		<p>Amazon’s Prime video service have released a new trailer for<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/secret-level/"> Secret Level.</a> The fifteen episode series features fourteen dedicated to a specific game, and one for “various PlayStation Studios games” which we know will feature Kratos from God of War as he was seen briefly in the first trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Secret Level - Official Trailer | Prime Video" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SvY9Uq7I30Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Let’s address the elephant in the room: Concord is still listed, although not shown in the trailer. Well, I don’t <em>think</em> it’s shown in the trailer, given that barely anyone played the game before it was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/29/sony-permanently-shuts-down-concord-and-developer-firewalk-studios/">deleted from history</a> it’s rather hard to judge.</p>
<p>The cast list has also been revealed and there are some big names; Arnold Schwarzenegger (The Terminator Franchise), Kevin Hart (Jumanji), Keanu Reeves (John Wick), Temuera Morrison (The Book of Boba Fett, Chief of War), Ariana Greenblatt (Barbie), Heaven Hart, Emily Swallow (The Mandalorian), Gabriel Luna (The Last of Us, Terminator: Dark Fate), Ricky Whittle (American Gods, Land of Bad), Patrick Schwarzenegger (The White Lotus), Merle Dandridge (The Last of Us), Claudia Doumit (The Boys), Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (Lost, The Union), Clive Standen (Vikings, The Morning Show), Laura Bailey (The Legend of Vox Machina), and Michael Beach (The Perfect Couple, Tulsa King).</p>
<p>The games covered include: Armored Core, Concord, Crossfire, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Exodus, Honor of Kings, Mega Man, New World: Aeternum, PAC-MAN, , Sifu, Spelunky, The Outer Worlds, Unreal Tournament and Warhammer 40,000. The first set of episodes will drop on December 10th with additional episodic drops until December 1th, so I would guess that means two episodes a day.</p>

<p>“Secret Level weaves a tapestry of iconic games across multiple mediums, to tell a series of unique and captivating stories,” said Vernon Sanders, head of television, Amazon MGM Studios. “Created and led by Tim Miller, Blur Studio, and Supervising Director Dave Wilson, each episode will take our global Prime Video customers on a brand new journey with breath-taking animation and imaginative storytelling.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/13/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Last year, I visited Japan for a few weeks, soaking in the culture, the nature and way too many plates of curry. Giant billboards advertised the latest niche gacha game, and multi-floor department stores dedicated huge displays to current and upcoming game releases unlike anything I’d ever see back in America’s dried out and dour shopping culture. The single most mind-blowing display of gaming reverence and promotion, though, was when I walked into a Lawson convenience store in Osaka that had been converted from front-to-back with a Dragon Quest theme. The signage outside was made of slime smiles, when you walked into the store you’d hear the crunchy NES sound-effect of an opened door from the original game play, and half the store was dedicated to selling merch related to the franchise. Dragon Quest has had a lasting impact not just on gaming, but on Japanese culture as a whole. Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, above all else, is a reminder and a celebration of that.</p>
<p><iframe title="DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dRx4TbtpcRw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For people outside of Japan, it can be hard to notice that influence, and a lot of that is simply due to the Dragon Quest series not being nearly as impactful or consistent overseas. Mainline entries like Dragon Quest IX on the Nintendo DS or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/26/dragon-quest-xi-s-echoes-of-an-elusive-age-definitive-edition-review/">Dragon Quest XI</a> have certainly made an impact on gamers worldwide, but for Dragon Quest III and what is essentially this franchise’s equivalent of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/">Final Fantasy VII</a>, there hasn’t been a widely accessible or brushed up release until now with this remake.</p>


<p>Of course, with HD-2D in the title, it’s clear that this isn’t a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/06/final-fantasy-vii-remake-review/">Remake</a> or Rebirth moment for Dragon Quest. The bones of this game are the same as they were in 1988 – you’re a young adventurer boy or girl, tasked with forming a party of companions and setting off into the world to vanquish the demon Baramos and save the world. It’s without a doubt a clichéd story that’s been adapted and twisted and parodied for decades, but what’s important here is that Dragon Quest III is ostensibly the game that invented that kind of story in the first place.</p>


<p>As a remake, Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake isn’t doing a whole lot to reinvent that story, flesh it out or turn it into some kind of meta-commentary. There are some additional Episodic story scenes you can access throughout your journey, but they serve to flesh out some of the already existing characters and story threads – like getting a deeper look into the adventures of your famous father Ortega. As a protagonist, you’re a blank-slate, and the same goes for your customisable companions.</p>
<p>Each character class has a unique set of sprites and can be customized with their own names, hair colour, and personality-types, but with no spoken dialogue from your comrades, that final element only affects their stat-growth on paper. Still, that didn’t stop me from telling a story in my mind where my scatterbrain cleric Kikuri kept wasting her MP and missing attacks because she was nursing a perpetual hangover/drunken stupor like her Bocchi The Rock anime namesake.</p>

<p>A new gameplay feature that helps amplify that sense of self-driven storytelling is the ability to Recall conversations. Anytime someone says something you’d like to keep in mind for later, instead of having to jot down a note in your notebook you can just press the start button to save that entire conversation in-game for later access. In a game like Elden Ring, the natural experience of remembering characters wants and objectives can be hard to keep track of the deeper you get into the game. A quality-of-life feature like Recall makes that process a bit easier without hampering the self-guided nature of the journey at all.</p>
<p>Lots of other quality-of-life features have made their way into Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, like the introduction of multiple difficulty options that can be swapped at any time. This isn’t a particularly difficult RPG by traditional standards, but certain tricky bosses or lengthy dungeon back-tracks definitely had me relying on a temporary drop in difficulty to get through them a bit more swiftly.</p>
<p>There’s also a brand new vocation called Monster Wrangler for your companions – it starts out as a pretty standard brawler type with good physical attributes, but eventually turns into a bit of a Blue Mage style character. By capturing and recruiting monsters, you can learn skills from them for the Monster Wrangler. On top of the really fun skill variety, having the added layer of monster-capturing on top of every enemy encounter made battles a lot more enticing and exciting. Your recruited monsters also feed into the newly expanded Monster Arena side-mode, a huge upgrade from the monster-battle gambling of the original game. It feels like a huge love letter to Dragon Quest Joker, the iconic Pokemon-inspired spinoff series, to have these Monster Wrangler and Monster Arena elements worked into the game – and it’s impressive how seamlessly they fit into your grand adventure.</p>

<p>The biggest change and upgrade in Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, without a doubt, is the shift in visuals to an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/07/26/octopath-traveler-review/">Octopath Traveler</a> inspired blend of 3D environments, realistic lighting, and traditional pixel-art sprites. It’s done incredibly well, and the mix of old-school elements like the sprite art and chunky sound effects combined with the flashy new visual touches creates such a fun contrast. Particle effects have been given a wild modern upgrade too, leading to incredibly satisfying moments in battle where your spells and abilities summon huge gusts of wind and searing fireballs.</p>
<p>My only issue with the HD-2D treatment is that, in a lot of locations and times of day, the bloom lighting can be a bit too distracting – I nearly had to wear sunglasses from how bright the sun was reflecting off my parties sprites.</p>

<p>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake is a lovingly-crafted celebration of gaming’s most iconic franchises. Rather than reinvent that wheel and change the game for modern audiences, Square Enix has highlighted and elevated the elements that made this such an iconic game all those decades ago, while slipping in a treasure trove of quality-of-life features that make it an even smoother experience to either dive into for the first time ever or return to yet again.</p>

			<p>Fallout TV series creator Jonathan Nolan and Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer appeared earlier this week at the Paley International Council Summit during a panel titled Source Code: How Hollywood and Videogames Are Leveling Up Together.</p>
<p>At some point during the conversation (transcribed by Inverse), Phil Spencer <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/fallout-season-2-jonathan-nolan-interview-phil-spencer-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the outstandingly successful Fallout TV show might have actually benefited from not having another game launch in the same franchise at a similar time. The executive pointed out that the strategy is much more in-depth and long-term than merely using the adaptation to incentivize fans to buy a new game.</p>
<p><em>We didn't have a new game lined up for the launch. I actually think that gave us some creative liberty that we wouldn't have had if we tried to coordinate the production of two very different creative processes to land at the same time.</em></p>
<p><em>The play is much more long term than trying to drive some gift buying.</em></p>
<p>Fortunately, the days of tie-ins, when games were often rushed out of the door simply to be released alongside big-budget movies, are behind us. This has led not only to greater creative freedom but also to much better overall quality, as the creative process cannot be rushed. Plus, Fallout games did <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-show-popularity-got-bethesda-at-least-80-million-says-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get</a> a massive boost in sales anyway when the TV show dropped on Amazon Prime Video, even if they weren't newly released.</p>
<p>During the panel, Jonathan Nolan briefly discussed the show's <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-officially-renewed-by-amazon-for-second-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second season</a>, saying it will rely even more on flashbacks than season one.</p>
<p><em>For the most part, in games, it’s a little harder grammatically to flashback, right? Some games can do it very well. There are a couple of memorable flashbacks in Call of Duty and other franchises. But for the most part, you kind of lock the user into that first-person point of view across both space and time. In a show, you can flashback and you can explore that world beforehand. It’s one of the things I love the most about season one and we will be doing more of that in season two.</em></p>
<p>Fallout TV season 2 will start filming soon in California.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GOG has announced the GOG Preservation Program, an initiative that aims to keep certain games playable forever no matter whether their developers are still supporting them or not.</p>

<p>Over on the official Preservation Program <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/gog-preservation-program" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, the company warns that "time is erasing the games that shaped you", but that "we can fight back" through the program, which "ensures classic games remain playable on modern systems".</p>

<p>According to GOG, games that belong to the initiative will be DRM-free and eligible for "dedicated tech support", so even if something does go wrong, you'll be able to get help to fix it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gog-preservation-program-games.jpg?itok=8mrmRJ9h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gog-preservation-program-games.jpg?itok=jt7K9zVg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The GOG Preservation Program currently covers 100 games, and more are coming.</figcaption></figure><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1856698605563793789" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">followup thread on X</a> (formerly Twitter), GOG says that the initiative features "updated, improved, or quality-tested builds", and that if you see the Preservation Program stamp on a game's GOG page, that means you'll be able to enjoy it on your PC "hassle-free".</p>

<p>Games currently included in the program include the likes of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-3-classic-gog-re-release" rel="nofollow">original three&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>games</a>, the original&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>and its&nbsp;<em>Hellfire&nbsp;</em>expansion, and&nbsp;<em>Heroes of Might and Magic 3</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Kain: Defiance</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>, and more.</p>

<p>GOG cites the Video Game History Foundation as saying that "87% of games created before 2010 are inaccessible today", a sobering statistic that demonstrates just how necessary an initiative like this really is.</p>




<p>You'll also find an FAQ on the Preservation Program's website that provides more information about the initiative. It includes info like what to do when a stamped game doesn't work, as well as whether classic GOG games are necessarily worse than those included in the Program (the answer being no, of course).</p>

<p>GOG says it wants "hundreds of games" to come with the GOG Preservation Program stamp by the end of 2025, so you can expect lots more games to be added to this initiative as time goes on. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Instead, the company opted to work directly with smart TV manufacturers to integrate that functionality. The company’s much hyped Xbox mobile gaming store is also still MIA. Still, it sounds like Spencer thinks the overall market is trending away from walled gardens, whether on Xbox, iPhone, or beyond.</p><p> “I think the ball is moving in the right direction,” Spencer said. “I think this idea of open platforms, where users have more choice, creators have more choice, you see the momentum, right?” </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Union employees at Bethesda have gone on strike across multiple locations in the United States.</p>



<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/bethesda-strike-zenimax-xbox-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Inverse</a>, “hundreds” of employees have walked off the job in both Maryland and Texas. It’s claimed that the strike is due to the company not addressing remote work concerns as well as the recent outsourcing of quality assurance. The latter being something the union never agreed to.</p>



<p>The report claims that the union is “looking to limit the percentage of quality assurance testers the company outsources in comparison to the number of full-time workers present in its bargaining unit”.</p>



<p>The union, which is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-game-studios-union-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest video games union</a> in the United States, is also looking for a more flexible remote work policy after employees are being denied remote work requests.</p>



<p>“They have continually given us their first proposal again and again, and it’s become obvious that our different mobilization tactics have not worked,” Bethesda Quality Assurance Test Lead Rhyanna Eichner told Inverse regarding the company’s negotiations with the union.</p>

<p>“Striking isn’t fun or ideal, but there’s a satisfaction in having a concrete physical action we can do to fight for better work conditions,” Senior Quality Assurance Tester Juniper Dowell told the outlet. “Hopefully, we can convince them to stop dragging their feet and meet us at the table.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft and Bethesda for comment on the strike. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/steam-no-longer-supports-windows-7-or-8/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Valve has released an update for Steam that officially ends support for Windows 7 and 8 operating systems. </p>



<p>The update, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/4472730495692571025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released on November 5</a> that includes the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steams-game-recording-feature-is-now-out-of-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ability to record games</a> within Steam, forces those who wish to continue to use Steam to either upgrade to Windows 10 or 11. Or, if you don’t want Windows at all, you can move to MacOS or Linux.</p>







<p>“This version of the Steam client will no longer run on Windows 7 or Windows 8,” the update reads. “Users on these OS versions will not automatically update to this new version of the Steam Client.”</p>



<p>In it’s FAQ page on the support ending, Valve says moving on from the old operating systems has to do with the security of its users.</p>



<p>“This change is required as core features in Steam rely on an embedded version of Google Chrome, which no longer functions on older versions of Windows,” Valve said. “In addition, future versions of Steam will require Windows feature and security updates only present in Windows 10 and above.”</p>



<p>They continued: “Computers running these operating systems, when connected to the internet, are susceptible to new malware and other exploits which will not be patched. That malware can cause your PC, Steam and games to perform poorly or crash. That malware can also be used to steal the credentials for your Steam account or other services.”</p>



<p>It’s also worth noting that Steam will also no longer work on MacOS 10.13 or 10.14.</p>



<p>Are you one of the holdouts still using Windows 7 or 8? Will this finally get you to upgrade? Let us know down below.</p>

With the release of Lego Horizon Adventures this week, it has been confirmed--in that spin-off game at least--that Sylens does appear and is voiced by Star Trek Voyager actor Tim Russ.</p><p>A deuteragonist in the games, Sylens is similar to Horizon's hero Aloy in several ways, as he also explores the secret history of the world following a cataclysmic event that saw machines rise to the top of the food chain. Russ is no stranger to the Horizon series, as he'd previously played the character Jetakka in Horizon Forbidden West. In Lego Horizon Adventures, he appears as "DJ Sylens" (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-horizon-adventures-recasts-late-lance-reddick-with-star-trek-actor-tim-russ" data-target="true"

                <p>To promote the launch of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Microsoft has partnered with IHOP to create an Indiana Jones-themed breakfast menu and a custom Xbox themed around pancakes.</p><p>Starting November 18, people who dine at IHOP will find an Indiana Jones-themed menu that includes items like the "Fully Loaded French Toast" and drinks like "Explorer's Caramel Apple Butter Hot Chocolate" and the "Long-Lost Cookie Butter Milkshake." It's not clear what any of these things have to do with Indiana Jones or Xbox, but the food looks delicious.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4398980-screenshot2024-11-13at9.39.20am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4398980" data-ratio="0.56275303643725" data-width="1235" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4398980-screenshot2024-11-13at9.39.20am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4398980"></a><figcaption>Yum.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4398980-screenshot2024-11-13at9.39.20am.png"></figure><p>People who join IHOP's International Bank of Pancakes program can upload their receipt to earn "PanCoins" that can be redeemed for Xbox prizes like game downloads, merch, accessories, and Game Pass memberships.

            <p>GOG has announced a new Preservation Program.</p>
<p>This initiative from the PC platform aims to maintain games' compatibility with modern and future systems.</p>
<p>"Time is erasing the games that shaped you. Forgotten, incompatible, unplayable," the <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/gog-preservation-program">GOG Preservation Program</a> page reads. "We can fight back."</p>

<p>At the time of writing, GOG has confirmed 100 games are currently part of the program. "By maintaining these iconic titles, GOG helps you protect and relive the memories that shaped you, DRM-free and with dedicated tech support," the team wrote.</p>
<p>In addition, GOG shared a number of preservation stories, including <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_3_complete_edition">Heroes of Might and Magic 3</a>, which first released over two decades ago.</p>
<p>GOG "revived" it 10 years ago, and an update today fixed non-playing intros in Russian and French versions of the game, validated stability and "verified compatibility" with Windows 10 and 11.</p>
<p>Other titles include the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/original-resident-evil-available-now-on-gog-2-and-3-on-their-way">recent Resident Evil Bundle</a>, which comprises the original game in the series as well as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a> and Resident Evil 3.</p>

            <p>The PlayStation-published <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-horizon-adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> doesn't include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> support at launch.</p>
<p>If you pop over to the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP9000-PPSA14632_00-LEGOHZNADVENTURE">PlayStation store</a>, the game doesn't have the PS5 Pro Enhanced label attached to it, which other games do. Rather, the soon-to-be-released brick-based romp will instead offer players two different graphics modes on its debut: Performance and Fidelity.</p>
<p>Performance mode will provide a higher frame rate. Fidelity, meanwhile, gives a lower frame rate but - as the name suggests - higher fidelity. These modes are used in countless other games, as well.</p>

<p>It may well be that developers Guerrilla and Studio Gobo release a patch for Lego Horizon Adventures that adds that shiny, PS5 Pro 'Enhanced' label at a later date.</p>
<p>For now, however, Eurogamer has verified that the game's Perofrmance and Fidelity modes are the only ones offered on both the base PS5 as well as the PS5 Pro.</p>

<p>As for Lego Horizon Adventures, we just awarded the game two out of five stars.</p>
<p>"It's a decidedly joyless kind of game, the sort that's better to look at than actually play with, and one that does little to bridge the gap between its two main subjects," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-horizon-adventures-review">Eurogamer's Lego Horizon Adventures review</a>. "I still don't know why it exists or who it's for, and there's little evidence to suggest that Guerrilla or Gobo know the answer either."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Handheld Officially Confirmed by Phil Spencer, but It's Years Away]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-handheld-confirmed-but-years-away</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-handheld-officially-confirmed-by-phil-spencer-but-its-years-away.1034637/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-handheld-confirmed-but-years-away<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox head Phil Spencer has officially confirmed that an Xbox handheld is in the works, although that announcement does, as you would expect, carry several pretty heavy caveats.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>, Spencer said that the "expectation" is that Xbox would create some kind of hardware in the handheld category. Bloomberg says that Xbox is "working on prototypes", but that the final release of any kind of Xbox handheld device is "a few years out".</p>

<p>An Xbox handheld (that is to say one created officially by Xbox, rather than one simply <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/logitech-and-tencent-cloud-gaming-handheld-images-possibly-leaked" rel="nofollow">designed to play</a> Xbox cloud games) has long been rumored, but this is the first official confirmation we've had from anyone on Xbox's side.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/asus-rog-ally-xbox-handheld.jpg?itok=qhbTOxyk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/asus-rog-ally-xbox-handheld.jpg?itok=gnSjnz5M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There are handheld devices that play Xbox games on the market, but we now know that an official Xbox handheld is in the works.</figcaption></figure><p>Rather than focusing on the handheld, Xbox engineers will instead work to improve the Xbox app on existing devices. Spencer told Bloomberg there was room for improvement with regards to the Xbox app, and that any potential handheld needs to be "informed by learning and what's happening now".</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Spencer reveals a couple of other interesting tidbits regarding Xbox's strategy. He reiterates that there are no "red lines" dictating which games could or couldn't come to non-Xbox platforms, but says that it's too early to talk about whether&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>could go multiplatform.</p>

<p>Spencer also confirms that Microsoft and Xbox are still looking at more acquisitions, which puts recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">sweeping layoffs</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="nofollow">studio closures</a> at Microsoft into somewhat stark relief if you ask me.</p>

<p>Then again, Xbox arguably has a history of saying seemingly contradictory things after making big decisions. Remember when Matt Booty said Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-smaller-games-comment-hi-fi-rush" rel="nofollow">needed "smaller games"</a> right after closing two studios that would have been ideally situated to make them? Me too.</p>

		<p>Christmas just wouldn’t be Christmas if it didn’t start in November and include a weird advert from PlayStation that shows no games or consoles, so deck those halls and jingle those bells because the ad has arrived.</p>
<p>This year we see lots of young people jumping about, sliding down ramps, and generally engaging in physical activity, the complete opposite of sitting in front of a games console and killing aliens. It’s ‘aspirational’ I guess, maybe you could infer that anything is a game and PlayStation is here to make that true, but as your PS5 is securely tethered to you sofa I think that’s a bit of a stretch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Play Has No Limits | PS5" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KiNPo7KvWCM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It does makes you miss the good old days when Sony used to mash up characters from thirty games in a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPctTR3y5Qc"> one advert .</a> I’ve just looked and that happened thirteen years ago so now I feel very old and so should you.</p>


<p>These videos are usually packed with Easter Eggs but there just a couple in this new advert. The bus stop at 28 seconds in has 1994-2024 on it, 1994 being the launch year of the PS1. The one that is getting everyone excited is 46 seconds in when a departure board is shown with and at the top is a date and time, 03 12 20:24, so December 3rd this year which is exactly 20 years on from the PS1 launch.</p>

<p>Sony are rumoured to have State of Play in December so some are guessing is that will be the date, it is a week before The Game Awards so Sony could get some big reveals out before the news is swamped with other announcements.</p>
<p>That appears to be it, there are no signs for games in the background, the graffiti does not reference anything, the shops are generic, not even a hint of Crash Bandicoot, all the things Sony usually does in these adverts are missing this year.</p>
<p>Probably the most boring PlayStation advert in history, I bet it cost a fortune to make.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-outlanders-is-an-open-world-mobile-rpg-from-tencent-and-capcom.1034622/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-outlanders-mobile-rpg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom and Tencent subsidiary TiMi Studio Group have announced&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Outlanders</em>, an open-world action RPG set to be released for mobile devices.</p>

<p>The two studios describe&nbsp;<em>Outlanders&nbsp;</em>as an "open-world survival game set in the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>universe", and you'll be able to do all of the things you'd expect from a&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>game, including discovering ecosystems, crafting gear, and hunting alongside your friends.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Outlanders&nbsp;</em>yet, but TiMi and Capcom say they will be conducting "several play tests in advance", although those don't have dates yet either, unfortunately. The goal with the game is to create a mobile experience you can enjoy "with friends, anytime and anywhere".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-outlanders-gliding.jpg?itok=CKAskoKS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-outlanders-gliding.jpg?itok=Q6GMqsIK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Outlanders&nbsp;</em>is an open-world mobile survival RPG from TiMi and Capcom.</figcaption></figure><p>The screenshots TiMi and Capcom have released so far show a game that looks...well, a lot like a traditional&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>game. Expect open-ended areas to explore, monsters to take down, and lots of elaborate, ostentatious armor and weapons to build from monsters' remains.</p>

<p>The two studios are promising "natural environments [and] ecosystems" to discover, so like classic&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>, you'll probably be able to observe monsters as they go about their daily lives before you start your hunt.</p>

<p>If you're interested in&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Outlanders</em>, you can sign up for email announcements via the <a href="https://monsterhunteroutlanders.com/en/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">newly-created official website</a>, which also displays some rather evocative concept art.</p>




<p>The reveal of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Outlanders&nbsp;</em>comes as Capcom gets ready to release&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, the next mainline entry in the franchise, which is scheduled to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date" rel="nofollow">arrive across PC and consoles in February</a>.</p>

<p>It's shaping up to be a pretty big success already; an open beta was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta" rel="nofollow">held earlier this month</a>, and the beta alone <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records" rel="nofollow">broke the series' Steam player count record</a> despite not being a full game.</p>

<p>We don't yet have an official release date or window for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Outlanders</em>, so watch this space for more info as and when we get it.</p>

As Steam was on the rise and digital distribution was clearly to become the future of gaming, a Polish company that had just released its first game—a relatively obscure RPG called <em>The Witcher</em>—wanted to get in on the act. The goal was updating and preserving classic gaming, and selling it without any form of DRM. Over the years, GOG seemed to drift away from this origin, and shift its focus to trying to compete as a distribution platform for AAA gaming, going head-to-head with Valve’s behemoth. But today marks a big change.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196599" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Tactical RPGs, Creepy Circuses &amp; More New Releases | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="128" data-playlist="196599,195891,196131" data-current="196599"><div><p>Tactical RPGs, Creepy Circuses &amp; More New Releases | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22154.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Starting today, GOG is launching what it’s calling <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gog.com/en/gog-preservation-program&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gog.com/en/gog-preservation-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The GOG Preservation Program</a></span>. It’s a self-aware determination to return to the company’s roots, with a long-term commitment to preserve and maintain classic games for the foreseeable future. There are 100 games currently listed, with a pledge to use the company’s “own resources to maintain games’ compatibility with modern and future systems.” At a time when game preservation is becoming increasingly vital, and on far more people’s minds, this seems like a pretty positive step.</p><h2 id="h64142"><a id=""></a><strong>How It Started</strong></h2><p>16 years ago, the world of PC gaming was very different. In 2008, the number one issue anyone would name when it came to digital games was DRM—digital rights management. These anti-piracy measures were grossly ineffective, doing almost nothing to prevent piracy, but instead causing legitimate customers to have far worse versions of a game—versions that required online checks to launch, refused to be installed on multiple devices, or just flat-out didn’t work properly. GOG arrived right at the peak of players’ fury, and offered a service that sold games that promised there would be <em>none</em> of this. Versions that just downloaded the files to your hard drive, that you could copy and share if you felt compelled to, but would never fail to launch because of an abandoned server, or because you bought a new PC.</p><p>At the same time, GOG was releasing games that had been unavailable and unplayable on PC for years. Classic titles that dominated the ‘80s and early ‘90s, that were designed to run on MS-DOS and didn’t know what to do with Windows, were suddenly available again, and were sold DRM-free with scans of the original manuals, and updates that meant they’d run straight from the .exe without issue.</p><p>The site became known for restoring lost games, a way to play <em>Wing Commander</em> and <em>Ultima II</em>, <em>King’s Quest</em> and <em>Rise of the Triad</em>. An early deal with Ubisoft to release DRM-free versions of its classic games (an ironic situation, given Ubisoft was at the forefront of crippling DRM in newer games) helped the project gain traction, and by 2014 it had deals with companies like LucasArts to make everything from <em>Star Wars: TIE Fighter</em> to <em>The Secret of Monkey Island</em> available.</p><h2 id="h64143"><a id=""></a><strong>How It’s Going</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="16e998ba573b4584e5b817e5fa1fe922" data-recommend-id="image://16e998ba573b4584e5b817e5fa1fe922" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1012" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Max sat at the wheel of his car." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Max sat at the wheel of his car." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

For whatever reasons, for whatever ambitions, in my view GOG changed its sights, wanted to be selling the big-name AAA titles, and took its eyes off that original purpose.</p><p>In 2019, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/facing-financial-pressures-gog-quietly-lays-off-at-lea-1832879826?_gl=1*4o9j2y*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTQzNTAyMi4xMDQuMC4xNzMxNDM1MDI1LjU3LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/facing-financial-pressures-gog-quietly-lays-off-at-lea-1832879826?_gl=1*4o9j2y*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTQzNTAyMi4xMDQuMC4xNzMxNDM1MDI1LjU3LjAuMA..">according to a <em>Kotaku</em> story by Jason Schreier</a></span>, the company was in real trouble. Deep into its push to be a AAA store that competed with Steam, there were lay-offs, at the same time as the company abandoned its so-called Fair Price Package, through which GOG would repay customers who were charged higher fees due to regional price differences. One former employee said at the time that he was told, “we’re dangerously close to being in the red.”</p><p>As someone who, throughout the first half of the 2010s, regularly used GOG to find classic games and would frequently check the site to see what new titles had been rescued from the past, I drifted away, too. That the games were DRM-free still felt like a big deal, but the convenience of Steam, the improvements in DRM tech, and the shifting nature of all digital ownership made GOG feel so much less essential. I’d once seen it as the site that let me play classic point-and-click adventures, but now when I looked at it, I just saw the same big-name games that are splashed across every other store.</p><p>“The market is different today,” GOG’s senior business development manager, Marcin Paczyński, told me by email, when I asked what was driving the decision to refocus. “Most platforms continue to leave these classics behind, or don’t give them the care they deserve, so the games we set out to protect are disappearing again.”</p><h2 id="h64144"><a id=""></a><strong>Where It’s Going Next</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="3acf2caa3a4a8d0fa667f75ad95eec12" data-recommend-id="image://3acf2caa3a4a8d0fa667f75ad95eec12" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="781" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Jagged Alliance screenshot with an apposite quote about wanting back-up." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Jagged Alliance screenshot with an apposite quote about wanting back-up." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Madlab Software / GOG</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3acf2caa3a4a8d0fa667f75ad95eec12" data-recommend-id="image://3acf2caa3a4a8d0fa667f75ad95eec12" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="781" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Jagged Alliance screenshot with an apposite quote about wanting back-up." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The new moves by the site are giving me great hope. If DRM was the main issue in 2008, games preservation feels like the most vital topic of 2024. As we watch major publishers just wiping older (and even newer) games from existence, while abandoned servers and forgotten consoles make ever-more games we own unplayable, people are getting really riled up. It seems like a very smart move for GOG to step into this space and loudly declare its intentions.</p><p>The GOG Preservation Program promises to begin with 100 games, and keep adding to the list, pledging long-term support of all of them. Those currently included have, GOG say, been tested “on the most popular PC configurations,” and “work flawlessly,” but the company encourages its community, which is rather sweetly referred to as “restless,” to keep pestering if updates break things.</p><p>The 100 games are an eclectic bunch, with games like <em>Diablo</em>, <em>Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura</em>, <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>, <em>Roller Coaster Tycoon Deluxe</em>, <em>Fallout</em>, <em>Blade Runner</em>, and <em>Alpha Protocol </em>in the mix. They reach as far back as the ‘80s, and as recent as <em>Mad Max</em>. The criteria for inclusion is that a game needs maintenance, and that GOG can commit to maintaining it themselves. The company aims to have “hundreds of games” stamped with the commitment by the end of 2025.</p><p>“It’s a renewed commitment to our mission,” says Paczyński, “offering improved, well-supported editions of the classics that defined gaming, while continuing to deliver DRM-free new releases.”</p><p>Paczyński reiterates the importance of no DRM to GOG, explaining that not having it is vital to preservation. “When you buy a DRM-free game on GOG, you can download and safeguard its offline installer any way you want. DRM-free keeps you out of the reach of platforms’ rules and policies and untethered to some central server suddenly switching off. We still strive to get as many DRM-free titles as possible on GOG, regardless of when they were first released.”</p><p>I ask how far ahead the plan goes. What if GOG is zapped by aliens and disappears—what happens to the games it’s preserving without them? “We’re dedicating significant resources and long-term planning to ensure that each game in the program receives continuous updates and care—we know it’s a commitment.” He repeats that the DRM-free nature of the games means the installers survive the site. “Whatever happens to us, ever, your games are always safe.”</p><p>“It will stick,” Paczyński adds. “Today, we made several bold commitments, so we are truly serious about this. GOG’s reputation is on the line here—we’re all-in on this!”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The high graphics preset is what GSC calls recommended, and provides 60fps gameplay at 1440p.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For that high graphics preset, you’ll need a Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti / RTX 4070 or AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT GPU and 32GB of RAM. Low and medium require 16GB of RAM and less powerful GPUs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All graphics presets, however, require 160GB of SSD storage, which is a significant footprint worth bearing in mind if you’re planning on playing.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/13/gcm7s-wweaerrys-1731500123682.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Stalker 2's PC system requirements.

Specifically, Stalker 2 launches with DLSS 3 and Reflex, which means GeForce RTX 40 Series gamers can activate DLSS 3 with Frame Generation and Super Resolution from day-one, accelerating performance.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Stalker 2 PC system requirements:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Low (1080p / 30fps):</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>CPU: Intel Core i7-7700K / AMD Ryzen 5 1600X</li><li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 6GB / AMD Radeon RX 580 8GB / Intel Arc A750</li><li>RAM: 16GB</li><li>Storage: 160GB SSD</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Medium (1080p / 60fps):</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>CPU: Intel Core i7-9700K / AMD Ryzen 7 3700X</li><li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 Super / RTX 4060 / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT</li><li>RAM: 16GB</li><li>Storage: 160GB SSD</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>High (1440p / 60fps):</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>CPU: Intel Core i7-11700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5800X</li><li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti / RTX 4070 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT</li><li>RAM: 32GB</li><li>Storage: 160GB SSD</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Epic (4K / 60+ fps):</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li>CPU: Intel Core i7-13700KF / AMD Ryzen 7 7700X</li><li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 / AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX</li><li>RAM: 32GB</li><li>Storage: 160GB SSD</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Stalker 2 has suffered a number of understandable delays, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-2-delayed-again-this-time-by-2-months-so-the-dev-can-fix-more-unexpected-anomalies">most recently in July</a> when the game was due out in September.

The Pokémon Company refused to give a clear answer.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/13/img-5221-1731499315556.PNG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pokémon TCG Pocket's Booster Pack Carousel. Image credit: IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"While Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket draws inspiration from the experience of opening physical Pokémon TCG booster packs, we are unable to share specifics at this time," it said vaguely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But some players claim to already have hard proof that the choice in Pokémon TCG Pocket is all an illusion, with the Wonder Pick system being at the heart of such evidence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This additional method of obtaining cards lets players pick one of five cards at random, with the choices coming directly from another player's pack. If a player opens one containing a Charmander, Charmeleon, Charizard, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular">Charizard ex</a>, and Blane, for example, there's a chance a friend of that player, or even a complete random, will see this pack in their Wonder Pick section.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">They can then choose to open this pack and be presented with the Charmander, Charmeleon, Charizard, Charizard ex, and Blane, but each card is flipped around and players pick just one at random.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/kOx_xHGujN4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PokéNinaa</a> shared a clip of her opening a pack while a friend checked their Wonder Pick from her. The moment PokéNinaa selected Open a Pack, and was presented with the carousel of boosters presenting a choice, her Wonder Pick appeared on her friend's account.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Wonder Pick contained a pack PokéNinaa hadn't open previously, and contained Pyukumuku, Blitzle, Slowpoke, Kabutops, and Melmetal. She then picked a booster pack from her myriad options and was presented with Pyukumuku, Blitzle, Slowpoke, Kabutops, and Melmetal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oher players have shared the same findings with Wonder Picks, leading to a general belief among the Pokémon TCG Pocket community that pack choices don't actually matter. It certainly appears to be the case, especially with The Pokémon Company refusing to say anything to the contrary, but there's a chance this could be an unintended bug or similarly unintended mechanic that will disappear once the game grows older than a couple of weeks.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Alternate Art 'Secret' Card in Pokémon TCG Pocket: Genetic Apex</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived in October on iOS and Android as a digital version of the beloved trading card game.

                <p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has commented on bringing more Xbox games to PlayStation and Nintendo Switch, saying he's not ruling anything out, and that includes the next Halo release.</p><p>Talking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth?embedded-checkout=true" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Spencer said, "I do not see sort of red lines in our portfolio that say, 'Thou must not,'" he said. For the next Halo game specifically, Bloomberg reported that Spencer said it was too early to make a decision about that.</p><p>In September, Microsoft announced that it was working on multiple new Halo games that are being made in Unreal Engine 5. None of the games have been officially announced, however. That being said, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">elements from the Project Foundry demo are likely to show up in future Halo titles</a>, Microsoft has said.</p><p>Halo games being made on Unreal Engine 5 could help <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unreal-engine-may-make-it-easier-to-bring-halo-to-ps5-experts-say/1100-6526970/" data-ref-id="1100-6526970">make it easier for the franchise to come to PS5</a>, tech experts claim. Halo on PS5 wouldn't be a total surprise, as it was previously reported that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unreal-engine-may-make-it-easier-to-bring-halo-to-ps5-experts-say/1100-6526970/" data-ref-id="1100-6526970">Microsoft was considering bringing the sci-fi series to Sony's home console</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDgR1FRJnF8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FDgR1FRJnF8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>So far, Microsoft has released a few of its games on rival platforms, including Sea of Thieves and Grounded. One of the next big ones is Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which launches in December on Xbox and PC before coming to PS5 in early 2025.</p><p>Also in the Bloomberg interview, Spencer said he expects Microsoft will eventually release a handheld gaming device; the company is now making prototypes, the report said. "I love us building devices," Spencer said. "And I think our team could do some real innovative work, but we want to be informed by learning and what's happening now."</p><p>Microsoft has been openly discussing plans for a handheld gaming device for a long time already, and the latest rumor was that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-console-generation-could-include-a-handheld-report/1100-6526635/" data-ref-id="1100-6526635">next Xbox home console could also link up with a new Xbox handheld device.</a></p><p>Spencer also discussed the possibility of more acquisitions, following Microsoft's blockbuster deal to buy Activision Blizzard. He said it might be worth pursuing deals that add "geographic diversity" to the company, including in Asia. There are no "imminent" deals coming, however.</p><p>Microsoft already owned a prominent Japanese game developer, Tango Gameworks, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-is-shutting-down-four-studios-including-arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks/1100-6523227/" data-ref-id="1100-6523227">shut the studio down</a>--it later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tango-gameworks-saved-by-pubg-publisher-krafton-hi-fi-rush-rights-also-acquired/1100-6525702/" data-ref-id="1100-6525702">re-emerged under the ownership of PUBG company Krafton.</a></p><p>In the past year, Spencer has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cuts-650-more-gaming-jobs-but-no-studios-closed-or-games-canceled/1100-6526439/" data-ref-id="1100-6526439">overseen more than 2,500 layoffs at Xbox</a>, and he said in the Bloomberg interview that "the Xbox business has never been more healthy." Spencer had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-executive-defends-layoffs-says-they-were-necessary-to-run-a-business/1100-6527510/" data-ref-id="1100-6527510">always said the layoffs were necessary because capitalism demanded it. </a></p><p>He ended his chat with Bloomberg by seemingly reacting to Sony's recent launch of the $700 PS5 Pro (which costs more than $1,000 in some regions like Australia), saying expensive consoles are not going to help grow the video game industry.</p><p>"I feel pretty good about where this industry is going," he said. "To reach new players, we need to be creative and adaptive of new business models, new devices, new ways of access. We're not going to grow the market with $1,000 consoles."</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tequila-works-insolvency</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gylt-and-rime-developer-tequila-works-files-for-insolvency.1034556/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tequila-works-insolvency<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Gylt&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Sexy Brutale&nbsp;</em>developer Tequila Works has filed for insolvency, with newly-appointed general manager&nbsp;Térence Mosca citing "prolonged market conditions" as the reason for the studio's predicament.</p>

<p>According to a GamesIndustry.biz <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rime-developer-tequila-works-files-for-insolvency" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, Mosca says he's proud of what his team "has accomplished together", but that the aforementioned market conditions gave his studio no choice other than filing for insolvency.</p>

<p>As a reminder, Tequila Works <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tequila-works-rime-sexy-brutale-layoffs" rel="nofollow">canceled an unannounced project</a> and laid off an unspecified number of staff back in October, calling the current moment in the gaming industry an "incredibly difficult time". Evidently, those layoffs and that cancellation weren't enough to save the studio.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tequila-works-insolvency-rime.jpg?itok=9k1Rc0Q0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tequila-works-insolvency-rime.jpg?itok=LjOf2zZz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tequila Works is responsible for games like&nbsp;<em>Rime</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that insolvency isn't necessarily the same thing as a studio shutdown; essentially, insolvency means an entity isn't able to pay the debts it's incurred, which means Tequila is functionally out of money but not necessarily defunct yet.</p>

<p>As such, the studio could undergo a reorganization under Mosca, although it looks like it might take a pretty mighty reorganization effort in order to save a studio that seems to have been struggling for quite some time.</p>

<p>In the statement provided by GI.biz, Mosca says that the studio is doing everything it can to "provide support and guidance to our teams", an assurance that was also made when the studio laid off staff and canceled its project last month.</p>

<p>The statement notably doesn't say that Tequila has canceled its remaining project or laid off the remainder of its staff, so it's possible we may see Tequila rising from the ashes at some point in the future.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-sexy-brutale-tequila-works-church.jpg?itok=LSlQWP4B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-sexy-brutale-tequila-works-church.jpg?itok=cuhNEQBm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Previous games by Tequila Works include time-loop puzzler&nbsp;<em>The Sexy Brutale</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Tequila Works was founded in 2009 and released its first game, cinematic zombie platformer&nbsp;<em>Deadlight</em>, in 2012. That game was followed by titles like&nbsp;<em>The Sexy Brutale</em>,&nbsp;<em>Rime</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Gylt</em>, as well as last year's&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>spinoff&nbsp;<em>Song of Nunu</em>.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen what lies in Tequila Works' future, but don't be surprised if we don't hear from the studio for some time. Stay tuned for more.</p>

                <p>Stellar Blade developer Shift Up has revealed more details on the game's upcoming PC release, and it has high expectations for the platform. In the studio's Q3 2024 earnings report, Shift Up confirmed that Stellar Blade is "being considered within 2025" for a PC release--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stellar-blade-dev-is-considering-a-pc-port-and-sequel/1100-6523587/">something it has spoken about in the past</a>.</p><p>"Considering recent trends such as Steam's expanding market share in the AAA game sector and the global success of Black Myth: Wukong, we expect the performance on PC to exceed that on consoles," <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=203&amp;page=1&amp;code=ir_eng" rel="nofollow ">Shift Up said in its report</a>. To put that into context, Black Myth: Wukong had a strong launch in August with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-is-now-one-of-the-fastest-selling-games-ever/1100-6526082/">10 million copies sold in its first three days</a> on PC and PS5, and within two weeks, that figure climbed to 18 million.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1510369080" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

figure that can potentially be reached with its upcoming expansion. In comparison, Stellar Blade reached 1 million sales on PS5 by the end of June.</p><p>Shift Up also mentioned that sales on PS5--where Stellar Blade is exclusively available for now--continue to remain stable, thanks in part to the studio constantly updating the game and releasing new DLC for it. "With the addition of the Nier: Automata DLC and ongoing marketing activities, we plan to maintain the IP's popularity until the platform expansion," Shift Up explained.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stellar-blade-is-getting-a-nier-automata-crossover-dlc/1100-6526688/">The Nier: Automata DLC for Stellar Blade</a> will be available starting November 20, and in addition to some stylish outfits inspired by the game's co-protagonist 2B, there'll be a new hairstyle for heroine Eve to equip, as well as a photo mode will be added to the game.</p><p>"A strong battle system and exciting moments make Stellar Blade more than just an imitator," Imran Khan wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stellar-blade-review-nier-as-it-can-get/1900-6418215/">Stellar Blade review</a>.</p>

                <p>Nearly three decades ago, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pokemon-red-review/1900-2684314/" data-ref-id="1900-2684314">Pokemon</a> debuted in Japan and spawned a best-selling video game franchise that continues to this day. The Pokemania phenomenon has since grown to include multiple anime series, films, trading-card games, toys, and more. Pokemon was also one of the 12 finalists to make it into this year's inductees for the Toy Hall of Fame. However, Pikachu and his pals are going to have to wait until at least 2025 after being denied this year.</p><p>The National Toy Hall of Fame has <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/press-release/2024-toy-hall-inductees-revealed/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">released its new inductions for 2024</a>, and Pokemon didn't make the cut. But at least Pokemon is in good company. The Choose Your Own Adventure books, remote-controlled vehicles, Hess Toy Trucks, trampoline, Apples to Apples, and Sequence were also denied the honor.</p><p>Hasbro was the big winner, as two of its 1980s franchises, Transformers and My Little Pony, earned their induction into this year's class at the Toy Hall of Fame. The Transformers toys debuted in 1984, and the franchise has largely endured for four decades. My Little Pony was originally launched as My Pretty Pony in 1981 before it became a hit toy line of its own. MLP went dormant for a few years before a 2003 revival proved to successful. The card game Phase 10 was the final 2024 inductee for the Toy Hall of Fame.</p><p>Pokemon may not have won this year, but its ongoing popularity is staggering. On the Nintendo Switch alone, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-sales-reach-99-million-units-on-switch-alone/1100-6527600/" data-ref-id="1100-6527600">the Pokemon franchise has sold 99 million units</a>.

                <p>Earlier this year, Embark Studios--which was co-founded by Battlefield veteran Patrick Soderlund--reversed course on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-delay-has-completely-changed-its-genre/1100-6514238/" data-ref-id="1100-6514238">Arc Raiders</a>. What was originally envisioned as a free-to-play shooter was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-new-game-dumps-free-to-play-model-changes-to-40-premium-release/1100-6525993/" data-ref-id="1100-6525993">shifted over to a premium release</a>. Now, the latest gameplay video for Arc Raiders demonstrates why Embark Studios felt confident about making that move as it shows off an impressive--and dangerous--post-apocalyptic world.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpCooWm-PDs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OpCooWm-PDs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game takes place in a future where humanity has retreated beneath the surface of the Earth to escape the lethal Arc machines, which are programed to slaughter any humans they find. Players assume the role of one of the Raiders, who risk their lives by returning to the surface to find badly needed supplies while evading both the machines as well as rival Raiders who aren't looking to share any of the spoils.</p><p>Getting in and out of the locations isn't easy, even though having a team to watch your back helps increase the odds of survival. The smaller Arc machines are always on patrol, and the larger machines aren't as easy to dispatch as their counterparts. Enemy Raiders can also ambush a team before they reach their extraction point. But that's only going to draw the attention of the Arc machines, which will target both sides of the conflict. As far as the machines are concerned, the only good human is a dead one.</p><p>Although Arc Raiders isn't finished yet, this early gameplay is already looking good. Embark Studios will release the game on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC in 2025.</p>

Blizzard has also revealed a unique logo for its University of Warcraft collaboration, and has promised more unique WoW-themed graphics leading up to the game.</p><p>Blizzard is also getting some of the Washington Huskies team on board for the takeover, signing NIL (name, image, likeness) deals with players Carson Bruener, Denzel Boston, Jonah Coleman, Camden Simon, Adam Mohammad, Kamren Fabiculanan, Jacob Lane, Cameron Broussard, D’Angalo Titialli, Demond Williams Jr., and Will Rodgers. The players will be posting about the collab on social media to promote the Warcraft takeover--though its not clear if they'll be making an appearance in the game itself.</p><p>"We are thrilled to unite interactive entertainment with the sports industry to celebrate 20 incredible years of World of Warcraft delighting millions of players worldwide," said Blizzard head of marketing Monica Austin, as quoted by <a href="https://www.si.com/fannation/name-image-likeness/nil-news/world-of-warcraft-makes-nil-debut-with-washington-huskies" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sports Illustrated</a>. "Our teams have been working together to create incredible in-person and broadcast experiences for fans, and we hope Husky Nation and World of Warcraft players alike are excited to WoW down to Washington."</p><p>The Warcraft-themed game is taking place this Friday November 15 at 6 PM PT / 9 PM ET at Husky Stadium in Seattle, and will be broadcast on Fox for anyone curious to see how this unexpected collaboration plays out.</p>
