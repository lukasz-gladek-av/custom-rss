            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>EA and the Battlefield Studios group has fully announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>, the next game in the long-running first person shooter series, but they did so with a cinematic trailer while teasing a multiplayer reveal for next week.</p>
<p>The Battlefield 6 multiplayer reveal will take place on 31st July, one week from now. At that point we might also get word of a release date for the game – something which has been leaked/rumoured in the last few days to be coming in October.</p>
<p><iframe title="Battlefield 6 Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgNCgJG0vnY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>From that, we can draw that everything within the announcement trailer was in-engine and more indicative of the single player campaign that is being developed by Criterion and Motive Studios. The trailer opens with an obscured President of the United States speaking from the White House podium about an unprovoked attack on Europe, the US and NATO by a private military group known as Pax Armata.</p>
<p>Here’s the trailer blurb:</p>

<p>Witness the vicious path of destruction carved by Pax Armata, the world’s leading private military company. PAX pursues the destruction of NATO and its allies, stopping at nothing to uphold their motto: “Our Protection, Your Peace.”</p>
<p>Lock &amp; load for the ultimate all-out warfare experience. Fight in high-intensity infantry combat. Rip through the skies in aerial dogfights. Demolish your environment for a strategic advantage. In a war of tanks, fighter jets, and massive combat arsenals, your squad is the deadliest weapon. This is Battlefield 6.</p>
<p>Little is known about who Pax Armata is, but from pre-announcement teasers, they seem to be backed by a growing coalition of other nations. Careful not to step on certain countries’ toes, this isn’t being labelled as a particular nation at this time, and is instead the “Pax Armata Mercenaries”.</p>
<p>Following this we get a look at a broad spectrum of Battlefield-like scenarios. There’s cinematic moments with characters calling in military strikes, angrily slapping tables and more, but there’s also paratroopers jumping from planes, there’s beach landing craft coming out of carriers, there’s rocket artillery, there’s dams blowing up and more. It builds up until parts of New York are getting blown up.</p>
<p>The next Battlefield is in development under the collective brand Battlefield Studios, which encapsulates Criterion, DICE, Ripple Effect and Motive Studios. With the launch of Battlefield Labs playtesting earlier this year, we got a glimpse of actual gameplay from the next Battlefield, featuring a map in the Middle East with modern combined forces as tanks and soldiers battle through the streets. There’s clearly an emphasis on flashy map destruction and degradation, building up to a whole building facade being blown up with an RPG.</p>
<p>The thing that has been most controversial, though, is whether or not weapons will be locked to classes or not. I guess we’ll find out about that in 7 days…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers launched yesterday, at the time of this writing, and in what seems to be a required milestone in the launch of any major title, it has done so with a number of performance issues. In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560/view/498327923676151994">a new statement</a> from developer Leenzee Games, the studio acknowledges the reports it has received from players regarding performance problems and a few other issues with "<em>abnormal pricing</em>" and pre-order errors.</p>



<p>After thanking players who have supported the game and were there to play it on launch, Leenzee Games wrote that it has "<em>received reports regarding issues such as the game’s optimization not meeting expectations, errors in distributing pre-order rewards, and some abnormal pricing.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>These problems should never have occurred,</em>" it continued, "<em>and we deeply regret the inconvenience and negative experience some players are currently facing</em>."</p>



<p>Leenzee Games adds that it is "<em>confident in the game's performance</em>" so long as your PC is within the studio's recommended technical specifications, but it is working on optimizing the game for the variety of PC builds out there. It also confirms that a patch is being worked on, and that Leenzee will release it "<em>as soon as we can</em>."</p>



<p>Leenzee Games also quickly touches on "<em>pricing anomalies</em>" in some regions where the game is being sold, and just says that it is trying to work with Steam to ensure that the correct price is listed in every region. </p>



<p>Lastly, Leenzee Games addresses reports of players not getting promised pre-order rewards, an issue it also says will be fixed in its next patch. And as a sign of appreciation for its players, everyone who purchased the game on Steam is getting a free copy of the game's soundtrack. If you bought the deluxe version of the game on Steam, then you'll also be getting a brand-new costume in a future update, as another token of the studio's appreciation for your support.</p>



<p>A free copy of the soundtrack and new in-game cosmetics is nice and all, but what players want is for the game they purchased to run smoothly. Of the 8,000+ player reviews for WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers on Steam, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2277560/WUCHANG_Fallen_Feathers/#app_reviews_hash">only 21% of them are positive</a>, with pretty much every negative review citing major performance problems. </p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wuchang-fallen-feathers-unleash-the-madness/">Francesco De Meo looked at WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers for his review</a>, he also cited performance issues as a key drawback of the game, and while it has a strong art style and some engaging combat elements, the performance problems aren't the only things players have to worry about in Fallen Feathers. </p>



<p>"<em>Uninspired level design, mediocre PC performance and a formula that relies a little too much on the genre's conventions hold the experience back a bit, making it worthwhile only for fans of the genre who haven't had enough of it, and are willing to look past some shortcomings.</em>"</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-vtuber-world-is-in-crisis-over-%E2%80%98owed%E2%80%99-donations.1252344/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>On July 21st, 6,669-year-old demon queen Ironmouse posted an 11-minute video, explaining that <a href="https://youtu.be/MwLbGcUMy6g?si=DmgFvaaqceo4XGaw">she is leaving her talent management agency, VShojo</a>. Ironmouse is a VTuber, or “virtual YouTuber,” which is a type of a streamer who doesn’t usually show their human face and <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/vtuber-agencies-virtual-idols-global-streaming-superstars-1235387390/">creates elaborate digital personas to make content</a> instead.</p></div><p>“I recently found out that for the past couple of months, I have been misled by VShojo,” she said in her video. “I believe that I am owed a significant amount of funds, which I have not been paid.”</p><p>With her pink hair, purple eyes, and horns, Ironmouse is one of Twitch’s biggest streamers. She currently has more than 2.3 million followers on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ironmouse">Twitch</a> and 1.3 million subscribers on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@IronMouseParty">YouTube</a>. In 2023, <a href="https://www.siliconera.com/ironmouse-wins-content-creator-of-the-year-at-the-game-awards-2023/">she won a Game Award for content creator of the year</a>. A year later, she briefly overtook <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/4/23820637/kai-cenat-ps5-giveaway-nyc-union-square">Kai Cenat</a> as the most subscribed to Twitch streamer, with more than 300,000 subs. Her VTuber colleagues at VShojo have follower counts in the hundreds of thousands across Twitch and YouTube. Now, in the aftermath of Ironmouse’s video, most of them have also quit the company, with some of them also alleging unpaid wages.</p><p>According to Ironmouse, her trouble with VShojo started with the conclusion of her 2024 subscription marathon on Twitch. During the event, Ironmouse raised more than $500,000 for the Immune Deficiency Foundation, a cause she explained was important to her as she — the real person behind the Ironmouse persona — suffers from common variable immunodeficiency, or CVID.</p><p><em>The Verge</em> has reached out to VShojo, Ironmouse, and the Immune Deficiency Foundation for comment.</p><p>“Because the money came from my Twitch revenue … it required VShojo to make the donation on my behalf,” Ironmouse said in her video. She claims this has not been done and that’s why she’s decided to leave VShojo:</p><div><blockquote><p>“And most importantly, the thing that hurts me the most is that the Immune Deficiency Foundation, which is the most important charity to me and also the reason why I’m here today, is owed over half a million dollars from VShojo … I really want to tell you everything, but unfortunately right now I have been instructed by my attorney to wait for more of the legal procedure to unfold. So one day I will be able to tell you the full story. But for now, I just need to let you know that I will no longer be a part of VShojo.“</p></blockquote></div><p>“As of right now, I am an independent VTuber,” she said.</p><p>While a creator leaving a talent agency is nothing new, especially in the world of VTubers, the scope and scale of this departure has had a serious impact on both VShojo and the wider VTuber community. In the hours after Ironmouse released her video, 12 of the 13 VTubers listed on VShojo’s website have officially announced they are leaving the company.</p><div><p>On July 22nd, <a href="https://www.vshojo.com/talent/kson">Kson</a>, a yakuza-themed VTuber with 1.3 million followers on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/cBxw80mZoWI?si=x7vX9CYX3FfbM7bs">did a livestream in which she announced that she, too, would be leaving the company</a>, also alleging unpaid funds.</p></div><p>“And the reason why is because VShojo hasn’t paid a significant amount of money to me,” Kson said.</p><p>Most of the other VShojo members, who said they were leaving on their livestreams and social media, did not give explicit reasons why, suggesting that they aren’t able to due to legal reasons. Nearly all of them expressed heartbreak related to their departure and shock at Ironmouse’s treatment.</p><p>“Yes, I’m leaving VShojo,” <a href="https://x.com/ProjektMelody/status/1947667567440761307">Projekt Melody posted on X</a>. “I put my everything into this comp[any]. But I’m beyond devastated at what happened. &amp; I never in a million years thought I’d be saying these words.”</p><p>When VShojo was founded in 2020, it positioned itself as ”talent first” as a way to differentiate itself from other companies that had reputations <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24065311/vtuber-selen-tatsuki-nijisanji-termination-dokibird">for treating talent poorly</a>. This attracted popular VTubers and huge numbers of fans.</p><p>VTubers operate similarly to Twitch streamers but can have extra expectations and constraints set upon them if they are corporately sponsored by talent agencies. To understand VTubers, it’s best to think of them as digital Japanese pop idols. Almost every aspect of a corporate VTuber — their sponsorships, social media accounts, finances, name, and more — is owned and controlled by their agency. In most circumstances, if a VTuber decides to go independent, then they have to leave every aspect of their persona behind, including all the channels attached to that persona, and start over from scratch. VShojo stood out as a company because its clients were not beholden to those terms.</p><p>“I’m actually shocked,” said Biggles, an artist and independent VTuber, who told <em>The Verge</em> that she’s been a fan of VShojo talent since the company’s beginning. “VShojo was a dream for many.”</p><p>Ironmouse’s dream for the Immune Deficiency Foundation lives on, however. After posting her announcement video as her usual persona, <a href="https://tiltify.com/@ironmouse/ironmouse">she initiated a donation drive to replace the allegedly unpaid funds</a>. Through her community, her former VShojo colleagues, and their communities, they’ve raised almost $1 million.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/712627/ironmouse-leaves-vshojo-vtuber-twitch-youtube]]></content:encoded>

But the Twitch star is part of a far bigger industry that spans various countries, cultures, and languages. According to a May 2025 report from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://streamscharts.com/news/vtubers-q1-2025-report&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://streamscharts.com/news/vtubers-q1-2025-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Streams Charts and VSTATS</a></span>, the international VTubing landscape continues to grow quarter-over-quarter. While Japanese VTubers dominate the industry’s upper echelons, English-language VTubing is a core niche in the contemporary market. Meaning, if you’re interested in VTubing, now is the perfect time to start streaming.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Just don’t end up sticker shocked. Ordering your very own custom-made Live2D VTuber, or a 2D VTuber rigged to match a performer’s movements and facial expressions, can cost thousands of dollars. Many 3D VTuber commissions start around $1,000, with some high-end models reaching similar prices as their 2D counterparts. Make no mistake: The artists, riggers, modelers, and animators who make VTubing shine deserve every penny for their hard work. They are the backbone of this industry. But for newcomers interested in VTubing, it’s ill-advised to drop a couple grand on your first model. Cutting your teeth on something relatively inexpensive is best.</p><p>Luckily, VTubing is more accessible now than ever before. Plenty of pre-made models exist at an affordable price, allowing newcomers to express themselves creatively without breaking the bank. Programs like VRoid Studio even offer free model creation. And when in doubt, you can always throw a few images together and get started as a PNGTuber. Read on to learn the best ways to become a VTuber today.

However, commissioning a bespoke Live2D model can be expensive. Luckily, there’s a relatively affordable way to get started as a 2D VTuber. You can purchase an avatar base and then customize it to your liking.</p><p>Avatar bases are special models created with a wide assortment of modifiable hair, face, eye, and clothing options.

Yes, this is literally a form of VTubing where you create content with image files. It’s incredibly simple to get started: Just draw a few images, hook them together with a PNGTuber program, and you’re done. I highly recommend this format for illustrators and digital artists unfamiliar with rigging or 3D modeling. Creating your own PNGTuber doubles as an advertisement for your artistic skills.</p><p>Using luna olmewe’s free program <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://olmewe.itch.io/veadotube-mini&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://olmewe.itch.io/veadotube-mini" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">veadotube mini</a></span>, you can create your very own PNGTuber with ease. Simply fire up the software, go to the right-hand side, and select different image files that depict your VTuber with their mouth opened, closed, or while blinking in either state. You can then customize how your character moves when standing still or speaking. Make sure the correct microphone is selected, and you’re done! When you speak, your new PNGTuber will open their mouth. You’re officially ready to plug your new VTuber into your broadcasting program of choice.</p><p>Anywhere from two to four images will suffice for your PNGTuber. And for those who aren’t artistically inclined, have no fear. Many artists offer PNGTuber commissions starting at approximately $50 – a perfect option if you’re looking for a more boutique experience without breaking the bank.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/unmatched-board-game-expansions-buying-guide</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/unmatched-board-game-buying-guide.1252317/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Although it’s a repurposing of an older game, Star Wars: Epic Duels, the Unmatched series quickly made a name for itself as the premier head-to-head skirmish board game after its release in 2019. Its formula of simple rules married to giving each character their own deck of cards, ensuring a unique feel and endlessly tweakable gameplay, shot it to the top of the charts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, its success has ensured that it’s spawned a dizzying array of different sets, all of which can be mixed and matched. After all, one of the key selling points of the series is that it lets you pit anyone from its bewildering array of fantasy and franchised characters against any other, offering huge replay value.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Featured in this article</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are so many sets available that we’re focusing on in-print ones for this guide, although it’s not hard to find the older ones second-hand. But if you’re confused by where to get into this exciting universe of carnage, or how best to expand your collection, we’re here to help with a rundown of the various options. Fundamentally, however, it’s a fantastic franchise with a strong core system, so wherever you start you’re unlikely to go wrong.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Unfranchised Versions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Unmatched box was Battle of Legends, which featured a variety of mythical characters from across the world. Even while it’s spun off into various licensed products, the series has continued to maintain this line and, unless you’re a superfan of one of the franchised versions available, these remain the best place to start.</p><p id="battle-of-legends-vol-1"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Battle of Legends Vol. 1">Unmatched - Battle of Legends Vol. 1</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225691"><div id="225691" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched - Battle of Legends Vol. 1</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It speaks to the strength of the series as a whole that <strong>the very first set that launched it all is still the best place to start for most players</strong>. You get four characters from a diverse range of global mythology: King Arthur, Sinbad, Medusa and Alice, of wonderland fame. Each has a unique playstyle which fits their background, with Alice able to turn from small to big for different bonuses, for example, while King Arthur can sacrifice his cards for super-powerful sword attacks.</p></div><p id="battle-of-legends-vol-2"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Battle of Legends Vol. 2">Unmatched - Battle of Legends Vol. 2</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225695"><div id="225695" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched - Battle of Legends Vol. 2</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">By the time Volume 2 came out, Unmatched as a whole had diversified strongly, so the designers had to dig deep to find some new play angles for the four included characters. The results are great, but not necessarily the best place to start out as they’re a bit off-the-wall and require some extra rules to learn. Sun Wukong, the trickster Monkey King, can create clones of himself to harass other players while urban Legend Bloody Mary gets extra actions as long as she’s holding at least three cards. It is, however, a great addition to a burgeoning collection.</p></div><p id="cobble-fog"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Cobble &amp; Fog">Unmatched - Cobble &amp; Fog</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225696"><div id="225696" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched - Cobble &amp; Fog</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>While this might not be the best place to begin your Unmatched collection, as some of the characters take a bit of experience to handle, Cobble &amp; Fog is probably the best box overall in the entire series</strong>. It features fighters from Victorian gothic fiction: Dracula, Dr Jekyll (and of course Mr Hyde), Sherlock Holmes and the Invisible Man. Not only is this an inspiring selection of very popular characters but they’re also well-balanced, with each bringing out their theme superbly during play, as we discussed during our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unmatched-cobble-and-fog-board-game-review"><u>review of Cobble &amp; Fog</u></a>.</p></div><p id="slings-and-arrows"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Slings and Arrows">Unmatched - Slings and Arrows</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225697"><div id="225697" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched - Slings and Arrows</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the newest sets in the series also has potentially the most surprising source, drawing as it does on the works of Shakespeare. It feels unlikely that the bard ever imagined what might happen if The Three Witches from Macbeth, Hamlet, Titania, and Shakespeare himself ever fought a pitched battle in his home base of the Globe Theatre, London, but now you can find out for yourself if you’ve a mind. It’s a really fun set but it’s also a bit too crazy for beginners, with the Witches throwing cards into brewing a potion and Shakespeare counting words on his cards to keep in iambic pentameter.</p></div><p id="unmatched-adventures-tales-to-amaze"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Unmatched Adventures: Tales to Amaze">Unmatched Adventures: Tales to Amaze</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225698"><div id="225698" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched Adventures: Tales to Amaze</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Tales to Amaze is an outlier in the Unmatched world as it’s designed as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative</a> experience, where players take a motley mix of fictional and real-world characters from a supercharged version of Nikolai Tesla to mythical flatboat captain Annie Christmas, and team up against either the Mothman or a Martian invasion. It works surprisingly well as a cooperative game thanks to tons of variety in enemy movement and minions and, as a bonus, you can also use the included characters in traditional competitive Unmatched too, although you’ll need a board from one of the other base sets to do so. It’s unusual enough that we gave <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unmatched-adventures-tales-to-amaze-board-game-review"><u>Tales to Amaze a full review rundown</u></a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Witcher</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The series’ newest franchise is a biggie: the Witcher universe made famous by CD Projekt Red’s hugely popular <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/the-witcher">series of video games</a>. If you’re one of its legions of fans, these adaptations will do you proud and you can jump straight in. But since this edition contains three characters rather than the four in older sets, those previous boxes represent better value.</p></div><p id="the-witcher-steel-silver"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="The Witcher: Steel &amp; Silver">Unmatched - The Witcher: Steel &amp; Silver</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225699"><div id="225699" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched - The Witcher: Steel &amp; Silver</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the better of the two Witcher sets released so far, not least because it includes the titular Witcher, Geralt of Rivia himself, a powerful melee character who you can customize to some extent to suit your playstyle. He’s accompanied by Ciri, who can chain “source” cards to escalate effects, making for tough choices as to what order to play things in, and by The Ancient Leshen who has a terrifying card that transforms him into crows, allowing him to move anywhere on the board.</p></div><p id="the-witcher-realms-fall"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="The Witcher: Realms Fall">Unmatched - The Witcher: Realms Fall</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225700"><div id="225700" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched - The Witcher: Realms Fall</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Without Geralt, this box has to fall back on the famous sorceresses of the series, Philippa Eilhart, Triss Merigold and Yennefer of Vengerburg, except the latter two are presented as one character in a kind of double act: you can choose which is the main character and which is the sidekick. All have a varied and powerful mix of cards, as befits sorcerers from the Witcher world. Rounding out the set is the head of the Wild Hunt Eredin, a brutal close-combat fighter with powerful attacks.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Marvel</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As if just having the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-marvel-board-games">Marvel</a> franchise wasn’t enough, these sets also change the formula of basic Unmatched by including item tokens. These are placed randomly on the board and provide minor boosts to the player that picks them up. Vanilla boards were the only weak points in the series so this is a good change, but it’s perhaps less well-suited for newcomers, especially since, again, these sets all have three characters instead of four.</p></div><p id="marvel-redemption-row"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Marvel - Redemption Row">Unmatched: Marvel - Redemption Row</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225701"><div id="225701" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched: Marvel - Redemption Row</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The best of the Marvel boxes is Redemption Row</strong>. Of its three heroes, Ghost Rider has hellfire-powered movement while Luke Cage is well-nigh invulnerable without some smart cardplay to get around his booster defences and Moon Knight rotates through different powers as he responds to the changing lunar phases. They’re all fun characters, well balanced out of the box and fun to pit head to head.</p></div><p id="marvel-brains-and-brawn"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Marvel - Brains and Brawn">Unmatched: Marvel - Brains and Brawn</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225702"><div id="225702" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched: Marvel - Brains and Brawn</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Of all the Marvel sets this one probably has the most popular selection of characters</strong>. Spider-Man uses his spider-sense to force your opponent to show their played combat cards before you respond. She-Hulk has a mass of hit points and can discard cards to damage opponents and, last but certainly not least, Doctor Strange relies on a very fun and varied deck of spell effects to mess with his enemies. </p></div><p id="marvel-for-king-and-country"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Marvel - For King and Country">Unmatched: Marvel - For King and Country</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225703"><div id="225703" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched: Marvel - For King and Country</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Get the Avengers assembling with this box. Black Widow has a very unusual approach that sees her playing mission cards from among her hand, with requirements she can then fulfil for an extra bonus. Black Panther’s suit lets him steal cards from other players, and the Winter Soldier has enormously powerful card effects, many of which come with a downside as a result of his tortured psyche. </p></div><p id="marvel-hells-kitchen"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Marvel - Hell's Kitchen">Unmatched: Marvel - Hell's Kitchen</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225704"><div id="225704" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched: Marvel - Hell's Kitchen</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Hell’s Kitchen features some of Marvel’s shadier characters. Bullseye is a ranged monster, able to strike from an extended distance and with cards that can have extra effects when you win combat. Daredevil has a fraught and exciting push your luck element but Elektra lets the side down a bit with her resurrect mechanic: she’s still fun to play but doesn’t feel as varied or as interesting as the other two inclusions.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Two-Figure Sets</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside the bigger boxes, Unmatched also offers smaller sets that only have two fighters. In theory these should be a cheaper entry point into the system but in practice, stock shortages mean they can cost you as much as a full base game set. </p></div><p id="robin-hood-vs-big-foot"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Robin Hood vs. Big Foot">Unmatched - Robin Hood vs. Big Foot</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225705"><div id="225705" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched - Robin Hood vs. Big Foot</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The cage match of the century that you never knew you wanted, both these characters are really interesting to play. Robin Hood has a unique hit and run style, supported by a band of merry men, while Bigfoot gets to draw extra cards if he’s alone in a zone at the end of the turn. This makes them good complimentary opponents but they also work well integrated into other sets.</p></div><p id="suns-origin"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Sun’s Origin">Unmatched - Sun’s Origin</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225706"><div id="225706" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched - Sun’s Origin</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This set offers two historical Japanese characters. Tomoe Gozen is a ranged and highly mobile character, who matches well against Oda Nobunaga’s ability to boost friendly melee characters. Both are hard to master so, together with the castle board and its interesting split-level setup, this is a better addition for seasoned Unmatched collectors than newcomers.</p></div><p id="houdini-vs-the-genie"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Houdini vs. The Genie">Unmatched: Houdini vs. The Genie</h3></p><div catalogid="125c132d-a0ce-4296-96ea-01451efb3260" id="225707"><div id="225707" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Unmatched: Houdini vs. The Genie</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A legendary magician faces off against a very famous fake magician in this pairing. Neither is especially inspiring: Houdini is presented as a melee fighter, for some reason, who can use boost cards to pop up around the board, while the Genie can discard cards to take extra actions for some super-powered turns.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 24, 2025 1:58 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/unmatched-board-game-expansions-buying-guide]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The first trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a> has arrived, and it's impressive. This trailer spotlights the game's campaign, which is being made at Motive Studio, opening with the President of the US speaking to the American people about a "monstrous, unprovoked attack" and how "no country is safe."</p><p>The developers previously spoke about how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-campaign-is-inspired-by-this-movie-and-tv-show/1100-6531514/" data-ref-id="1100-6531514">Alex Garland's war movie Civil War</a> was an inspiration for the game, and it's not hard to see the influence of that film in this trailer. The trailer shows off a variety of locations around the world, including New York City, and also features the iconic Battlefield music, which is nice to hear. Of course, Battlefield's trademark destruction is on display in the trailer as well.</p>

    <div id="main-content">
        

        <p>But it's mostly about anime.</p>

    </div>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Sony has whipped out its wallet and snapped up precisely 2.5 percent of publisher Bandai Namco as part of a "strategic partnership" that primarily appears to be focused on expanding audiences within the realm of anime and manga.
</p>
<p>
The news, of course, follows Sony's move to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-is-now-fromsoftware-owner-kadokawas-largest-shareholder">become FromSoftware owner Kadokawa's largest shareholder</a> last year. And while it might be tempting to conclude this new Bandai Namco is part of a nefarious scheme to lock FromSoftware in a PlayStation-shaped bunker, the reality probably isn't quite so Machiavellian.
</p>
<p>
Sony's decision to increase its shares in Kadokawa last December was - as with today's Bandai Namco deal - primarily about the anime market. In Kadokawa's case, it was said the increased partnership would allow Sony to adapt the company's IP (Kadokawa is a major name in anime publishing) into live-action film and TV dramas globally, as well as co-produce anime works, expand global distribution of Kadokawa's anime works, and more.
</p>
<p>
And it's a similar story with Bandai Namco. In a <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202507/25-0724E/">joint statement</a> announcing Sony's acquisition of 16m shares in the company as part of a new "strategic partnership", the pair wrote, "Through this business alliance and Sony's investment in Bandai Namco... [we] will focus on expanding the fan community for IP such as anime and manga around the world and strengthening engagement, particularly in the anime field where rapid market growth is anticipated."
</p>
<p>
This will involve implementing initiatives to expand the "works as well as products and services based on IP developed by Bandai Namco, leveraging Sony's strengths in areas such as the production and distribution of anime and other video content, as well as merchandising."
</p>
<p>
There was also talk of the companies "merging their strengths to create new and emotionally moving experiences for fans" in order to "maximise the value of IP" as part of the 68bn yen/$464m deal. There was not, however, any mention of a PlayStation-exclusive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> 2.
</p>
<p>
Sony's recent anime-focused activity follows its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-completes-usd1bn-crunchyroll-buyout">$1bn purchase of streaming service Crunchyroll</a> in 2020. That deal, it said at the time, would create an "unprecedented opportunity to serve anime fans like never before and deliver the anime experience across any platform they choose, from theatrical, events, home entertainment, games, streaming, linear TV."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> has finally been revealed officially, courtesy of a brand-new trailer premiered on YouTube. A legal disclaimer URL featured at the end of the trailer may have given away a release window too!
</p>
<p>The trailer itself shows in-engine footage, but not gameplay. You see all the Battlefield staples: tanks, helicopters, fighter jets, all blasting away at each other and demolishing buildings. The trailer sets up a private miltary force called Pax Armada too, which appears to the be antagonistic force in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>.
</p>
<p>The trailer started up with a in-engine camera feed where discussions can be heard about various modern war talk, different countries, whispers about who isn't present in the room, and quiet chatting about the upcoming statement from the President of the USA. This then led straight into the trailer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Surprisingly, there was no <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a> announcement to be found in this week's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/pokemon-presents-july-2025-every-announcement-full-livestream">Pokémon Presents</a>, but an update reveal wasn't far behind.</p>
<p>The Pokémon Company has today lifted the lid on the new 'Wisdom of Sea and Sky' expansion, which sees Johto's very own Lugia and Ho-Oh take centre stage in a Gen 2-focused set. The above trailer gives us a closer look at the two legendary ex cards, a handful of full arts and shinies, and, of course, Chikorita, Cyndaquil, and Totodile. All of this will be arriving in the Pokémon TCG Pocket app on <strong>30th July</strong>.</p>
<p>While we're very excited to see the new set in action (it's a good year to be a Totodile fan), the biggest announcement for us was the reveal that the in-game trading feature will be getting a facelift on the same day.</p>
<p>From 30th July, you'll be able to make a wishlist of cards you'd like to trade for via the My Cards screen, so other players can see what you're after and make you an offer. You'll be able to select up to 20 cards for your wishlist, and pin three of them to your profile for all to see.</p>
<p>As promised, Trade Tokens will also become a thing of the past, replaced by the much easier-to-obtain Shinedust (which you get as standard with any repeat card pulls) for three-diamond, four-diamond, and one-star rarity trades. You'll be able to cash in your pre-existing Trade Tokens in the in-game shop for Pack Hourglasses or Shinedust.</p>
<p>After months of hardly touching the woefully consumable-based trade system, we might finally start to fill in the blanks in our collection.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/pokemon/related-articles:185507,177763 @ 1753369203 -->
<p><em>Are you pleased to finally see the trade update come into effect? What are your thoughts on the next expansion? Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/pokemon-tcg-pocket-lands-much-needed-trading-update-and-a-new-expansion-next-week]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-sales-hit-10m-nightreign-at-5m.1252266/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has announced new sales milestones for&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC, as well as the experimental multiplayer spinoff&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, and they're both doing very well indeed.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1948382858109698175" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media, the studio reveals that&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>has reached the 10 million sales mark, which means it's doubled its sales count in the year or so since it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales" rel="nofollow">hit five million in its first week</a>.</p>

<p>Since base&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>sales were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">sitting at around 30 million</a> at last count, that means around a third of all&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>players have checked out&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, which is a pretty impressive adoption rate for DLC.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-nightreign-sales-scadutree.jpg?itok=R2fa6NYk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-nightreign-sales-scadutree.jpg?itok=ki7xoilj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC has done very well for itself, as has spinoff&nbsp;<em>Nightreign</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, meanwhile, has hit the five million sales mark, so it's amassed another 1.5 million sales since passing the 3.5 million milestone <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-confirmed-sales" rel="nofollow">back in June</a>.</p>

<p>Sales of&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>may only be a fraction of its bigger brother's, but it's worth remembering that&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>isn't a mainline FromSoftware Soulslike; rather, it's an experimental spinoff that draws from roguelikes,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, and games like&nbsp;<em>Risk of Rain</em>, so these sales are still pretty impressive.</p>

<p>Indeed,&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>sold well enough to keep both Nintendo Switch 2 launch title&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>and Hideo Kojima trip&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;</em>from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/circana-june-2025-us-gaming-sales-data" rel="nofollow">all-format top spot in June</a>, so Bandai Namco has plenty of reason to feel smug.</p>

<p>The franchise's future is looking pretty rosy as well; back in May, a live-action movie helmed by&nbsp;<em>Ex Machina&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Annihilation&nbsp;</em>filmmaker Alex Garland <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-movie" rel="nofollow">was announced</a>, so there's even more&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>around the corner.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-shadow-of-the-erdtree-sales.jpg?itok=6zCvq6nD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-shadow-of-the-erdtree-sales.jpg?itok=zF6uwv4H 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's a good time to be an&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>fan.</figcaption></figure><p>While there probably won't be an&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-2-not-happening-fromsoftware" rel="nofollow">anytime soon</a>, that doesn't mean FromSoftware is resting on its laurels. The studio is currently hard at work on&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>, a PvPvE game coming <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2" rel="nofollow">exclusively to Nintendo Switch 2</a> (yes, you read that right) next year.</p>

That’s how I initially felt about <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>. The high-fidelity trailers looked like an indistinct mashup of <em>Stellar Blade</em> and <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>. Was it another Unreal Engine 5 game from a first-time Chines studio relying on aping existing formulas to capitalize on waning days of a genre goldrush? </p><figure id="" data-id="434d7ce250c34d1c4cbb085f242d7716" data-recommend-id="image://434d7ce250c34d1c4cbb085f242d7716" data-format="png" data-width="956" data-height="620" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a Wuchang post on X.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It may be the “Gooner Souls” of 2025, but that’s certainly not all it is. As everyone’s pointing out, <em>Wuchang</em> isn’t <em>just </em>more derivative Soulslike slop. It’s actually pretty fun and surprisingly deep. I’ve only played about five hours of <em>Wuchang </em>so far. I’m nowhere near ready to render a more definitive verdict on the totality of the game, but it has successfully laid to rest my initial fears and skepticism about it being a purely flashy yet hollow imitation of better games. I mean, it sort of is that in some ways, but there are some cool new twists to play with as well.</p><p>A familiar pace of combat—dodge, dodge, wait for an opening, attack—adds a resource called Skyborn Might that you build up by completing perfect dodges and parries (block to deflect or attack to clash and reflect the damage back). Skyborn Might is in turn used to unleash spells and more powerful attacks, which encourages you to constantly change up the flow of fights to optimize damage output. And instead of pouring points into stats every time you level up, there’s a <em>Final Fantasy X</em>-like Sphere Grid called the Impetus Repository, in which you level up individual nodes that each grant unique benefits. Add in a variety of weapons and armor to swap between, and you get a pretty fun combat loop that makes crafting a build feel less rote than in some other Soulslikes. </p><p>I’ve been playing on PS5, where performance has been fine (it’s also out on Game Pass today), but that’s apparently not the case for many people on PC at the moment. <em>Wuchang </em>is officially out today, and the Steam page is already full of negative reviews slamming the game for a lack of optimization. “Stutterchang: Fallen Frames,” wrote one user. “Stuttering, ghosting, blur visual, frame drop...well really bad performance with RTX 5070,” wrote another. That hasn’t stopped the game from hitting over 130,000 concurrent on Steam. </p><figure id="" data-id="765a4597619cf0454e1ee8a32b539529" data-recommend-id="image://765a4597619cf0454e1ee8a32b539529" data-format="png" data-width="1511" data-height="862" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Steam reviews for Wuchang." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows Steam reviews for Wuchang." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Steam / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="765a4597619cf0454e1ee8a32b539529" data-recommend-id="image://765a4597619cf0454e1ee8a32b539529" data-format="png" data-width="1511" data-height="862" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Steam reviews for Wuchang." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While some players say they’ve managed just fine on 3000 series cards, only 21 percent of the roughly 8,000 reviews so far are positive. There’s no demo either yet, so you can’t try the game out to see if it runs okay before buying the full thing, though Steam does allow refunds with less than two hours of playtime. “We are confident in the game’s performance within our recommended spec but we’re working on optimization,” the studio <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560?emclan=103582791474575079&amp;emgid=498327923676151994&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560?emclan=103582791474575079&amp;emgid=498327923676151994" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on Steam today</a></span>. “We are looking to issue a patch as soon as we can.”</p><p>For those not on PC, <em>Wuchang</em> is definitely worth a second or third look, especially for Souls fans and anyone else not already completely burnt out on “another one of those.” I do hear it has some pretty absurd difficulty spikes later on, but in the beginning its pretty forgiving. At the very least, don’t write-off <em>Wuchang</em> only because it looks like gooner <em>Souls </em>bait. And unlike <em>Stellar Blade</em>, it actually has plenty of outfits that look cool and aren’t completely absurd. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-gooner-souls-pc-steam-reviews-1851786856]]></content:encoded>

<p>The big new release of the moment, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, has sold a smashing 127,905 units in the week of 14th July to 20th July, but can't quite take the number one spot from the Switch 2 launch title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, which shifted another 135,370 copies. DK, of course, was only available for part of the week, so we'll see how far its legs carry it over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>For comparison's sake, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/donkey_kong_country_tropical_freeze">Tropical Freeze</a> debuted on Switch with 88,421 physical sales, and on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/donkey_kong_country_tropical_freeze">Wii U</a> it debuted with 35,717 sales.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4rnumkp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The only other new release of the week that cracked the top ten is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hunter_x_hunter_nen_x_impact">Hunter x Hunter: Nen x Impact</a>, a fighting game based on the hugely popular manga and anime series. However, at least in terms of physical sales, it only managed to shift 3,174 copies on Switch, with other platforms outside the top ten.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tamagotchi_plaza">Tamagotchi Plaza</a> continues to do very well, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> remains in the top five with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing</a> joining it — incredibly impressive given that we have that new Mario Kart. Nothing will stop it, eh?</p>

<p>On the hardware side of things, Switch 2 sales continue to climb as the new console has sold an extra 20k+ units this week compared to last — it shifted 152,165 this week compared to 128,643 last week. That's a nice boost thanks to DK, we reckon.</p>
<p>Once again the Switch OLED and Lite have outsold the PS5, with only the OLED managing to sell above 5,000 units. It's a bit of a drop from last week, but as more new games come to the Switch 2, we're sure more people will move over.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Expect Xbox to Port More Games To PS5 and Nintendo Switch 2 as Analyst Says “We’re Way Beyond” Players Jumping Platforms for Exclusive Games]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-ports-nintendo-switch-2-ps5/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/expect-xbox-to-port-more-games-to-ps5-and-nintendo-switch-2-as-analyst-says-%E2%80%9Cwe%E2%80%99re-way-beyond%E2%80%9D-players-jumping-platforms-for-exclusive-games.1252221/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Xbox has been in third place behind PlayStation and Nintendo for years now, and the recent wave of Xbox releasing games that would have previously been platform exclusives on PS5 and Nintendo Switch/Nintendo Switch 2 has only further solidified that Xbox isn't trying to move up the ladder; it's just trying to hang on to some level of market share.</p>



<p>And you should expect more ports, according to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/bringing-your-games-to-other-platforms">The Game Business</a> and Circana executive director and video game industry analyst, Mat Piscatella. Piscatella spoke to The Game Business founder and editor-in-chief Christopher Dring about video game and hardware sales for June 2025, which saw the Nintendo Switch 2 become the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-fastest-selling-gaming-hardware-us-history/">fastest-selling video game hardware in US history</a>, and, importantly for Xbox, saw Forza Horizon 5 be one of the top-five selling games on PlayStation in the US. </p>



<p>In fact, according to data firm Alinea Analytics, Forza Horizon 5 has become the<a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-best-selling-game-playstation-5/"> best-selling game on PS5 for 2025 so far</a>, and that kind of sales success is exactly what Xbox needs right now, even if it has to come from other platforms. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="&quot;Bringing your games to other platforms is how you’re going to win&quot;" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rVynmmmM4FA?start=1497&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>People who buy a hardware system these days, they’re doing it because of the ecosystem, because of their friends list. You’re not going to get people to transition consoles because of exclusives anymore. We’re way beyond that point</em>,<em>"</em> Piscatella told The Game Business. "<em>People are entrenched into their systems. And bringing the content to them is the only way to win. And that is what everyone is doing, except for Nintendo they tend to do their own thing. Even they could benefit from it, but of course they won’t, that’s not their MO."</em></p>



<p>Piscatella continues to say that because the biggest live service games are so dominant on the charts tracking player engagement, it's key for publishers and game makers to go where players are, and unfortunately for Xbox, the majority of them aren't playing on a Series X/S console. </p>



<p>"<em>In the US at least, the Top Ten live service games suck up half of all gaming time every month, and every other game has got to fight for the remainder. So, bringing that content to where people are is the only way you’re going to be able to win in an environment like we’re looking at right now</em>,<em>"</em> Piscatella adds. "<em>Forza being this strong… that’s great. That really bodes well for its next iteration, if they come out day one across systems. Every game finding its way to more stores and ecosystems… that is how you’re going to survive and win.</em>"</p>



<p>And it's not just in the US that live service games dominate player engagement. We see it every month in <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-was-one-of-may-2025s-top-5-games-by-revenue-according-to-newzoo-while-oblivion-remastered-remains-firm-in-the-top-20-for-revenue-and-mau/">Newzoo's reports</a>, how new releases have the potential to <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-rematch-newzoo-june-2025/">crack the top-10 list of best-selling games</a>, but the top-10 games for player engagement are pretty much always the same, only ever swapping places with each other from time to time.</p>



<p>The fact of the matter is that Xbox has not been able to get players to buy into its platform this console generation, so it's trying to go where players are, instead of trying to convince players to spend hundreds to buy a console to play a new exclusive blockbuster. Even PlayStation has had to lean into the idea of going to where players are, with its recent efforts to port its games to PC. Nintendo is the last platform standing that can still convince players to buy into its platform for exclusive games, and that's probably going to be the case for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>Dring, for his part, adds that Xbox is "<em>expected</em>" to port more games to Nintendo Switch 2 and PS5 "<em>in the coming weeks</em>," which can be read as a tease for announcements he might have a heads-up on, but it's also just the common-sense expectation to have, as we head into the next wave of announcements with Gamescom 2025 around the corner. </p>



<p>Xbox porting more of its games to other platforms is practically one of the few surefire predictions you could make about the upcoming show and the future of Xbox in the video game industry.</p>

(A group of tabletop game makers filed <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/656074/trump-tariffs-lawsuit-tabletop-game-companies-stonemaier-princess-awesome">a lawsuit in April</a> in an attempt to stop them.) While the current status of the tariffs <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5460936/trump-tariffs-economy-china-policy">remains fluid</a>, people are still backing games. Per dePontbriand: “Gamefound hasn’t seen a drop in US backer activity or overall campaign funding.”</p><p>As part of the acquisition, Indiegogo will change its pricing to be in line with Gamefound’s, which is “a flat 5 percent fee” and “no additional fees for any promotional placements” on Indiegogo and its newsletters, dePontbriand says. That change will be going into effect “immediately.”</p><p>Indiegogo will also follow Gamefound’s tipping policy, which gives 100 percent of tips directly to a creator “outside of the checkout flow,” dePontbriand says. This change is in the works, and “we’ll provide an update on timing as soon as possible.”</p><p>Both platforms will continue to exist separately, though Gamefound campaigns will be featured on both Gamefound and Indiegogo “for added exposure,” per the press release.</p><p>dePontbriand says she will remain the CEO of Indiegogo, while Gamefound CEO Marcin Świerkot will “take on the role of Group CEO.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/712733/indiegogo-acquired-gamefound-crowdfunding]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you're partial to a bit of sticking a thing on top of another thing, then having little people live in those things while you lord over them as an omnipotent and potentially wrathful god that's busy listening to yoga class music, pay attention. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pile-up">Pile Up!</a>, which is about strategically building cities on little islands, has just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2094910/Pile_Up/">emerged from early access</a> and gotten a bunch of new additions.</p>
<p>One of these fresh things comes with an insistence from Turkish developers Remoob that you "try fearmongering". Bold of them to assume I'm not already covertly steering the world around me towards a state of rabid paranoia.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The devs kicked off the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2094910/view/496076123863515253?l=english">patch notes</a> for Pile Up! by giving themselves a "great" rating in terms of how they handled its two year-long early access period, during which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-micro-citybuilder-is-a-high-rise-delight">our Katharine dived in</a> and found the game to be more up her alley than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/townscaper">Townscaper</a>.</p>
<p>Then, they get into the new stuff. A fresh mechanic's been added to the houses you place on your little island, meaning that if you stick one "directly in the middle of different buildings", it'll gain more population. The devs say this is inspired by a certain game they won't name, and I'm drawing a blank, so I'm just gonna assume it's somehow <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>.</p>

<figure>

<p>Then, we get to the fearmongering. Remoob have added in three new types of building to increase the combos and strategies on offer in your stacking. Utopia buildings will help keep your people happy, Fundamentals can help drive a baby boom, but if you want to "destroy your buildings to panic people and win", the devs are clear. Try fearmongering. Do it.</p>
<p>Whether you've used the new islands the update also adds to Pile Up! in order to build your city on an unstable ruin, over a constantly travelling whale or at a very high altitude, it doesn't matter, you've got to try fearmongering.</p>
<p>Ditto if you're trying the new passive upgrades, playing through the new missions to pile up more lore knowledge, or hopping into the reworked chill mode which eliminates the need to care about buildings with different mechanics. Try fearmongering.</p>
<p>Remoob say they plan to keep on updating the game going forwards, and will have more info on that soon. In the interim, why not try fearmongering?</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/chill-micro-citybuilder-pile-up-just-emerged-from-early-access-and-its-devs-want-you-to-try-fearmongering]]></content:encoded>
