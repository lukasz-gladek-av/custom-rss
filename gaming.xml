            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/tango-gameworks-lives-again-thanks-to-krafton/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closed down</a> Tango Gameworks alongside Arkane Austin, Alpha Dog Games, and Roundhouse Studios (the latter was actually rolled into ZeniMax Online Studios), the industry did not hide its displeasure.</p>
<p>The Japanese developer didn't deserve such a fate, especially after delivering the universally acclaimed rhythm action game Hi-Fi Rush, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-wins-navgtr-goty-marvels-spider-man-2-and-hi-fi-rush-win-7-and-6-prizes-respectively/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won several awards last year</a>. On Wccftech, the game earned a 9 out of 10 score from reviewer Ule Lopez:</p>
<p><em>Hi-Fi Rush is a fantastic game that combines two very popular genres and makes a wonderful and innovative game with a low skill floor but a high skill ceiling. The game is both accessible to newcomers to rhythm games and very challenging for veterans looking to be tested in several other areas that don't necessarily have to do with just rhythm games. The combat is varied, the combos you learn are great to execute, and the music is a joy to listen to. Overall, a great success.</em></p>
<p>It was even more baffling because Microsoft had previously stated they wanted to add more Asian developers to their first-party roster. Regardless, it was not the end for Tango Gameworks, as PUBG maker Krafton <a href="https://wccftech.com/tango-gameworks-and-its-hi-fi-rush-ip-have-just-been-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">swooped in</a> to acquire the studio and the Hi-Fi Rush intellectual property. In September, Krafton CEO Han 'CH' Kim said they know a sequel probably wouldn't sell a lot due to being a niche genre, but they would still try to do their best for fans.</p>
<p>Today, at the dawn of the new year, Tango Gameworks has r<a href="https://x.com/TangoGameworks/status/1874259495783981205" target="_blank" rel="noopener">esumed social media communications</a> with the following message to all its fans:</p>
<p><em><strong>A New Start </strong></em><br>
<em>Tango Gameworks studio has been reborn as Tango Gameworks Inc., proudly joining KRAFTON Inc. </em><br>
<em>We're excited to continue crafting games that bring joy to players around the world. </em><br>
<em>Thank you for your continued support as we embark on this new journey!</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, the Japanese studio previously also released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-evil-within-review-lackluster-horror-forgotten/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Evil Within</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-evil-within-2-good-not-scary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Evil Within 2</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghostwire-tokyo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghostwire: Tokyo</a>. Those franchises have stayed with Microsoft for now, but they don't appear to be&nbsp;used for the time being. As such, it's not inconceivable that Tango might ask for the license at some point in the future, though the current focus is undoubtedly on Hi-Fi Rush 2.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Gray Zone Warfare Has Hit One Million Sales in Early Access]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-early-access-one-million-sales/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gray-zone-warfare-has-hit-one-million-sales-in-early-access.1072116/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-early-access-one-million-sales/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Gray Zone Warfare, the realistic tactical shooter (with extraction elements), continues to turn heads since entering early access in April 2024. It launched to a boom that saw the game sell 500,000 copies in just four days, with many players familiar with games like Escape from Tarkov getting in on the action.</p>



<p>Since being released in early access, Gray Zone Warfare has maintained a steady course, with developer MADFINGER Games working to polish the product and push out a major update, Night Ops. Recently, the team confirmed that the game has sold one million copies – and a further 500,000 ‘edition upgrades’ have been secured.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-numbers">Big Numbers</h2>



<p>MADFINGER transitioned into the tactical shooter space a while ago, producing Gray Zone Warfare in April 2024 as the fruit of its labour. The game is years in the making, and it offers an unparalleled open-world tactical shooter experience, casting players into the dangerous, fictional world of Lamang and forcing them to survive against all odds.</p>



<p>It was one of the best-selling games on Steam in 2024, where it’s exclusively available. The ongoing performance of the title allowed it to hit the one million sales milestone relatively quickly, notching up the number just eight months after launch. That’s not bad going for a game with no pre-existing fanbase made by a company new to the genre.</p>



<p>I sat down <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madfinger-ceo-interview-tarkov-extraction-shooter-gray-zone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with MADFINGER’s CEO at Gamescom</a>, learning about what’s next for the game. He has preached multiple times that the game is ‘only 20% finished’ and that there’s plenty on the horizon, and being privy to some of those plans, I can say for sure that there’s a lot in the pipeline for this tactical shooter.</p>



<p>If you’re not enjoying <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-flea-market-locked-for-two-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the latest Tarkov wipe</a> or if you want a more unique extraction experience mixed in with a persistent world, unbound by timers, then check out Gray Zone Warfare – you won’t regret it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch 2 Motherboard Pictures Leaked on the Web]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-motherboard-pictures-leaked-on-the-web.1072107/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-motherboard-pictures-leaked-on-the-web/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Unsurprisingly, the first leak of the year is related to the Nintendo Switch 2. Three pictures of the upcoming console's motherboard have allegedly leaked <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hqu83a/switch_2_motherboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>The memory appears to be SK Hynix LPDDR5 48Gbit. The leaked images also show NVIDIA's logo, which is again entirely expected given that previous leaks all pointed to the Nintendo Switch 2 once again being powered by NVIDIA hardware. More specifically, it will use the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-pro-successor-rumored-nvidia-tegra239-soc-confirmed-to-be-real-to-feature-8-core-cpu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tegra 239 System-on-Chip (SoC)</a>, which is based on the Orin SoC family. The CPU has eight cores and 12x ARM Cortex-A78AE cores, while the GPU, based on NVIDIA's Ampere architecture, includes 2048 CUDA Cores. The hardware reportedly supports Deep Learning Super Sampling Super Resolution and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-ray-reconstruction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ray Reconstruction</a>, the latter's inclusion confirming hardware ray tracing support.</p>
<p>According to previous leaks, it won't feature built-in Frame Generation. However, several console games have shipped with AMD FSR Frame Generation, and on PC, it is possible to mix DLSS Super Resolution with FSR Frame Generation. We might see that again from some developers making Nintendo Switch 2 games as a way to extract more performance.</p>
<p>DLSS Ray Reconstruction might be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-superiority-ray-reconstruction-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only real advantage the hardware has over PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X</a>. Otherwise, experts concur that the new console will be much weaker than even the Series S, and it is rumored to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-dock-4k-30-fps-only/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limited to 4K resolution and 30 frames per second when docked</a>. Then again, it's nothing new for Nintendo fans - the last competitive console in this regard was the GameCube, which also flopped pretty hard from a sales standpoint.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1hqu83a/switch_2_motherboard/">Switch 2 motherboard</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MHN1994/">u/MHN1994</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/">NintendoSwitch2</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will once again try to attract a large audience with its seamless combination of handheld and home console that worked so well for its predecessor. The Switch just <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-surpassed-playstation-2s-lifetime-console-sales-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> the lifetime sales of Sony's PlayStation 2 in the United States. Globally, the PS2 is still ahead, but Nintendo's console might get very close before all is said and done.</p>
<p>The increasing pace of the leaks suggests a reveal might be really close. A previous rumor points to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-dock-image/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January 8 unveiling</a> by Nintendo, while the accessories are <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-might-launch-on-march-28-says-italian-website/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> to be available on the market starting on March 28.</p>

<p>Robin ‘ropz’ Kool has officially left FaZe Clan after three years on the organisation’s Counter-Strike roster. On social media, the superstar competitor penned an emotional message to fans and followers as he departed on amicable terms from FaZe Clan.</p>



<p>The Counter-Strike pro player’s next steps are undefined at present – or at least, they’re unconfirmed to the wider public. Most recently, the 25-year-old player found a second-place finish at the Perfect World Shanghai Major, falling in the grand final against Team Spirit in an emotional series.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-moving-on">Moving On</h2>



<p>Ropz <a href="https://x.com/ropz/status/1874247750922977693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">took to social media</a> to post an emotional message, prompting responses from hundreds of his peers across the industry:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a 12 year old boy who dreamt of being in FaZe. That boy was me. Fast forward a decade, I am proud for not only reaching that dream, but also creating history within it. </p>



<p>Today I am officially leaving FaZe to start another journey. It was an absolute joy and pleasure to represent this team alongside all the amazing people, who became like family to me. Memories for a lifetime, one of the best 3 years of my life. </p>



<p>No words will do justice to how much this meant for me and how special everything was, this was a decision I made against my heart and a part of me will always love this team and organisation. </p>



<p>Thank you.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In a relatively short time, ropz became one of Counter-Strike’s winningest players, racking up approximately $1.5 million in winnings since entering the scene in earnest with mousesports in 2017. His first big win was at the ESG Tour in Mykonos, Greece in 2017, where he netted a $120,000 prize with mousesports after defeating Team Liquid in a close GF.</p>



<p>Following that win, the player was instrumental in both mousesports and FaZe Clan’s success, storming to victory in the likes of:</p>



<ul>
<li>Intel Grand Slam</li>



<li>PGL Major Antwerp</li>



<li>IEM Cologne/Katowice</li>



<li>Thunderpick World Championship</li>



<li>ESL Pro League</li>



<li>CS Asia Championship</li>
</ul>



<p>Except for a BLAST Premier event, ropz has claimed almost every prize possible in the Counter-Strike space. He has ranked in the HLTV Top 20 Players seven times and has picked up half a dozen MVP awards for his efforts. </p>



<p>And it all began when ropz kickstarted a career as a Call of Duty content creator.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/2024-steam-awards-winners-revealed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>As 2024 came to a close, one final awards ceremony concluded – The 2024 Steam Awards, hosted by Valve. The community-picked winners were awarded their trophies after several days of voting, but for the most part, the awards handed out were mostly predictable.</p>



<p>For instance, Black Myth Wukong secured Game of the Year, after soaring to lofty heights and shattering player count records on the platform earlier this year. It couldn’t be Astro Bot, so why not have Black Myth Wukong pick up the prize?</p>



<p>Read on to see all the winners from The 2024 Steam Awards.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-the-winners-from-the-2024-steam-awards">All The Winners From The 2024 Steam Awards</h2>



<p>Here’s the full breakdown you’re looking for:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Game of the</strong> <strong>Year: </strong>Black Myth Wukong</li>



<li><strong>VR Game of the Year: </strong>Metro Awakening</li>



<li><strong>Labor of Love Award: </strong>Elden Ring</li>



<li><strong>Best Game on Steam Deck: </strong>God of War Ragnarok</li>



<li><strong>Better with Friends Award: </strong>Helldivers II</li>



<li><strong>Outstanding Visual Style: </strong>Silent Hill 2</li>



<li><strong>Most Innovative Gameplay: </strong>Liar’s Bar</li>



<li><strong>Best Game You Suck At Award: </strong>Black Myth Wukong</li>



<li><strong>Best Soundtrack: </strong>Red Dead Redemption</li>



<li><strong>Outstanding Story-Rich Game: </strong>Black Myth Wukong</li>



<li><strong>Sit Back and Relax Award: </strong>Farming Simulator 25</li>
</ul>



<p>Black Myth Wukong cleaned up at <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamawards/2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The 2024 Steam Awards</a>, continuing an award spree that was most recently fuelled by two wins at The Game Awards, hosted by Geoff Keighley early in December. It beat Space Marine II, STALKER 2, Balatro, and Helldivers II to the ultimate prize.</p>



<p>There were some deserving wins here, though. Metro Awakening winning the VR Game of the Year award is a solid shout – it might not be the ‘next game’ in the series that fans were hoping for, but as a standalone VR title, it’s nothing short of stellar and deeply authentic.</p>



<p>Elden Ring’s Labor of Love award was handed out mostly because of Shadow of the Erdtree, which was so popular upon release earlier this year that it became a contender for Game of the Year awards at The Game Awards (and other showcases). </p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption’s Best Soundtrack trophy seems strange when compared to the competition, but it’s a popularity vote at best. It wasn’t a good year for gaming OSTs, it looks like.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/russia-gaming-consoles-putin-cant-compete/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/russia%E2%80%99s-gaming-consoles-can%E2%80%99t-compete-with-xbox-and-playstation.1072095/</guid>

<p>Earlier this year, it was revealed that Putin had ordered Russian tech manufacturers to work on ‘homegrown’ gaming consoles. The goal is for the country to compete against PlayStation and Xbox in the home console stakes, but it seems that things aren’t going as planned. </p>



<p>In a recent update posted by Habr.com, it was stated that the ‘Skolkovo Foundation’, tasked with developing the core foundation of the consoles, is having some technical issues.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-something-truly-breakthrough">‘Something Truly Breakthrough’</h2>



<p>In a quote <a href="https://habr.com/en/news/869822/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">picked up by Habr.com</a> (and circulated by Tom’s Hardware), it was said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I hope that my colleagues will approach this task with full responsibility and come up with something truly breakthrough. After all, it is obvious to everyone: Elbrus processors are not yet at the stage of development that would ensure equal competition with PS5 and Xbox, which means that the solution must be non-standard.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This was a quote taken from Anton Gorelkin, the Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Information Policy. His reference to ‘Elbrus’ is a nod to a Russian-developed processor unit. The transparency of the statement confirms that the tech the country has created isn’t yet on par with the hardware created by Xbox and PlayStation.</p>



<p>The Elbrus processor has been pieced together by the Moscow Center of SPARC Technologies, but it’s not a patch on the hardware being created by the likes of Intel and AMD. </p>



<p>Gorelkin repeated the desire to create something sovereign, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/putin-russia-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">per Putin’s wishes</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This platform should primarily serve the goals of promoting and popularizing domestic video game products, expanding their audience beyond PCs and mobile gaming.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The most recent reports suggest that the Russians are working on two consoles, one a ‘not very powerful’ device and the other a cloud-based streaming-focused unit with a $45 price tag. In a first-look image published just days ago, it was revealed that the $45 unit features an Xbox-styled controller with a small remote and a USB dongle.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/27/12/2024/673f81ca9a79477d7dd76e72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">article by RBC.ru</a>, the goal of the hyper-cheap gaming solution was detailed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The MTS console will operate on the principle of cloud gaming on its own MTS Fog Play system — a platform for so-called foggy gaming. The system was originally designed to allow owners of “weak” computers to play games with high system requirements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In August, it was confirmed that Tango Gameworks had been ‘saved’ after being acquired by KRAFTON, the super-sized publisher behind games like PUBG, InZOI, and Dark and Darker. In a recent social media post, the Tango Gameworks team—which faced closure before being acquired—announced a small rebrand.</p>



<p>Tango Gameworks will henceforth be known as ‘Tango Gameworks Inc.’ under the KRAFTON banner.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-and-better-for-it">Back and Better For It</h2>



<p>When KRAFTON acquired Tango Gameworks, it was on a knife-edge after being shut down by Microsoft. KRAFTON swooped in at the final hour and saved Tango, securing the Hi-Fi Rush label (amongst others) and saving the studio from decimation at the hands of Microsoft.</p>



<p>Back then, the team at KRAFTON said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As part of this strategic agreement, KRAFTON intends to collaborate with Xbox and ZeniMax to ensure a smooth transition and maintain continuity at Tango Gameworks, allowing the talented team to continue developing the&nbsp;Hi-Fi Rush IP&nbsp;and explore future projects.</p>



<p>KRAFTON intends to support the Tango Gameworks team to continue its commitment to innovation and delivering fresh and exciting experiences for fans.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>On social media, the team posted:</p>











<p>This was the team’s first post on social media since announcing the firm’s shutdown in May 2024.</p>



<p>It’s not yet known what the team at Tango Gameworks Inc. will focus on next, but IPs like Ghostwire Tokyo and The Evil Within were previously created by the studio. </p>

<p>PS Plus Premium in 2025 should be another year of classic titles in an ever-growing library. Month by month the Premium tier becomes more tantalizing, and I’ve picked out some of the best games you definitely to try out in 2025. </p>



<p>I’ve gone through periods of being subscribed to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps-plus-24-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS Plus</a> Premium, then downgrading my subscription, and eventually coming back to try many new games I’ve missed. Sony’s most expensive tier in the three-tiered PS Plus model isn’t for everyone, I get it. If you have a proclivity to game and miss the classics—or want to try out titles from yesteryear—Premium was born for this.</p>



<p>Narrowing this down to seven was difficult. I could probably come up with a second new list of recommendations, but these might be the best of the best. I’ve factored in variety, impact on gaming, and personal bias: You should find <em>plenty </em>to love.</p>



<h2 id="h-7-ps-plus-premium-games-to-play-in-2025">7 PS Plus Premium Games to Play in 2025</h2>



<p>The volatility of PS Plus Premium’s catalog does mean this list isn’t stable. Therefore, I encourage you to download these games and play them as quickly. <strong>Games are removed from the service regularly</strong>, and it isn’t a one-way influx of new titles. Check our list, read it twice, and find out which ones are naughty and nice—only joking, they’re all nice.</p>



<h3 id="h-ape-escape">Ape Escape</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Timeless. Credit to IDGB.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>Did you know 1999’s <strong>Ape Escape was the first software to require a DualShock controller</strong>? It’s a regurgitated fact, but one I find fascinating to this day. The accessory was mandatory to tame the madness of monkeys. 2024’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro Bot</a> celebrated Ape Escape by dedicating a full level to the classic franchise, and the OG title has aged quite well. It’s still funny, possesses charm, and will keep you entertained for a few hours. </p>



<h3 id="h-dark-chronicle-dark-cloud-2">Dark Chronicle / Dark Cloud 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t sleep on this. Credit to IDGB.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>The confusion on my face was palpable as I opened this as a gift on Christmas Day nearly twenty years ago. Yet, it became one of my favorite gifts as I sank countless hours into the surprising JRPG. Known as Dark Cloud 2 in America and Dark Chronicle elsewhere, Level-5’s release switches between two main characters and features a blend of dungeon-dwelling combat and city-building mechanics. It’s unique and still has cool ideas seldom seen in modern JRPGs.</p>



<h3 id="h-dino-crisis">Dino Crisis</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Just no. Credit to IDGB.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>Capcom decided to see what happens if you take classic <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/capcom-confirm-new-resident-evil-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil</a>-style gameplay but swap zombies with dinosaurs. The result is a legendary survival-horror game fans have been begging to get the remake treatment for years. Like old-school Resi, the main character Regina has to survive, find supplies, and fight off enemies, but try not to become dinosaur chow. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/capcom-fans-dino-crisis-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dino Crisis fans are desperate for a new title</a>, but until this happens, play the original on PS Plus Premium.</p>



<h3 id="h-doom">DOOM</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Where it all began. Credit to IDGB.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>I joined the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-can-run-the-original-doom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM</a> train a bit later than most—thanks to 2012’s BFG Edition—and I’ve been hooked ever since. I get passionate talking about my love for DOOM. PS Plus Premium has the first releases—which would go on to define the first-person genre for the next 30-plus years—and almost every FPS game you’ve played has likely been influenced by DOOM’s badassery. The guns, the music, the demons, the levels; DOOM is in the GOAT category, and all journeys start somewhere.</p>



<h3 id="h-god-of-war-3-remastered">God of War 3 Remastered</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Kratos isn’t scared, I promise you. Credit to IDGB.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>My favorite God of War game turns on a dime. 2018’s reboot and 2022’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-receives-a-ps5-pro-enhanced-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ragnarok</a> are masterpieces in their own right, but there’s something about GOW 3 Remastered that hits differently. I understand recent GOW fans have probably never had the chance to experience the wonders of Kratos’ true origins. His heartbreaking and hellacious bloody and violent story culminates in a Greek tragedy of epic proportions in God of War 3. Do yourself a favor and play the whole trilogy, and you can appreciate the spectacle and grandeur that sets the scene for the “Dad of Boy” Norse deviation.</p>



<h3 id="h-jak-and-daxter-the-precursor-legacy">Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Platforming perfection. Credit to IDGB.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>This might be a hot take, but I feel <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-jak-and-daxter-movie-is-planned-at-sony-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jak and Daxter</a> died after its first release. Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy is one of the games I’ve fully completed the most times. Naughty Dog’s first crack at something other than Crash Bandicoot results in one of gaming’s memorable double acts. Jak is a mute but strong protagonist, and Daxter, is a scene-stealing, anything-but-silent Ottsel. The Precursor Legacy elevated the 3D platformer genre to new heights on the PS2 and is the franchise’s highlight—before it takes a literal dark turn in Jak 2.</p>



<h3 id="h-phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-trilogy">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy</h3>



<figure><figcaption>You feel like a lawyer. Credit to IDGB.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>HOLD IT! You don’t think this entry deserves to be on the list? OBJECTION! I think it does, so TAKE THAT! Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy is about the finest example of the PS Plus Premium package I can think of. I’d never in my life stopped for a second to think about the Phoenix Wright series and one day, cycling through Premium’s offerings, I saw the trilogy. I gambled, downloaded it, and 30 hours later, myself and my fiancé couldn’t get enough. Its interactive storytelling hybrid is utterly gripping—as is every case—and it’s great to see how the mechanics innovate and are reinvented with each sequel.</p>



<h3 id="h-syphon-filter">Syphon Filter</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Ahead of its time. Credit to IDGB.com</figcaption></figure>



<p>Had Konami’s Metal Gear Solid 1 not come out a year earlier, I think the first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-syphon-filter-teaser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Syphon Filter</a> would’ve received more attention and love—not that it hasn’t already. Syphon Filter’s blend of espionage action and well-designed levels mesh seamlessly. Its “Danger” system, use of gadgets, and varied mission parameters ensure Syphon Filter is another release well ahead of its time—it simply can’t compete with MGS1’s story. Nevertheless, Syphon Filter—and its main two sequels—are on PS Plus Premium, with trophies, and there’s a reason they were symbolic of the PS1 era.</p>

		<p>Happy New Year!</p>
<p>We’ve made it once more around the Sun, putting 2024 behind us and looking forward to a 2025 that’s full of hope, optimism and brightness… OK, so this coming year (and the next four years, truth be told) are sure to instil a lot of fear and trepidation in a lot of people around the world, but if the real world is looking to be rather doomy and gloomy, at least we have games to look forward to. There’s even a new Doom!</p>
<p>On the gaming front, 2024 was a year with a lot of highs and lows. Perhaps more than any other year, this past twelve months were stacked with remakes and remasters, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/14/silent-hill-2-2024-review/">Silent Hill 2</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/30/persona-3-reload-review/">Persona 3 Reload</a> really standing &nbsp;out as being the equal of new big budget games. And what games those were, as well? <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/14/helldivers-2-review/">Helldivers 2</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/29/palworld-december-update-new-island/">Palworld</a> made the start of the year about silly co-op action, the end of the year was really all about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">Astro Bot</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/metaphor-refantazio-review/">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, and a great Call of Duty in the form of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review/">Black Ops 6</a>, and it was all capped – Fedora’d? – off by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.</p>

<p>However, there’s been a lot of change across the industry this year. Ignominious flops in the form of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/05/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review/">Suicide Squad</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/concord-review-a-fun-frenetic-hero-shooter/">Concord</a> – the latter failing so badly that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/29/sony-permanently-shuts-down-concord-and-developer-firewalk-studios/">Sony delisted the game and shut down the debutant studio</a> – made the risks of big budget game development and the expectations of live service games more apparent than ever. Meanwhile, major companies continued to make layoffs and shut down studios including Microsoft shuttering <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-closed-by-microsoft/">Arkane Austin and Tango Gameworks</a> (the latter <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/12/tango-gameworks-is-back-as-krafton-revives-hi-fi-rush-studio/">rescued a few months later by Krafton</a>) and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-closed-by-microsoft/">Arkane Austin</a>, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/04/ubisoft-is-shutting-down-xdefiant-now-delisted-after-just-half-a-year/">closing down XDefiant</a>, Meta closing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/08/meta-is-shutting-down-lone-echo-the-order-1886-developer-ready-at-dawn/">Ready at Dawn</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/27/mass-layoffs-hit-sony-interactive-entertainment-london-studio-shutting-down-naughty-dog-insomniac-also-affected/">London Studio closing</a>, and more.</p>

<p>It’s really saying something when one of the standout moments of The Game Awards wasn’t a GOTY acceptance speech or glitzy new trailer, but rather the highlighting of the work of Amir Satvat, setting up a community for the thousands affected by the mass layoffs.&nbsp;We really hope to see this downward trend turned around in the next year or two.</p>
<p>2025 looks to be a huge year for games, which ought to help a little. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-is-coming-this-fiscal-year-but-not-at-nintendo-direct-in-june/">Nintendo will finally announce and presumably release the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, there’s big upcoming games such as Ghost of Yotei, Doom: The Dark Ages, Civilization VII, Death Stranding 2 and, of course, Grand Theft Auto 6, and we’ll be here to cover them all as best we can.</p>

<p>And with that, it’s just left to me to wish you once again a very Happy New Year from the entire TSA team, to thank you for visiting our humble gaming site through the year, and to say we hope you’ll continue to join us for all your gaming news and reviews in 2025!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-dragons-pinball-game-announced-by-wizards-of-coast<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> pinball machine is coming next year. Wizards of the Coast is extending the world's most popular fantasy TTRPG into the realm of old-school time wasters thanks to a deal with Stern Pinball.</p>

<h2>The Dungeons &amp; Dragons Pinball Machine Announcement</h2>

<p>The official <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> account announced the Dungeons &amp; Dragons pinball machine via a <a href="https://x.com/Wizards_DnD/status/1874138499051298872?t" rel="nofollow">social media post</a> on X (formerly Twitter).</p>

<p>The post contained little detail. It was a collection of eyeball emojis followed by a thirty-second teaser trailer. The trailer was barebones, showing illustrations of a dungeon, a battle map, a d20 being rolled, and a blink and you'll miss it face of a red dragon. The name of the pinball machine, <em>The Tyrant's Eye</em>, alongside this imagery strongly implies the machine will involve toppling a red dragon tyrant.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeons-dragons-pinball-red-dragon.jpg?itok=QqScYe9j 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeons-dragons-pinball-red-dragon.jpg?itok=PJZ1FIXU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The official Stern Pinball <a href="https://sternpinball.com/game/dungeons-dragons/" rel="nofollow">website</a> does contain a bit more information. First, there is a limited supply of these pinball machines. Second, the machines will only be shipping to the mainland United States. Sorry, EU and UK fans. Third, purchases of these pinball machines will only be available to All-Access Stern Insider members.</p>

<p>As for the price for one of these maines? The Pro and Premium editions of the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> pinball machines will be sold at an MSRP of $6,999. Furthermore, there is a Limited Edition machine available for $12,999.</p>

<p>This does beg the question as to what these pinball machines contain. What novelty will they bring to the game of pinball? Will certain creatures and characters be showcased like the conniving Xanathar or the magnficent Mordenkainen? Those details will be revealed by Stern on January 3.</p>

<p>The release of a Dungeons &amp; Dragons pinball machine is a natural extension of the game's growing popularity. One that has surged thanks to the rise of actual plays like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-10-year-anniversary-live-show-announced-includes-fjord-and-jester" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Critical Role</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dropout-announces-vod-dates-for-their-actual-play-live-show-dimension20-time-quangle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dimension 20</em></a> alongside the critical and commercial success of Larian Studios' <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Earth Defense Force 6 is the pinnacle of a series that many people view as being a fairly mindless shooter. Despite that, it also has the best use and interpretation of time travel of any game I've played. It does that without leveraging new-fangled fancy graphics, instead relying on quality storytelling and some very cool meta decisions that change up the usual “just pick the next mission” grind that’s present in these games. EDF 6 uses all of these things to great effect, and it makes the time-travel concept almost feel believable.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Earth Defense Force 6 spoilers follow.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The fact that time travel is ingrained into basically every aspect of the story means that, while it's not as visually striking as the time travel offered in something like Dishonored or Titanfall, it's more engrossing. The way it's interwoven into the mechanics as well makes for an incredibly novel take on the concept I’ve not seen before, especially when it ends with somehow being more over-the-top than killing a god.</p><h3 dir="ltr">The Future Is Filled With Bugs</h3><p dir="ltr">EDF 6 kicks off a few years after the end of EDF 5, when the Primers wiped out the majority of humanity. Despite the fact that you manage to kill what might be a god, humans still have to escape underground to try to survive against the alien menace.</p><p dir="ltr">The result is that, at the start of EDF 6, you shoot a bunch of giant frogs with guns. You shoot them with guns, but they also have guns--you follow? These are older versions of the same foes from EDF 5, but they don't move like they want to fight: They move like they're sick of this never-ending war. Nevertheless, you fight them off, and after a few levels, see a brand-new ship that opens up a strange portal.</p><p dir="ltr">You then watch a bunch of other new ships go into the portal with no idea of what's going on. You find a weak spot on this strange vessel, and after shooting it, everything fades to white, as you get welcomed to EDF 6. This is where you're booted back to levels from EDF 5, and boy howdy, is that wild.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416859-edf-6-alien-head-ship.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416859" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416859-edf-6-alien-head-ship.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416859"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416859-edf-6-alien-head-ship.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Another One</h3><p dir="ltr">You eventually find yourself in the future once more, but things are a bit different. Terraformers darken the skyline, and new enemy types have appeared, but how can this be possible if this is just a loop? Well, guess what: You fight for a bit, find the same portal ship, destroy it, and are welcomed to EDF 7. This loop continues until you hit EDF 9.</p><p dir="ltr">It sounds like that should be arduous, but each time, EDF throws a new load of missions at you, with some being brand new, and some being slight tweaks on missions from EDF 5, but with subtle changes to allude to the time-travel storyline. The missions you tend to actually replay-- the futuristic ones--also come with small tweaks. Sometimes that's new enemies, and sometimes it's something in the background. Most importantly, though, you and the one scientist who knows what's going on are always aware of these loops, and you're learning, too.</p><p dir="ltr">Through repetition and study, the scientist concludes that time travel is happening and convinces the world of this fact. How do you fight against a foe that can keep traveling back in time and, more importantly, one who can keep upgrading their tech as well? This isn't a loop; it's an endless spiral of an arms race where neither side can actually win. How did this begin anyway?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416860-edf-6-big-ship.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416860" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416860-edf-6-big-ship.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416860"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416860-edf-6-big-ship.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Time Travel Is The New Meta</h3><p dir="ltr">This segment covers the first 132 levels, which are, thankfully, far better-paced than that of any other game in the series, and all of them contribute to the strange feeling you and the characters will have about the whole time-travel aspect. This is where EDF 6 does something truly incredible: It temporarily stops giving you new levels.</p><p dir="ltr">Well, that's what it looks like, anyway.</p><p dir="ltr">EDF 6 has six mystery missions marked with ??? in your missions list for you to stumble upon as you're trying to figure out what's happening. Each of these represents a key victory that you haven't managed in any timeline. Maybe you rescue someone who's always died otherwise; maybe you find a way to destroy a specific ship earlier than usual. Once you've completed them all, you get to the final version of the future, and that's where the concept goes from well-done to awe-inspiring.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416861-edf6-boss-dying.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416861" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416861-edf6-boss-dying.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416861"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416861-edf6-boss-dying.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">The End Is The Beginning</h3><p dir="ltr">The first major event in this final future is that you once again find the portal ship, but upon destroying the control unit this time, the ship itself isn’t destroyed. You aren't hurled back through time, either. Instead, the portal remains open, and enormous tentacles and turrets start to come out of it to kill you and the remainder of the EDF. Things are different this time, but you find two new weaknesses on this ship and destroy it. The war is won, yay! Well, no.</p><p dir="ltr">An entirely new portal opens above you, and an enormous flying metal dragon emerges. It's hard to describe just how large this thing is, but fighting it involves consistently leading your shots because the sheer scale of your foe makes it hard to target. The game states it's over 1km in length, and it feels it. It turns out this is the newly upgraded version of the portal ship, but one from several centuries in the future, because the Primers you're fighting have all the time in the world to keep upgrading their tech and sending it back.</p><p dir="ltr">After a long fight, you seemingly destroy this ship, only to see that the head of it has been replaced by the final boss from EDF 5: a godlike being with the power to alter reality and create life from nothing. As you continue to fight, you learn that the EDF has discovered these aliens come from Mars. They launch a rocket at the planet to try to destroy them at their source--the present--even though you're fighting a version of them from the future. You can't read that and tell me it's anything less than incredible, and it gets better.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416862-edf6-time-travel.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416862" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416862-edf6-time-travel.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4416862"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4416862-edf6-time-travel.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr">Timey-Wimey, But With Ants And Gods</h3><p dir="ltr">It turns out that the Primers started attacking Earth because of this missile, but you only ever sent this missile because they attacked Earth. This, dear readers, is a paradox, and that's not great for any timeline. Gameplay-wise, you just keep fighting until you've won, but the way the game justifies this confusing loop is far cooler.</p><p dir="ltr">The scientist explains that this paradox has to be righted, because if it exists, then all timelines might collapse. The paradox will, as a result, simply choose a victor. Your aim is to weaken the Primers and their god to the point where they are the logical choice as the loser, and as you keep fighting, you eventually tip the scales out of balance and into the favor of humanity. The timeline erases the Primers entirely.</p><p dir="ltr">Earth still suffered losses, but now, society gets to prosper with tech that's been through multiple timelines and create a proper utopia. Why isn't all of that removed from reality entirely? I've no idea, but there's simply no other game that makes time travel feel as much a part of its DNA as the actual gameplay. Earth Defense Force 6 one-ups killing a god by having you kill a time paradox, and that's metal as all hell.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

<p>That concludes the 2024 Steam Awards, and these are all of the winners across each category. It's no surprise that Black Myth: Wukong has swept up a ton of awards, especially considering how well they've done for themselves in every other ceremony despite being a widely controversial game.</p>
<p>There are some surprising winners on this list, with games like Red Dead Redemption taking the best soundtrack when games such as Silent Hill 2 and Horizon Forbidden West were competitors in that category. However, Silent Hill 2 did net one award for the best visual style.</p>
<p>Despite the popularity of Balatro and the fact that the game was nominated in multiple categories, it didn't win any awards at this particular ceremony. However, it has been successful in other ceremonies, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/all-winners-at-the-game-awards-2024-astro-bot-game-of-the-year/">The Game Awards</a>, where it picked up a couple of awards and was even nominated for Game of the Year.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this year's winners of the Steam Awards 2024?</p>

<p>The next 12 months are shaping up to be some of the best for Microsoft and the Xbox Series X|S systems since they launched in 2020. While there have been some great games over the last four years — Forza Horizon 5 and STALKER 2, just to name a couple —  for the latest Microsoft consoles, it’s been a bit hit or miss for the most part of this generation. In 2025, that appears to be changing. So, let’s look at the biggest Xbox games expected to release in 2025.</p>



<p>Whether it’s an Xbox exclusive or an anticipated multiplatform title, there’s no shortage of games coming that will leave you wondering how you are going to find the time (and money) for everything.</p>



<h6>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-playstation-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8 Biggest PlayStation Games Coming in 2025</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-biggest-xbox-exclusives-of-2025">Biggest Xbox Exclusives Of 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-avowed">Avowed</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Avowed is the upcoming first-person RPG developed by Obsidian Entertainment, set in the high-fantasy world of Eora, the same universe Pillars of Eternity. The game was originally scheduled to release in October 2024, but was pushed to February 18, 2025 by Xbox Game Studios in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-delay-wasnt-due-to-game-quality-phil-spencer-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">order to let the game breath</a> more rather than releasing it so close to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. </p>



<p>The game will feel familiar to fans of Skyrim and other fantasy RPGs, with various abilities and skills to help you experience the world how you like. For those concerned about the game being first-person, fear not. Avowed will have the option to play in third person. It will also be available day one on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.</p>



<h3 id="h-south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>From the developers of We Happy Few and Contrast, South of Midnight takes players to the deep south of the United States. The game sees you play Hazel who becomes a Weaver after a storm hits her home of Prospero. According to Compulsion Games, a Weaver is a “magical  mender of broken bonds and spirits”. </p>



<p>“Imbued with these new abilities, Hazel will confront and subdue dangerous creatures, untangle the webs of her own family’s shared past and -if she’s lucky – find her way to a place that feels like home,”  the game’s description reads.</p>



<p>No release date has been announced, but the game is planned to release in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-fable">Fable</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Officially announced in 2020, Fable has been in development for nearly a decade. Not only is it the fourth main installment of the series, but it’s also serving as a reboot for the franchise.</p>



<p>Developer Playground Games has released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEQRwpMYPaw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a couple trailers</a> for the game so far, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FiBmVBaY0g&amp;t=6s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">each more promising</a> than the last. The game also features Richard Ayoade as a giant who doesn’t seem too fond of the main character, or heroes in general.</p>



<p>Fable is scheduled for 2025 — rumors <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/latest-on-fables-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have it scheduled for late 2025</a> — and will be available on day one on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.</p>



<h3 id="h-gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War: E-Day</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>A prequel set 14 years before the original game, Gears of War: E-Day centers around young versions of Marcus Fenix and Dom Santiago. The game’s story — that we know so far — has players deal with the locust horde during Emergence Day. Not much else is known about the game’s features, but that should be coming over the coming months.</p>



<p>Gears of War: E-Day hasn’t been confirmed for a 2025 release, but <a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/1801291340569071619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the latest rumors</a> are pointing to the possibility. This is one Xbox exclusive, however, that could be come in 2026 instead.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-xbox-games-of-2025">Biggest Xbox Games Of 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-grand-theft-auto-gta-6">Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 6</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Did you think this would be a list of biggest games and not include GTA 6? The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-is-the-insider-gaming-communitys-most-anticipated-game-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most anticipated game of the year</a> — and likely the last decade or more — GTA 6 is currently planned for a 2025 despite countless rumors of an eventual delay to 2026.</p>



<p>It’s been nearly 12 years since the last game in the series was released, and, based on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-trailer-world-record-broken/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal trailer alone</a>, GTA 6 could go down as the biggest launch in video game history. The anticipation for the game isn’t just with fans, either. Even those in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-power-launch-date-competing-publishers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">industry are making decisions</a> about their releases around what Rockstar decides to do</p>



<h3 id="h-doom-the-dark-ages">DOOM: The Dark Ages</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">First revealed by Insider Gaming</a>, DOOM: The Dark Ages is a prequel to 2016’s DOOM. A single-player game, DOOM: The Dark Ages “tells the epic cinematic origin story of the DOOM Slayer’s rage.” According to developer id Software, the game sees you control DOOM Slayer as he tries to protect a kingdom against the demons from Hell.</p>



<p>Not much else is known about the game at the moment, but that should be coming over the next few months. And for those on PlayStation 5 who were worried about not getting the next DOOM game, it should be noted that the game will launch on PS5 the same day.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Another game from Obsidian Entertainment coming in 2025, The Outer Worlds 2 was first announced at E3 2021. At the time, the developers bluntly stated that there was nothing else ready to be shown to players. Three years later, and fans got a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer at The Game Awards 2024</a> along with a confirmed 2025 release window.</p>



<p>The game took “three times longer to make” and will be at least “two times bigger” according to the fun gameplay reveal trailer. Like the first, The Outer Worlds 2 will be a first-person RPG that takes players to the new Arcadia colony where a factional war has broken out that you have to navigate. In addition to launching on Xbox, the game will be available on PS5 and Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<h3 id="h-borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>By the time it launches in 2025, it’ll have been six years since Borderlands 3 was released. While fans have gotten Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands and New Tales from the Borderlands in between, it still felt like something was missing. With Borderlands 4, players will explore a brand new location with four new vault hunters along with a cast of returning characters.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-borderlands-4-trailer-first-look-at-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first look at gameplay</a> was shown at The Game Awards 2024 that should quench the thirst for Borderlands content until Gearbox starts giving more deep dives into the game. One thing to expect is less <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-humor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“toilet humor”</a> this time around, according to one of the game’s developers. Borderlands 4 is set to release in 2025, and Take-Two has already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-and-borderlands-4-will-not-release-close-to-each-other/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said that it won’t release</a> around GTA 6.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-generative-ai<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>creator Ken Levine has expressed skepticism regarding generative AI, admitting its usefulness for technical tasks but doubting its ability to "tell [him] a really compelling story".</p>

<p>In a new interview with GamesIndustry.biz, Levine is asked for his opinions on generative AI and its "capability to react to players". Levine says he doesn't want to "underestimate" the technology, but that its biggest limitation right now is "persistence".</p>

<p>He gives the example of ChatGPT's video generator Sora, which he says is capable of generating a "beautiful" street scene featuring a woman walking down the street. However, if that woman were to "turn around and walk backwards", Sora wouldn't "remember where she has been".</p>

<p>Despite that, Levine acknowledges that generative AI has its uses. He says that it's useful for "training your bug database to query how many bugs you have in certain situations", for instance, or "clearing [the&nbsp;<em>Judas&nbsp;</em>dev team's] analytics database".</p>

<p>However, he hasn't used it for concept art, largely "because there's some legal issues" around how generative AI sources its images. In case you're not aware, generative AI <a href="https://hbr.org/2023/04/generative-ai-has-an-intellectual-property-problem" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">can often use art without crediting the original artists</a> when generating content.</p>

<p>The full GI.biz <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-future-of-storytelling-with-ken-levine" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> is well worth reading, especially if you're interested in keeping up with Levine's work on&nbsp;<em>Judas</em>. He discusses everything from the game's approach to player choice all the way through to his work on&nbsp;<em>BioShock</em>.</p>




<p>Levine isn't the only person in the industry to express skepticism when it comes to gen AI. Back in July, Nintendo <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-generative-ai-no-plans" rel="nofollow">declared that it had no plans</a> to use the tech in its games, acknowledging similar IP rights issues to Levine.</p>

<p>However, that hasn't stopped companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp" rel="nofollow">Netflix</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-working-hard-on-using-ai-to-make-npc-and-worlds-more-alive-reactive-and" rel="nofollow">Ubisoft</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-ceo-pledges-to-be-aggressive-in-applying-ai-and-cutting-edge-tech-to" rel="nofollow">Square Enix</a>&nbsp;from going all in on generative AI. It looks like this is a debate that isn't going away anytime soon.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-swimming-in-naiad-is-so-good.1071858/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/naiad-indie-game-review-steam-switch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The swimming in recent indie game <a href="https://www.hiwarp.com/naiad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Naiad</em></a> absolutely rules, which is good because you do a lot of it. You play as a water nymph who drifts around doing little nature tasks in the fringes of the human world, exploring the interplay between the environment and the creatures in it. It’s not quite as chill a game as that setup would suggest, but the visuals and swimming mostly make up for it.&nbsp;</p><p>I really cannot say enough good things about the swimming. Made by a solo developer, the basic task of <em>Naiad</em> is to guide your character through rivers, lakes, streams, pipes, and other bodies of beautifully-rendered water to move through its levels. You can dive and rush short distances, or sing to attract schools of fish to follow you on your journey. Basking in pools of sunlight makes your character “grow up,” getting bigger and gaining new abilities to help on her journey. The movement feels exactly as floaty and pleasantly imprecise as being a water-based creature would, and it feels wonderful to find your own path along a river that follows its own path through the landscape. The game shows the world from a top-down perspective, and each area is full of gorgeous vegetation and rocks and light. It’s a lovely game to look at and be in, as you can tell from its trailer:&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Naiad - Extended Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2a79VL-PQNo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Story-wise, there’s a twee cloud who guides you, and also a swirling black mass that threatens you. There’s also a lot of humans, who do all sorts of bad human things: chop down trees, pollute, crash their cars, argue. Sometimes you stop the humans by scaring them off or interfering with their tasks, but other times you help them by assisting them in building bridges or finding their boat oars. <em>Naiad</em> mostly seems to want to tell a very basic, heavy-handed story of “people bad,” so this fuzzy relationship between your naiad and the humans can feel a little unclear at times.</p><p>I had way more fun with tasks that ignored humans altogether. Most levels have baby ducks you can reunite with their mother, and I spent entirely too long herding distractable ducks around. There are also some frogs you can compel to lily pads, but I would recommend avoiding this unless you want to be driven mad; the frogs want to go everywhere <em>but</em> where you so obviously want them to go, and while I appreciated their rebelliousness, it wasn’t always the fun kind of annoying to try to steer them.&nbsp;</p><p>In between all of this is some puzzle solving, which is where <em>Naiad </em>starts to go a little bit off the rails. The game starts with basic navigation puzzles, simple enough to fit its chill vibe, but they soon become inconsistent and a bit illogical. Why does zipping through these flowers–sometimes in order, sometimes backwards–sometimes break rocks? Why does breaking this human’s vehicle cause a gate to open, when other gates are opened by compelling humans to open them? It’s not always clear why an action leads to a particular consequence, nor where the solution to a puzzle can be found, which means I did a lot of swimming around the edges of levels looking for secret passages, or singing at various objects or creatures to see if anything would happen. This could be particularly frustrating in levels that were large bodies of water instead of narrow streams, where the top-down perspective made it difficult to know where I was supposed to go or if I’d been to an area already. A game where you just move from the top of the screen to the bottom might be too simple, but it feels <em>so good</em> to just do that that other activities sometimes felt clumsy in comparison.&nbsp;</p><p>But the thing that frustrated me the most about <em>Naiad</em> was how long it spent telling me its story was about to end and then not ending. The ominous black swirl starts off sowing doubt in you, in comparison to the cloud’s gentle encouragement, and as the game goes on it keeps warning you that the end is near. But then the game would continue, and the gameplay felt mostly the same, until I felt a mismatch between what the narrative was telling me and what was actually happening. I started feeling impatient for the game to be over–not always because I wasn’t enjoying it, but because it kept hyping up an end that kept not coming. The actual end game is drawn out so long that it almost felt comical; I kept popping into Aftermath’s Slack to express my frustration, but I thought I was so close to the end that I didn’t want to just quit out.</p><p>Some of this is in service of the larger narrative <em>Naiad</em> wants to tell about the cycle of life; when the credits told me it was made in memory of the creator’s grandparents I felt like a monster for yelling “Why aren’t you over?!” at it so frequently. When I’m playing a game for work, I always try to stay aware that my circumstances are different than the average person’s; something might feel too long to me because I’ve been playing a game more than I otherwise would, or because I’m on a deadline. In <em>Naiad</em>’s case, where there was no deadline or requirement, my play session stretched out because the game kept telling me I was close to finishing it and I wanted to see what would happen. It’s not a long game, but it feels like it could have been much shorter.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite how negative this all sounds, the look and feel of <em>Naiad</em> is so good that it mostly trumps the rest of my frustrations. It is a simply beautiful game that feels great to navigate, and the first half is wonderfully chill and peaceful. If you take more breaks than I did, its pacing problems might not frustrate you as much. It might be best as a game to play a handful of levels or a chapter in a go, taking time to revel in all the lovely things about it and swimming around with the fish. (Not the frogs, though. Screw the frogs.)</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-rivals-remains-one-of-top-played-games-across-3-platforms-in-us-sonic-frontiers-gets-resurgence.1071843/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-remains-one-of-top-played-games-across-3-platforms-in-us-sonic-frontiers-gets-resurgence/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>New information from the latest Circana report, as posted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lejpf37m3k2k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mat Piscatella on social media</a>, shows that Marvel Rivals is still taking top spots across multiple platforms. This is the hit new hero shooter, where players can pick a number of Marvel characters to play and battle against others in teams. On <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-path-of-exile-2-and-marvel-rivals-all-broke-records-this-weekend/">Steam</a>, Marvel Rivals is in the 1st position and has retained that position for at least a week now. On both Xbox Series and PlayStation 5, the game takes the third spot. It's worth noting that the data for these games only pertains to the US. It isn't too surprising that Marvel Rivals is continuing to be highly successful, with Call of Duty taking the top spot for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series.</p>
<p>Most surprisingly, Project Zomboid has shot up the rankings again on Steam and has entered the top 15 on Steam. It takes the 11th spot on Steam after previously being ranked 48 last week. While there doesn't seem to be an ultimately strong cause as to why this has happened, it's possible that it was due to the update that they released for the game on December 17. However, it's an unstable build that only people who opt-in to play them can access, and it's expected that there will be bugs and issues along with the new content. This title has been in Early Access since 2013, and even now, the game is still in Early Access despite receiving a plethora of updates, making it uncertain as to whether this game will ever fully launch.</p>
<p>Another game that has seen a resurgence is Sonic Frontiers. What was a well-received game in 2022 has now ended up taking the 14th spot in the PlayStation 5 rankings. This is due to the game being added to the PS+ catalog, allowing those who are subscribers to get the game for free to keep it until they are no longer subscribed. Other titles such as Jurassic World Evolution 2, Coffee Talk, Aliens: Dark Descent, and Temtem were all added to December's catalog, providing a wide variety for those who are PS Plus members and those who have access to PS Plus Premium and Extra.</p>
<p>Among these titles are games such as Fortnite, Helldivers 2, and Roblox, which doesn't come as a surprise to anyone. These games have been popular throughout the year and have been mainstays for audiences across the globe.</p>
<p>On Steam specifically, Path of Exile 2 has dropped by one ranking and is now down to the 3rd position. While this game has proven to be popular since entering Early Access, they have lately been experiencing an issue where <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-in-security-crisis-after-hackers-raid-players-accounts-stealing-valuables/">accounts are being compromised</a>, and users are losing out on their valuable items, with Grinding Gear Games making no promise to return them.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sifu-epic-games-store-free</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sifu-is-free-on-the-epic-games-store-right-now.1071840/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sifu-epic-games-store-free<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has revealed the next free game that you can download and keep right now on its store, and it's perfect for fans of martial arts-based action brawlers, although its relentless difficulty might take some getting used to.</p>

<p>That's right: your next <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/sifu" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">free Epic Games Store game</a> is Sloclap's&nbsp;<em>Sifu</em>, which was actually an Epic Store exclusive on PC until <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/martial-arts-brawler-sifu-comes-to-steam-and-xbox-in-march" rel="nofollow">its release on Steam and Xbox</a>&nbsp;in March last year.</p>

<p><em>Sifu&nbsp;</em>is the latest in a string of free games Epic has been offering up on the Store for the last couple of weeks. It joins the likes of&nbsp;<em>Ghostrunner 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Control</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Hot Wheels Unleashed</em>, along with plenty of others (which you can no longer redeem, unfortunately).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sifu-epic-games-store-free-brawl.jpg?itok=koXWYtYX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sifu-epic-games-store-free-brawl.jpg?itok=Vk0fyERH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sifu&nbsp;</em>is free to keep right now on the Epic Games Store.</figcaption></figure><p>Since&nbsp;<em>Sifu&nbsp;</em>launched in February 2022, it's received <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/show-off-your-style-and-moves-in-sifu-free-summer-2022-update" rel="nofollow">a number of updates</a> bringing features like new game modes, extra modifiers, and more. If you played this one back at launch, it's worth giving it another shot, especially if you were into the core gameplay loop at the time.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Sifu</em>, it's a martial arts brawler in which you must battle your way through a series of dungeon-like environments in order to avenge your father.</p>

<p>The game's unique gimmick revolves around a magical talisman you wear; each time you die, you're resurrected, but you age a number of years, gaining attack power in return for a smaller health pool.</p>

<p><em>Sifu&nbsp;</em>adopts a structure that's not dissimilar to a roguelite; you can either press on with your current run or start again with the permanent upgrades you've already unlocked to give yourself a better chance of reaching the last boss while still young.</p>




<p><em>Sifu&nbsp;</em>isn't the only free game you can claim on PC right now, either. If you head on over to <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/vambrace_cold_soul" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>, you can grab yourself a copy of roguelite RPG&nbsp;<em>Vambrace: Cold Soul</em>, and you won't have to pay a penny.</p>

<p>Like&nbsp;<em>Sifu</em>,&nbsp;<em>Vambrace&nbsp;</em>has also benefited from a number of updates over the years, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vambrace-cold-soul-update-features-difficulty-tweaks" rel="nofollow">difficulty tweaks</a>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/devespresso-games-announces-new-game-and-more-changes-for-vambrace-cold-soul" rel="nofollow">New Game Plus mode</a>, and plenty more. Again, if you gave it a try at launch but put it down, you might want to pick it up again, especially since it won't cost you anything!</p>

<p>An area of development for two of Hideo Kojima’s upcoming games have been delayed. In a post on social media, Kojima said that both OD and Physint have been impacted by the current <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sag-aftra-strike-with-video-game-voice-and-performance-artists-to-continue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SAG-AFTRA strike</a>.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1873951232764895628" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">his post</a>, Kojima gave players an update on where things stand with his three main projects — Death Stranding 2, OD, and Physint. Regarding Death Stranding 2, he says that the team “started to play and build up the game” over the summer after working on music production, Japanese voice recording, and more. For the other two games, however, there have been hiccups. </p>



<p>First, with OD, Kojima says that game development continued along with actor and environment scanning. In the second half of the year, though, scanning and filming was suspended due to the strike. For Physint, casting was suspended because of the strike.</p>



<p>Kojima said that the hold is to resume next year. That’s as long as a deal reached, of course. The current <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-voice-and-performance-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-in-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SAG-AFTRA strike began in July</a> after 18 months of negotiations over AI protections for video game actors. As of publishing, there is no update on where the talks stand.</p>



<p>What do you think of the SAG-AFTRA strike leading to delays for Kojima’s OD and Physint? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1364/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/review/infinity-nikki-what-dreams-are-made-of/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			<div><header>Game Info</header><div><div>
						<h5>Infinity Nikki</h5><p><span>December 5, 2024</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>Android, iOS, PlayStation 5, PC</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Typically, I don't do gacha games. The way they work just doesn't gel with me, as I don't want to get sucked in and end up spending money on it, especially when there are tons of other games that I can play where I don't need to spend money to get ahead or be better in the game. Luckily, Infinity Nikki's gacha system is pretty fair compared to some of the others on the market right now. For the most part, there isn't a bad thing I can say about Infinity Nikki, as it is much like the games I used to play when I was younger and loved dress-up games. As an adult, this brings back many feelings of that childhood joy I experienced and allows me to get sucked into a cozy world full of whimsy and color.</p>
<p>To play this game on PC, you must download the independent launcher or play it via the Epic Games Store. I <span>chose to use the&nbsp;<a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">independent launcher</a> because I find that games launched through the Epic Games Store just don't run well at all for me, possibly because the launcher is not</span> optimized. Of course, the game is also available on PlayStation 5, Android, and iOS devices.</p>
<p>Although I knew that the former Director of Zelda, <a href="https://wccftech.com/infinity-nikki-announced-zelda-botw-designer-producing/">Kentaro Tominaga</a>, was working on Infinity Nikki, it still shocked me just how, like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, it was not just in the sense of the grand exploration, but also from the trials that you can undertake to get Whimstars. The aesthetic of the trials, in particular, is very reminiscent of those from Tears of the Kingdom, especially ones where you have to use your Purah Pad to be able to get from point A to point B.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-10-07-000539.png"></a></figure>

<p>The atmosphere and the aesthetic of the game is breathtaking. Even when you approach the first Warp Spire in the game, the location you get it at is so well decorated and bursting with vibrancy and realism. It's hard not to play Infinity Nikki and take a ton of pictures. Even if you aren't taking pictures of the costumes you unlock for Nikki, there is so much beauty in the surrounding world, especially once you start to progress through the story and discover new locations.</p>
<p>Even without doing the questing, I found myself getting lost in the expansive world, collecting materials that I could use later on to craft new dresses. I've always loved games where I can collect resources and hoard them, and Infinity Nikki allowed me to do just that. Every flower and herb was immediately pocketed, and I continued on my journey.</p>
<p>Ultimately, there wasn't much about Infinity Nikki that I&nbsp;<em>didn't</em> like. The game was magical and everything that younger me would have dreamed of. It definitely appealed to the inner child and allowed me to reminisce about days when I would play dress-up games online. Most controversially, the one character I didn't like was Nikki's sidekick, Momo. They were reminiscent of Paimon from Genshin Impact, and both have voices that I just don't like. Compared to Paimon, Momo was significantly more tolerable but still a touch annoying to listen to.</p>
<p>What surprised me most about Infinity Nikki was the game's performance. Admittedly, I do have a pretty powerful PC that I play it on, but when it comes to Unreal Engine 5 games, they don't have the best reputation for how they perform on PC specifically. For example, Silent Hill 2 was a game that ran terribly for me, even after many patches. However, Infinity Nikki felt like a breath of fresh air with how well it ran, even on Ultra settings. Once I got to the central city, the game was a little bit laggy, so I turned the settings down, and it improved significantly.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-10-07-181551.png"></a></figure>

<p>Florawish was a particularly great city to explore, and I loved being able to climb up buildings, stand on the peak, and look over the people and terrain below. There wasn't a single part of it that wasn't teeming with life and vibrancy, and it was the perfect game to slow down, stop, and smell the roses. There's a lot of exploration to do in Florawish alone, with there being hidden chests in nooks and crannies that you may not even spot unless you're traversing the rooftops. It was fun trying to find everything, and I'm sure even now, I've missed a ton of stuff.</p>
<p>Overall, Infinity Nikki is a fantastic experience and is well-optimized, considering it's made in Unreal Engine 5. I had a lot of fun with the game, and I can't wait to see what is added to it with new updates. My main issue is the fact that you can't change the key binds. As someone who is left-handed and suffers from dexterity issues in my hands, I find that using a controller becomes painful after a while. I would love the option to change the key binds to make the experience more comfortable and streamlined.</p>

				<p>Infinity Nikki is a fantastic game, and you can play it while avoiding most of the gacha elements. It's a great gacha game that doesn't require you to pay any money to it to be able to succeed. It's a game full of whimsy, wonder, and most importantly dressing up and being able to customize Nikki to your liking, depending on the outfits you collect.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dont-look-back-2nd-edition-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Everyone was dead. She was sure of it. The huge monster of a man wielding a machete had hacked Ranger Sandy to pieces right in front of her eyes, and she had been running for what felt like hours ever since. Even if they had survived, they wouldn't have left her. Would they? She had heard the car start, and she did wonder why the others had sent her a different way to the car. Maybe they would come back for her once they had found a safe place to hide? Hopefully, before that killer found her.</em></p>

<p>Welcome to <em>Don't Look Back 2nd Edition</em>! We covered the original <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dont-look-back-core-game-review" rel="nofollow">Don't Look Back</a></em> box set a few years ago, and recently we covered the awesome <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/hametsu-core-rulebook-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Hametsu</em></a>, also by Black Site Studios.</p>



<p><i>Don't Look Back </i>is a horror miniatures tabletop game that can be played cooperatively against an AI-controlled killer, or with the latest edition, a player can take control of the killer and try to slay their friends. The 1st edition of the game released in 2021, which you can read our review of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dont-look-back-core-game-review" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and the 2nd edition update is essentially the same, but with a lot more content in the rulebook.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dont-look-back-2nd-ed-2.jpg?itok=iQw3udLo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dont-look-back-2nd-ed-2.jpg?itok=6zXylbO6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Don't Look Back</em> captures the horror genre superbly with its mechanics [Photo credit: Black Site Studio].</figcaption></figure><h2>What Is The Difference Between The Don't Look Back 1st and 2nd Edition Rulebooks?</h2>

<p>The core rules for <em>Don't Look Back</em> are the same as they were in the 1st edition, with a focus on the layout and presentation of the rules to make them as clear as possible. What the 2nd Edition <em>Don't Look Back</em> core rulebook now contains is a lot more options and background, which includes:</p>

<ul><li>2 new characters (on top of the 6 original 1st edition)</li>
	<li>Rules for randomly generating your own plots&nbsp;(in addition to the five classic&nbsp;core plots)</li>
	<li>Optional rules for vehicles&nbsp;and companions</li>
	<li>Trilogies - Originally a separate book, the new rulebook includes these rules for creating a series of 3 linked games</li>
	<li>Final Call - The 2nd edition core rulebook includes rules for creating your own character, playing as the killer, and also running the game as a games master</li>
	<li>Pack Hunt - It also includes the rules for including multiple killers, and hordes of enemies in your games</li>
	<li>Large background section - The book includes a lot of background, maps, and images on North Wood to help you flesh out your games</li>
	<li>Two complete trilogies - It also includes 2 complete sets of 3 linked adventures, Visions and Corporate Casualties</li>

<p>The core rules for <i>Don't Look Back</i> are very simple, which is essential for a narrative and theme-driven game as it allows you to focus on what's going on, rather than flipping back and forth through a rulebook, ruining the immersion.</p>

<p>With each turn in <em>Don't Look Back</em>, fright tokens are generated to represent noises, shadows, and eerie effects. The killer can randomly appear from fight tokens, or they might just generate terror for nearby characters. When characters gain terror points, they increase the movement and combat skill of the killer targeting that character, and also reduce a character's rolls, making it more difficult to achieve tasks. If a character ever has double the amount of terror points of their fright value, they are removed from the game, succumbing to panic.</p>

<p>During the game, players need to complete the scenario objective while avoiding the killer and controlling the terror points on their character. Players do this each turn by working together to search areas and removing fright tokens by investigating and shining light tokens on them. They can also lure the killer to an area to allow other characters the freedom to search with the 7 Minutes in Heaven action with another consenting character, in a true horror trope.</p>

<p>As with all miniatures games, you will need a few items on top of the <i>Don't Look Back</i> core rulebook to play:</p>

<ul><li>Three types of dice (D20s, D10s and D6s)</li>
	<li>A measuring tool</li>
	<li>A 3x3 playing area with an assortment of terrain</li>
	<li>A miniature to represent The Killer</li>
	<li>A hero/character miniature for each player</li>
</ul><p><em>Don't Look Back</em> is a miniatures agnostic system, which means you can use any miniatures from any system you want to represent the killer and characters, but <a href="https://blacksitestudio.com/en-gb/pages/dlb" rel="nofollow">Black Site Studios</a> have a whole range of killers (and their rules) and character miniatures, along with scenery that's perfect for the North Wood setting.</p>

<p>We loved <i>Don't Look Back </i>1st edition, it's simple rules let you explore the theme very well without distracting, allowing full immersion. The mechanics complimented the theme perfectly, and nothing has changed in this edition, other than giving you a huge amount of content in a single book. Everything that made <em>Don't Look Back</em> great is still there, only now there's more of it. The added scenario generator, character generator, and ability to play as the killer, or run it with a GM make this an incredibly varied system with a huge amount of replayability, built of a simple set of core mechanics that get it done.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy Don't Look Back 2nd Edition?</h2>

<p>Even if you own the first edition of <em>Don't Look Back</em>, this updated rulebook has a huge amount of content, all between the same covers to stop you from carrying multiple books around. It's all presented better, with a great opening chapter on the setting and the North Wood area. If you're not a horror fan though, then you won't find much else in <em>Don't Look Back</em> as it's entirely built around the theme.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-od-physint-strikes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>and <i>Death Stranding&nbsp;</i>creator Hideo Kojima has provided a year-end update on his upcoming projects, currently codenamed&nbsp;<em>OD&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Physint</em>, and it sounds like SAG strikes heavily impacted both games.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1873951232764895628" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on social media platform X</a>, Kojima says that during 2024,&nbsp;his studio Kojima Productions "developed [<em>OD</em>] and had actor and environment scanning", but that during the second half of the year, "scanning and filming were suspended due to the SAG strike".</p>

<p>Of&nbsp;<em>Physint</em>, Kojima says that "casting was also suspended" for the game owing to the strike. It sounds like&nbsp;<em>Physint&nbsp;</em>is currently a lot earlier in development than&nbsp;<em>OD</em>, which makes sense given that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-new-game-od-in-partnership-with-xbox-and-filmmaker-jordan-peele" rel="nofollow">the latter has an official trailer</a> (albeit a brief one) and the former <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-next-generation-espionage-action-game" rel="nofollow">does not</a>.</p>

<p>The strike is technically still ongoing; at time of writing, <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike-the-game-awards-2024" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">no overarching agreement</a> has been reached, although a number of gaming companies have signed agreements with SAG in order to protect its members from generative AI exploitation.</p>

<p>Indeed, in Kojima's message, he says that he and his studio "hope to resume next year", which evidently means that the filming, capture, and casting processes haven't restarted for either&nbsp;<em>OD&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Physint</em>.</p>

<p>Kojima also recaps the rest of his year in the message, as well as providing an update on the upcoming live-action&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>film, which is being produced in conjunction with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-movie-a24" rel="nofollow">movie production company A24</a>. He says preparations for the movie, as well as "other adaptations", are underway.</p>

<p>Kojima's message also comes just under two months after the surprise Xbox release of the original&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em>, which also saw Kojima Productions <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-xbox-release-kojima-ip" rel="nofollow">acquiring the rights to the IP</a>.</p>
