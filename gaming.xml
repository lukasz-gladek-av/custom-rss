			<p>If you have been following us for some time, you are well aware of how much I like FromSoftware's Souls series. Despite having quite a few problems getting into the original Demon's Souls before it officially made its way to the West back in the PS3 days, once the game clicked, I came to appreciate the formula so much that I even enjoyed Dark Souls 2 with all of its well-known issues.</p>
<p>Having something of a fondness for clunky experiences that still manage to get some of their features right, I expected to enjoy <a href="https://lordsofthefallen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lords of the Fallen</a> by Hexworks far more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/">I actually did</a>. While the game wasn't bad by any means, there were too many issues in the launch version to make it anything more than a decent experience, though far too frustrating for my taste. I felt the developer completely misunderstood the idea of challenge that FromSoftware implements in its titles, going for unbalanced enemy configurations that, coupled with the frankly bad movesets of most weapons, made going through any area past the tutorial a pointless exercise in patience. For this reason, after clearing Lords of the Fallen, I never returned to it, as I felt that the bad definitely outweighed the good the game had.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lords-of-the-Fallen-1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Following the launch of the game, however, Hexworks showed some exemplary dedication to their game and has often updated Lords of the Fallen with new features and balance changes, culminating with the release of the 2.0 update <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-0-out-now-with-enhanced-combatmovement-and-free-friends-pass/">last week</a>, which massively improves the game in pretty much every way. For starters, the game is much more forgiving and better eases the player into the experience after completing the tutorial, which I felt, in the launch version, wasn't really representative of what awaited players in the real game. Some may find the game too easy now, but the presence of some modifiers allows players to ramp up the challenge level, providing an unprecedented level of flexibility for a Soulslike. I haven't played through the entire game yet, but the fact that I was not swarmed by three enemies or more while getting sniped by long-range fighters as soon as the proper journey begins has made me more willing to play through it again to experience its solid world design once again. The addition of Lamp Guidance, a new mechanic that guides players from one Vestige save point to another, is a very welcome touch that makes experiencing the game's world even more enjoyable and stress-free.</p>
<p>The 2.0 update also brought significant improvements to movement and combat, which ultimately make Lords of the Fallen a much better game. For starters, the Crusader is much more responsive, which, by itself, already makes combat more enjoyable against single enemies and even groups. Movesets have also been massively improved, with similar weapons also getting some differentiation between them that gives them a more distinct identity and provides more reasons for players to use them besides stats. The movesets overhaul also makes any combat maneuver considerably less floaty, so the massive positioning issues I experienced at launch are no longer present, though combat still feels a little unsatisfying, as movesets still lack weight, animations are stiff, and sound effects continue to sound a little too thin for my tastes.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Lords-of-the-Fallen-2-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The new Lords of the Fallen update also goes a long way in improving the co-op experience with some very welcome tweaks. Shared co-op progression is a game changer, allowing players to seamlessly enjoy the entire game together, something that FromSoftware titles do not offer, and is only available on PC via mods. The Free Friend's Pass is also an incredibly generous offering that allows players to experience the game without owning it, which is, again, something that is rarely offered. In this regard, Hexworks really hit it out of the park, not only listening to players' feedback but going the extra mile to make the experience as enjoyable and accessible as possible in terms of multiplayer.</p>
<p>While the 2.0 update doesn't address all the issues found in Lords of the Fallen, as the clunky inventory management hasn't been improved, and some of its additions aren't exactly great, like the new UI which I feel doesn't really fit the game's aesthetics too much, there's no denying that Hexworks' dedication to their game has paid off big time. It's rare that we see such a level of post-launch support for a single-player-focused experience, and as such, the developer has to be commended for it. Hopefully, the lessons learned during the long development of Lords of the Fallen will benefit its sequel, which is currently in <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-will-continue-to-receive-meaningful-updates-up-to-version-2-0-sequels-playtesting-to-take-place-this-year/">development</a> for PC and consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-circana-march-2025-sales<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>US analysis firm Circana has released its gaming sales data for March, and it probably won't come as a surprise that Ubisoft's latest major release&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>is leading the pack for the month.</p>

<p>According to Circana's Mat Piscatella over on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lniaufpggs26" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>,&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>topped the all-format sales chart for March, with new sports release&nbsp;<em>MLB: The Show 25&nbsp;</em>coming in second. Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>is in third, which isn't surprising given its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" rel="nofollow">incredibly strong sales performance</a>.</p>

<p><em>Shadows&nbsp;</em>is also Xbox's top-selling game for the month, although it's pipped to the post on PlayStation by the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>MLB: The Show 25</em>. Since neither game launched on Switch, the honor for Nintendo's console goes instead to&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-announced" rel="nofollow">recent remaster</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xenoblade-chronicles-x-circana-sales-data-march-2025.jpg?itok=CajVuSfV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xenoblade-chronicles-x-circana-sales-data-march-2025.jpg?itok=qOFJBYOP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X&nbsp;</em>was the best-selling Switch game in March.</figcaption></figure><p>In terms of play time,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>topped the charts for both PlayStation and Xbox, although the honor on Steam goes to wacky co-op horror game&nbsp;<em>R.E.P.O.</em>, probably because&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>isn't available on Steam.</p>

<p>Just in case you're wondering,&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>' March performance wasn't enough to give it the top spot in the year-to-date sales chart; that still belongs to&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, although&nbsp;<em>Shadows&nbsp;</em>is in a very respectable second place.</p>

<p>Hardware spending fell by 25% over last March, representing the lowest March total since 2019. Sony's PS5 was once again the market leader for both dollar and unit sales, with Xbox Series X|S coming in second on both measures.</p>

<p>Switch sales dropped by 37% when compared to last March, although that's almost certainly due in large part to consumers waiting for the Switch 2, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">launching in June this year</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-circana-sales-data-march-2025.jpg?itok=quiYN9ZJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-circana-sales-data-march-2025.jpg?itok=h_sClzgN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Switch sales are down, but the Switch 2 is coming later this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Overall, gaming spending dropped by 6% in March when compared to March last year, with only non-mobile subscriptions and console premium digital purchases growing.</p>

Oblivion, which first launched in 2006, was one of the chief culprits, with objects flying all over the place, characters making poorly-timed (but often hilarious) on-screen interjections, and <em>things </em>happening in the background that, in the context of what was going on in the foreground, were perfect meme material.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nearly 20 years later, and Bethesda’s remaster (not a remake, it’s insisted), has all the “charm,” of the original, as Todd Howard put it. And that’s not an issue. In fact, it’s quite the opposite.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Oblivion is back,” is what players of the remaster are saying in response to clips of the game going wrong in some way, or doing that Bethesda game thing of having a random NPC's face steal the scene.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even glitches players exploited in the original Oblivion have been found to work in the remaster.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">The permanent bound weapons and armour glitch still works in Oblivion Remastered LMAO <a href="https://t.co/Nzp8gCAucK" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Nzp8gCAucK</a></p>— Nerbit (@Nerbit_13098) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nerbit_13098/status/1914780386648809874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 22, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">And players are recreating Oblivion memes, trying to recapture the hilarity of the game’s NPC behavior as it was all those years ago.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Original for comparison <a href="https://t.co/egYXGxe438" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/egYXGxe438</a></p>— crobb 🌹 (@corombb) <a href="https://twitter.com/corombb/status/1914864882232475829?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 23, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">None of Oblivion Remastered’s jank is seriously affecting player enjoyment of the game. For some it offers a warm familiarity. Can you imagine if the game had stripped all this out? It would feel… soulless, somehow, and nothing like the original fans fondly remember. Perhaps such attention on polish is best reserved for The Elder Scrolls VI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bugs, glitches, and memes are just one aspect of Oblivion Remastered’s success, which has seen players use the character creator <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remastereds-funny-character-faces-are-going-viral-for-being-total-nightmare-fuel-and-for-looking-like-the-original-fallout-talking-heads">to come up with some hilarious and nightmarish faces</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-starter-pokemon-from-each-generation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The most pivotal moment in any Pokemon game comes right at the start – choosing your partner Pokemon. The first moment you lock eyes with the creature you’ll spend tens of hours raising, bonding with and sending into battle is a special experience. That decision is usually based on vibes and taste to the point where many fans see it as a personality test. However, in those moments, you have no knowledge of how that decision will affect your journey to becoming a Pokemon master, with the gyms, rivals and secrets of the region yet to reveal themselves to you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, we’ve done the research, looked into the base stats, found every strength and weakness of every starter Pokemon and all their evolutions and pitted them against their native regions to determine who is the best starter pick, not just to get you past the first couple gyms, but to take on the Elite Four and beyond. This is the first step to becoming a Pokemon master across all iterations.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 1: Bulbasaur</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-bulbasaurpng-1745318747449.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While being the obvious pick to tackle the first gym in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-red-version">Pokemon Red</a> and Blue (Grass beats Rock, as any Pokemon fan knows), Bulbasaur outshines both Charmander and Squirtle as  the best starter pick in any bid to dominate the Kanto region. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Initial analysis might understandably lean towards Charmander. Fire types are a minority in Gen 1, many random encounters pitt you against Flying types (which are strong against Bulbasaur’s Grass) and the final gym is heavy on Ground types – something Charizard is immune to. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, those who are Bulbasaur-inclined will find themselves flying through the majority of the game, with the Grass type being super effective against Brock’s Rock Pokemon, Misty’s Water collection, and the Giovanni’s final gym line-up, as well as being the best choice to take out the first two members of the Elite Four. The biggest challenge Bulbasaur will face are Erika’s Grass type gym, where strategy will be vital to overcoming the barrage of “not very effective” attacks, and Blaine’s Fire type gym, which can be defeated thanks to the abundance of water types present in Kanto. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are some issues a Bulbasaur trainer will have to contend with, not least the many Pidgeys and Spearows you’ll come across in tall grass, whose Flying typing will provide a problem for anyone looking to grind their way to a high level. Thankfully, the amount of Ground and Rock types in caves will provide ample opportunity for Bulbasaur to wipe out entire bloodlines of Pokemon to gain a few XP. Also problematic are the frequent encounters with Blue, whose Pidgeot and Charmander will be a consistent issue, the latter of which can be helped by a Water type on your team. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Bulbasaur, along with having well-balanced base stats, has the added bonus of evolving into Venasaur who also is a poison-type, giving him a solid advantage over the other two offerings from Professor Oak.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 2: Cyndaquil</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-cyndaquil-1745320920819.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-gold-version">Pokemon Gold</a> and Silver introduced just eight new Fire types to the series, in comparison to 10 Grass and 18 Water types. That minority means snapping up a powerful Fire Pokemon like Cyndaquil from the start adds a great deal of diversity to your team. More importantly, Cyndaquil proves to be the best matchup for the majority of gyms and Elite Four members that populate Johto. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bugsy’s (you guessed it) Bug type gym and Jasmine’s Steel type gym will easily fall before a few Embers and Flame Wheels from Cyndaquil and his subsequent evolutions. The same cannot be said for the cutest of the starters, Water type Totodile, with there being no Fire, Ground or Rock gyms for him to dismantle. Grass type Chikorita (or more likely her third form, Meganium) would have a field day in Pryce’s Water gym but would struggle with the early Bug and Flying type gyms as well as Morty’s Poison type gym. Pryce will pose a problem for Cyndaquil, and so you’ll want to put together a well-balanced team to get you through that penultimate gym, but you’ll have many hours to assemble the perfect group before that hurdle. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also working in Cyndaquil’s favour are the Grass and Bug types dotted throughout the Elite Four’s roster. Though all four of these teams are well-balanced enough to give you trouble no matter who you pick as a starter, the many Poison types and Lance’s team of Dragon/Flying types makes this a no-go zone for Meganium. Meanwhile Totodile’s final evolution, Ferligator, would certainly hold its own against many of these Pokemon, but won’t blaze through a few like Typhlosion will. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Picking Cyndaquil does come with its issues. There will be many Rock and Ground Pokemon bothering you with random encounters in caves and Lance’s team containing a Charizard and a Gyrados will require some solid strategy to overcome, but the effects of these are much lesser compared to what ails Chikorita and Totodile. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 3: Mudkip</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-mudkip-1745320946409.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You might pick Mudkip because you just think he’s neat, but the reasons to go Water type for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-ruby-version">Pokemon Ruby</a> and Sapphire run a bit deeper. In terms of gyms, Water type Mudkip has a bit of competition from the Grass type Treecko as both of them are super effective against three of the eight. They both have an advantage in Roxanne’s and Tate &amp; Liza’s Rock/Ground gyms, while Mudkip will be best suited to take on Flannery’s Fire gym and Treeko for Wallace’s Water gym. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By the time you get to Wallace, Treeko would have almost definitely evolved into Sceptile, as Sootopolis City houses the final gym. The significance of that can’t be understated, but Treeko’s Grass typing sees it at a disadvantage in battles with Flannery and with Winona’s Flying type lineup. Mudkip, on the other hand, will struggle with just the one gym – Wattson’s (you guessed it) Electric type gym early on in Mauville City. Your third option, Torchic, doesn’t really enter the conversation here, with Fire types being super effective against none of the gyms and Fighting (a type gained by Torchic’s third form, Blazicken), only super effective against one, not to mention being at a massive disadvantage for Wallace’s battle. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The makeup of the Elite Four can lend a slight advantage towards Treeko’s final form, Sceptile, as you come across Glacia’s Ice/Water Pokemon and a few Grass Pokemon along the way which will cause Swampert (Mudkip’s third evolution) some issues. However, as Mudkip evolves into its final form, it gains Ground typing and very nicely balanced stats which see it gain a huge defensive boost, becoming immune to Electric and its only weakness being Grass. This makes Swampert able to power through battles where it usually might be the underdog. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another consideration may be the amount of water present in the Hoenn region, meaning random encounters can be a bit of a grind, but Mudkip shows enough advantages in other areas to overcome that obstacle. Bonus points for being the cutest of the bunch.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 4: Chimchar</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-chimchar-1745320985367.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Continuing the trend from the very first game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-diamond-version">Pokemon Diamond</a> and Pearl adds far fewer Fire type Pokemon to the series; just five in comparison to the14 introduced for Water and Grass. Though this isn’t a deciding factor in which starter to pick, it adds to the list of attributes going in Fire type Chimchar’s favour over Grass type Turtwig and Water type Piplup. Three is the magic number in terms of how many gyms a Pokemon needs to be super effective against to come out on top over its peers, and Chimchar’s Fire typing helps it overcome Gardenia’s Grass type gym, as well as the sixth and seventh gyms ran by Byron’s Steel types and Candice’s Ice types. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chimchar faces tough competition from Turtwig, who can eliminate Roark’s Rock type and Crasher Wake’s Water type gyms with ease. After evolving into Torterra, it also gains Ground typing, making it immune to Electric attacks which will see it waltz through the final gym owned by Volkner. Though they may seem perfectly matched, a lot of Turtwig’s strengths are most exemplified in the early stages of the game, while Chimchar’s abilities sees him primed for late game success.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Coming through the gyms with minimal fuss is important due to the Sinnoh region’s very well-balanced Elite Four. Chimchar’s final evolution, Infernape, is perfect to take on Aaron’s Bug Pokemon, which would be super effective against Torterra, but the Grass type would admittedly be best to dismantle Bertha’s Water and Ground types. Piplup, despite evolving into the very resilient Empoleon, doesn’t have a significant advantage over many of the gym leaders or the Elite Four to make a dent here. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a close matchup between Chimchar and Torterra, but due to the frequent battles with Team Galactic’s Bug types, the advantage falls with Chimchar, who has the gym battle credentials to back it up. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 5: Tepig</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-tepig-1745321009249.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Gen 5 makes for a more clean cut decision, with the Fire type Tepig making the biggest claim for being the smartest pick. Grass type Snivy doesn’t quite make the cut as it only has an advantage over just the one gym, nor any significant advantages over any Elite Four member, as well as being plagued by the various Bug and Flying types across the Unova region’s tall grass and boss battles. Water type Oshawott isn’t as embattled as Snivy, being the best choice to take on Clay’s Ground type gym and being resistant to Brycen’s Ice Pokemon, which are super effective against Snivy. But like the Grass type, there are no Elite Four members who lean into a type specifically tailored to Oshawott or its evolutions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, Tepig’s Fire abilities, and its final form, Emboar, also being a Fighting type, allows it to have a smoother ride through Unova. Firstly, Burgh’s Bug gym and Brycen’s gym are light work for a Fire type, the latter being the penultimate gym in the game. Alternative solutions will need to be found to make it through Clay’s Ground-based gym, but the same can be said for Oshawott as it arrives in Elesa’s Electric gym. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Elite Four battles are where Emboar’s Fighting type comes in handy, being super effective against Grimsley’s Dark type Pokemon. Emboar is admittedly vulnerable to Caitlin’s Psychic types, but if you have a strong enough bench, this battle can easily be overcome. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also working in Emboar’s favour are his strong attacking stats and the presence of Team Plasma, who have an abundance of Steel types. Having to fight the Elite Four twice makes <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-black-version">Pokemon Black</a> and White a tough challenge no matter who you choose, but Tepig can put your mind at ease more often than the others. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 6: Fennekin</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-fennekin-1745321043423.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-x-version">Pokemon X</a> and Y continue the dominance of Fire types in this list. The sixth generation has a quirk where you can choose from two sets of starters, first between the new bunch of Chespin, Fennekin and Froakie, and later between the Kanto starters from the original games. For this list, we’ll focus on the starters unique to this game, of which Fennekin is the standout. The Fire Pokemon can almost stroll through the gyms, being super effective against three and resistant to two more. Though two of those gyms are in the early stages of the game, the final three being Fairy, Psychic and Ice based means that Fennekin’s third evolution, Delphox, now imbued with Psychic typing, can head off to the Pokemon League relatively unscathed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Froakie evolves into Greninja, a Water/Dark type Pokemon, making it super effective against Olympia’s Psychic team but weak against Valerie’s Fairy types. Being a Water type mostly gets it into trouble, matching up poorly against Ramos’ Grass types and Clemont’s Electric types, something Grant’s early Rock gym doesn’t make up for. Chespin’s story makes for similar reading, struggling off the bat with Viola’s Bug gym and going on to gain a Fighting typing after evolving into Chesnaught which leaves it at a disadvantage against Olmpia and Valerie. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the games progress, the Elite Fours get a bit more balanced. Pokemon X and Y is another example of a series of battles suited to a different type each time. You’ll want Water to overcome Malva, Fire to overcome Wikstrom and Grass to overcome Siebold. Delphox just about has the edge, able to resist whatever Diantha’s Gardevoir throws at it. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 7: Litten</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-litten-1745321072999.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Rounding out this Fire type four-peat is Litten from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-sun-version">Pokemon Sun</a> and Moon. Despite having to struggle through the first couple trials (the Alola region’s version of gyms, of which there are only seven), Litten is the obvious choice for the rest of the battles. Mallow’s Grass trial is the only lineup where each Pokemon is weak to Fire, but Sophocles’ Electric gym contains two Steel types and a Bug type. And by the time you arrive at Acerola’s Ghost trial you could have evolved Litten into the Fire/Dark type Incineroar whose attacks will be super effective against the whole lineup, especially the Grass and Ice Pokemon in Acerola’s team. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The final trial, in which you must face Mina with her Fairy Pokemon, is a little more complicated because of Incineroar’s Dark typing. A regular Fire type would be able to resist Fairy attacks, but Incineroar is damaged normally by them. Helpfully, Mina has a Steel, Grass and Bug type in her team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Litten’s starter counterparts, Rowlet and Popplio, will find success with one of the first three trials, but will cease to have an advantage over any of the late game battles. Rowlet’s evolution, Decidueye, gains Ghost typing, which is a blessing and a curse for Acerola’s trial, but doesn’t garner much of an advantage elsewhere. Popplio evolves into the Water/Fairy type Primarina, but that doesn’t affect its fortunes with the trials at all. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sun and Moon’s Elite Four are just a small fraction of what awaits you in the Pokemon League. After becoming champion yourself, you face challenges from 10 more trainers looking to take your place. These battles, on top of the Elite Four themselves, are too diverse for any starter to have any advantage over the other, meaning Litten’s ability to clear the trials is even more vital. The Alola region also introduces just eight Fire Pokemon in comparison to Grass and Water’s 13 (after the series had become more balanced in that regard) so snapping Litten up early is a great aid.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 8: Sobble</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-sobble-1745321095167.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Sobble’s victory over Grookey and Scorbunny might be the closest of the lot. All three Pokemon are the best picks against three gyms, with Gordie and Raihan’s Rock and Ground gyms being perfect for Sobble and Grookey, and Melony’s Ice gym and Opal’s Fairy gym being tailor made for Scorbunny. Additionally, the first three gyms are Grass, Water and Fire typed, in that order, lending no advantage to any of the three starters. Raihan’s gym being the final one gives it a bit more importance, so the gym battles give a hair’s breadth of a lead to Grookey and Sobble. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Galar region’s version of the Elite Four, The Champion Cup, allows Sobble to just inch past Grookey in the standings. None of these Pokemon’s final evolutions gain any new types, making them work with what they’re given from the start. The semi-final opponents don’t lean any particular way, but Bede's Fairy Pokemon, followed by Nessa’s Water types and Raihan’s Fire and Ground heavy Dragon team, favour Fire, Grass and Water respectively. If success against the toughest opponents is most valued, then Sobble just about edges victory here. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other considerations like the rivals, Team Yell, and random encounters are even less impactful than normal in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-sword">Pokemon Sword</a> and Shield. Team Yell uses mostly Dark types, which attack and defend normally against Fire, Water and Grass types, and the introduction of overworld Pokemon means random encounters happen less. If there’s any other factor that tips the scales towards Sobble, it would be that its final evolution, Inteleon, has a nicely balanced set of stats. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gen 9: Fuecoco</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/best-pokemon-starters-fuecoco-1745321116725.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The sixth Fire type to be chosen on this list is one of the clearest winners. You might think that the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-scarlet">Pokemon Scarlet</a> and Violet’s focus on player freedom might allow for little separation between Sprigatito, Fuecoco and Quaxly – You can do the gyms and raid Team Star bases in any order you like and you can avoid encounters with wild Pokemon almost entirely. But even with all of that, the Paldea region feels designed to be dominated by Fuecoco. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gyms in Scarlet and Violet don’t level scale, so if you have a bad matchup, you can just return once you’re able to power through a disadvantage. Still, the highest level gyms being Psychic/Fairy and Ice types, courtesy of Tulip and Grusha, and the two lowest level gyms being Katy and Brassius’ Bug and Grass types, means there’s a good reason to go with Fuecoco (and its Ghost type final evolution, Skeledirge) regardless of your strategy. Being a water type, Quaxly isn’t strong against any gym until it reaches its third form, Quaquaval, where it becomes a Fighting type, helping it in Larry’s Normal type gym. Sprigatito fares a bit better, evolving into Grass/Dark type Meowscarada, enabling it to best Tulip’s gym and Ryme’s Ghost gym. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Team Star base raids place even more importance on what starter you pick, being vital to the story progression of the game. The crews based around Dark and Poison Pokemon have an abundance of Bug Pokemon who have to be cleared before you can face the boss, while crews based around Fairy and Fighting types are perfect for Skeledirge, who is immune to attacks from the latter. Quaquaval and Meowscarada are worthy opponents for the first member of the Elite Four, Rika and her Ground Pokemon, but from Poppy’s Steel team onwards, Skeledirge finds itself miles ahead of the competition. </p><div id="the-best-starter-pokemon" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Best Starter Pokemon</h3><h3>The Best Starter Pokemon</h3></p></div></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Steam is rolling out a new questionnaire for developers that makes it easier for them to highlight <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-xbox-playstation-are-teaming-up-for-accessible-games-initiative/1100-6530272/" data-ref-id="1100-6530272">accessibility features</a> in their games. Later in 2025, it will also become easier for players to search for games with specific accessibility features.</p><p>These updates were outlined in a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/536595840131663919" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> on April 22. In the "Edit Store" section for a game on Steamworks, developers can now complete an accessibility support questionnaire to confirm that their game has various gameplay, audio, visual, and input accessibility options. From there, developers can self-identify their game's level of accessibility.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4481080-dad4d0852ce47f116b63cba4469478ba2b678aa4.png" data-ref-id="1300-4481080" data-ratio="0.41045454545455" data-width="2200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4481080-dad4d0852ce47f116b63cba4469478ba2b678aa4.png" data-ref-id="1300-4481080"></a><figcaption>This is what the accessibility support questionnaire game developers can now fill out on Steamworks looks like.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1849/18498836/4481080-dad4d0852ce47f116b63cba4469478ba2b678aa4.png"></figure><p>For now, this will only be visible within Steamworks, but later this year, it will have more public-facing uses. Developers will eventually be able to share information from this questionnaire on the Steam Store and App pages. Steam users will also gain the option to search for specific accessibility features. The following accessibility filters for search have been confirmed by Valve:</p><ul><li>Adjustable Difficulty</li><li>Save Anytime</li><li>Adjustable Text Size</li><li>Subtitle Options</li><li>Color Alternatives</li><li>Camera Comfort</li><li>Custom Volume Controls</li><li>Stereo Sound</li><li>Surround SOund</li><li>Narrated Game Menus</li><li>Playable without Timed Input</li><li>Keyboard Only Option</li><li>Mouse Only Option</li><li>Touch Only Option</li><li>Chat Speech-to-text</li><li>Chat Text-to-speech</li></ul><p>Valve explains that it is implementing these features to bring "a more positive experience on Steam for everyone by making it easier to find games that support Accessibility features." It's not required that devs fill out the questionnaire, but Valve says it is "highly recommended" because it will make it easier for players with accessibility needs to find these games.</p><p>If you're a Steam user, expect to see these game accessibility-focused improvements on Steam sometime this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-surpasses-9-million-copies-sold-ahead-of-its-console-launch-this-summer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Just under a week after VOID Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/void-interactives-ready-or-not-coming-to-consoles-in-summer-2025/">announced</a> that Ready or Not would be coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, the tactical FPS hit another milestone by surpassing <strong>9 million copies sold</strong> on PC.</p>
<p>"<em>Our flagship tactical shooter Ready or Not is hitting a huge new milestone: We're officially coming to PlayStation and Xbox this summer</em>," VOID Interactive's chief executive officer, Julio Rodriguez, said in a press release.</p>
<p>"<em>As we approach 10 million units sold on Steam, we're beyond excited to bring the experience to console players worldwide.</em>"</p>
<p>There's still no specific release date for Ready or Not on consoles, but we know it will be sometime during summer 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ready or Not – Console Reveal Trailer (PS5/Xbox Series X | S)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jW3zr1Jn5bM?start=15&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ready or Not is a tactical FPS that puts you in the boots of a SWAT team where, unlike plenty of other shooters, you're trying to not pull the trigger as much as possible, instead of going in guns blazing for every situation.</p>
<p>The realistic scenarios Ready or Not emphasize to players that they need to strategize as much as possible. It's not your average war-shooter or Call of Duty, where the aim is to kill everyone in sight. A successful mission in Ready or Not means you've apprehended all hostile combatants and ensured everyone in harm's way gets out safely and alive.</p>
<p>Ready or Not originally launched in early access in <a href="https://wccftech.com/tactical-fps-ready-or-not-swat/">2017</a> before reaching its full 1.0 release in <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-launches-out-of-early-access-adding-lots-of-missions-and-content/">2023</a>. This release came after a few delays, with the full release being first scheduled for 2020. Now that it's due to arrive on consoles two years after its full PC release, VOID Interactive's long journey with Ready or Not will enter its next chapter.</p>
<p>The console version of Ready or Not will arrive with 20 missions that can be tackled solo or in co-op with up to five players. Two brand-new missions will also be available in the console version, which PC players will receive the same day as the console launch in a free update.</p>
<p>It'll also include two DLC expansions, which add another six missions to the pile. Those who pre-order the console version will have access to the M32A1 Grenade launcher, MK-V Pistol, and 590M Shotgun. Once again, PC players who already own the game will get these weapons in a free update.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-is-up-to-its-old-web3-tricks-again-with-might-magic-fates.1171311/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/might-and-magic-fates-blockchain-mobile<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has announced&nbsp;<em>Might &amp; Magic Fates</em>, a new free-to-play trading card game created in conjunction with blockchain studio Immutable, and yes, that does mean the game will have Web3 elements.</p>

<p>In an announcement <a href="https://x.com/MightMagicFates/status/1915033605266456909" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Ubisoft says&nbsp;<em>Might &amp; Magic Fates&nbsp;</em>will give you the opportunity to "collect and trade iconic cards", and that the game will offer the chance to "play for free [and] dominate with skill".</p>

<p>According to an <a href="https://www.mightandmagicfates.com/faqs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a> on&nbsp;<em>Fates</em>' official website, the game is a "strategic card game where every decision matters", and it'll involve building "powerful decks by combining creatures, spells, artifacts, buildings, and heroes" from across the&nbsp;<em>Might &amp; Magic&nbsp;</em>world.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/might-magic-fates-free-to-play-blockchain-art.jpg?itok=rpyoZYSk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/might-magic-fates-free-to-play-blockchain-art.jpg?itok=B-fKlTqA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Might &amp; Magic Fates&nbsp;</em>is another Web3-infused offering from Ubisoft.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, you'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>Might &amp; Magic Fates&nbsp;</em>online against other players, and Ubisoft promises the chance to build your collection either through earning rewards by playing the game or through "opening booster packs filled with cards of varying rarities".</p>

<p>If you're wondering where the Web3 elements come in, Ubisoft says the blockchain stuff in&nbsp;<em>Might &amp; Magic Fates&nbsp;</em>will be "optional" and will "unlock digital ownership for players who want it".</p>

<p>According to Ubisoft, that means you can "enjoy the full experience, grow your collection, and compete at the highest level" without ever having to touch&nbsp;<em>Fates</em>' Web3 elements, but if you want to, you can "freely trade your cards using the Immutable blockchain".</p>

<p>This is, of course, far from Ubisoft's first dalliance with Web3 gaming. In October last year, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-nft-game" rel="nofollow">released the rather generically-named</a>&nbsp;<em>Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles</em>, an NFT game that features figurines you can buy with your real-life hard-earned cash.</p>




<p>I'm not entirely sure that&nbsp;<em>Might &amp; Magic Fates&nbsp;</em>is going to be the thing to turn Ubisoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-cost-cutting-q3" rel="nofollow">flagging fortunes</a> around, but then again, given that it's a blockchain game, I don't think Ubisoft is banking on it doing so either.</p>

<p><em>Might &amp; Magic Fates&nbsp;</em>has no release date yet, but when it launches, it'll arrive for mobile devices "with potential expansion to PC". Watch this space for more.</p>

This confirms its compatibility with other Switch 2 software, although Nintendo is getting ahead of any problems that arise with that by pointing out that there could be issues. Hopefully, it at least works with games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-smash-bros-ultimate/" data-ref-id="5000-480957">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> on Switch 2.</p><p>"The Nintendo GameCube controller is designed for use with the Nintendo GameCube – Nintendo Classics collection of games and is an optional way to play those games," Nintendo's full statement explains. "Since it doesn’t have all the buttons and features found in other controllers that can be used with the Nintendo Switch 2 system, there may be some issues when playing other games. The Nintendo GameCube controller can only be used on Nintendo Switch 2 and is not compatible with Nintendo Switch."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MvkSVs8f_w" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0MvkSVs8f_w" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The Switch 2's GameCube controller was revealed alongside the addition of GameCube games to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">April 2 Switch 2 Direct</a>. It features a very similar layout to the original GameCube controller, but works wirelessly and has the Home, Capture, C, and ZL buttons present on the Joy-Con 2 controllers. A disclaimer in one of Nintendo's trailers suggested that the Switch 2's GameCube Controller wouldn't work with other games, which is why Nintendo had to clarify this in the first place.</p><p>This new GameCube controller will become available for preorder on the My Nintendo Store the same day as Nintendo Switch 2.

<p>In Devolver Digital's <a href="https://investors.devolverdigital.com/files/downloads-and-publications/DEVO-FY24-Investor-Presentation.pdf">FY24 investor presentation</a>, the publisher explained Nerial had "undergone a team restructure" which aimed to "address issues around recent releases and to better shape the team for future releases".</p>

<p>In the same presentation, Devolver Digital said it had downsized its Polish studio Artificer by 50 percent early last year.</p>
<p>"Good Shepherd / Big Fan also reduced its headcount by 50 percent + over the course of 2024," it wrote. "Overall group headcount has reduced from a peak of 303 at end 2023 to c. 270 now, including the above reductions."</p>
<p>Nerial is one of Devolver Digital's internal studios, which it acquired in 2021. As reported by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/devolver-cuts-40-percent-of-workforce-at-reigns-developer-nerial">Game Developer</a>, Nerial's Reigns franchises is one the publisher's most successful, earning over $20m in lifetime revenue across five titles.</p>

<p>Along with its Reigns games, Nerial is also known for its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-crush-house-is-a-thirst-person-shooter-that-holds-a-mirror-to-reality-tv-production">"thirst-person shooter" The Crush House</a> (pictured below), which was released last year, as well as Card Shark.</p>
<p>"Even though some parts might momentarily break the illusion, The Crush House maintains its shiny sheen of plastic perfection (one that hides a dark, sickly goo inside). It touches upon multiple facets of reality TV with sharp satire and wit, including the nature of the relationships we have with contestants on these shows, the industrial churn of people and their lives for our entertainment, and the truth of what's captured on screen impacting what's happening when the cameras are off," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-crush-house-review">Eurogamer's four star The Crush House review</a>.</p>
<p>"You'll definitely want to tune in for this one."</p>

<p>As for Card Shark, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/card-shark-review-scoundrels-and-intrigue-delivered-with-a-flourish">here is what Christian Donlan had to say about it</a>: "Card Shark is brilliant. It's a game about card games, but it isn't a card game itself - not really. It's a game about tricks, but you're in a world of con artists rather than magicians."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-apple-500-million-euro-fine<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apple has been ordered to pay a fine of&nbsp;€500 million and make changes to the way its iOS store works as part of its ongoing legal battle with&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>studio Epic Games.</p>

<p>In a news <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/apple-is-breaking-the-law-by-charging-fees-for-steering-imposing-restrictions-on-third-party-stores" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on its website, Epic reveals that the European Commission has <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1085" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">found</a>&nbsp;Apple to be in breach of the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which requires the iPhone maker to "inform customers, free of charge, of alternative offers outside the App Store".</p>

<p>As part of the DMA, Apple must also "steer [customers] to those offers and allow them to make purchases", an obligation with which the European Commission believes Apple "fails to comply". The Commission says Apple "prevents app developers" from informing customers about alternative offers and distribution channels.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/apple-epic-european-commission-fortnite.jpg?itok=nL_9tJEl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/apple-epic-european-commission-fortnite.jpg?itok=qPrGULfx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Apple's battle with Epic has resulted in another blow to the Cupertino tech giant.</figcaption></figure><p>Today's ruling means that Apple must "remove the technical and commercial restrictions on steering" (i.e. allowing developers to recommend other offers and non-iOS alternatives to customers) and "refrain from perpetuating the non-compliant conduct in the future".</p>

<p>According to Epic, changes Apple must make include the removal of fees imposed on purchases made outside of an iOS app, as well as the elimination of "restrictions on the language, style and flow that developers can use to link to their website or to access an alternative payment system".</p>

<p>If you need a reminder of where all this started, it's been running since 2020, when Epic <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-slashes-up-to-20-off-purchases-on-all-platforms" rel="nofollow">decided to offer a discount</a> on in-game&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>purchases across all platforms, but only if using a new direct payment system introduced by the company at the time.</p>

<p>Apple took umbrage at this decision and removed&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>from the iOS App Store, prompting Epic to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-apple-store-version-removed-for-violating-app-store-guidelines" rel="nofollow">file a lawsuit in response</a>. Google, the owner of the Android operating system, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-sues-google-over-fortnites-removal-from-play-store" rel="nofollow">took similar measures</a> and was also sued by Epic.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-mobile-epic-apple-european-commission.jpg?itok=pYA66nQy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-mobile-epic-apple-european-commission.jpg?itok=nia3XVmp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>All of this started as part of a row over alternative payment systems within&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>on mobile.</figcaption></figure><p>The saga has essentially been running since then, but Epic <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-google-victory-play-store" rel="nofollow">won another pretty significant victory</a> back in October, this time against Google. As part of the ongoing case, a judge ruled that Google must open up its Play Store to third-party apps and give "rival third-party app stores access to the full catalog of Google Play apps".</p>

<p>That ruling referred specifically to the Epic Games Store's availability on Android rather than alternative payment systems, but since Epic would rather funnel players through its own store and payment systems than Google or Apple's, it's all connected.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what today's ruling means for Epic and Apple in the future. In the meantime, you can still play <i>Fortnite&nbsp;</i>on mobile devices, although you'll need to download the Epic Games Store app to do so.</p>

The trailer introduces a gang of outlaws, and her ultimate goal is to find and eliminate all six. “One by one, she’s hunting them down to avenge her family,” the official description reads. “But while Atsu’s story begins with vengeance, she’ll find there’s more to her journey than just revenge. As she explores Ezo, Atsu will meet unlikely allies and forge connections that help give her a new sense of purpose.”</p><p>The game’s structure sounds fairly open, as Sony says “you’ll choose which leads to follow as you pick which Yōtei Six member you want to hunt down first.”</p><p><em>Ghost of Yōtei</em> is one of s small number of major exclusives planned for the PS5 this year. It will follow the launch of <em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610946/death-stranding-2-trailer-ps5-state-of-play-on-the-beach">which comes out on June 26th</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Choose your path—build an economy based on farming or profit from monster-slaying (either way, don’t forget to collect taxes). Recruit adventurers and send them on quests to kill, defend, explore, and more. After all, everyone knows the only thing adventurers love more than glory… is gold.</p><p>With no army and no budget, you’ll have to throw gold at every problem and hope your hired heroes survive long enough to gear up, grow stronger, and maybe evolve into something more. If they don’t? Feed them to the pet god-beast you found snacking on your supplies. It’s growing faster than expected—so raise it, teach it spells or tricks, pet it, brush it, and if necessary, discipline it. Treat it well, and it just might become a trusted companion on your journey. Run the town, fund the chaos, and hope your gold lasts longer than your heroes.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Give <a title="Platforms > Quest [138 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a>s</strong> – Everyone knows that adventurers do not work for free. Their loyalty lies with GOLD! You’ll have to recruit them with promises of gold or glory, and give them quests! Kill, defend, explore, and more!</li><li><strong>Recruit Unique <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,225 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">Adventure</a>rs</strong> – Gold-thirsty adventurers will come from all corners of the world. Humans, beastmen, mothmen, undead, and more may join your cause. Pick them all, or only your favorites!</li><li><strong>Build a City</strong> – Build a thriving city around a monster-filled dungeon. Create an economy based on either farming or monster-slaying, and watch as it evolves based on your <a title="Genres > Action [2,683 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s. Whatever you choose, remember to collect your share of the taxes!</li><li><strong>Raise a Pet God-Beast</strong> – The pet you found snacking on your supplies seems to be growing more than expected. Far more. It might be wise to teach it what is right and wrong, before it grows too big to care about your opinions. Raise it, teach it spells or tricks, pet it, brush it, and if necessary discipline it. You might find that it becomes a trusted companion on your journey!</li><li><strong>Fight Monsters</strong> – As your adventurers clear the world of monsters, you can watch their pathetic struggle against the world. Be merciful and help them survive, get better items, and learn new skills… or feed them to your god-beast. Each level brings them one step closer towards a forbidden evolution.</li></ul></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Apple has been hit by a €500m (£429m) fine from the European Union for violations of its Digital Markets Act (DMA) - and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> maker Epic Games, which has been warring with the iPhone manufacturer amidst the rollout of its own app store, has been quick to respond.
</p>
<p>
Today, both Apple and Facebook owner Meta have been handed the first major penalties to come from the DMA. Apple has been slapped for App Store practices. Meanwhile, Meta must pay €200m (£172m) over its advertising policies.
</p>
<p>
Issues with Apple's App Store centre on the company's policy of not allowing iPhone and iPad apps to mention or link to alternative storefronts or offers elsewhere - meaning customers are directed to spend solely via the App Store, where Apple takes its 30 percent cut.
</p>
<p>
This was a key issue behind Epic Games' original beef with the iPhone maker, when it launched the first strike in its now years-long war with both Apple and Google by slipping cheaper, direct payments into Fortnite (and swiftly getting booted from the App Store and Google Play as a result).
</p>
<p>
Apple has always argued that its baked-in storefront was the most secure option for users, and that opening up its systems to alternatives posed risks to itself and to customers. The company has said today it will appeal the decision.
</p>
<p>
"Under the DMA, app developers distributing their apps via Apple's App Store should be able to inform customers, free of charge, of alternative offers outside the App Store, steer them to those offers and allow them to make purchases," <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1085">the European Commission wrote today</a>, announcing its verdict.
</p>
<p>
"The Commission found that Apple fails to comply with this obligation. Due to a number of restrictions imposed by Apple, app developers cannot fully benefit from the advantages of alternative distribution channels outside the App Store. Similarly, consumers cannot fully benefit from alternative and cheaper offers as Apple prevents app developers from directly informing consumers of such offers. The company has failed to demonstrate that these restrictions are objectively necessary and proportionate."
</p>
<p>
On top of its fine, Apple has now been ordered to "remove the technical and commercial restrictions on steering and to refrain from perpetuating the non-compliant conduct in the future" within 60 days, or risk further fines.
</p>
<p>
And there's further bad news today for Apple as the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1086">European Commission has issued its preliminary findings on the company's "user choice obligations", as well as its controversial Core Technology Fee</a> - essentially a tax on major app store developers who choose to publish their games on alternative iPhone storefronts in regions (such as the EU) where Apple has been compelled to allow them.
</p>
<p>
"The Commission takes the preliminary view that Apple failed to comply with this obligation in view of the conditions it imposes on app (and app store) developers," it wrote. "Developers wanting to use alternative app distribution channels on iOS are disincentivised from doing so as this requires them to opt for business terms which include a new fee (Apple's Core Technology Fee). 
</p>
<p>
"Apple also introduced overly strict eligibility requirements, hampering developers' ability to distribute their apps through alternative channels. Finally, Apple makes it overly burdensome and confusing for end users to install apps when using such alternative app distribution channels."
</p>
<p>
These findings have now been passed to Apple, before further action is taken. 
</p>
<p>
"Today's announcements are yet another example of the European Commission unfairly targeting Apple in a series of decisions that are bad for the privacy and security of our users, bad for products, and force us to give away our technology for free," an Apple spokesperson said in a statement to Eurogamer. 
</p>
<p>
"We have spent hundreds of thousands of engineering hours and made dozens of changes to comply with this law, none of which our users have asked for. Despite countless meetings, the Commission continues to move the goal posts every step of the way. We will appeal and continue engaging with the Commission in service of our European customers."
</p>
<p>
"Apple is breaking the law by imposing illegal fees, scare screens and restrictions on purchases made outside the App Store," <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/apple-is-breaking-the-law-by-charging-fees-for-steering-imposing-restrictions-on-third-party-stores?sessionInvalidated=true">Epic Games said in a statement today</a>, meanwhile. "Apple's pattern of malicious compliance must end the following technical and commercial restrictions: 
</p>
<p>
"Apple must allow apps downloaded from the App Store to steer customers to third party stores. Apple must not charge any fees on purchases that are made outside of an app. Apple must eliminate restrictions on the language, style and flow that developers can use to link to their website or to access an alternative payment system. In simple words: Apple must end the scare screens they pop up in front of Epic Games Store to deter customers from doing business with us.
</p>
<p>
"Apple must not track, surveil, or require developers to send Apple data about purchases that consumers make outside apps. Apple must allow developers to advertise lower prices and communicate directly with their customers."
</p>
<p>Back in January, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-set-to-pile-pressure-on-apple-and-google-app-store-dominance-as-fresh-investigation-launched">UK's Competition and Markets Authority announced a similar investigation into both Apple and Google,</a> backed by fresh powers granted under the recent Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Act.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Sucker Punch have announced the&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei</em> release date, and it won't be long until you can check out the studio's sequel to&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>.</p>

<p>Per a new PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/23/ghost-of-yotei-comes-to-playstation-5-on-october-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, the game, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-ghost-of-tsushima-followup-2025" rel="nofollow">first announced back in September</a>, will be launching exclusively for PlayStation 5 on October 2nd. If <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-tsushima-announced-for-pc-with-nvidia-dlss-3-amd-fsr-3-unlocked-frame-rate-and" rel="nofollow">its predecessor</a> is anything to go by, however, we can probably expect a PC port somewhere down the line as well.</p>

<p>Pre-ordering the game will get you a special in-game mask and a set of PSN avatars, and multiple editions of the game will also be available, each of which comes with its own set of bonuses.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-release-date-cliff.jpg?itok=I2meuuzl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-release-date-cliff.jpg?itok=dLdHFwtx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ghost of Yōtei&nbsp;</em>is officially launching for PS5 in October.</figcaption></figure><p>Picking up&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>'s Digital Deluxe Edition will net you a special armor set and dye, and you'll also get "a unique horse color and unique saddle dye", as well as a number of other in-game goodies.</p>

<p>The Collector's Edition, meanwhile, gets you everything in the Digital Deluxe Edition, as well as "a replica display edition of Atsu's Ghost mask", which is made from resin and measures 6.8 by 5 by 5.9 inches.</p>

<p>Not only that, but you'll get a number of other goodies, including a replica sash inscribed with the members of&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>'s villainous Yōtei Six faction, plus a number of other great physical goodies. Sucker Punch&nbsp;says it considers this Collector's Edition "the best Collector's Edition we've ever produced".</p>

<p>All of this was announced alongside a brand new trailer that shows off the aforementioned&nbsp;Yōtei Six faction, as well as giving a couple of new glimpses into the game's world. You can check that trailer out here.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>, it's a followup to Sucker Punch's 2020 game&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>. Taking place over three hundred years after the events of that game,&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei&nbsp;</em>follows Atsu, a woman on a quest to avenge her family against the Yōtei Six.</p>

<p><em>Ghost of Yōtei&nbsp;</em>launches exclusively for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/ghost-of-yotei/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> on October 2nd.</p>

He previously worked at <em>Android Police</em> and <em>Tech Advisor</em>.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Shortages of the Switch 2 look increasingly likely after Nintendo admitted today that it “cannot fulfill” all of the preorder applications it has already received through its own Japanese store. </p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1914982671522083155">statement on X</a> via Nintendo’s Japanese account, president Shuntaro Furukawa confirmed that the company’s storefront has received 2.2 million applications to preorder the new console in Japan alone. That’s a number that “far exceeds our expectations, and far exceeds the number of Nintendo Switch 2 consoles that can be delivered from the My Nintendo Store on June 5th.”</p><p>In its first month on sale the original Switch <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/historical_data/index.html">sold 360,000 units in Japan</a>, suggesting that Nintendo is seeing six times the demand for its sequel. The Japanese demand for day one is almost as high as the 2.74 million Switch consoles the company sold worldwide in its first few weeks in 2017.</p><p>Furukawa didn’t say how many consoles Nintendo has ready for the launch, but only that “a significant number of customers” won’t be lucky in the My Nintendo Store lottery. Those who don’t get a console will be automatically re-entered into a second lottery, while third-party retailers in Japan will begin taking preorders tomorrow, April 24th. In Japan Nintendo is offering two versions of the Switch 2: a Japanese-only model for ¥49,980 (about $350) and a ¥69,980 (about $500) multilingual version which is exclusively available through the My Nintendo Store.</p><p>Preorders have already been open for several weeks in some parts of the world, including most of Europe, and stores have sold out fast. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643616/nintendo-switch-2-us-preorders-date">US preorders open tomorrow</a> for $449.99, following an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">initial delay</a> over tariff concerns.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
