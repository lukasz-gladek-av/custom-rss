			<p>A couple of hours ago, the official Focus Entertainment Twitter/X account <a href="https://twitter.com/Focus_entmt/status/1833537959326339304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1833537959326339304%7Ctwgr%5Edb17e9dc9db64f3f0c366b2ff0ed3dd966bc624d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dsogaming.com%2Fnews%2Fwarhammer-40k-space-marine-2-has-sold-two-million-copies%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 has already sold two million units.</p>
<p>The long-anticipated sequel only launched yesterday, so it's likely the number is due, in large part, to the pre-orders. Indeed, during my Gamescom 2024 chat with Saber Interactive Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits, the industry veteran <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-qa-with-tim-willits-we-have-a-game-that-will-exceed-expectations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p>
<p><em>We're very proud of where it is now. We're very happy with our work, and the people who played the preview were happy. Preorders are great. Right now, what we're focused on is September 9, you know, making sure that the servers are up and running for everyone, making sure that any issues are ironed up, but everything's looking good; it's all green lights. The game is fun and solid, so yeah, I'm excited about the launch.</em></p>
<p>So far, user reviews are largely positive on Steam. However, our own Chris Wray wasn't quite enamored with Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2, giving the game 7 out of 10 in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>:</p>
<p><em>In all, while Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2 isn't a bad game, not in any sense of the word - it's arguably good at what it does - I haven't enjoyed it that much. The repetitiveness of combat, particularly with the limitations directing you down the repetitive execution spam route, was the core reason for this. There's a good story with an awe-inspiring setting, narratively and visually, which will likely keep you going if you're like me. All in all, it's not a bad game at all and a worthy sequel. It&nbsp;is a decent game, but one that becomes repetitive quite quickly, though fans of this sort of action combat could find it enjoyable.</em></p>
<p>The developers already promised a lengthy <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-reveals-first-year-of-post-launch-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post-launch roadmap</a>, with lots of content coming, as well as frame rate-enhancing features like <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-dlss3-fsr-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA DLSS3 and AMD FSR 3</a>.</p>

<p>When you imagine a side-scrolling adventure, it’s usually not a complex game. You move across the screen, slaying monsters and completing objectives from point A to point B. A few Towerborne tips and tricks should serve you well in your adventures beyond The Belfry, and Insider Gaming intends to take this adventure alongside you!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-towerborne">What is Towerborne?</h2>



<p>Towerborne is a side-scrolling action-adventure game with RPG elements from Stoic, the developers behind The Banner Saga. You take on the role of a hero, an Ace, born of spirits and with incredible abilities to defeat the monsters encroaching upon The Belfry. You’ll venture out—solo or with a party of up to three other players—to explore new lands, acquire powerful gear, and defeat creatures of varying sizes and difficulties. If you intend to venture alone, you can hire Umbra—unique companions joining you in combat and enhancing your abilities.</p>



<p>But it’s not all fighting. Towerborne features an untold number of quests, the ability to reforge your equipment to become more powerful, and other RPG mechanics that promise to keep players enjoying the experience for years, according to the studio.</p>







<h2 id="h-towerborne-tips-and-tricks-for-new-players">Towerborne Tips and Tricks for New Players</h2>

<p>Despite its simplicity on the surface, Towerborne does offer complex mechanics and a few confusing design choices that have new players scratching their heads. We’re here to help with a handful of Towerborne tips and tricks!</p>



<ol>
<li>You don’t need to rush into combat. While the enemies prove squishy in the early game, some of them hit hard. They telegraph their tells, so learn your foe’s moveset, watch for their wind-up, and know when to dodge forward, backward, or strike to interrupt attacks.</li>



<li>Don’t fret over character creation too much, as part of the lore revolves around you being essentially immortal, which means you can alter your appearance anytime you wish from the hub area!</li>



<li>You can switch classes anytime, so long as you’re not in the middle of a mission, so experiment with the four available—Sentinel, Pyroclast, Rockbreaker, and Shadowstriker—to figure out which one meshes well with your preferred play style. They all feature unique abilities and weapons, allowing for plenty of variety.</li>



<li>Learn the game’s various roles and how they fit into a party-based environment. For example, the Sentinel excels as a frontline fighter that takes the brunt of the attack, while the Pyroclast moves up in the second slot to deal heavy damage to groups with its fire-based heavy attacks.</li>
</ol>



<p>As we continue playing Towerborne, we’ll update this tips and tricks guide with additional insights!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Every Game That's Enhanced for PS5 Pro]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/every-game-enhanced-for-ps5-pro</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/every-game-thats-enhanced-for-ps5-pro.977295/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/every-game-enhanced-for-ps5-pro<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>After weeks for speculation and leaks, Sony has officially revealed the PS5 Pro during a nine-minute presentation that touched on some of the enhancements the console will offer. Boasting better GPU performance, advanced ray-tracing, and AI-powered upscaling, the PS5 Pro aims to eliminate the choices many of us currently have to make between performance and fidelity modes. In short, it aims to  give us both of those modes running at the same time, and as part of the reveal we saw glimpses of games that will be enhanced for PlayStation 5 Pro by offering up higher-resolution visuals that run at a smoother 60-frames-per-second.</p><p>Although specific enhancements were mostly kept to first-party Sony games, we did get a broader look at what games will make use of the hardware when it launches. Here’s every game we know so far is going to be enhanced for PS5 Pro.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Game Enhanced for PS5 Pro So Far</h3></div></output><h2>Alan Wake 2</h2><p>Thanks to the power of Remedy’s advanced Northlight engine, Alan Wake 2 was already one of the best-looking games on the PS5 platform. The PS5 Pro will hopefully take it to new heights, especially when it comes to the atmospheric lighting effects in the New York City-like Dark Place.</p><h2>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2><p>Ubisoft has purposefully upgraded the Anvil engine for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, its upcoming feudal Japan-set historical adventure. The added power of the PS5 Pro will hopefully allow that engine to render a sprawling open world at 4K resolution with high frame rates, without having to sacrifice beautiful extras such as gusts of cherry blossom and tree pollen. Running at a steady 60fps will also keep the combat feeling as sharp as Yasuke and Naoe’s blades.</p><h2>Demon’s Souls</h2><p>Despite being a launch title released back in 2020, Demon’s Souls remains one of the most visually arresting games on PS5. The standard version features a Cinematic mode, which has all the bells and whistles tuned on and runs at 4K resolution capped at 30fps, and a Performance mode which drops the resolution to 1440p in order to hit 60fps. The visual difference between the two is only slight, and so most people opt to play in Performance mode considering timing is a vital part of Souls combat. Being able to have the full force of Cinematic mode at 60fps will be a treat if that’s what PS5 Pro delivers.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Dragon’s Dogma 2</h2><p>When it launched earlier this year, Dragon’s Dogma 2 was scrutinised for its choppy performance on console, with 60fps all but impossible to achieve. Sony has yet to detail what to expect from the confirmed PS5 Pro enhancement, but hopefully it brings the framerate up to 60fps so we can enjoy those giant monster battles exactly how they were meant to be. With any luck we’ll also be able to do that at 4K so we can see all the detail rendered by the impressive RE Engine.</p><h2>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</h2><p>Another 2024 game that suffered performance woes, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth is frequently a graphical stunner but is locked in the 30fps jail cell. Shifting from fidelity to performance mode makes the combat run buttery smooth, but it comes at the cost of upsettingly blurry visuals. FF7 Rebirth is a game that deserves to be played in the best situation possible, so best to showcase its gorgeous world design and lovingly rendered characters, and hopefully the PS5 Pro upgrade will unlock its full potential.</p><h2>Gran Turismo 7</h2><p>Gran Turismo 7 already looks pretty damn good on PS5 and runs at a slick 60fps, but on PS5 Pro the main focus looks to be ray tracing, especially between the cars as they race around the tracks. This was demonstrated when a bright yellow Corvette edged past a blue Porsche Cayman GT4, and you could clearly see the reflection of the Corvette in those blue body panels as it passed by. It looks nice, but $700 nice? That’s up to you to decide.</p><h2>Hogwart’s Legacy</h2><p>Hogwart’s Legacy was another game that really showcased the PS5 Pro’s improved ray-tracing capabilities, and when we walked through the doors to the Hogwarts' Great Hall I was almost dazzled by how shiny the stone floor was. In addition to <em>more</em> reflections, we’re promised a <em>greater variety</em> of reflective surfaces, a point that was made as a hippogriff flew gracefully over the Great Lake, the distant hills reflected in the icy waters. Lastly, the ray-tracing will benefit shadows too, promising greater realism.</p><h2>Horizon Forbidden West</h2><p>Guerilla Games’ Horizon Forbidden West was another first-party game showcased during the reveal that, thanks to the improvements of the PS5 Pro, promises to bridge the gap between Performance Mode and Fidelity Mode by taking full advantage of the improved GPU. During the presentation we saw Horizon Forbidden West on PS5 Pro with an improved level of graphical fidelity, from better lighting to more detailed skin and hair texture during cinematics.</p><h2>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</h2><p>Insomniac’s Spider-Man 2 is the benchmark to which all PS5 games aspire to, with high-end graphics and insane performance – but not necessarily at the same time. PlayStation architect Mark Cerny promises that, with the PS5 Pro, a game like Spider-Man 2 will no longer have to choose between performance or graphics, and that Spider-Man 2 will achieve high fidelity graphics at performance mode level of framerate, so you get all that gorgeous detail at a sweet 60fps.</p><h2>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</h2><p>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart was an early PS5 technical marvel, highlighting in particular the kind of whiz-bang effects that were only achieved thanks to the faster SSD loaded in the base console. With the PS5 Pro’s promised improvements, we saw that Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart is now able to maintain that high level of performance and gameplay, while improving the graphics that took a hit to meet peak performance. We even see that the PS5 Pro can hit greater visual details while maintaining the same level of frames during Performance Mode.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>The Crew Motorfest</h2><p>Ubisoft’s online racing game The Crew Motorfest was briefly shown during the montage of games that will be improved thanks to the PS5 Pro. While we don’t have any details on what those specific improvements are, the brief sizzle showed what looked to be improved reflections on the car surfaces, potentially meaning a similar visual improvement to Gran Turismo 7’s graphical upgrade, while maintaining 60fps.</p><h2>The First Descendant</h2><p>Nexon’s free-to-play MMORPG The First Descendant also appeared in the PS5 Pro montage, indicating that it too will receive performance and graphical upgrades with the new console. The clips shown during the sizzle were only from cinematic cutscenes, making it hard to determine what specific improvements will be added, but the PS5 Pro promises to bridge the gap between Performance and Fidelity Mode, so expect to see even greater graphical details while maintaining a consistent higher frame-rate.</p><h2>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</h2><p>During the presentation we saw a side-by-side comparison of The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered running on PS5 Pro alongside the PS5 version in fidelity mode. The wooded environments Eliie explores look as sumptuous and detailed as ever on the Pro, but the key difference is the frame-rate – it runs at 60fps, which looks much smoother compared to the standard PS5 version running at a choppy 30fps. When the presentation compared the original’s performance mode, the difference in detail was obvious – it’s noticeably sharper on PS5 Pro. It’s another clear demonstration that the Pro will offer both high resolution visuals and a smooth framerate, if you’re willing to fork out $700.</p><p>Those are all the games we know will be enhanced for PS5 Pro so far. We’ll be sure to add others when they’re announced. In the meantime, check out how the internet has reacted to the PS5 Pro $700 price point, and check out the console’s reveal trailer.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Photo modes have become a common sight in big-budget games in the years since the release of Dragon Age: Inqusition, but it nevertheless marks an important milestone for BioWare's fantasy series.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/09/image-2-1725923531726.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Manfred is here to introduce Dragon Age: The Veilguard's photo mode.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Happily, Dragon Age: The Veilguard's version of the popular mode has plenty of toys for fans who want to indulge their dreams of being a fantasy photographer. Here's some of what The Veilguard's photo mode has to offer.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Free-roaming camera, tilt, focal length, and lens distortion</li><li>Depth of Field</li><li>Auto Focus</li><li>Distance</li><li>F-Stop, which lets you control the lighting</li><li>Vignette mode, which darkens the edge of the screen and gives it a more cinematic look</li><li>Bloom strength </li><li>Saturation, brightness, and contrast</li><li>The ability to hide the player, the party, enemies, or NPCs</li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dragon Age: The Veilguard - 15 Exclusive Screenshots Taken Using Photo Mode</h3></div></output><p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard's photo mode owes a debt to Mass Effect: The Legendary Edition, which introduced a photo mode of its own when it was released in 2021. Director Corinne Busche credits Mass Effect: Legendary Edition producer Brenon Holmes for getting photo mode implemented into The Veilguard.</p><p>"Not only did he drive this feature, he did a lot of the work to support it," she explained. "What I really like is the tab that lets you hide various characters. So hide character, hide party, hide enemies, hide NPCs. You can really curate the shot to your liking...You might be mid-fight with a dragon, but there’s a character in the way, so you can clear them out.”</p><p>In the slideshow above, you can see some of the pictures we were able to take using Dragon Age: The Veilguard's photo mode, including some of its more atmosphere areas. We also grabbed a shot of a cat that we happened to run across, because we love fantasy cat photos.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Personally I'm enjoying this lady because she's absolutely the type of characters I usually make. <a href="https://t.co/WgmtltzRIp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/WgmtltzRIp</a></p>— *CR* - Dragon Age: Status Effect (@CorbynRed) <a href="https://twitter.com/CorbynRed/status/1831803711167066412?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 5, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>These aren't the only images making the rounds, of course. When we posted our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-watch-22-minutes-of-exclusive-gameplay-diving-into-exploration-and-more-ign-first">exclusive Dragon Age: The Veilguard footage last week</a>, fans were quick to notice the Rooks created by myself and my colleague Alex Stedman. While they weren't taken in photo mode, I can't resist posting them here. The hair in particular just looks incredibly good in these shots.</p><p>We'll have lots more coverage later this week (and throughout the month) as our IGN First for Dragon Age: The Veilguard continues.

                <p>Ubisoft has announced that it will be adding offline modes for The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest. The company announced this along with its Year 2 plans for The Crew Motorfest.</p><p>"...Ubisoft Ivory Tower committed to long-term access for both The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest, ensuring that both games will be playable for many years to come, including in an offline mode coming in the future," Ubisoft said in a <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/1fiTcUyVqBbYf2zM4uhaaR" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>.</p><p>Motorfest's Year 2 starts on November 6 with Season 5 and players will get access to the entire map of Maui for free. There are three Seasons in Year 2, which will have Made in Japan Volume 2 and sees the return of neon-filled races, events, and locations.</p><p>Year 2 will also add The Chase Squad, which is the game's PvE content.

Those who own the Gold and Ultimate Editions of the game will receive access to The Chase Squad as part of the Year 2 pass, as well as unlock 20 additional vehicles.</p><p>The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest receiving offline support is crucial because the online servers for the first Crew game were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-crew-is-delisted-servers-shutting-down-at-the-end-of-march-2024/1100-6519967/" data-ref-id="1100-6519967">shut down back in March</a> after 10 years of support.

What makes <em>MvC3 </em>an incredible game in its own right (and a fantastic companion piece to anyone looking to grab the new collection when it drops) is how it translates the franchise formula into a more modern fighter. But every good fighting game starts with its roster, and <em>MvC3 </em>has an impressive one, with 50 characters to choose from. As is series convention, you get to mix and match the roster into a team of three, creating a wide variety of playstyles that you can essentially tailor to your needs as a player. That roster also includes the introduction of iconic Capcom and Marvel characters like <em>Ace Attorney</em>’s Phoenix Wright, <em>Resident Evil</em>’s Nemesis, and Hawkeye, all of whom are perfect additions.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="667ea9c08302bcf8e34a55dc934bcd02" data-recommend-id="image://667ea9c08302bcf8e34a55dc934bcd02" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dormammu faces off against Tron on the field of battle" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dormammu faces off against Tron on the field of battle" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="667ea9c08302bcf8e34a55dc934bcd02" data-recommend-id="image://667ea9c08302bcf8e34a55dc934bcd02" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dormammu faces off against Tron on the field of battle" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Of course, gameplay is king when it comes to fighting games, so it’s good that <em>MvC3 </em>still delivers in this regard. It continues the fast and frenetic tag team battles of its predecessors with a more refined design. Perhaps the most important change is the introduction of the X-Factor mechanic which lets players move faster, deal higher damage, regenerate more health, and extend combos. It’s a skill that can only be activated once per match by a player and gets stronger the more knocked out characters you have on your team. It’s effectively a hail mary that gives everybody a chance to come back and win it all, making every match feel like a true competition that can turn on a dime at any second.<br></p><p><em>MvC3 </em>also introduced a simplified control scheme that (prior to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-review-world-tour-story-mode-roster-1850481281&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-review-world-tour-story-mode-roster-1850481281"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a></span>’s incredible modern controls) felt like the textbook example of how to make a fighting game more beginner friendly while retaining a focus on strategy. To this day, the three-button scheme makes <em>MvC3 </em>one of the easiest fighting games to pick up. As an added bonus, the transition from pixelated sprites to 3D character models with cel-shading make the world of <em>MvC3 </em>look more like a comic than the series ever had before. It gives the game a unique look that feels in line with the grand multiversal clashes you get to engage in, and hasn’t been matched by any entry in the series before or since. So even if you can’t wait to dive into <em>MvC2 </em>again on September 12, don’t ignore the modern classic that is <em>Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Modern Warfare III &amp; Warzone - The Haunting Season 6 Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr" id="What_to_expect_from_Season_5">What to expect from Season 5</h2><p dir="ltr">A new season of Call of Duty means a brand-new battle pass is on the way. New seasons typically include new operators and two or three weapons in the free tiers of the battle pass.</p><p dir="ltr">This season is themed around Call of Duty's annual Halloween-themed event called The Haunting. This event brings nighttime map variants, zombies-themed game modes, and plenty of spooky operator skins.</p><p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/michael-myers-returns-to-call-of-duty-in-season-6-of-warzone-and-mw3/1100-6526390/">Season 6 trailer for The Haunting</a> reveals a few things players can expect for the season. A spooky nighttime makeover is arriving for Warzone's Rebirth Island map, content themed around zombies, as well as the return of Michael Myers, who was first featured in DLC for Call of Duty: Ghosts.</p><p dir="ltr">Here are the spooky operator skins confirmed in the trailer so far:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Michael Myers</li><li dir="ltr">The scarecrow from Trick 'R Treat</li><li dir="ltr">Art the clown from the Terrifier movies</li><li dir="ltr">Simon "Ghost" Riley as a three-headed abomination</li><li dir="ltr">Makarov sporting a terrifying grin that looks related to the Smile movie</li><li dir="ltr">Bubby the mascot from Call of Duty's fictional Burger Town</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Michael Myers is featured on the Season 6 key art along with Farah. Characters featured on the seasonal promo art are usually the battle-pass operators, so players will likely be able to unlock the slasher-film icon with just the standard battle-pass purchase. The other horror-themed skins will probably be store bundles.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the past seasons of MW3 have included several events for unlocking free cosmetic items, such as camos, weapon blueprints, and calling cards. This will likely continue in Season 6. More aftermarket parts and weekly challenges are expected as well.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4364945-thehaunting-season6launchtrailer_callofduty_warzone%26modernwarfareiii1-27screenshot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4364945" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4364945-thehaunting-season6launchtrailer_callofduty_warzone%26modernwarfareiii1-27screenshot.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4364945"></a><figcaption>Art the clown</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4364945-thehaunting-season6launchtrailer_callofduty_warzone%26modernwarfareiii1-27screenshot.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Modern_Warfare_3">Modern Warfare 3</h2><p dir="ltr">Nothing is specifically confirmed for MW3's multiplayer. The Haunting usually adds game modes themed around zombies, such as Hordepoint and Infected.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 5 included the final Zombies story mission for Modern Warfare 3's Dark Aether narrative, so any new content coming to the mode will likely be themed around new schematics and Dark Aether rift unlocks.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Warzone">Warzone</h2><p dir="ltr">The only thing the trailer confirmed for battle royale so far is the eerie nighttime variant of the Rebirth Island map. It's possible Warzone could bring back past Zombies-themed modes like Vondead and Zombie Royale.</p><p dir="ltr">With Season 6 starting mid-September, it's possible the season will overlap and continue past the launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on October 25. Here is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/">everything announced for Black Ops 6</a>, including campaign details, Zombies, and Warzone integration with the new Area 99 map.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-ps5-pro-costs-700-dollars-and-still-looks-like-that.977220/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/ps5-pro-700-dollars-looks-bad<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The PS5 has been a monstrous, gargantuan eyesore the whole time I’ve had it. Few consoles are this ugly, a joke that has been made to death but which I will take the opportunity to clown on again: it looks like if Zaha Hadid’s ghost was forced to design a console in hell. There was ultimately one situation in which I was going to buy a PS5 Pro any time soon, a merciful out that the PS3 had when Sony made the PS3 slim, and that was just to make it look normal, like something a “professional” would have. Sony has instead opted to say no, it still looks like that, fuck you. Also, we put little fins on it, plus it costs $699.99 USD and does not ship with a disc drive.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="PS5 Pro Technical Presentation hosted by Mark Cerny" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X24BzyzQQ-8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Today, Mark Cerny unveiled the PS5 Pro in a technical presentation, and laid out the case for the existence of the device focusing on three points: more GPU power, better raytracing and Playstation specific AI-driven upscaling. I am sure there is a lot of fascinating technology under the hood of the PS5 Pro that I would care about. I spent three months comparing the performance of PC fans, so I am a mark for this stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><p>I know people are tempted to say “PS5 games look good already” and largely that is correct, but as someone who constantly goes back and forth between performance mode and fidelity mode, the PS5 does so by making a ton of compromises. Raytracing is something that a very small demographic of people want or notice, although I think people largely agree that it has been largely oversold. And though AI has become a catch-all term for rancid technology, AI upscaling in games has proven to be one of the most legitimate use cases. Cerny refers to this as Playstation Spectral Super Resolution or PSSR, and technologies like FSR and DLSS are proven technologies here. I am not so bold as to say there is no market for any of this.</p><p>But man. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BOHqG1nc_tw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$699.99 USD</a>! Woof! You can practically hear Kaz Hirai’s voice booming that MSRP in your head with the reverb of a grand cathedral.</p></div><div><figure><p><iframe title="PlayStation 5 Pro Console - Reveal Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6HaRMiTfvks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I get that Apple and basically every cell phone maker has shown that a dedicated and sufficiently locked-in user base is willing to pay whatever premium to get the latest new toy. They’ll eat that slop! I also recognize that the cost of technology has changed. $700 dollars isn’t going to snag you a perfect gaming PC these days, although if you’re in for that much money you’re getting there! I will even acknowledge the argument for shifting away from discs and moving those resources to other parts of the device, although its omission feels particularly annoying for people who want to use the device for Blu-rays (although <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24240906/sony-ps5-pro-disc-drive-separate-price" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can add one on for $79.99!</a>). But Sony isn’t Apple; the phone upgrade ecosystem is different and at least Apple knows how to visually distinguish its products so the consumer goes “Oh hey, something new!”&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>You gotta give me something to work with here, Mark. I need a box that isn’t a monstrosity. I need something that lays down on its side normally and isn’t embarrassing to look at. You can do that while still keeping the strange design language of the PS5. I am a professional; I need a computer. Maybe they’re saving that for the PS6 or something, but that attitude does not instill confidence in me!&nbsp;</p><p>The PS3 level of hubris on display here is what gets me.&nbsp; When the PlayStation 5 launched it was a console that had one very good <em>Astro </em>game, and years later they added racing stripes to it and it has two very good <em>Astro</em> games. The case that has been made for the PlayStation ecosystem, even within their own technical demo, has become increasingly thin to the point where <em>Astro Bot </em>(as good as it is) can sometimes feel like a wake more than a celebration. But they can do that because they’re Sony and what’re you gonna do, buy an Xbox? Microsoft is mainly interested in being an AI blood cult until the market finally craters and punches a hole in the tech industry it may never recover from.&nbsp;</p><p>I am trying to imagine who the PS5 Pro is for, a person with enough disposable income to want high quality graphics, but not enough interest in a gaming PC. I know this person exists; I have met them. But I am skeptical that enough of them have 700 dollars kicking around to justify this, particularly when it still. Looks. Like. This.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There only appears to be one version of the PS5 Pro. </p><h2 id="h56269"><a id=""></a>What do I get for that price? </h2><p>The PS5 Pro includes a 2TB SSD, a DualSense controller, a digital copy of <em>Astro’s Playroom</em>, and of course, the new console.</p><h2 id="h56270"><a id=""></a><strong>Can I pre-order it now?</strong></h2><p>Not yet! But Sony says pre-orders will go live on September 26. </p><h2 id="h56271"><a id=""></a>Wait, there was a presentation about the PS5 Pro? Can I watch it still?</h2><p>Yes. Here you go. It’s about 9 minutes long. Enjoy. </p><h2 id="h56272"><a id=""></a><strong>How powerful is it?</strong></h2><p>Mark Cerny, the lead architect of the PS5, claims it’s the most powerful PlayStation console ever made. It features 28% more RAM, and a more powerful GPU with 67% more Compute Units. In the presentation, Sony says this will lead to 45% faster rendering.</p><h2 id="h56273"><a id=""></a><strong>What New Features Does It Have?</strong></h2><p>The PS5 Pro will support PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution AI upscaling. This is basically Sony’s spin on AMD’s FSR and Nvidia’s DLSS upscaling tech and will be exclusive to PS5. </p><p>In theory, this should let you run games at higher framerates without having to sacrifice high-end visual settings. It will also include WiFi 7.</p><h2 id="h56274"><a id=""></a><strong>Does it still look kinda silly like the OG PS5?</strong></h2><p>Yeah... <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-ps5-does-not-look-good-1844002748&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-ps5-does-not-look-good-1844002748">it still looks bulbous and a bit odd</a></span>.

(But basically, no games support 8K...yet.) </p><h2 id="h56277"><a id=""></a><strong>What games are getting PS5 Pro upgrades?</strong></h2><p>According to PlayStation, a lot of games will see performance and visual boosts on PS5 Pro. We saw <em>Last of Us Part 2, Ratchet And Clank: Rift Apart,</em> and <em>Spider-Man 2 </em>running better and looking nicer during the short video. </p><p>Sony also listed a number of games that will receive updates to become “PS5 Pro Enhanced” including: <em> Alan Wake 2, Assassin’s Creed: Shadows, Demon’s Souls, Dragon’s Dogma 2, Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth, Gran Turismo 7, Hogwarts Legacy, Horizon Forbidden West, The Crew Motorfest, </em>and <em>The First Descendant.</em><br></p><p>Additionally, the company says “8,500 backward compatible PS4 games” will see performance boosts on PS5 Pro, too. </p><h2 id="h56278"><a id=""></a><strong>Will there be PS5-Pro-only games?</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>No mention of that during the video or in the blog. I’d say its unlikely. The PS4 Pro never got exclusive games. This isn’t a new console, just a more powerful PS5. </p><h2 id="h56279"><a id=""></a><strong>Does it support my current PS5 controllers and accessories? </strong></h2><p>Yup! Sony says PS5 Pro will support all accessories currently available. </p><h2 id="h56280"><a id=""></a><strong>Do I need a PS5 Pro?</strong></h2><p>Do you care about raytraced reflections, higher-quality shadows, 60 fps, and improved draw distances? If not, then you can probably just continue to enjoy your PS5 and not worry about this upgraded machine. </p><h2 id="h56281"><a id=""></a><strong> Is this a PS6?</strong></h2><p>No, but it does make me worry about how much <em>that thing </em>will cost in a few years...</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In Jiaoqiu’s case, <strong>Those Many Springs</strong> is the ideal choice. It provides a massive buff to Effect Hit Rate and allows him to apply additional debuffs that increase the damage taken by enemies. </p><p>Two more excellent 5-star options are <strong>Incessant Rain</strong> and <strong>Reforged Remembrance</strong>, which are the limited-time Light Cones available alongside Silver Wolf and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/honkai-star-rail-black-swan-light-cone-relic-team-build-1851238822&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/honkai-star-rail-black-swan-light-cone-relic-team-build-1851238822">Black Swan</a></span>.

The former provides simple buffs to both Effect Hit Rate and DoT, while the latter can inflict a debuff on enemies that will lower their DEF. </p><h2 id="h56287"><a id=""></a>Which Traces to prioritize</h2><p>Playing Jiaoqiu revolves around stacking his Ashen Roast debuff as consistently as possible. Managing this can feel a little difficult at times, but focusing on certain traces will make it far easier. These are the best ones to invest in.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Quarter Finesse, Octave Finery – Upgrading his talent will increase how much DMG enemies will receive thanks to the Ashen Roast stacks. Considering that this debuff is the core of his strategy, it’s vital to prioritize this trace.</li><li>Pyrograph Arcanum – Nearly as important as Jiaoqiu’s talent is his Ultimate. Upgrading this trace will increase the initial DMG dealt by the attack, along with the increases to general Ultimate DMG and the chance of applying Ashen Roast while the zone is active.</li><li>Seared Scent – This bonus ability is the perfect addition to his Ultimate. Any enemies that enter combat while the Zone is active will have Ashen Roast stacks applied to them, equal to the highest amount on the field.</li></ul><h2 id="h56288"><a id=""></a>Best Jiaoqiu Relic Sets</h2><figure id="" data-id="acab61eeceeadaf0095c6f38ce701651" data-recommend-id="image://acab61eeceeadaf0095c6f38ce701651" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1044" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two full relic and planar ornament sets displayed on the Relics screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two full relic and planar ornament sets displayed on the Relics screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="acab61eeceeadaf0095c6f38ce701651" data-recommend-id="image://acab61eeceeadaf0095c6f38ce701651" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1044" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two full relic and planar ornament sets displayed on the Relics screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Finding the right relics for Jiaoqiu isn’t as obvious as it is for other characters. It will all come down to what kind of team you’re placing him on. Even then, you’ll likely need to mix and match with different sets to make for the best build. Here are the ideal Relic and Planar Ornament sets to enhance Jiaoqiu.&nbsp;</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Prisoner in Deep Confinement is a great choice if you want to increase Jiaoqiu’s damage output. Having two pieces increases ATK by 12 percent, while four pieces will ignore enemy DEF depending on how many DoTs they have. The only caveat is that the four-piece effect will be more efficient if your team can inflict up to three DoT debuffs on enemies.</li><li>Messenger Traversing Hackerspace can be a huge help if you need him to move a bit faster. The two-piece effect increases SPD by 6 percent, which is beneficial as a Support character. You likely won’t get as much use from the four-piece effect, so I recommend pairing this with the previously mentioned Prisoner in Deep Confinement.</li><li>Sprightly Vonwacq is a fantastic Planar Ornament set to equip. It increases Energy Regen by 5 percent and will boost Jiaoqiu’s action at the beginning of the battle if his SPD stat is 120 or higher. Having him go first at the start of every battle is ideal so that he can set up his debuffs.</li></ul><p>Few <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> characters are capable of overwhelming enemies the way Jiaoqiu can. The abundance of debuffs he can offload is the perfect setup for other characters to take advantage of. If you enjoy melting your opponents with stacks of debuffs and DoT, Jiaoqiu is a satisfying Support for your teams. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is primarily emphasized by her talent, which increases the maximum number of usable skill points, and her ultimate, which recovers skill points for the team. Both of these, in addition to her talent ability, increase ally DMG. Whether you’ve only just managed to unlock Sparkle through her banner’s rerun, or need a refresher on how to use her more efficiently, here are my build guidelines for this excellent support.<br></p><h2 id="h8860"><a id=""></a>Best Sparkle team composition</h2><figure id="" data-id="9860a1e5e3758bf1d8317e692b5c616c" data-recommend-id="image://9860a1e5e3758bf1d8317e692b5c616c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1046" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Four characters on the Team Screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Four characters on the Team Screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9860a1e5e3758bf1d8317e692b5c616c" data-recommend-id="image://9860a1e5e3758bf1d8317e692b5c616c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1046" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Four characters on the Team Screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> If you have teams, or even a single character that can easily hog skill points, Sparkle can make a difference. You’ll get the most bang for your buck by using her on a team with other Quantum characters, thanks to one of her bonus abilities that increases their ATK. Nevertheless, she’ll shine no matter who she’s paired with. </p><p>  <strong>Two DPS Quantum characters that will reap the most benefits are Seele and Qingque.</strong> Both can become real powerhouses with all the different DMG and ATK buffs. The extra skill points can also help Seele land her skill ability more often, and let Qingque search more often for matching tiles with her skill. I will concede that not being able to find a matching tile after spending additional points is one of the most disappointing feelings I’ve had while playing though.</p><p><strong>When it comes to DPS characters of different types, Acheron and Imbibitor Lunae certainly come to mind.</strong> Acheron will make great use of the buffs and benefit from being advanced forward by Sparkle’s skill. The recently released Jiaoqiu is also a great secondary Support for an Acheron-centered team. Imbibitor Lunae will benefit for the above reasons, on top of being able to burn through skill points to deal more damage. </p><p>  <strong>Lynx and Fu Xuan are the optimal choices for your healer role.</strong> Extra skill points will ensure Lynx can heal far more often. Fu Xuan doesn’t need to use her skill that much, which means the rest of your team will have plenty of points available. They’ll each be able to trigger Sparkle’s Bonus ability to buff Quantum characters as well, which is great news if you have a DPS of the same type. </p><h2 id="h8861"><a id=""></a>Best Sparkle Light Cones</h2><figure id="" data-id="bbc9f466ba24d305daa52991b083325f" data-recommend-id="image://bbc9f466ba24d305daa52991b083325f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1046" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A card called Past and Future is shown on the Light Cone screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A card called Past and Future is shown on the Light Cone screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bbc9f466ba24d305daa52991b083325f" data-recommend-id="image://bbc9f466ba24d305daa52991b083325f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1046" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A card called Past and Future is shown on the Light Cone screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are quite a few Light Cone options for Sparkle, but the most effective are those that support other characters. Here are the top choices to make her an even bigger asset.</p><p><strong>Earthly Escapade</strong> is the 5-star light cone that runs alongside Sparkle’s banner, and just like other 5-star characters such as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/honkai-star-rail-yunli-build-guide-1851632557&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/honkai-star-rail-yunli-build-guide-1851632557">Yunli</a></span>, the related light cone is the best choice. What makes Earthly Escapade a standout is that it provides huge buffs to Crit Rate and Crit DMG.<br></p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/honkai-star-rail-yunli-build-guide-1851632557&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/honkai-star-rail-yunli-build-guide-1851632557">Master Counters With the Best Yunli Build for <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em></a></span></p><p>The next best option is the 5-star light cone, <strong>The Battle Isn’t Over</strong>. It will increase energy regen for the wearer and regenerate a skill point whenever they use their ultimate. More importantly, the next ally after Sparkle uses her skill will deal more damage for one turn. This pairs nicely with her skill which will advance the ally that she chooses. The only caveat here is that this is Bronya’s featured light cone, so you might be waiting a while to get it.</p><p>If you want a more accessible version of the above light cone, <strong>Past and Future</strong> is a wonderful alternative. The simple thing it does is increase the next ally’s damage after the wearer uses their skill. It’s not as strong of a buff, but it’s easier to gather these from the Forgotten Hall than it is to hope RNG is on your side for a limited-time item.<br></p><h2 id="h8862"><a id=""></a>Which Traces to prioritize</h2><p>Everything in Sparkle’s kit is helpful, but some aspects are better prioritized than others. Here are the Traces to look out for when you’re upgrading.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Red Herring – Upgrading her talent will increase how much the team-wide damage buff will be whenever an ally uses a skill point. Considering how skill-heavy most Sparkle teams are, this ability will constantly be in play and should be upgraded</li><li>The Hero with a Thousand Faces – While you can’t improve how many skill points are recovered, upgrading Sparkle’s ultimate does affect the additional DMG boost to her talent. Both of these should be upgraded together</li><li>Artificial Flower – This bonus ability extends Sparkle’s Crit DMG buff until the start of the ally’s next turn. On paper, this doesn’t sound too impressive, but it can help with any awkward timing issues, depending on everyone’s SPD stat</li><li>Nocturne – If you’re building a mono-Quantum team, this is a necessary bonus ability. The base 15 percent ATK increase for all allies is great already, but it goes further by boosting Quantum characters’ ATK by 5-30 percent depending on how many are on the team</li></ul><h2 id="h8863"><a id=""></a>Best Sparkle Relic Sets</h2><figure id="" data-id="ea17794d73c0c6041b5e3822eff750c5" data-recommend-id="image://ea17794d73c0c6041b5e3822eff750c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1047" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Relics screen for Sparkle with full relic and planar ornament sets." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Relics screen for Sparkle with full relic and planar ornament sets." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ea17794d73c0c6041b5e3822eff750c5" data-recommend-id="image://ea17794d73c0c6041b5e3822eff750c5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1047" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Relics screen for Sparkle with full relic and planar ornament sets." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Equipping the best Relic and Planar Ornament sets isn’t too difficult. All you have to keep in mind is that Sparkle needs to be fast, and needs to increase ally DMG. I’ve listed the preferred options below.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Messenger Traversing Hackerspace is a must-have for nearly every build. The 6 percent SPD increase is solid, and the four-piece effect can boost the entire team’s SPD further by 12 percent. Sparkle is just plain better with these relics</li><li>If you don’t care about team SPD, then Musketeer of Wild Wheat is a decent alternative. Its two-piece effect increases ATK by 12 percent while the four-piece increases SPD by 6 percent and Basic ATK by 10 percent</li><li>Broken Keel can fit in perfectly as long as a particular stat is high enough. The first part of the planar ornament increases the wearer’s effect RES by 10 percent. If this stat reaches the minimum of 30 percent, the whole team will enjoy a 10 percent increase in Crit DMG. Sparkle’s skill will buff a selected ally’s Crit DMG based on a percentage of her own, meaning this ornament can make the skill far more deadly</li></ul><p>Sparkle might have taken six months to return, but she’s easily still one of the best Support characters in <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>. Her utility is second only to Ruan Mei, and even that might be arguable depending on what kind of teams you prefer. Unless her banner rerun goes against a character that completely changes the game, I can’t imagine a better use for your Stellar Jade and Star Rail Special Passes. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s a platform game that’s inherently extremely silly, and embraces that with a series of challenging screens that don’t feel any need to judge or punish when you mess up. This is largely because you’re playing a knight who can only move by swinging his sword.</p><p>This means that if you want to move to your right, you need to swipe at the ground to your left. This propels you against the force of your swing, bouncing you in the opposite direction. Using this, with a combination of powerful swings and littler ones, you need to negotiate your way through a world of ledges and platforms, littered with spikes and obstacles that’ll shatter you on contact. Why? Because you’re on your way to a barbecue, of course.<br></p><p>Failure comes often, but a split-second instant restart means you’re not left staring at a “GAME OVER” or frustrated by the game’s gloating.

But developers Brynjar Á and Sindri H, both 19 years old, have absolutely nailed it. Movement is natural and satisfying, no matter how daft it is in conception.

Pulling the analogue stick in the opposite direction that you want to move is obviously tricky to get used to, and then ever-more-so when you’re trying to wall-bounce up a shaft, before sproinging onto a temporary platform in order to bounce off a spike, and so on. But most bizarre was how any time I landed on a safe, flat piece of ground, I would immediately try to just run left or right, despite this at no point being a game that ever lets you do that. The whole thing is an exercise in rebelling against your instincts.</p><p>I’d say there’s a solid hour here if you’re rubbish like me, and probably less than half an hour for people who breeze through games like <em>Celeste</em>. But even though at one point I got a WhatsApp from my wife downstairs asking “Are you ok?” (to which I replied, “Yes, shhhhhhhhh.”), it never crossed from feeling frustrated with myself to feeling frustrated with the game. Oh, and I finished it! I don’t know if that means it’s too easy, or if I’m finally getting better at this sort of thing. I’d assume the former.</p><p>Wondering why something quite so good was quite so free of charge, I got in touch with the Icelandic developers. Brynjar and his development partner Sindri made this game in a gap year between finishing high school and starting college. They were already working on their biggest project yet (“I mean more than a month long”), when they were inspired by a side-effect of a mechanic they saw in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV0s442AbMQ&amp;t=9s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV0s442AbMQ&amp;t=9s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sara Spalding video</a></span>, and thought it was underused in her game.</p><figure id="" data-id="d23915dc40604ea12d187aa4ed58e109" data-recommend-id="image://d23915dc40604ea12d187aa4ed58e109" data-format="jpg" data-width="2132" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A bucolic opening scene, before you attempt any platforms." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A bucolic opening scene, before you attempt any platforms." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Brynjar Á, Sindri H / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d23915dc40604ea12d187aa4ed58e109" data-recommend-id="image://d23915dc40604ea12d187aa4ed58e109" data-format="jpg" data-width="2132" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A bucolic opening scene, before you attempt any platforms." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“As soon as I saw it,” Brynjar told me by email, “I thought to myself that you could make an entire game out of just that mechanic alone, you wouldn’t even need to walk! Which was a very interesting and appealing idea to me, a platformer without walking.”</p><p>When he realized Spalding’s game wasn’t using the conceit itself, he was inspired to do it himself. “At around 3 a.m., fueled by a spark of inspiration, sleep deprivation and frustration from the underutilisation of the mechanic, I jumped into Godot and prototyped my idea,” Brynjar continues, “making the recoil bounce and adding controller support. And to my surprise it was very fun, even with just an empty level with some blocks scattered around.”</p><p>Recognizing that his art skills weren’t up to the project, he teamed up with Sindri, the two teenagers finishing the project before starting college a few weeks ago—where the pair are studying game development and VFX.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3030210/SlashJump/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3030210/SlashJump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Slash/Jump</em> is completely free</a></span> via Steam and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://brynkilius.itch.io/slashjump&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://brynkilius.itch.io/slashjump" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Itch</a></span>, and well worth your time.

This particular feat of strength happened on Diablo 4's current test server, where Blizzard is testing out the game's numerous patch 2.0 changes that will launch alongside its upcoming Vessel of Hatred expansion.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXXuWP6hkOM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SXXuWP6hkOM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Funnily enough, part of the 2.0 update is tailored around <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-may-have-players-deal-less-damage-and-that-could-be-good/1100-6525197/" data-ref-id="1100-6525197">reducing player levels and scaling down many of the numbers in the game</a> to make them more readable. As Rob2628 has shown, that doesn't look to be going exactly to plan, though they are quick to point out that the absurdly high damage numbers they achieved seem to be thanks to a bug--one that will almost certainly be fixed prior to the 2.0 update's official release.</p><p dir="ltr">To achieve the feat, Rob2628 stacked gear with Thorns and Maximum Life, took advantage of the Barbarian's new Thorns-focused Key Passive Barbed Carapace (which grants more Thorns as a player continues to attack), and managed to gain 31 ranks of the Tough as Nails passive skill (which increases Thorns damage and has a chance to cause enemies to take additional bleed damage).</p><p dir="ltr">Rob2628 also took advantage of two of the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-getting-diablo-2-style-runewords-so-you-can-make-your-own-spells/1100-6526197/" data-ref-id="1100-6526197">Runewords being introduced in Vessel of Hatred</a>: one that gives them more life (and thus more Thorns) and one that creates an earthquake while standing still. All the while Rob2628's Barbarian continues to use their high amount of attack speed and Fury generation to use the Barbarian's Whirlwind ability without stopping, making sure the Thorn damage continues to scale to higher and higher heights until it eventually surpasses the amount of damage the game can display. He defeats the game's greatest challenge, a boss on Tier 100 of the Pit, in an instant.</p><p dir="ltr">"This can pretty much speed-farm everything in the game, obviously, because we have infinite damage," Rob2628 said in a video breaking down the accomplishment.</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4's 2.0 update and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-coming-october-4-new-trailer-revealed/1100-6524085/" data-ref-id="1100-6524085">Vessel of Hatred expansion releases on October 8</a>.

That nugget of information comes via a <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/ps5-pro-hands-on-sonys-699-turbo-console-hits-in-november/">report from CNET</a>, which chatted with PlayStation's lead system architect Mark Cerny ahead of today's PS5 Pro reveal. So far, Sony has only officially named 13 games set to recieve PS5 Pro upgrades on launch day, meaning there's still plenty more to be shared. Those game, incidentally, are as follows:

<ul>
<li>Alan Wake 2</li>
<li>Assassin's Creed: Shadows</li>
<li>Demon's Souls</li>
<li>Dragon’s Dogma 2</li>
<li>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</li>
<li>Gran Turismo 7</li>
<li>Hogwarts Legacy</li>
<li>Horizon Forbidden West</li>
<li>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</li>
<li>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</li>
<li>The Crew Motorfest</li>
<li>The First Descendant</li>
<li>The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered </li>
</ul>
<p>
Some of those freshly enhanced titles got an airing during today's PS5 Pro reveal, with announced upgrades ranging from a fidelity mode frame rate boost from 30fps to 60fps for numerous titles - including The Last of Us Part 2, Marvel's Spider-man 2, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ratchet-clank-rift-apart">Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</a> - alongside more substantial enhancements elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7</a>, for instance, will gain ray tracing reflections between cars during gameplay on PS5 Pro, all while still targeting 60fps, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a> is getting an upgrade with improvements to lighting and visual effects, as well as enhanced hair and skin in cinematics. One game not mentioned in Sony's annoucement but shown to CNET during its demo is EA's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/f1-24">F1 24</a>, which will reportedly also recieve new ray tracing effects during races.
</p>
<p>
Notably, however, Sony is yet to announce enhancements for any of its PSVR 2 titles, which is unlikely to instil confidence in fans worried about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-hard-to-stay-excited-about-the-playstation-vr2-if-even-astro-bot-wont-wear-one">what feels like an increasingly neglected platform</a>. But Mark Cerny did at least note to CNET that higher-resolution games will be possible on PSVR 2 thanks to PS5 Pro's GPU boost and owners can "eventually" expect a "tuning of Sony's AI upscaling that will work with all VR games".
