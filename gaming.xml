            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeon-stalkers-early-access-fall<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Action Square and pubilsher Hybe IM have announced that&nbsp;<em>Dungeon Stalkers</em>, a PvPvE dungeon-crawling action RPG that's gunning for&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker</em>'s crown, will launch into Early Access this fall.</p>
<p>In a press release, the studios say that after tests throughout last year and in May of this year,&nbsp;<em>Dungeon Stalkers&nbsp;</em>will undergo "several beta testing rounds" for the rest of 2024 before being released sometime in fall.</p>
<p>A number of changes have been made to the game since its initial debut in testing, and I'm assuming these changes will make an appearance in the final game. They include the introduction of a tutorial, a number of character and skill balance changes, and quality-of-life improvements, plus lots more.</p>

<p>The video, which is in Korean with English subtitles, sees chief producer Daehoon Han discussing&nbsp;<em>Dungeon Stalkers</em>' combat, its lore, and the reasons behind an Early Access release, among other things.</p>
<p>If you've got any interest in&nbsp;<em>Dungeon Stalkers</em>, it's worth taking a look at this video, as it provides some pretty interesting insights into how Action Square is bringing its dungeon-crawling vision to life. You can check out the&nbsp;<em>Dungeon Stalkers&nbsp;</em>making-of video right here.</p>

<p><em>Dungeon Stalkers&nbsp;</em>is a multiplayer action-RPG with a focus on PvPvE dungeon crawling and strategic combat.</p>
<p>Like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dark-and-darker">other games</a> in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeonborne-playtest-early-access">the genre</a>, your goal is to explore a dungeon, combing it for loot and defeating any enemies you find before attempting to escape with what you've amassed.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most unique twist on the genre you'll find here is the Witch's Curse mechanic, which "periodically bestows curses" on players in order to add an element of randomness and keep you on your toes.</p>
<p><em>Dungeon Stalkers&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2468730/Dungeon_Stalkers/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> sometime this fall. Watch this space for more info.</p>

It was only last year that we played <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/double-dragon-gaiden-rise-of-the-dragons/tag-team-turmoil">Double Dragon Gaiden</a>, a pixelated throwback brawler (or belt-scroll action game, the game's official YouTube description describes it) take on the franchise.</p>

<p>This next entry is decidedly more modern with fully 3D visuals. It's not the first time the series has explored this dimension, but it is a rare occurrence. The game is being developed by Yuke's, the developer that worked on the WWE 2K franchise until WWE 2K19. It is being published, or presented by, as the trailer implies, Arc System Works, the developer behind Guilty Gear and Dragon Ball FighterZ.</p>

<p>Double Dragon Revive is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and One, and PC sometime in 2025.</p>

<p>For a whole lot more on Double Dragon, but maybe not the version of Double Dragon you're thinking, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/02/20/double-dragon-the-forgotten-bad-video-game-movie">head here</a> to read all about the 1994 movie. Back in 2019, I tracked down the film's director, James Yukich, to talk about the bizarre film's trajectory, what went wrong, and what he would have done differently had he been giving a chance to try making the film again.</p>

            <p>
Frontier has officially announced Planet Coaster 2, the sequel to its popular theme park management game.
</p>
<p>
The studio has been teasing news for the past couple of days on its <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/frontier">Twitch channel</a>, with an ongoing stream of park noises. Now it's shown a short in-engine teaser and revealed water parks will be a major new inclusion.
</p>
<p>
The game will be released this autumn, with a full gameplay reveal set for 31st July.

<p>

Players will be able to create lazy rivers, flumes, wave pools, and water coasters, plus changing rooms, sunbeds and lifeguards will be required.
</p>
<p>
The sequel will also include enhanced tools that build on its predecessor, to allow players to create rollercoasters piece-by-piece, as well as enhanced pathing tools, and an enhanced event sequencer tool to combine animatronics, smoke, water jets, sound and more.
</p>
<p>
The game will consist of three modes: Career mode to complete various scenarios; Franchise mode to build a global park network; and a freestyle Sandbox mode.

</p>
<p>
Planet Coaster 2 will launch across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. New details will be revealed on the last Wednesday of each month ahead of release during Frontier Unlocked livestreams.

<p>
The first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-coaster-review">Planet Coaster</a> was released in 2016 and proved immensely popular for its detailed creation tools. Frontier followed this with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-zoo-releases-for-consoles-in-march">Planet Zoo</a> in 2019, as well as two <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jurassic-world-evolution-review-a-beautiful-overly-brutal-park-sim">Jurassic World Evolution</a> games.

            <p>Sony has opened up the early access beta for its upcoming 5v5 sci-fi shooter Concord to all PlayStation Plus users.</p>
<p>Initially, this beta access was only going to be available to those who had already pre-ordered the game (you can find out more about the editions available and pricing in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-sonys-live-service-sci-fi-shooter-concord-will-launch-with-a-35-price-tag">Matt's story here</a>).</p>
<p>Those in the UK interested in trying out the early access beta can get it pre-downloaded from 6pm this evening (11th July). It will then be available to play from 6pm tomorrow, with cross play support for PS5 and PC. Sony said PS Plus users should look out for the option to download and play the Concord beta when they start up their PlayStation 5s.</p>

<p>"During the early access and open beta, all 16 of our launch Freegunners will be unlocked and available to play and customise," <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/11/concord-beta-early-access-preload-and-server-times-pc-specs-and-more-detailed/">developer Firewalk</a> said in a blog post accompanying today's news.</p>
<p>"Whether you want to snipe from afar, lock down an area, provide support for your teammates, or... just dive head-first into the fight, our roster of Freegunners has something for everyone."</p>
<p>There will also be four maps to try out during the early access beta, and three modes: Clash Point, Trophy Hunt and Cargo Run.</p>
<p>When Firewalk then hosts Concord's open beta weekend (which runs from 18th - 21st July), it will add another new mode known as Area Control, and a new map called Bone Mines.</p><p>

"If you plan on joining us for both early access and open beta, your progress will carry over between the weekends," the team said. "However, please keep in mind that your progress from either beta will not carry over to our official launch on 23rd August."

<p>Our Chris went hands on with Concord earlier this year. "Concord can't help but feel like many of the other competent games made by other highly competent former-developers of other big, successful multiplayer games," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-feels-like-a-load-of-brilliant-games-combined-but-is-that-enough">Eurogamer's Concord preview</a>.</p>
<p>"In other words: a game that places individual moments of that high-level competency within its various disciplines - diverse, fleshed-out characters! Satisfying gunfeel! Intelligently-limited verticality! Sensible environment design! No gameplay-affecting microtransactions! - above an overall uniqueness of vision that binds it together."</p>

We meet the characters separately, but the short scenes reveal a great deal about the nature of each character, and by the end of the episode, we see them cross paths, at least casually.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Supacell</em> is an exploration of survival and synchronicity. While the initial episode focuses on the character of Michael (Tosin Cole), we observe the emergence of each superhero throughout. As indicated in the teaser for the show, you can tell someone’s superpowers are activated or currently active by their eyes—they turn yellow.</p><h2 id="h21213"><a id=""></a>Red vs. blue and complementary lyrics, too</h2><p>Most scenes in <em>Supacell</em> feature a prominent color, either in the lighting or in an object in the scene. One scene features a blue car, for instance, in which a man tells his partner that the blue is her color and her skin looks good next to it. </p><p>Red is also an important color in the show, relating to the prevalence of violence, the presence of Sickle Cell Disease in the Black community (see below), and the untapped vitality of the community. <em>Supacell</em> isn’t shy about showing the consequences of violence, even in the first scene, which, without much context, shows a sinister white man drinking out of a mug in a facility where Black people are imprisoned in cells.</p><p>In a scene set in a club where gang members are present, “Talkin’ da Hardest” by Giggs plays, and the song’s lyrics mirror what the characters experience. “Everyone’s suit same color as Batman” references both the importance of tones and skin color to the show, but also foreshadows the awakening of superpowers for the characters.</p><p>The song goes on to mention being covered in red, implying violence, and the entire scene as well as the clothes the characters are wearing add more red to the scene. Their opposition gang shows up wearing blue, as do many of the initially unconnected characters, such as a healthcare worker and a delivery man.</p><h2 id="h21214"><a id=""></a>Black as the norm</h2><p>Almost every character in the show is Black. When white characters do show up, it’s typically as a symbol of oppression or oversight, and they have a sinister feel to them even if they’re not openly exhibiting racist or otherwise problematic behavior. There’s also sometimes a mystery to them; whereas the Black characters share feelings and emotions with each other, the white characters appear calculating and deliberate. </p><figure id="" data-id="f261115226abd79e2289b78d606f4cde" data-recommend-id="image://f261115226abd79e2289b78d606f4cde" data-format="jpg" data-width="2279" data-height="1283" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A vibrant blue BMW on a London city street, with a Black woman in the passenger seat and a man standing next to it.

When white characters observe Black characters, take notice of them, or recognize them as people in any way, there’s a possibility of bad intent or suspicion. I appreciate the clear view of distrust coupled with the obvious reasons it’s necessary.<br></p><h2 id="h21215"><a id=""></a>The system is rigged, surveillance is reality</h2><p>The prevalence of drugs and other alternative economies in the show is depicted as clearly a product of a rigged system. Characters never randomly engage in illegal activity— there’s always a reason, and it usually has to do with making a living in a racist society. Overall, white characters observe and “supervise,” but life has to go on for the Black characters in this framework.</p><p>If white people aren’t actually present and observing, there are sometimes surveillance devices, some of which pick up superhuman activities. Hopefully, we will learn more about who is watching as the series goes on.</p><h2 id="h21216"><a id=""></a>Everyday marginalization and Black identity</h2><p><em>Supacell</em> opens a discussion about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hematology.org/education/patients/anemia/sickle-cell-trait&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hematology.org/education/patients/anemia/sickle-cell-trait" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the prevalence of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) and the sickle cell trait</a></span>, which is more common in Black populations.

<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChxrl60x8Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer</a> released today, Frontier revealed a new trailer announcing that Planet Coaster 2 will launch sometime in Fall 2024.</p>



<p>The new trailer doesn’t feature any gameplay, and it doesn’t provide a concrete release date for Planet Coaster 2. However, the announcement does tease that a first look at gameplay is coming on July 31, 2024.</p>



<p>Frontier’s trailer also warns fans that it only includes “pre-alpha engine footage.” So, although the visuals already look solid, they are still subject to change and improve by the time of release.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>The announcement trailer showcases a variety of potential rides, items, and settings that players may find in Planet Coaster 2. </p>



<p>That includes some classic coasters, as well as a focus on water parks content, such as pools and water slides. Fans quickly praised the new revealed features, which are sure to increase the scope of the game.</p>



<p>Planet Coaster 2’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2688950/Planet_Coaster_2/">Steam page</a> teases everything from “meandering lazy rivers to adrenaline-pumping wave pools, looping flumes to exhilarating water coasters.” Players can combine these with their coaster rides.</p>



<p>Fans will also get to share their creations, build with friends across platforms, and visit other parks after Planet Coaster 2 launches in Fall.</p>



<p>The first Planet Coaster originally launched nearly 10 years ago in 2016. Fans may also recognize Frontier Developments for the Jurassic World Evolution series, and it recently announced a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-new-jurassic-world-game-is-coming-from-frontier/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Jurassic World game</a>.</p>

		<p>Frontier Developments has revealed Planet Coaster 2, a sequel to their hit theme park management game coming out on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC in autumn 2024.</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/UChxrl60x8Y</p>


<p>Planet Coaster 2 will look to take your parks further than ever with the introduction of water-based attractions. These range from lazy rivers and calming pools to flumes that loop around, tower over the surrounding park, and wave pools. There’s even water coasters, that will combine both sides of the game.</p>
<p>There will be a whole host of new rides, some new themes and plenty of customisable scenery pieces that will let you make your amusement park match your dreams. That goes from new ride smoothing in the creation tools, to customising colours and set dressing for individual carriages or all at once, and a new event sequencer to make animatronics take place at just the right time.</p>
<p>There will be four new themes included in the game, with the Mythological Theme, California-inspired Resort Theme, the wet Aquatic Theme and rustic Viking Theme, and you’ll naturally be able to pick and choose from everything in the game, combining things together to create your own scenery and blueprints.</p>

<p>Behind the new themes and water rides are new management tools. You’ll have to look out for the health of your guests with lifeguards, shade and sunscreen, and can delve into new heat maps to see better what is and isn’t working in your park.</p>
<p>Alongside the career and sandbox is the leaderboard challenge of Franchise, and you can share a save file with other players to go building and adapting, though this is a one-at-a-time kind of experience.</p>
<p>It’s wild to think it’s been eight years since Planet Coaster first launched on PC in 2016, though that’s partly because <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/10/planet-coaster-console-edition-review-ps5-ps4-xbox-one-series-x/">Planet Coaster: Console Edition</a> only arrived in 2020. Either way, this was the game that reinvigorated the genre, and in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/11/29/planet-coaster-review/">our original Planet Coaster review</a>, Dave said, “Planet Coaster feels like a step into more modern times for the genre. There are bugbears when it comes to the camera and the subsequent patience required to build your perfect theme park, but should one have the stamina to intricately design features for their park, the possibilities are nigh on endless.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/riot-games-reportedly-cancels-unannounced-smash-bros-competitor.924744/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/riot-games-pool-party-canceled-report<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to a new report,&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>developer Riot Games has canceled an unannounced&nbsp;<em>Super Smash Bros.</em>-style platform fighter by the name of&nbsp;<em>Pool Party</em>.</p>
<p>This report comes from <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/riot-games-pool-party-canceled-smash-melee" rel="noopener" target="_blank">former Washington Post reporter Mikhail Klimentov</a>, who cites "current and former Riot Games employees familiar with the decision". According to Klimentov and his sources,&nbsp;<em>Pool Party&nbsp;</em>was canceled in late May.</p>
<p>Klimentov says that around 70-80 Riot employees were working on the project, and that of those staffers, around half of them have "received an offer to be reassigned within the studio", while others are seeking new positions via Riot's "internal job board".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/super-smash-bros-ultimate-riot-games-pool-party.jpg?itok=BTBLn_Qm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/super-smash-bros-ultimate-riot-games-pool-party.jpg?itok=_PoyBRCH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Riot Games' apparently-canceled&nbsp;<em>Pool Party&nbsp;</em>would have been a competitor for&nbsp;<em>Super Smash Bros.</em></figcaption></figure><p>A further ten employees weren't offered work elsewhere within Riot and didn't apply for internal jobs either, according to Klimentov, which presumably means they either left or were laid off. It <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-developer-riot-games-laying-off-530-employees-riot-forge-will-cease">wouldn't be the first round of layoffs</a> within Riot this year if that was the case.</p>
<p>According to Klimentov's report,&nbsp;<em>Pool Party&nbsp;</em>began life as a hardcore fighting game before morphing into a more casual-friendly project that aimed to compete with&nbsp;<em>Super Smash Bros</em>., particularly in light of Nintendo's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/riptide-super-smash-bros-project-tournaments-canceled">strange relationship</a> with that game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/smash-bros-hurt-community">esports scene</a>.</p>
<p>However, Klimentov says Riot was "spooked" by what the studio perceived to be the "failure" of Warner Bros' platform fighter&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-release-date-full">released in full earlier this year</a> after an extensive beta period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This "failure" caused Riot to reassess whether there was a public appetite for a&nbsp;<em>Smash Bros.&nbsp;</em>competitor, and with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-fighting-game-officially-named-2xko-as-spectacular-new-gameplay-is">more hardcore fighter&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>in the works</a>, it's clear Riot decided to shift its priorities, assuming the report is correct.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/multiversus-riot-games-pool-party.jpg?itok=9wVjZOFO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/multiversus-riot-games-pool-party.jpg?itok=zTc_Rs16 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>According to Mikhail Klimentov, Riot canceled&nbsp;<em>Pool Party&nbsp;</em>after it got "spooked" by the "failure" of&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Klimentov quotes Riot's senior comms director Joe Hixson as saying that the studio "always ha[s] a number of projects in various phases of R&amp;D", and that "spinning projects up and down" is a regular occurrence.</p>
<p>Still, it's a shame to think that whatever work Riot's staff did on&nbsp;<em>Pool Party&nbsp;</em>will be lost forever. Not for the first time, I think it'd be a good idea for the studio to release what it had, just so we can see what&nbsp;<em>Pool Party&nbsp;</em>might have been like.</p>

Being an NPC in a Hidetaka Miyazaki game, Igon doesn’t have a lot of lines, which Lintern was well aware of going in. Initially, Lintern assumed he could wrap up his line reads in about 40 minutes. The entire thing ended up stretching to about five to six hours instead. Lintern thoroughly enjoyed the experience though, saying, “It felt creative, and it felt engaged. And I didn’t quite know what I was doing, but I knew that I’d had fun doing it.”</p><p>Funnily enough, Lintern frames the VO session quite a bit like a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-radahn-hitboxes-dark-souls-2-1851585346&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-radahn-hitboxes-dark-souls-2-1851585346">boss fight</a></span> you’d encounter in a FromSoft game. According to him, he walked into the studio to find more than a dozen people kind of gathered around <em>Elden Ring</em>’s director Hidetaka Miyazaki, who Lintern likens to a “god of the gaming world.”</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“I didn’t know the game, and I didn’t know the status of the game, and I didn’t know [Miyazaki’s] status. But when I walked into the room, his status was very clear, very clear immediately. Everyone was very friendly, but at the same time, I could see that this was a bigger deal than I’d imagined it was going to be.”</p></blockquote><p>He describes Miyazaki as “the mysterious figure in the center of the room…very much in control of the operation.” After reading a line, it’d go through several channels back to Miyazaki who would then deliver notes. “We were doing lines hundreds of times, literally hundreds, because if I was there for five hours, the actual total amount of lines that I spoke, I could’ve done in seven minutes,” Lintern shared. I can see him walking back through those theoretical fog gates time and time again. Throughout, Lintern says that the most consistent note he got was simply to amp things up. “Do you have more? Can you explode?”</p><p>And goddamn, did that man explode. Lintern—who in in his own words had to go from “naught to 5000” for his portrayal of Igon—claims he was “giving it as much as I possibly can, vocally, emotionally, neck stretching, vocal cords ripping, everything,” before taking a water break and running it back. Lintern’s director must’ve told him to take five, but I think he heard “change lives” instead and delivered the performance of a lifetime.</p><p>Lintern claims that he was spent in more ways than one by the end of session, and if that doesn’t sound like the feeling of triumphing over a FromSoft boss, I don’t know what does. I’ve been visibly shaken by the end of the most arduous encounters, including one that took me the entirety of a Saturday afternoon and evening during my first run of <em>Bloodborne</em>. I’ve held my breath only to let out the deepest of exhales upon doing that last tick of damage. I haven’t cried, but I have screeched at the top of my lungs upon having tasted the ichor of victory.</p><p>Elsewhere, Lintern talks about how his time with <em>Elden Ring </em>has opened him up to further possibilities in voice acting, which is great considering the fanbase his first stab at it has garnered. Despite how little he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-s-story-explained-1851566799&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-s-story-explained-1851566799">knew about the game</a></span>, and the air of mystery that hung around Miyazaki the whole time, Lintern still managed to pull it out. Now, Igon is already among one of the most beloved characters in one of the most esteemed catalog of games. How’s that for a first day at a new job?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>TMNT: Mutants Unleashed is set in the same universe as the animated Mutant Mayhem film. Players must contend with the TCRI corporation with the help of April and Splinter. </p>



<p>Today’s new trailer adds that the beloved turtles will also “battle an all-new wave of havoc-wreaking mutants.” Naturally, missions will be set “across the streets of NYC.” </p>



<p>Mutants Unleashed will support both solo and local co-op gameplay. The devs also tease that “it’s filled with action, humour, and nostalgia.”</p>



<p>Outright Games recently announced Transformers: Galactic Trials. It combines both racing and shooting mechanics, and it’s also coming in mid-October 2024.</p>



<p>Besides Mutants Unleashed, fans of the ninja turtles can also look forward to TMNT: Splintered Fate. The latter launches on July 17, 2024, and the devs just announced this week that it will similarly support couch co-op.</p>



<p>There’s also anticipation for a darker take on the turtles, with an action RPG <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">based on The Last Ronin</a>.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Nintendo unveiled a chilling cinematic trailer for their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-reveals-trailer-for-m-rated-game-teases-creepy-emio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming horror game,</a> Emio, sparking widespread curiosity about the title. While details surrounding the game’s storyline remain shrouded in mystery, fresh information has emerged, offering a glimpse into the game’s nature, courtesy of Emio’s rating in Australia.</p>



<p>Emio has received an M rating from ESRB in America, a standard rating for games with mature content, such as strong language, intense violence, and sexual themes. This aligns with the horror nature of Emio but doesn’t provide any specific information. </p>



<p>On the other hand, Australian ratings are more detailed, informing players why such a rating has been provided. Emio has received an MA 15+ rating in Australia due to “Strong themes, violence and suicide references”. Moreover, it has been restricted for players younger than the age of 13 due to “violence, cruelty, domestic abuse &amp; suicide themes”.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>The trailer for Emio is a surprising departure from Nintendo’s usual family-friendly content. The inclusion of violence, suicide, and other mature themes has sparked players’ curiosity about what Nintendo is planning. Also, The fact that Emio has already been rated in Australia has led to exciting speculation that a 2024 release might be on the cards, and the Halloween season seems like the perfect window.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>Studio Mechka has announced that its metroidvania game inspired by 90’s cartoons and Slavic folklore, Marko: Beyond Brave, is set to launch on Steam on September 17th. There is a demo available at the moment to check <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1186470/Marko_Beyond_Brave/">Marko: Beyond Brave</a> out, and you can see some gameplay in the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mg2Fck_etTU?si=4Vyqq9Ls-ghEWRGR" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>


<p>In Marko: Beyond Brave, entropy has broken free from its prison, and threatens to consume the world. Armed with his greatsword and moustache, Marko has to confront evil forces, duel against legendary beasts, and form alliances to reestablish balance in Zagora. Marko has abilities that let him control elemental powers to aid him in his quest, where every decision has an impact on Zagora. Zagora is made up of multiple locations including forests and dilapidated castles. Enemies and bosses have been designed by drawing inspiration from Slavic folklore figures like Vila, Koz’el, Urgl, Vlashko, and the Tree of Life.</p>
<p>Marko: Beyond Brave has a non-linear map featuring hundreds of individual rooms, containing concealed treasures, relics, and decaying edifices that shed light on the past. There is crafting and enhancements within the game allowing players to construct the weapons and tools to help in the fight for victory.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/double-dragon-revive-continues-a-classic-franchises-rebirth-next-year.924657/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/double-dragon-revive-announcement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arc System Works and Yuke's have announced&nbsp;<em>Double Dragon Revive</em>, a new entry in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Double Dragon&nbsp;</em>series of beat-'em-up games.</p>
<p>Due to land sometime in 2025,&nbsp;<em>Double Dragon Revive&nbsp;</em>transposes the classic action gameplay of the series into 3D, giving the iconic Lee brothers a modern makeover as they take on "powerful foes from their past".</p>
<p>Although the game is in 3D, it looks like the gameplay will still take place mostly along a 2D plane, although you will be able to knock enemies into the background or use area-of-effect attacks to take down enemies from different angles.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/double-dragon-revive-announcement-gameplay.jpg?itok=QljJYo75 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/double-dragon-revive-announcement-gameplay.jpg?itok=SzRWhM4g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Double Dragon Revive&nbsp;</em>will adapt the series' classic gameplay with modern visuals.</figcaption></figure><p>Developer Yuke's and publisher Arc System Works are promising "the same simple and intuitive gameplay" you love about classic&nbsp;<em>Double Dragon</em>, but "with controls and balance refined for the modern era".</p>
<p><em>Revive&nbsp;</em>will offer a "carefully crafted experience" supervised by Arc System Works staff, with the publisher pointing to its extensive experience in the fighting genre as proof it can be trusted with the franchise.</p>
<p>According to the two studios,&nbsp;<em>Double Dragon Revive&nbsp;</em>won't just let you get away with button-mashing; instead, you'll have to carefully observe your enemies to spot patterns and pick out your timings.</p>
<p>Don't worry, though.&nbsp;<em>Double Dragon&nbsp;</em>isn't about to turn into a Soulslike; it's still the same side-scrolling beat-'em-up you know and love, by the looks of things, but with a few modern twists to keep things interesting.</p>

<p>This is the second&nbsp;<em>Double Dragon&nbsp;</em>game to be announced in as many years, after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/double-dragon-gaiden-announcement">last year's pixel art roguelite</a>&nbsp;<em>Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise of the Dragons</em>.</p>
<p>Unlike its cousin, however,&nbsp;<em>Revive&nbsp;</em>is going for a more modern 3D style rather than the nostalgic retro look. It remains to be seen whether Arc System Works and Yuke's can pull it off, but I'm rooting for them.</p>
<p><em>Double Dragon Revive&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3012220/Double_Dragon_Revive/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010965" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and Xbox in 2025.

			<p>Turkish developer Motion Blur has announced Black State - an Unreal Engine 5-powered upcoming third-person action adventure that appears to have been inspired by Metal Gear Solid.</p>
<p>The new PC title packing strong Metal Gear Solid and Portal vibes was announced by the studio yesterday through an official reveal trailer (courtesy of IGN). We've included the announcement video below alongside some key features of the game. We've also included some impressive-looking screenshots. It has to be said, this pre-alpha footage does look pretty impressive, although it's clear that performance needs to be improved. According to the developer, this new trailer opens the door to a photo-realistic single-player third-person shooter. "This trailer is just the tip of the iceberg", Motion Blur's CEO Kadir Demirden said. "We can't wait for players to dive in and experience the full depth and intensity of the game."</p>
<p>In Black State, the player is summoned for a secret mission by a group of scientists known as the Architects. The task at hand? Save captives and uncover the truth behind a cataclysmic event, with each door leading to new and unexpected locations.</p>

			<p>This Thursday, NVIDIA announced the addition of three games to the GeForce NOW cloud library.

<p>Granted, Once Human isn't exactly a taxing game, having been designed to also run on mobile devices. Its system requirements, as you can read below, are quite low for mid-2024.</p>

<p>However, GeForce NOW is also supported on mobile devices and even directly on TVs, which certainly provides a greater level of accessibility for those interested in playing Once Human.</p>
<p>This week, GeForce NOW users can also play Cricket 24 via the Xbox app/ PC Game Pass. The latest edition of the cricket game was released by Australian developer Big Ant Studios in late 2023, featuring more than 200 real players recreated with photogrammetry, over 50 officially licensed stadiums, tournaments like The Ashes, the KFC BBL and Weber WBBL, The Hundred, the Caribbean Premier League, and the Pakistan Super League.</p>
<p>Lastly, the action first-person shooter game Anger Foot launches today <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1978590/Anger_Foot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a> and will be playable via GeForce NOW. Anger Foot was made by Free Lives and published by Devolver Digital. Here's what you can expect:</p>
<p><em>Crash through the caffeine-fueled fever dream of Shit City, putting the boot to a menacing menagerie of merciless gangsters.</em></p>
<p><em>Unleash the world's deadliest feet on a colorful cast of anthropomorphic enemies. Clearing out slums, sewers, and skyscrapers as you grab new weapons, unlock new sneakers, and upgrade your powers in absurd and wonderful ways. Kick and shoot your way to the exit as you leave behind a smoldering trail of shattered doors, broken bones, and crumpled energy drinks.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-review-%E2%80%93-changeling-mischief.924648/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-review-changeling-mischief<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</em> was a phenomenon upon its initial release. Great character writing and imaginative situations helped elevate the animated show's themes of friendship and community. There's a reason why it is the most beloved incarnation of Hasbro's equestrian-themed toy line. <em>My Little Pony: Dark Skies Over Equestria</em> expresses that imagination in an official TTRPG module. One that features magic, friendship, and the shapeshifting antics of Queen Chrysalis and her changeling hive.</p>

<p><em>My Little Pony: Dark Skies Over Equestria</em> is a 166-page <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/opinions/how-to-use-essence20-to-make-perfect-transformers-crossover" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Essence20</a> adventure module for the <em>My Little Pony Roleplaying Game</em>. It features six interconnected adventures where players stop the schemes of Queen Chrysalis from laying waste to Equestria. It is also a mini-supplement, providing players new Perks, Spells, and rules for playing as Changelings.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-changeline-artwork.jpg?itok=hPBc3Jq7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-changeline-artwork.jpg?itok=2KPjGZTk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>They're adorable little shapechangers.</figcaption></figure><h2>How are the new player options in <em>My Little Pony: Dark Skies Over Equestria</em>?</h2>
<p>The new player options in <em>My Little Pony: Dark Skies Over Equestria</em> mostly focus on Changelings. Since the prewritten adventure is Changeling-themed, adding them as a player option makes some sense. The book even provides options and story seeds for how Changeling characters can be introduced in the adventure. It cites characters like Thorax and events like the metamorphosed colony for players that want to play good Changelings and recommends different Roles like Loyalty and Generosity.</p>
<p>The new Changeling options are handled well. Players can choose between being a Colony Changeling, part of the collective that Queen Chrysalis commands, or a Metamorphosed Changeling transformed by the magic of friendship.</p>
<p>In game terms, the Changeling Origin is powerful. Changelings can shape-shift at will into other creatures, have a flying speed, and even have some magic skills. Effectively, if their disguise is good enough they can pass for anything they turn into.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-shapeshifting-rules.jpg?itok=Z8EsX7iu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-shapeshifting-rules.jpg?itok=kB7IEUXX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The design team thought this stuff through.</figcaption></figure><p>Thankfully, there are several controls. First, shape-shifting is imperfect and limited without the use of certain Perks. You can't change into an inanimate object or change your size. Changing into a creature doesn't give you any inherent benefits like a wolf's sense of smell or a unicorn's magic. You can't perfectly imitate a specific character, meaning infiltration potential is limited. Changelings only have one health, making them glass cannons if discovered. Lastly, depending on your Origin, you need to take certain Influences and Hang-Ups, which can make it harder for you to maintain your cover.</p>
<p>The book does provide advancement options for those who want to become perfect chameleons. Some Perks remove various shapeshifting restrictions. Personal favorites are Size Shift and Object Shift; Prop Hunt energy in Changeling form. The potential to be a master shapechanger is there, you have to work for it.</p>
<p>As someone who generally bans shapechanging options in my games, I have to applaud the designers of <em>My Little Pony: Dark Skies Over Equestria</em>. It lets Game Masters maintain intrigue and pacing at the start of an adventure while allowing players to become masters of disguise in the late game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-widget-artwork.jpg?itok=OIRkmV-C 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-widget-artwork.jpg?itok=chFYeBCg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Great Scott! A brilliant pony inventor!</figcaption></figure><h2>How Fun Are The Adventures in <em>My Little Pony: Dark Skies Over Equestria</em>?</h2>
<p>The six adventures in <em>My Little Pony: Dark Skies Over Equestria</em> maintain a great balance of mystery and comedy. The first adventure, <em>Lost In Shadow</em>, is a straightforward mystery story. Ponyville locals are accusing one another of stealing or causing mischief and the players need to solve it.</p>
<p>It's a solid introduction. Every major character has answers to major questions players may ask. The twists and turns are well-telegraphed, which indicates confident storytelling. Lastly, the adventure can end diplomatically, leading to different outcomes.</p>
<p>The second adventure, <em>Day Becomes Night</em>, is one of the weaker entries. For some reason, the sun isn't rising in Equestria. A local eccentric inventor pony, Widget, has a gizmo that may help, but repairing will take some work.</p>
<p>By itself, the adventure isn't bad. There's some novelty in helping Ponyville's locals deal with the lack of light. Widget's character design is inspired by <em>Back To The Future's</em> Doc Brown, which is delightful. The adventure is packed with alternative options for fixing Widget's machine, allowing any potential party composition to get to the end.</p>
<p>My issue is that the connections to Queen Chrysalis' plans aren't established until the end of the adventure. The result is a scenario where the enemy feels more like an evil lamp than a persistent antagonistic force.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-pony-noir-artwork.jpg?itok=qhKFCJZX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-pony-noir-artwork.jpg?itok=fgrBUQeE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Alright, smarty pants, where are you keeping the stolen color!?</figcaption></figure><p>The third adventure, <em>Equestria Noir</em>, is a personal highlight. It follows up from the last adventure. The party wakes up the next day to discover that all color has been drained out of Equestria. On top of that, everyone has begun dressing and talking like hardboiled detectives.</p>
<p>As a kid-friendly genre exercise, it is perfect. The wordplay is excellent. The adventure is packed with references to noir staples like <em>The Maltese Falcon</em> and <em>The Third Man</em>. Players are encouraged to lean into character with internal monologues, trenchcoats, and fedoras. Even the adventure as a whole is framed as a whodunnit mystery with witnesses, clues, and red herrings. It is my favorite part of this book, hands-down.</p>
<p><em>In The Land of Shadow</em> is the most action-packed, conventional adventure in <em>My Little Pony: Dark Skies Over Equestria</em>. Players reactivate a mysterious portal, enter a land ruled by Queen Chrysalis, and disrupt her plan to siphon energy from Equestria. It's a great <em>MLP</em>-themed take on a fantasy adventure module. Puzzles, traps, navigating maps, creative solutions to big problems. There's even a wrinkle of complexity with the introduction of Lost Land Ponies: ponies that are loyal to Queen Chrysalis' rule.</p>
<p>The weakest adventure of the bunch in my opinion is <em>The Balance of Harmony</em>. In isolation, it's fine. The Mane Six get sick, and the players need to go on an adventure to cure them. There's a great mix of unique characters and difficult challenges, a personal highlight involves a married couple and a magic apple. There is even a tricky moral decision near the end.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-bedridden-applejack.jpg?itok=iRmSJEIf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-bedridden-applejack.jpg?itok=awKEolgb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Well this took a turn.</figcaption></figure><p>My problems with the adventure mostly come down to design ethos. I like keeping my players as the main characters in an adventure. If it is a game set in an established setting, I change it so the original main characters don't exist or are in a supporting role. This adventure centers on the well-being of The Mane Six and assumes they still wield the Elements of Harmony. It effectively turns the PCs' adventure into a filler sidestory.</p>
<p>This is a “me” problem, but it does make adapting this adventure tricky. There is a certain thrill in having your characters interact with these main characters,&nbsp; a big draw of licensed TTRPGs, and this adventure delivers that fantasy. But the way this adventure is framed, I think it takes from the players' ability to make their own mark in the world.</p>
<p>The finale, aptly named <em>The Dark Queen</em> is a bombastic conclusion. Queen Chrysalis unleashes her changeling army, infiltrating and invading Equestria. Her sights settle on Ponyville, Princess Celestia, and Canterlot.</p>
<p>Running this adventure is a thrill. The book provides different approaches to Chrysalis' invasion alongside <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/among-us" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Among Us</em></a> hijinx with Changeling dopplegangers, There's even an exciting setpiece on a runaway train.</p>
<p>It feels like a <em>Friendship is Magic</em> season finale in RPG form, packed with returning characters, arcs coming to a close, and a big bad getting their comeuppance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-queen-chrysalis-artwork.jpg?itok=yJvI7NeA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-queen-chrysalis-artwork.jpg?itok=1F490HNi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>How will your group stop her?</figcaption></figure><h2>Should You Pick Up <em>My Little Pony: Dark Skies Over Equestria</em>?</h2>
<p>Overall, <em>My Little Pony: Dark Skies Over Equestria</em> is an entertaining, imaginative, and engaging <em>My Little Pony</em> mystery adventure. The puzzles are clever, the characters are entertaining, and the new Changeling player options are impressively designed. There are some low points, but they are overshadowed by solid quality and exciting setpieces. If you want to continue your adventures through Ponyville with a Changeling twist, this book will do just that.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
My Little Pony: Dark Skies Over Equestria is a breezy, entertaining slice of the My Little Pony world in TTRPG form. Aside from some narrative hiccups, the prewritten adventure and Changeling options are wonderful additions to a table. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

<p>As first spotted <a href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/uk-high-street-video-game-retailer-game-set-to-end-in-store-pre-orders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by TechRadar</a>, an internal staff memo at UK retailer GAME reportedly revealed the company will end in-store pre-orders soon.</p>



<p>The report adds that the staff memo mentions this move is due to “part of the continued integration into Frasers Group.” The changes will go into effect on August 1, 2024. </p>



<p>This information was also corroborated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-to-end-in-store-pre-orders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by EuroGamer</a>, which reported direct contact with GAME staff. A staff member further stated that “going forward the tills will only be able to sell and return products.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Late last June, GAME only just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/game-uk-stop-selling-physical/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">denied reports</a> that it will stop selling games and hardware. At that time, representatives stated that GAME would “continue to support the physical gaming market.”</p>



<p>The new memo does clarify that GAME customers can still order online for home delivery, “or purchase in store once released.” </p>



<p>Also, existing deposits and pre-orders for releases through January 31, 2025, will still be honored. For anything with a release date after that time, GAME is offering a pre-order refund for deposits.</p>



<p>This would mark another step in GAME winding down, after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/game-reward-ending-shut-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ending its GAME Reward</a> card scheme in early June 2024.  TechRadar’s new report adds that further instructions for staff about in-store marketing displays are coming.</p>



<p>GAME has not issued an official statement regarding the memo at this time.</p>

        <p>It’s up to Aero the Acro-Bat, the circus’s star performer, to rescue his friends and girlfriend Ariel, and put a stop to Edgar Ektor’s mad plans so everyone can enjoy the show again!</p><p>The powerful and eccentric industrialist Edgar Ektor has sworn to destroy the world of amusement as revenge for being banished from the circus when he was a kid after one of his pranks went too far and almost killed a circus animal. He started by invading a local circus with his gang of mad clowns and kidnapping all the circus staff to spoil the show.</p><p><strong>A Challenge to Become the Best</strong></p><p><em>Aero the Acro-Bat</em> is NOT your typical platformer in which you just go from start to goal. The players will need to use Aero’s skills in specific ways in order to accomplish the objectives in each stage, and this sets the game aside from many platformers that came before or after. <em>Aero</em> also comes from an era in which games were famous for being challenging, and the Aero series in particular has always been known for its challenging difficulty. Those who can clear these games can really consider themselves platforming masters! But fear not, if it’s too much for you, this new version includes cheats to make things a bit easier!</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_898429"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Play to Win</strong></p><p><em>Aero</em>‘s display presents a health bar and each stage starts with a number of hit points which can be added to by collecting items.

Hazards, such as spikes and lava, cost Aero a life regardless of his health metre. Aero can gain more health and more lives by finding items in the stages and also gains an extra life for every 20,000 points earned.

<p>A new platform has been added to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/play-doom-robot-lawnmower-husqvarna/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">list of things</a> that can run Doom, which is not as surprising as the others. A developer has posted the original Doom running on Unreal Editor for Fortnite, and you can check out the clip below.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Original Doom running on Fortnite is a unique and intriguing feat. The most fascinating aspect is the addition of build mechanics to the player character, offering a fresh perspective on the game. The ability to ‘crank 90s’ in Doom is a feature that was never imagined. The creator, Jackson Clayton, shared that while he can’t officially publish this, the process of getting Doom to run on Fortnite was a valuable learning experience about Material and Post Processing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Through an interview with <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-running-inside-fortnite-uefn-how-epic-twitter-fps-1851585177?utm_campaign=Kotaku&amp;utm_content=1720637674&amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, Clayton detailed how he got Doom running on Fortnite. He stated that the first thing he did was export the E1M1 files as a 3D model from Ultimate Doom Builder and ported that into Fortnite’s UEFN. Then Clayton removed “Unreal’s fancy effects” to make the game feel like it was running in Fortnite. Additionally, Clayton used Unreal’s material system to provide a choppy spinning effect for the Doom Marine and the Post Process material to add pixelation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clayton’s journey of getting Doom to run on Fortnite was not without its challenges. He found the UEFN to be advanced, requiring him to ‘get creative’ with the process. His experience in creating other Doom-like games in the past was a significant advantage, making this process easier.</p>
