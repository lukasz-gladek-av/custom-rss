            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/200-rockstar-north-employees-sign-letter-calling-out-management-for-%E2%80%9Cvicious-union-busting%E2%80%9D.1352827/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>More than 200 Rockstar North employees have signed a letter to management calling <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-developer-accused-union-busting-after-firing-dozens-of-employees/">the sudden firing of 31 employees</a> a "<em>blatant, unapologetic act of vicious union busting</em>." Rockstar was immediately accused of union busting when the employees were fired at the beginning of November, and though Rockstar has tried to claim the 31 employees <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-says-fired-gta-developers-had-been-leaking-information/">were fired for leaking internal information</a>, those claims have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/anonymous-rockstar-employee-says-there-were-no-leaks-layoffs-union-busting/">refuted by employees speaking out under anonymity</a>, and by recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9nOwjeznjI">reporting from People Make Games</a>, who spoke to employees who have held multiple protests outside Rockstar North's office in Edinburgh since the firings.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-a-blatant-unapologetic-act-of-vicious-union-busting-hundreds-of-rockstar-employees-sign-letter-to-management-demanding-fired-colleagues-get-reinstated">Eurogamer</a>, this letter to management is the latest action to try and get<a href="https://wccftech.com/fired-rockstar-workers-want-to-be-reinstated-get-back-to-work-on-gta-vi/"> those fired employees reinstated</a>, and contains more harsh words for management and the actions they have taken which, in the eyes of these 200+ employees, those fired, and the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) amount to nothing short of union busting.</p>



<p>"<em>It's heartwarming to see so many of our colleagues supporting us and holding management to account</em>," said one of the fired employees speaking under anonymity. "<em>During a period where Rockstar want us to feel scared, my brave former colleagues are marching straight up to our boss's door and demanding our voices are heard and not backing down.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>It's clear to everyone close to this situation that this is a blatant, unapologetic act of vicious union busting. Rockstar employs so many talented game developers, all of whom are crucial to making the games we put out</em>."</p>



<p>Of the 31 fired employees, all of them were members of the union that was growing within Rockstar, many of them integral in leading the charge towards unionization, and they were getting very close to hitting the 10% membership threshold needed to be recognized as an official union.</p>



<p>Those factors, along with the manner in which all 31 employees were fired make it clear to the IWGB that this is Rockstar union busting, plain and simple. Along with this letter from current Rockstar employees, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-hit-by-legal-claim-issued-by-iwgb-refusing-to-meet-fired-workers/">the IWGB has also filed a legal claim against Rockstar</a> after the company refused to meet with IWGB representatives speaking on behalf of those fired workers. </p>

            <p>
Earlier this year, the reveal of Sloclap’s Rematch sent me into spirals of introspection about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-creators-of-sifu-and-absolver-are-making-a-football-game-set-many-decades-from-now">the classist origins of my apathy for football</a>. Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road is sending me into spirals of introspection about the fact that maybe football was a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest">Dragon Quest</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> all along. Hypersonic penalty kicks that wreathe the ball in purple fire? Nobody told me football was this rad. So many years wasted, playing effing grass hockey.
</p>
<p>
Created by Level5 Inc – the studio behind such classics as Dragon Quest 8, the Professor Layton series and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ni-no-kuni-wrath-of-the-white-witch-remastered">Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch</a>, together with the more recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>, it’s a blend of open-ended school yarn and fantasy soccer with 5,400 characters to recruit.</p>
<p>There have been a few of these Inazuma Eleven games, it turns out, but this is the first mainline entry in 12 years, and the first time they’ve released one for PC. It seems smashing. Smashing! I don’t care that I sound like somebody out of the Beano. I don't care that the centre-forwards all sprint like they're battling to restrain the aftermath of a hastily eaten curry. I watched the trailer below and the score brought wholly non-curry-related tears to my eyes.

<p>
SMASHING. Let’s proceed to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2799860/INAZUMA_ELEVEN_Victory_Road/?curator_clanid=4777282">the Steam page</a> without further ado. Dear lord, it’s a tawdry logjam of special edition bonuses and bolt-on preorder tat. I read <a href="https://indiegamejoe.com/steam-store-page-optimization-above-the-fold-best-practices/">a blog post about how to structure a Steam page</a> earlier and this pretty much breaks every rule on it. Keep scrolling, however, and you’ll eventually discover the game's premise. 
</p><p>
“This new story takes place 25 years after the first Inazuma Eleven,” the developers explain. “In search of a world without football, protagonist Destin Billows enrolls at South Cirrus Junior High. Meanwhile, within the prestigious Raimon Junior High - renowned as the top team in the nationals - rises a Football Monster named Harper Evans. When these two cross paths, a tale begins to unfold…” The story sequences include animations supplied by MAPPA, producers of such anime films and adaptations as Dorohedoro, Chainsaw Man and Zombie Land Saga.
</p>
<p>
I can’t bring you any hands-on Victory Road impressions, sadly, as we’ve only just been offered code, and I’m worried the code offering person is a phisher. But there is much enthusiasm in the Steam forums, with the caveat that a lot of it is from advanced access buyers who are perhaps dabbling in a little sunk cost fallacy.

              <p>PCs don’t have to be bulky power-hogs that take over your entire workspace or super expensive to be efficient. If you’re after something that saves space while keeping up with your everyday work and play needs, there are quite a few solid mini PCs on the market. And Amazon is making it easier than ever to grab one.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5557/">The retailer has dropped the price of the Lenovo ThinkCentre Tiny M70q Gen 5 PC to just $800, after a massive 64% discount</a>. Even better, you’re not just getting the PC. This deal also includes a USB Calliope keyboard and mouse, plus Windows 11 pre-installed. That’s a full setup ready to go right out of the box. The deal, however, is selling fast, and there’s no telling how long the offer or the stock will stick around. If you’ve been waiting to upgrade your desktop situation for less, now is the time to act.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5557/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Performance In a Lightweight Frame</h2>
<p>This is a mini PC, which means you’re getting impressive power packed in a compact, lightweight frame. It measures just about 7 x 7 inches with a slim 1.4-inch depth, so it can fit into any setup without demanding a lot of space. Those who prefer a cleaner setup can simply tuck it behind their monitor or under the table using the VESA mount support, but you will have to purchase the mount separately.</p>
<p>Power-wise, it’s equipped with Intel Core i5-14400T, which is a 14th Gen chip with 10 cores (6 performance, 4 efficiency) and 16 threads, clocking up to 4.5GHz when needed. There’s a massive 32GB RAM that keeps everything running smoothly, which can especially be helpful during multitasking. You can perform a bunch of different tasks at once without experiencing frustrating slowdowns that kill the momentum.</p>



<p>Storage is handled by a 1TB PCIe SSD. It offers enough space to store all that you own, from photos to videos, programs, a ton of work documents, backups, and more. You really won’t have to invest in another storage solution anytime soon. And since it’s a solid-state drive, you can also expect much faster load and boot times compared to the traditional options out there. Together, both memory and storage ensure that you’re able to access your system quickly, plus get through busy days with ease.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth, and a wide port selection, including USB-C, multiple USB-A ports, Ethernet, and a headphone/mic combo jack. You can enjoy faster wireless connectivity, as well as expand your system by adding an external display or peripherals.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Embark Studios Just Nerfed ARC Raiders’ Most OP Perk]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/embark-studios-nerf-security-breach-perk/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/embark-studios-just-nerfed-arc-raiders%E2%80%99-most-op-perk.1352806/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios rolled out the 1.2.0 update for ARC Raiders today, introducing a new community-wide event, the dawn of a new map, and new ARC enemies to contend with. The team also issued several quality-of-life improvements, tweaks, and bug fixes. They also pushed out a<strong> silent adjustment </strong>to the Security Breach perk, nerfing the heck out of it.</p>



<p>In a move that some fans have questioned, the most OP perk in ARC Raiders has been dialled back. If you were pushing for Security Breach, you might want to now focus your attention elsewhere, as the perk isn’t as good as it was over the last two weeks.</p>







<h2 id="h-security-breach-nerf-explained">Security Breach Nerf Explained</h2>



<p>In a post on the ARC Raiders Discord server, the game’s community lead, Ossen, wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We adjusted the security lockers because they were over-providing valuable items</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The comment earned a string of emoji-based responses, the most popular of which was the <strong>clown </strong>emoji… Make of that what you will.</p>



<p>For most, this is a good move from Embark Studios, as it helps to tone down the overpowered perk that ‘chads’ were abusing to stack their stashes to the rafters with good equipment. It was also diluting the game’s experience, as the meta was to do night runs on maps like Buried City, soaking up loot routes and cracking open endless security lockers.</p>



<p>This change came in addition to some more positive ones, like the fact that desync has now been addressed, and you shouldn’t feel like you’ve been hit even though you dove behind cover. It also means that fighting ARC enemies will feel more accurate and reliable, not strangely disconnected and laggy.</p>







<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-1-2-0-update-full-patch-notes/">1.2.0 update</a> in ARC Raiders is live now on all platforms, and if you want to get access to the new map, you’ll need to work as a collective and provide enough resources to fuel the project.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re enjoying ARC Raiders.</p>

                <p>Now that Krafton Inc. is becoming an "AI-first" company, the South Korean <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds/" data-ref-id="5000-462692">PUBG</a> publisher is offering employees a "growth direction" opportunity through voluntary resignations, effectively reducing human jobs.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=256319#google_vignette" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a Business Korea report</a> (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-south-korean-publisher-krafton-announced-its-transforming-into-an-ai-first-company-its-now-offering-employees-voluntary-resignation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">spotted by Eurogamer</a>), Krafton internally began a voluntary resignation program on November 12. Based on tenure, employees who signed up were offered the following packages: six months' salary for those with one year or less; 12 months' salary for two years or less; 18 months' salary for five years or less; 24 months' salary for eight years or less; 30 months' salary for 11 years or less; 36 months' salary for more than 11 years. The company said this resignation "support" assistance isn't a means to slash its workforce, but to offer its employees the opportunity of "embarking on new challenges" as AI tech booms.</p><p>"The core purpose is to support members in proactively designing their growth direction and embarking on new challenges both inside and outside the company amid the era of AI transformation," a company representative said." The company plans to support members in autonomously deciding whether to continue the direction of change internally or expand externally."</p><p>Krafton Inc. CFO, Bae Dong-geun, explained during an earnings announcement on November 4 that the company has stopped hiring. He said that "individual productivity must increase" across the company amid its investment in artificial intelligence.</p><p>"Excluding organizations developing original intellectual property (IP) and AI-related personnel, we have frozen hiring company-wide," Dong-geun said. "Rather than reducing costs through AI First, individual productivity must increase at the company-wide level, so we are stopping hiring for now, and we will organize and disclose later whether there will be changes to the five-year franchise IP strategy announced earlier this year."</p><p>In October 2025, Krafton Inc. announced plans to become an "AI-first" company, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-publisher-invests-70-million-to-become-ai-first-company/1100-6535653/" data-ref-id="1100-6535653">investing $70 million into AI</a> to "accelerate mid- to long-term corporate value growth." According to the November 4 earnings announcement, Krafton Inc. posted its highest quarterly performance in the third quarter of this year. The company reportedly brought in 2.407 trillion won ($1.6 billion) in recorded revenue and 1.052 trillion won ($718 million) in operating profit. It said this cumulative operating profit marked "the first time since the company’s founding" that it exceeded 1 trillion won ($682 million) for the third quarter.</p><p>Not every Krafton Inc. subsidiary is buying into the "AI-first" investment. Subnautica 2 developer Unknown Worlds Entertainment claimed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/subnautica-2-devs-claim-theres-no-genai-in-game-after-publishers-ai-first-shift/1100-6535799/" data-ref-id="1100-6535799">AI is a tool it won't use</a> in the upcoming action-adventure survival sim.</p><p>"It is very unlikely that that will change," community manager Donya Abramo said. "We already have a lot of our teams, pipelines, and systems set up. But, ultimately, our relationship with Krafton is the same as it has always been. They provide us access to valuable tools and resources, and we choose which are the right fit for our projects."</p>

It's the first Wednesday in a month in which the team isn't simultaneously releasing two episodes and locking in the build for the next week's entries—not drastic fixes, but tweaking and polishing at the last minute.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We haven't been able to fully enjoy a launch day until today," AdHoc Studio co-founder and&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dispatch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;creator director Nick Herman told Game Developer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dispatch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s first two episodes were released on Oct. 22, a peak of nearly 13,000 played the game concurrently on Valve's Steam platform. That number more than quintupled to 66,000 concurrent players the next week, on Oct. 29, when the next two episodes were released. By episodes five and six, the past week's numbers doubled to 131,000.&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dispatch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s final two episodes were released on Nov. 12 and continued the increase, reaching a new peak of 220,060 concurrent players. Each week,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dispatch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;is finding more of an audience.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The weekly episodic release schedule, typically the realm of TV, works—at least for&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dispatch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which has been lauded for its storytelling, animation, and voice acting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Built by former Telltale Games, Ubisoft, and Night School Studio developers, AdHoc Studio is familiar with the episodic cadence. The team is behind games like&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Wolf Among Us</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, often cited as the gold standard of this sort of storytelling. But Telltale Games' episodes released its episodes months apart;&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Wolf Among Us</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">' first episode was released in October 2013, followed by its next episode in February 2014, and its third in April 2014. That schedule meant Telltale Games could make bigger changes to its stories between episodes.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/lumines-arise-developer-enhance-is-forever-chasing-god" target="_self" data-discover="true">Lumines Arise developer Enhance is forever chasing God</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You'd crunch to make an episode at Telltale, it would come out, and there would be another team who had been thinking about and started on the next one," Herman said. "But every couple months, you're just making a new game from scratch. Here, we had to do most of it upfront."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A long lead-up to a successful Dispatch">A long lead-up to a successful Dispatch</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">AdHoc Studio had been working on the current version of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dispatch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—there were previous iterations, including a live-action one—for roughly three years. The studio had to have ninety percent of the game done by the time the first episode was released, and the other ten percent was spread across the month of episodic launches. Dennis Lenart, also AdHoc Studio co-founder and&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dispatch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;creative director, said the format forced the studio to front load playtesting&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>everything</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;up front so it could reach its desired quality bar it set for cinematics.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/how-poor-leadership-slows-down-game-development" target="_self" data-discover="true">How poor leadership slows down game development</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You have to playtest as much as you possibly can upfront—interactive storyboards, and we built a whole pipeline where you could do playable scripts, playable storyboards," Lenart told Game Developer. "We tested this as much as possible, because one of the key ingredients to making a good game is playtesting. There's a lot of stuff that had to be locked a long time ago. There's a lot of stuff we haven't looked at for a year and a half because it was just early in the process. We had to iterate way more than we ever did in our previous projects at Telltale."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The little stuff behind-the-scenes—that ten percent—is fixing bugs, polishing audio, or tweaking on-screen text, not reanimating or rewriting scenes. Something unique to the episodic format, though, is how AdHoc Studio is able to do some internal balancing to the game's "invisible relationship meters" and other storytelling calculations necessary in a choice-based game like&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dispatch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Much of the gameplay in&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dispatch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, aside from the actual computer work of managing and dispatching a team of villains-turned-heroes, consists of quick-time events and dialogue choices. The decisions you make in&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dispatch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;have both immediate impacts and, perhaps, later consequences. Early on, for instance, the player must decide to kick someone off the team; there are two choices, and the game changes depending on who you pick. Later, that teammate must be replaced, which, again, turns the tide of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dispatch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s story. There are smaller decisions, and it's not always obvious what the impact may be, which heightens the stakes of the game.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/leadership-lessons-from-mark-darrah-s-days-at-bioware-game-developer-podcast-episode-57" target="_self" data-discover="true">Leadership lessons from Mark Darrah’s days at BioWare - Game Developer Podcast Ep. 57</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">AdHoc Studio has been watching player choice as each pair of episodes rolls out.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As we've been watching week-to-week, we've learned a lot of things from players—things we weren't expecting," Herman said. "Parts of the game we thought were hard have been really easy for people. Choices that we thought were going to be more split have been maybe one more-sided. We've done a little bit of balancing on the backend as far as what the math is, tweaking to make sure people don't end the game and 99 percent of players experience this one thing, and then there's this whole other piece that no one's seen because it's not quite tuned right."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That's the benefit of live development, that we're able to do stuff like that," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The approach is working. The episodic nature of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dispatch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;means Adhoc Studio is doing something with its playerbase that doesn't normally happen: Usually, there's a surge of players right when a game is released. Naturally, as people play through the game and complete it or lose interest, the playerbase decreases. The episodic format is an incentive for players to keep coming back, but&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dispatch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;has not only stayed consistent, but dramatically increased its playerbase.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players aren't coming back&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>because</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;it's an episodic release, though; they're coming back because the characters are compelling and the storytelling is successful. But the episodic nature does help with the "staying power" of the game, Herman said. "[It] creates that hype in the fandom that can discuss [the episodes] and it also allows people to hear about it late and feel like they can catch up and they're not behind," he said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Or, if players want, they can simply wait a month or so for all the episodes to be released and play them all at once. "One of the things that influenced our decision with the weekly releases is the idea that if someone came and saw the trailer and thought it looked cool but wasn't in the zone for something episodic at the time, there's a short enough time window between when the first episode releases and the finale airs that you can decide to wait and play it when it all comes out," Lenart said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's likely what we're seeing right now with the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dispatch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;concurrent player numbers on Steam, but the increase can also be attributed to the growing "snowball" interest in the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dispatch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s success means people are already asking—and were even before the finale—if it'll get a second season. AdHoc Studio hasn't announced anything yet, but Herman said that the extended cast and robust world means "there's potentially more content in the future, if we want there to be." But for now, it's enjoying the release that's been a long way in the making; Herman said&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dispatch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;is a project that could have died "five separate times along the path to get here."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It was really hard to get this game made," Herman said. "We basically made a television show and a video game at the same time, in parallel, and had to blend them together, which we hadn't seen anyone do before. There were not a lot of people who believed in this project. We tried to get this going for a long time. We got funding, we lost funding. Ninety percent of people told us this is never going to sell. We had to basically keep believing in ourselves and our team that we had something special here, that people were going to resonate with."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lenart added: "We put everything on the line. We believed in this type of experience. I don't think we look at this as some random, lucky success to never happen again. We see this type of experience, and the reception it's getting is more validating that there is interest in this type of game."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Columnist, Game Developer</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nicole Carpenter is a veteran reporter who has been covering the video game industry for over a decade.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/dispatch-s-episodic-format-alongside-sharp-storytelling-is-key-to-its-success]]></content:encoded>

<p>"When federal agents threaten his family, former outlaw John Marston is forced to hunt down the gang of criminals he once called friends," the app store's description reads.

<figure data-uuid="6b385640a56aa"><a title="Animal Crossing Amiibo Festival" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6b385640a56aa/animal-crossing-amiibo-festival.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nile Bowie / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Few games have tapped into the popular zeitgeist quite like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> did back in 2020 at the onset of the global pandemic. It’s sold a whopping 48.62 million copies worldwide since launch, elevating Animal Crossing from a fan-favourite series to a full-fledged cultural phenomenon, earning its place alongside Nintendo’s top-tier mascots.</p>
<p>Given all its success, it’s hard to believe just how far the series had fallen with its previous home console entry. Years before New Horizons turned debt repayment into a cosy form of self-care, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/animal_crossing_amiibo_festival">Animal Crossing: Amiibo Festival</a> for the Wii U had already cemented itself not only as the franchise’s most divisive entry but as a contender for one of Nintendo’s worst games. It’s even been blamed for putting YouTuber <a href="https://youtu.be/gUSTyhGCAlE?si=ptvoYh4-ZVoWl5Xa">Scott the Woz in therapy</a>.</p>
<p>When Amiibo Festival hit shelves exactly a decade ago, Nintendo was all-in on experimenting with toys-to-life gimmicks and, following the success of 2013’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/animal_crossing_new_leaf">Animal Crossing: New Leaf</a> on the 3DS, anticipation was high for a new mainline entry that would finally bring the series into HD on a home console. But the reality check came faster than you could scan an amiibo.</p>

<p>Fans were disappointed, to say the least, when Nintendo opted to release a board game instead of a proper new Animal Crossing instalment. The frustration only deepened once <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/wiiu/animal_crossing_amiibo_festival">the reviews</a> rolled in. The game bombed. Reviewers slammed it for being more of a <em>bored game</em> than a board game, taking aim at its price tag, sedate pacing, and overreliance on amiibo scanning.</p>
<p>Truth be told, Amiibo Festival's dire reputation has always intrigued me. When I found a copy on clearance around two years ago, I gave in to temptation to see if it really was as bad as everyone said. I also managed to snag nearly the entire line of amiibos online for a few dollars.</p>
<p>My general impression at the time was that the game was relatively harmless. I played it with my partner, and it worked well enough as a low-stakes way to soak up Animal Crossing vibes when I had already bounced off tending to my overgrown New Horizons island after 200+ hours. It certainly helped that I paid way less for it than the $59.99 MSRP sticker price at release, along with finding the figures and two packs of cards for a song.</p>
<p>With the game’s 10th anniversary upon us, I decided it was time for a proper reappraisal. So, I gathered three friends — all fans of board games and dedicated New Horizons players with hundreds of hours under their belts — and set up an Amiibo Festival night. This was the perfect test group, in theory, exactly the kind of audience Nintendo had in mind back in 2015.</p>
<p>Our mission was to find out if Amiibo Festival has any redeeming qualities, or if it truly deserves its place among Nintendo’s most notorious misfires...</p>
<h2>Terminally chill</h2>
<figure data-uuid="011d351527fcf"><a title="Animal Crossing amiibo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/011d351527fcf/animal-crossing-amiibo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>None of us were looking to dunk on it. We approached it with open minds, wondering whether time might reveal a misunderstood oddity or a bit of overlooked charm in hindsight.</p>
<p>What we found was a game that captures the cosy spirit of Animal Crossing to a tee. But where other social multiplayer titles like Mario Party offset luck-driven board play with skill-based minigames to create lively chaos, this one “just depends on your patience,” as one friend remarked midway through our session, neatly summing up Amiibo Festival’s entire gameplay loop: scan, roll, and read.</p>
<p>It’s played with a single Wii U GamePad. You take turns scanning your amiibo figures to roll the dice, moving your characters the number of spaces shown. Each space either grants or deducts Happy Points and Bells — akin to Mario Party’s Stars and Coins — and triggers a short, text-based slice-of-life vignette accompanied by a brief cutscene.</p>
<p>Each space tells a wholesome little story, ranging from earning Bells for helping a villager to losing Happy Points because seagulls ate the turnips you planned to sell on the Stalk Market – outcomes that are entirely luck-based. These moments are charming in theory and undeniably in tune with Animal Crossing’s cosy ethos, but they have no gameplay consequence.</p>

<p>Occasionally, events break up the monotony. Familiar characters appear on certain days, with Joan the turnip vendor offering the most mechanically interesting feature: you can invest Bells in her stock of turnips, then try to sell them later as prices fluctuate across different board spaces. It’s a small flicker of strategy in an otherwise automated board game.</p>
<p>Before starting a round, you choose a month of the year, with the board reflecting the corresponding season. Snow blankets the town in winter, cherry blossoms bloom in spring, and seasonal characters like Jack, the self-proclaimed Czar of Halloween, appear during October. But it’s all largely a reskin; the core gameplay remains the same no matter the month.</p>
<p>After every player completes their move, the in-game calendar advances by one day. The cycle repeats until the month ends, at which point Bells convert into Happy Points and a winner is declared. Before starting the board game, you can adjust the session length. A full playthrough with four players took us around 75 minutes.</p>
<h2>Charm offended</h2>
<p>By the end of our session, opinions were split. Two players said they enjoyed it for what it was. “It’s cute and chill,” one said, praising the cheerful music and charming event cutscenes. Another said its appeal lies more in treating it as a lightly interactive background activity, something to half-play while chatting and sharing snacks.</p>
<figure data-uuid="9fa6c519d60dc"><a title="Animal Crossing amiibo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9fa6c519d60dc/animal-crossing-amiibo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Others in the group were less charitable. One gave it a “three or four out of ten.” They admitted they only enjoyed themselves “because we were all playing together,” adding, “the people were fun, not the game.” When it came time for a final score, the group average settled around a 5/10, with everyone agreeing the game fails to do enough to keep you engaged.</p>
<p>I asked whether Amiibo Festival really deserved its reputation as one of Nintendo’s worst games, and the group was divided. One immediately agreed, calling it “definitely one of the worst Nintendo games I’ve played.” Another pushed back, saying it was “a bit harsh” and that “you can tell they tried.” The problem, they argued, isn’t a lack of care but a lack of <em>game</em>.</p>
<p>Indeed, it may be the most passive party game ever conceived. The decision to keep Amiibo Festival’s minigames separate from the main board game could explain why the proceedings felt monotonous. Then again, it’s hard to say a combined mode would be any more fun. The eight minigames on offer can only be accessed by scanning amiibo cards and are unlocked gradually as you play the main mode.</p>
<p>Cramming these into the board game would be an exercise in logistics. Imagine juggling a Wii U GamePad, an amiibo figure, and several amiibo cards, all of which would need to be scanned mid-round if minigames suddenly appeared. The idea of pausing play to put down your amiibo, scan in cards, and pass the GamePad around the room all feels excessively cumbersome.</p>

<p>These standalone minigames don’t set the world on fire, but certainly add to the package, showcasing how that Amiibo Festival isn’t completely devoid of gameplay. Desert Island Escape emerges as the standout – a lightly strategic, single-player turn-based survival mode where players gather resources, craft tools, and build a raft to escape a deserted island.</p>
<p>A few others, like Balloon Island and the trivia-style Quiz Show, have their charms, but most are built around clunky amiibo-card scanning that feels forced and unnecessary. Two of the minigames require six cards to play — more than the three bundled in with the game — implying an additional purchase just to access all the content on the disc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Does it feel like this game was made to sell amiibos?”<br>
“Yes.”<br>
“Is scanning an amiibo to roll dice fun?”<br>
“No.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Therein lies the core problem with Amiibo Festival: it feels less like a game designed around amiibo and more like one designed to <em>sell</em> them. The consensus among my test group was that its central mechanic — scanning figures to roll dice — felt like a marketing mandate, not an idea born from gameplay. Everyone agreed that doing so every turn quickly became tedious.</p>
<h2>Post-amiibo clarity</h2>
<figure data-uuid="e29326ab8e1fa"><a title="Animal Crossing amiibo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e29326ab8e1fa/animal-crossing-amiibo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>My hunch is that Amiibo Festival would be far less hated if it had been released for free on the eShop and been framed as a nifty value-add for those who bought the Animal Crossing amiibo and card sets, rather than as a full-priced retail title. At least then, it might’ve been remembered as an inoffensive curiosity rather than a complete commercial misfire.</p>
<p>A decade on, Amiibo Festival feels like a relic from a time when Nintendo was grasping for direction, convinced that toys-to-life was its next big thing. It wasn’t.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the company — and the series — found its footing. The runaway success of New Horizons proved there was no need for gimmicks. And as disappointing as its predecessor is, I don’t think I’ll need therapy.</p>

            <p>Over 200 staff at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a> developers Rockstar North have signed a letter to management calling for the "immediate reinstatement" of 31 workers fired recently by the company. Rockstar claimed they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-have-been-accused-of-union-busting-after-the-firing-of-more-than-30-staff-members">fired these staffers for "gross misconduct"</a>, subsequently accusing them of sharing confidential info publicly. UK union the IWGB, of which the fired staff were members, have accused Rockstar of union busting and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/iwgb-union-file-legal-claims-against-rockstar-due-to-gta-6-maker-allegedly-refusing-to-negotiate-over-firings">filed legal claims</a> against the company.</p>
<p>The union have also held protests outside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ah-shit-here-we-go-again-gta-6-developers-speak-from-the-picket-line-about-rockstar-north-union-busting">Rockstar North</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-rockstar-accuse-fired-staff-of-leaking-secrets-unions-launch-street-protests-against-publisher-take-two">Take-Two's UK offices</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Now, <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/rockstar-open-letter-13-11-25/">according to the IWGB</a>, a letter signed by 220 staff at Edinburgh-based Rockstar North has been delivered to the studio's management. The letter calls for the "immediate reinstatement" of the fired workers, and condemns the decision to boot them out of their jobs in the first place.</p>
<p>"It’s heartwarming to see so many of our colleagues supporting us and holding management to account – during a period where Rockstar want us to feel scared, my brave former colleagues are marching straight up to our boss’s door and demanding our voices are heard and not backing down," said an anonymous member of the fired Rockstar staff in the union's press release. "It’s clear to everyone close to this situation that this is a blatant, unapologetic act of vicious union busting. Rockstar employs so many talented game developers, all of whom are crucial to making the games we put out."</p><p>Meanwhile, IWGB organiser Fred Carter called the firings an "Amazon-style act of union-busting unprecedented in the games industry". More union protests against Rockstar are planned in the very near future, with an 8AM rally outside Take Two’s London office and a 4PM CET protest outside the company’s Paris headquarters - the latter staged by the French STJV (Le Syndicat des Travailleureuses du Jeu Vidéo) union - set to take place on November 14th. There's also a protest set to take place at 6PM on November 18th outside the Scottish Parliament in Holyrood, Edinburgh, timed to coincide with a cross-party parliamentary group meeting about the Scottish games industry.</p>
<p>GTA 6 remains a spectre now lurking on November 19th, 2026, following its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-everyone-gta-6-has-been-hit-with-delay-number-two">most recent delay</a> around the time news of the firings broke.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-quietly-dumps-the-forerunner-265-now-selling-the-garmin-watch-for-pocket-change-2000643948</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-quietly-dumps-the-forerunner-265-now-selling-the-garmin-watch-for-pocket-change.1352767/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You don’t need to spend $1,100 on the latest <em>Fenix 8</em> to get a serious running watch that tracks everything you need. The sweet spot in Garmin’s lineup has always been the <em>Forerunner</em> series, and for good reason: these watches outsell everything else in the brand’s catalog. The Forerunner 265 is the most premium and popular model in the range and packs a brilliant AMOLED display and advanced training metrics that rival watches costing twice as much. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5552/">just quietly marked it down to $299, slashed from its usual $449 price tag</a>. That’s an <strong>all-time low</strong> for a watch that delivers fantastic running features without the extreme price of Garmin’s flagship models.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5552/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why Runners Keep Picking This Watch</h2>
<p>The difference is apparent from the very first moments you fire up the Forerunner 265: that <strong>brilliant AMOLED touchscreen pops with color and sharp text</strong>&nbsp;which remains quite readable under direct sunlight, joined by traditional button controls that work beautifully when your hands are sweaty or you’re wearing gloves. The <strong>46mm size</strong> makes the watch feather-light on your wrist so you just about forget it’s there on those ultra-long runs-or really through most of the day. Get <strong>up to 13 days of battery life in smartwatch mode</strong> and up to 20 hours in GPS mode to give you plenty of juice for training weeks.</p>
<p>Your day begins with a personalized report which provides context for how to approach each and every training day. Upon waking, you get an overview of your sleep quality, recovery status, and training outlook alongside HRV status, training readiness, and local weather. This information helps you decide if today is the day to push hard or if your body needs an easier session. The training readiness score brings together <strong>sleep quality, recovery, training load, and HRV status</strong> to tell you if you’re primed to go hard and get the most out of your workout.</p>



<p>Race preparation becomes strategic with <strong>personalized daily suggested workouts</strong>. You input your target race and course details into the Garmin Connect app, and the watch creates training plans that adapt after every run to match your current performance and recovery status. The race widget on your watch keeps your goal front and center while the workouts adapt as your body responds to training.</p>



<p>Multi-band GNSS technology with SatIQ provides accuracy in positioning that more affordable watches simply cannot attain. This matters when you’re running in areas with tall buildings, heavy tree cover, or challenging terrain where the basic GPS signals struggle. Optimizing this accuracy for battery life means you won’t be sacrificing runtime to get accurate distance and pace. You <strong>have more than 30 built-in activity profiles for running, triathlon, cycling, open-water swimming, and lots more</strong>.</p>
<p>Safety features add peace of mind during solo training sessions. <strong>Incident detection works</strong> during select outdoor activities and sends a message with your live location to emergency contacts when paired with your compatible smartphone. The <em>Assistance</em> feature lets you manually trigger an alert when you need help, something that is good to have when you are exploring new routes or training in remote areas.</p>
<p>At $299, you’re getting a watch that competes directly with models costing $600 or more.</p>

 <p>The news comes after <a href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-krafton-ai-pubg-bloodlines-2-motion-blur-2000638553">Krafton committed $70 million</a> in investment for GPU clusters to drive its agentic AI transformation and as fellow South Korea publisher <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-gen-ai-nexon-eurogamer-voices-2000643436">Nexon suggested</a> adopting generative AI technology is a matter of survival.</p> <h2>220 <em>GTA 6</em> devs signed a letter blasting the firing of 31 colleagues</h2> <p>The IGWB trade union group in the UK announced on Thursday that the letter was delivered to Rockstar management. It accused the company of union busting and demanded the reinstatement of the previously fired developers. French union STJV is planning a protest in front of Take-Two France on Friday.</p>

 <p>“It’s heartwarming to see so many of our colleagues supporting us and holding management to account—during a period where Rockstar want us to feel scared, my brave former colleagues are marching straight up to our boss’s door and demanding our voices are heard and not backing down,” one of the fired employees said in a statement. “It’s clear to everyone close to this situation that this is a blatant, unapologetic act of vicious union busting. Rockstar employs so many talented game developers, all of whom are crucial to making the games we put out.”</p>

 <h2>Could <em>GTA 6</em>‘s delay also delay the launch of the PS6?</h2> <p>That’s the thought experiment one recently analyst proposed. “We are currently forecasting a next-gen PlayStation and Xbox to arrive in late 2027–but might the console companies be tempted to get more from the current console generation by riding the <em>GTA 6</em> wave and waiting until 2028?” Ampere Analysis research director Piers Harding-Rolls <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-games-industry-reacts-to-the-delay-of-gta-6">posed the idea to <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em></a>. “The fact that games are now cross-gen makes this less of a factor, perhaps, but such is the size of the <em>GTA</em> franchise, the launch timing will get all areas of the games business thinking about their product strategies.”</p>

 <p>The idea here is that GTA 6 will lead to a spike in new console sales that will dramatically increase the current-gen install base. If that peak doesn’t come until early 2027, console makers might have an incentive to wait a bit before pushing out their next hardware release. But as Harding-Rolls also points out, backwards compatibility makes that less of an issue these days.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>is the latest monster-taming RPG in the series to forgo voice acting. As these games have become more cinematic, it’s become pretty jarring that these characters don’t have voices when they speak. </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> has fully animated scenes in which characters’ mouths flap as they speak, but no sound actually comes out. As such, fans have been making their own voice dubs of the series for years, and there are </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2iFaaUZo9M"><span>some pretty good ones out there</span></a><span>. There’s also a deeply unserious one by </span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/review-final-fantasy-16-ffxvi-ps5-rpg-release-date-1850558485">Final Fantasy XVI</a> </span></i><span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402?_gl=1*9icn1w*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDcyMzIxNjAkbzU4JGcxJHQxNzQ3MjQ1MDg0JGo2MCRsMCRoMCRkTGhKQ1VESkJYd2lqTzFUMTlocEx1a0ptWERkbVBiM21jZw.."><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a><span> actor Ben Starr playing Naveen from </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> completely straight with his usual broody delivery.</span></p> <p><span>In a recent episode of the Kit &amp; Krysta Podcast, Starr “auditioned” for the role, with co-hosts Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang acting alongside him as the protagonist and Taunie. Starr, hilariously, makes no attempt to capture Naveen’s youth and pretty much whips out his gravely Clive voice from </span><i><span>Final Fantasy XVI</span></i><span>. If you’ve ever wanted to hear Starr be a broody simp for a Pokémon streamer, here’s your chance.</span></p>   <p><span>It’s a funny bit and I have to applaud the artistic choices made with a mostly straight face here, but it does underline that a lot of the character of these games can be dialed up and enhanced with a good voice actor in the booth. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> definitely shows that Game Freak has the writing chops to execute </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-credits-npc-dialogue-school-kid-2000638839"><span>some really funny, memorable scenes and jokes</span></a><span> despite not including voice acting, but every time I hear a fan try to embody these characters, I just wish the games had that same spark we get in projects like the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-ketchum-pikachu-final-episode-netflix-1850805389"><i><span>Pokémon </span></i></a><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-ketchum-pikachu-final-episode-netflix-1850805389">anime</a> or the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/detective-pikachu-returns-pokemon-review-switch-1850915720"><i><span>Detective Pikachu </span></i></a><span>games. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>takes a baby step toward this future by giving your main character Link-like grunts and yells when they do some actions, but they’re one person in a city full of heroes and villains that I’d love to hear speak instead of just reading. Don’t get me started on that weird scene in </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield </span></i><span>where a whole concert was happening just for a character to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC9vQmmvvfI"><span>pantomime the performance instead of singing</span></a><span>. Though that’s also </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thecamsteady/video/7536409709599870222"><span>allowed fans to interpret that character’s musical chops</span></a><span>, as well.</span></p>

                <p>During the final week of October, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstar-accused-of-firing-grand-theft-auto-devs-over-union-organization/1100-6535862/" data-ref-id="1100-6535862">Rockstar Games fired more than 30 employees</a> across offices in the United Kingdom and Canada. Rockstar subsequently claimed that the staff members were let go for "gross misconduct," but the employees contend that they were terminated for attempting to organize with a union. Now, the battle over those labor moves may be heading to court.</p><p>Over 200 Rockstar employees have signed letters demanding that their colleagues be reinstated to their jobs. The fired workers were all members of the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain, and the organization has called Rockstar's actions "the most ruthless act of union busting in the history of the games industry."</p><p>The fired staff members have been joined by current employees and other supporters for protests outside of the offices for Rockstar and its parent company, Take-Two Interactive. Additional protests are planned for the company's offices in London and Paris later this week.</p><p>IWGB representatives have pushed back against Rockstar's claims that the ex-employees leaked sensitive information about the company or its games in the union's Discord channels. Additionally, the IWGB has filed formal legal claims against Rockstar that may be a precursor towards a long battle in court.</p><p>"It's heartwarming to see so many of our colleagues supporting us and holding management to account--during a period where Rockstar want us to feel scared, my brave former colleagues are marching straight up to our boss's door and demanding our voices are heard and not backing down," wrote one of the former employees, whose real name was withheld. "It's clear to everyone close to this situation that this is a blatant, unapologetic act of vicious union busting. Rockstar employs so many talented game developers, all of whom are crucial to making the games we put out."</p><p>Rockstar has already made the prediction that its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-569323">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> launch will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-to-have-largest-game-launch-in-history-rockstar-says/1100-6534732/" data-ref-id="1100-6534732">the biggest video game debut in history</a>. The release date was recently pushed back to November 19, 2026 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.

                <p>Grand Theft Auto V's multiplayer game, GTA Online, is available for free, but only for a limited time.</p><p>Rockstar Games has announced that GTA Online for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S is free to download and play now through November 17. Additionally, there is no PS Plus or Game Pass Essential requirement to play online, the developer said in a <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/3921419k23a552/lay-a-proper-foundation-in-new-listings" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>.</p><p>GTA Online became a standalone game in 2022, and it normally costs $20. To be sure, after this free week wraps up, people will have to buy the game to keep playing. Alternatively, they can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-online-is-now-included-with-gta-membership/1100-6535997/" data-ref-id="1100-6535997">subscribe to GTA+ ($8/month) to get GTA Online</a>, Red Dead Redemption, and a bunch of other games, along with GTA Online perks, for as long as their membership stays active. GTA 5, meanwhile, was recently <a href="https://gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-plus-extra-premium-games-for-november-2025-include-chilling-horror-and-monster-trucks/2900-7252/" data-target="true">re-introduced to PlayStation Plus.</a></p><h2><strong>Next big GTA Online update in December</strong></h2><p>Rockstar has steadily updated GTA Online over the years, and the next big update in December will add mansion properties that people can buy.</p><p>"There's a new entrant in the Los Santos high-end real estate scene, and they're making moves into some of the most exclusive neighborhoods. Prix Luxury Real Estate has ambitious plans, bringing new unrivaled mansion properties to this lucrative market in December," Rockstar said.</p><p>Prior to the December update, people can take on three new missions related to the update that will pay out double GTA$ and RP, or quadruple those rates for GTA+ members. People who complete the missions will be able to buy the new mansion properties for a discount of GTA$ 2 million off what they will cost for people who don't do the missions.</p><p>People who complete all three missions also get a cash injection of GTA$ 1 million, along with cosmetics for their character. And anyone who simply logs in to GTA Online between now and December 7 will earn "Black Tier VIP" status, which entitles them to a free Ubermacht Revolter car.</p><p>The GTA Online freebie offer comes just after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-november-2026/1100-6536012/" data-ref-id="1100-6536012">Rockstar delayed GTA 6 to November 2026</a>. And in other Rockstar-related news, the ESRB just recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-rated-for-switch-2-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-s/1100-6536175/" data-ref-id="1100-6536175">posted a rating for Red Dead Redemption for modern consoles</a>, sparking speculation about a possible remaster.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Konami and developer NeoBards Entertainment have rolled out a new update for Silent Hill f that introduces a new Casual action difficulty. In addition, the patch notes point to an added skip feature for New Game+ players, faster stamina replenishment for <a href="https://silenthill.fandom.com/wiki/Hinako_Shimizu" rel="nofollow ">Hinako</a>, and enemy reductions in certain areas.</p><p dir="ltr">There is a laundry list of bug fixes with the new Silent Hill f update, too, according to <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/silenthill/f/news/us/en/patch-note_v110" rel="nofollow ">Konami's website</a>. Interestingly, it's noted that the Casual action difficulty can be selected from the start, or the survival-horror game will offer it up as an option upon dying a certain amount of times. The skipping sections feature for New Game+ is optional as well, with Konami noting it won't "impact branching paths or endings."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Silent Hill F Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The Silent Hill f system changes all sound like they're making the game a bit easier across the board. Along with quicker stamina recharging and fewer enemies, the patch notes state that "unskippable combat encounters" have been skimmed down. Plus, even the Hard action difficulty is reducing damage a tad to Hinako.</p><p dir="ltr">Launching in September,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-fs-launch-sales-higher-than-silent-hill-2-remake/1100-6535077/"> Silent Hill f sold over 1 million copies</a> in just 24 hours. That means the game hit the sales milestone faster than the Silent Hill 2 remake, developed by Bloober Team. Speaking of which, Bloober Team is now <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-remake-seemingly-teased-by-bloober-team/1100-6532382/">working on a remake of the original Silent Hill</a>. There is also a new movie adaptation for the franchise coming in the next couple of months: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/return-to-silent-hill-movie-teaser-brings-back-an-iconic-monster/1100-6534296/">Return to Silent Hill</a>, based on Silent Hill 2, is planned to premiere in theaters on January 23.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out GameSpot's<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/silent-hill-f-review-spirited-away/1900-6418411/"> Silent Hill f review</a>.

<p>"Announced in front of a packed auditorium at the Disney+ Originals Preview at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, executive producer of the series’ Hideo Kojima, and the series’ director Takayuki Sano, appeared on stage to announce that their first ever partnership with a global streaming platform will be with Disney+ and that the latest expansion of the Death Stranding franchise will be an animated series," according to the announcement post. "New concept art created by Ilya Kuvshinov, who served as character designer for <em>Ghost in the Shell: SAC_2045</em>, was also revealed along with the <em>Death Stranding Isolations</em> (working title) announcement."</p><p><strong>Here's the full synopsis of </strong><em><strong>Death Stranding Isolations</strong></em><strong>:&nbsp;</strong></p><p><em>Once, there was an explosion...</em></p><p><em>Lonesome souls of the dead manifest in the physical world, reaching in search of the living. However, the connection they create triggers a massive explosion that eradicates anything of this world—a phenomenon referred to as the Death Stranding. These events wipe out nations as well as civilization itself. People who remain are now isolated, withdrawn, and without connections. As humanity stands at the brink a legendary porter set out to transport both cargo and wishes of its senders, reconnecting people in the hope that they might still be saved.</em></p><p><em>Based on the video game born out of the mind of legendary game creator, Hideo Kojima, comes a new animation series headed by Japan’s up-and-coming animation studio E&amp;H production. Helmed by E&amp;H’s Takayuki Sano, it follows in the footsteps of the original in spirit and ideas and depict the world of Death Stranding through a bold and yet subtle touch and top-class hand-drawn animation. &nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Somewhere in North America, just as Sam Bridges walks through the continent in order to save America, the someones are also trying to deal with their isolation in their own way. An old man trying to realize salvation through ways outside of the connection advocated by Bridges. A female warrior who tries to kickstart a world of constant fighting. A boy with a grudge against Bridges. A girl who embraces loneliness.</em></p><p><em>On the precipice of the end of humanity and the world, their fates and hopes converge, as another story of Death Stranding begins.</em></p><p><em>And now, comes another explosion...&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Death Stranding Isolations</em> is the current working title, so the series' name could change, but when it premieres, it will do so on the Disney+ streaming service in 2027. <em>Isolations</em> is not to be confused with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/23/death-stranding-animated-film-announced"><em>Death Stranding: Mosquito</em></a> (working title), which is an animated film set in the Death Stranding universe currently in the works, or <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/07/death-stranding-movie-lands-the-director-of-a-quiet-place-day-one">the live-action Death Stranding movie A24 is creating</a> with <em>A Quiet Place: Day One </em>director Michael Sarnoski.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, read <em>Game Informer's </em>reviews for <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/death-stranding/death-stranding-review-the-wanderer">Death Stranding</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/boundless-sincerity-aside-flaws">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What kind of story do you hope Isolations tells?

            <p>A new trailer for Fallout Season 2 has been released, giving us a quick peak at what'll be going down in and around New Vegas. Moments of note include a fight with a Deathclaw, a glimpse of The Kings, and a close up of Macaulay Culkin.</p>
<p>A continuation of the incredibly popular first season, this time The Ghoul and Lucy Maclean follow Hank Maclean into the Nevada desert where they'll surely run into all manner of ne'er-do-wells. They're followed by Maxmimus of the Brotherhood of Steel, who'll have to wrestle with a giant monster, as well as his feelings. Which will prove harder? Who knows… Neato!</p>
<p>Macaulay Culkin is seen as a member of The Legion, seemingly stabbing some poor guy in a gruesome fashion. He doesn't seem to be having the worst time of it either, which makes sense considering what Fallout fans will already know about The Legion and how they get down. You can watch the trailer yourself, embedded below.</p>

              <p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is certainly one of 2025’s big success stories, but you’d be hard-pressed to call its concept wholly original. Sandfall Interactive’s turn-based RPG may well have been first to combine fully real-time movement with turn-based combat, but it was built on the shoulders of games like <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em>, <em>Atelier Ryza</em> and even <em>Mario RPG </em>and&nbsp;<em>Paper Mario</em>, along with a wealth of other influences (<em>Final Fantasy</em>,&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>,&nbsp;<em>Earthbound</em>…). So when another studio independently developers a turn-based RPG with real-time dodge and parry mechanics, it’s hardly a given that it’s lifting directly from this year’s hit. Yet this is the accusation <em>The Time I Have Left</em> is being bombarded with, and it’s really getting developer Ground down.</p> <p>The forthcoming RPG, which describes itself as “a time-driven escape adventure with RPG elements,” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2129480/The_Time_I_Have_Left_Demo/">has had its most recent demo available on Steam</a> for just over a month, and it’s been mostly been well-received by players, albeit with the qualification that combat is rather “clunky”—a term used by an awful lot of Steam reviews. However, it’s a different criticism that’s bothering developers Ground, and that’s the suggestion that its copying <em>Expedition 33</em>. Something the team suggests would be a tricky feat, given demos of its game were playable in 2022, some three years before the French success was released.</p>

 <p>“Every time someone accuses us of ripping off&nbsp;<em>Expedition 33</em>, we die a little bit inside,” the team wrote <a href="https://x.com/ground_ga/status/1988670588311990583">on X</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/groundga.bsky.social/post/3m5hgbijcms2j">BlueSky</a>. “Yes, it’s a turn-based RPG,” the post continues, and “Yes, it has dodges and parries.” But, the developers implore readers, “our game already had all that in the public demos we released in 2022 and 2024.” The post concludes, “No need to call us names.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Every time someone accuses us of ripping off Expedition 33, we die a little bit inside.</p> <p>Yes, it's a turn-based RPG.<br>Yes, it has dodges and parries.</p> <p>Our game already had all that in the public demos we released in 2022 and 2024.<br>No need to call us names🫠 <a href="https://t.co/zhe5XKQyQ4">pic.twitter.com/zhe5XKQyQ4</a></p> <p>— The Time I Have Left⏳Demo OUT NOW (@ground_ga) <a href="https://twitter.com/ground_ga/status/1988670588311990583?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 12, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Rather cannily, the post also features a brief trailer for the indie game and its fantastic red, black, and white aesthetic, which has hopefully drawn in a whole bunch of new eyes after the tweet went gently viral. The developers later noted their delight at the supportive response they’ve received to this, with almost 1,000 replies so far.</p>

 <p>Ground hasn’t had a particularly easy time of late. The studio itself went bankrupt earlier in the year, but <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1918830/discussions/0/595160802290523510/">the entire staff has continued on developing the game</a> while seeking more support, and has still managed to put out the new demo. And given the popularity of&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, it’d make some degree of sense for publishers to take note of this one, given there’s a pre-built audience out there right now.</p> <p><em>The Time I Have Left</em> features imbalanced combat in which enemies get more actions per turn than you, but you have multiple ways to influence the fight during their moves. There are parries and dodges, but also interrupts, counters, and even ways to gain more turns for yourself, with different suites of direct control in both phases of battles. The developers welcome feedback on the demo on Steam, although perhaps avoid mentioning you-know-what if you do.</p>
