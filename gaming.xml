			<p>We all knew that an official remaster for <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a> was coming from Bethesda and Virtuos. There were <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-will-be-officially-showcased-tomorrow-bethesda-announces/">more than enough leaks</a> to let us know ahead of time. But we also knew for a long time that a group of modders were already working on their own remake/remaster of Oblivion in Skyrim, called <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-lead-comments-on-nearly-official-oblivion-remaster/">Skyblivion</a>.</p>
<p>Bethesda has always supported modding groups like the Skyblivion team, mainly by not getting in their way and trying to halt the work the modders are doing with a cease and desist order. With the launch of the Oblivion Remaster, Bethesda went a bit further in their support, the Skyblivion team confirmed.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/TESRSkyblivion/status/1914751791381495955">post on X</a>, the Skyblivion team thanked Bethesda for sending each member of the modding team a game code for the Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remaster.</p>
<p>"<em>Huge thanks to our friends at Bethesda Studios for their continued support of Skyblivion!</em>" the post read. "<em>As massive fans, we're beyond grateful for the generous gift of Oblivion Remastered game keys for our entire modding team! This means so much to us. Thank you for everything, Bethesda</em><em>.</em>"</p>
<p>Skyblivion is a total conversion mod that turns the Special Edition release of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim into Oblivion. It's been in development for <a href="http://wccftech.com/skyrim-special-edition-oblivion-remaster-mod-skyblivion-gets-new-teaser-trailer/">years</a>, and nearly a decade later, the Skyblivion team is nearing the finish line, with a launch planned for <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-team-confirms-2025-launch-window-though-dlcs-will-come-later/">sometime in 2025</a>.</p>
<p>Wccftech has <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-lead-comments-on-nearly-official-oblivion-remaster/">followed</a> its development for practically the whole of that time, so we're just as excited for its release as we are of the fact that Bethesda and Virtuos have made their own remaster of Oblivion.</p>
<p>Both versions will also have big key differences, like the fact that Skyblivion will include more gameplay changes and cut content instead of just being the original Oblivion with a fresh coat of Unreal Engine 5 paint. There's room enough for both Skyblivion and the Oblivion Remaster. In the end, it's the fans who are winning.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mantic-games-announces-assassins-creed-animus-is-coming-to-kickstarter<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mantic Games is partnering with Ubisoft for an Assassin's Creed board game. The tabletop developer behind Halo: Flashpoint will be developing <em>Assassin's Creed: Animus</em>, a game spanning multiple eras and protagonists from across the franchise.</p>

<h2>The <em>Assassin's Creed: Animus</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, <em>Assassin's Creed: Animus </em>is an ambitious tabletop adaptation where 2-4 players work together using fan-favorite Assassin's Creed characters. The press release included characters like Ezio Auditore, Conner Kenway, Altair Ibn-La'Ahad, and Eivor Varinsdottir. Furthermore, it will feature "enjoyable, challenging, and choice-rich gameplay."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-animus-conner-promo-image.jpg?itok=-phvRV3Q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-animus-conner-promo-image.jpg?itok=HAUDIYoe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The press release is lax on any further details regarding complexity or detail on <em>Assassin's Creed: Animus</em>. Given developer Mantic Games history of complex but accessible miniatures games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/overdrive-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Overdrive</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/halo-flashpoint-rise-of-banished-brings-alien-exiles-to-battlefield" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Halo: Flashpoint</em></a>, it is likely this board game will be in that mold.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time <em>Assassin's Creed</em> has gotten a tabletop adaptation. Back in 2021 there was <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/assassins-creed-board-game-raises-shipping-costs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood of Venice</em></a> developed by Triton Noir, which focused more on Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood.</p>

<p>Since <em>Assassin's Creed</em> is about secret orders of assassins taking out targets with parkour, gadgets, and hidden blades across different eras of history, that kind of gameplay loop can translate well to a miniatures environment. A focus on spatial and environmental awareness, planning your moves. Choosing the right time to strike and escape. With some time and consideration, Mantic's style can mesh well here.</p>

<p><em>Assassin's Creed</em> is one of publisher Ubisoft's most popular action franchises. It began in 2007 and has continued to the present. The franchise has covered multiple historical eras, including The Crusades, the Italian Renaissance, the American Revolution, the Golden Age of Piracy, the French Revolution, the British Industrial Revolution, the time <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">of Vikings</a>, and recently, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-shadows" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Feudal Japan</a>.</p>

<p>The Kickstarter campaign for Assassin's Creed: Animus will be going live at some point later this year.</p>

<p>"Bethesda has always been supportive of community projects like ours, and we don't see that changing anytime soon," the team wrote at the time.</p>

      The latest "making of" trailer for the ambitious Skyblivion modding project.

          </p>

<p>Other publishers aren't always similarly open to competition from fans, though. Nintendo has long <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/what-to-make-of-valves-recent-fan-project-takedowns/">taken a legal scorched earth approach</a> to a wide variety of fan games that use its licensed characters or trademarks. And last year, Valve <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/what-to-make-of-valves-recent-fan-project-takedowns/">also took steps</a> to shut down a number of fan remakes of its legacy games.</p>
<p>In 2016, Blizzard <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/04/blizzard-shuts-down-popular-fan-run-pirate-server-for-classic-wow/">shut down</a> a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/07/blizzard-shuts-down-legacy-wow-fan-server-hours-after-it-goes-up/">couple</a> of fan-run "classic" <em>World of Warcraft</em> servers in the run-up to its announcement of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/11/world-of-warcraft-classic-is-official-will-bring-vanilla-wow-back/">official <em>World of Warcraft Classic</em> servers</a>. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/activision-kills-fan-clients-for-classic-call-of-duty-multiplayer-mods/">Activision</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/10/ea-shuts-down-fan-run-servers-for-older-battlefield-games/">EA</a> have similarly shut down modded servers for legacy online titles.</p>
<p>Some publishers have mirrored Bethesda's more open approach to modders, though. Sega <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/04/sega-embraces-legal-console-game-modding-with-new-genesis-pc-emulation-hub/">actively encouraged</a> official <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=34270&amp;browsesort=trend&amp;section=readytouseitems&amp;days=90">Steamworks modding</a> for some Sega Genesis classics released as PC downloads in 2016. And the heavily <em>Halo</em>-inspired <em>Installation 01</em> <a href="https://installation01.org/">continues to thrive</a> with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/06/halo-inspired-fan-game-gets-conditional-thumbs-up-from-microsoft/">something close to official support</a> from Microsoft and developer 343 Industries, as long as it remains a non-commercial project.</p>
<p>As for Skyblivion, while the project's last public road map update <a href="https://skyblivion.com/update/skyblivion-update-ii/">is months old</a> at this point, the team is still confident it will be able to release a version of its ambitious mod later this year. "We are confident that players will be the true winners, having the opportunity to experience both a community-driven reimagining and a professional, modern version of this beloved game."</p>

Though the RPG does a decent job of introducing things to you slowly, by the time you have a full party, you’re juggling pretty distinct characters with bespoke playstyles and trying to find some way to make them fit together. Part of the fun is experimenting with different characters, ability sets, and combos to find what works best for you, so I won’t try to influence your playstyle too much. Still, I do have a few early game tips to help you on your expedition.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195027" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Street Fighter 6’s Modern Controls Are Great For The Game" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="138" data-playlist="195027,196411,196805" data-current="195027"><div><p>Street Fighter 6’s Modern Controls Are Great For The Game</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195027/195027_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195027/195027_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195027/195027_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195027/195027_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20539.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h91894"><a id=""></a><strong>You unlock the camp…later</strong></h2><p>One of the odd design decisions in <em>Clair Obscur </em>is that you will start getting items that can be used at “camp” before you actually unlock the ability to set one up. So if you pick up items to upgrade your weapons and you can’t figure out where to do that, it’s because you probably haven’t unlocked it yet. You can set up camp once you reach the overworld map that lets you travel between hubs. This will come a few hours into playing, and after you have a team of at least three characters.</p><h2 id="h91895"><a id=""></a><strong>Free aim shots don’t end your turn, but use them wisely</strong></h2><p>Each character in <em>Clair Obscur </em>has a free aim ability that lets you aim and shoot projectiles at enemies in real-time. This is helpful for taking out flying enemies that will dodge your standard sword strikes, but it also doesn’t end your turn like an attack, ability, or item will. Your “ammo” is your AP, which fuels most of your abilities, so there is some risk vs. reward involved in just unloading bullets into your enemies. However, since they don’t end your turn, they’re a good tool to fall back on when an enemy has shields that will withstand several hits. If your enemy has shields up, they’ll reduce all incoming damage until a set number of attacks breaks them. These attacks don’t have to hit a certain damage threshold to break the shield, they just have to reach a certain number of strikes. So you can unload several bullets into an enemy to take down their shields, clearing the way for you to use more powerful attacks in the same turn.</p><h2 id="h91896"><a id=""></a><strong>Pictos have stat buffs alongside their base effect</strong></h2><p>One of the most important tools in your arsenal is Pictos. These are equipment that give each character passive buffs and effects, but they’re often more complex than simple stat boosts. Some examples include giving you additional AP for each dodge or parry, letting a character go first in battle, or boosting your standard attack’s damage after a free aim shot. But on top of this, they do often still have stat boosts as well. You have a lot of control over your stats, as you upgrade them manually with each level. However, a good Picto with a buff can make up for not dumping points into one stat or the other. I gave Gustave a Picto that greatly increased his health, freeing me to dump points into strength, defense, and agility. So while the passive abilities that come with Pictos are the draw, keep an eye on their other benefits.</p><h2 id="h91897"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t rely just on dodging, especially against long combos</strong></h2><p><em>Clair Obscur</em>’s turn-based battles are built around timing mechanics. There are QTEs to increase ability power, as well as dodge and parry mechanics to avoid and counter incoming attacks. For much of the early game, I relied on dodging more than parrying because the timing for those felt more forgiving. However, as I got further, I would run into enemies that would string together vicious combos that were so fast that by the time my character returned to their default position after dodging the first attack, the second one was already making contact. This is the kind of scenario in which you have to learn to parry with precision, and perfectly parrying enemy combos will allow you to throw some of that damage back at an enemy. You can mix both of them into your response, but if you commit to parrying, you’ll get the added benefit of countering.</p><h2 id="h91898"><a id=""></a><strong>Make time to talk to your team at camp</strong></h2><p>Sometimes you’ll be forced to set up camp for story reasons, but it’s worth heading to camp of your own volition just to check in on your party. As the game goes on, you’ll unlock social events to learn more about your crew, as well as optional scenes of the whole group reacting to the latest development. So make sure you head to camp to see how folks are holding up.</p><h2 id="h91899"><a id=""></a><strong>Make sure your team has status effect abilities that you can build combos from</strong></h2><p>Almost every ability in <em>Clair Obscur </em>has an additional reaction to something else. Sometimes an attack will get a passive buff if it’s used on an enemy afflicted with a status effect, or they’ll build off one of your character’s personal mechanics. Juggling all these combos and moving parts can be overwhelming, but when you get the hang of it, that’s when the game’s combat really shines. As you’re upgrading your team and assigning their abilities, look for combo opportunities even if the individual move might not seem that great on its own. I gave Gustave an ability that “marks” enemies for higher damage, despite it not really doing much beyond that. Maelle was then able to follow it up with an attack that would further increase damage to marked enemies, making it easy to reach the 9999 threshold with one attack. Gustave has an attack that self-heals when he strikes an enemy afflicted with burn, so I would have Lune unleash fire spells that would affect the whole enemy team right at the beginning of a match so he could leech off them. These combos are laid out pretty clearly in the battle UI, but there are so many different status effects and individual character mechanics that initially I would often stumble upon these interactions without realizing they were in my toolset. Once I started paying more attention to these, new strategies formed as I moved down the skill tree.</p><h2 id="h91900"><a id=""></a><strong>Burn is your best friend</strong></h2><p>Set your enemies on fire early and often. The Burn status effect deals decent damage at the beginning of every enemy turn. The effect stacks, so you can theoretically keep it going for an entire battle until the enemy is burnt to a crisp by reapplying fire spells and abilities before the status effect ends. This is especially useful when fighting fast enemies who get multiple turns in a row, as it will use their speed against them and deal more damage.</p><h2 id="h91901"><a id=""></a><strong>Maelle is much more powerful than you think</strong></h2><p>The only piece of advice I will give you in terms of party composition is that Maelle, the rapier-wielding party member, should always be on your team. Homegirl’s stance-shifting kit allows her to pivot between stat distributions in the middle of a fight to prioritize attack or defense, and the trade-off for that flexibility is that her stance changes are tied to other abilities. For example, some attacks will automatically shift her to one stance or another, and that means moving into the desired one can sometimes require a few turns of setup. But once you lock her into the Virtuose Stance that doubles her attack power, you are set up to take out nearly any enemy with a flick of her wrist. Managing her stance shifting requires some forethought, and that can make her challenging to use and strategize around, but once you figure out how best to utilize her abilities, she will mow through the most powerful foes you’ll face in <em>Clair Obscur</em>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He touched on the “blood, sweat, and tears” that went into bringing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-interactive-map">every inch of Cyrodiil</a> to life, and that’s why it’s been such a shock to see Oblivion reimagined in nearly every way.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was assuming this was going to be a texture update,” Nesmith said. “I didn’t really think it was going to be the complete overhaul that they’ve announced it to be... I would not have batted an eye at that. But to completely redo the animations, the animation system, put in the Unreal Engine, change the leveling system, change the user interface. I mean, that’s, you’re touching every part of the game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda didn’t officially mention Oblivion Remastered before its launch yesterday. Still, longtime fans have been left mostly impressed by the countless changes that range from shallow visual touchups to fundamental gameplay tweaks. Additions such as a new sprint mechanic and changes to the leveling system <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-fans-react-to-all-the-biggest-changes-say-its-good-enough-to-be-called-a-remake"><u>have many feeling like Oblivion Remastered is less of a remaster and more of a remake</u></a>, and Nesmith is leaning the same way.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The closest that could come [to categorising it] is Oblivion 2.0.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“That’s a staggering amount of remastering,” he added. “It almost needs its own word, quite frankly. I’m not sure remaster actually does it justice.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere in his chat, he attempted to label what he’s seen from Oblivion Remastered so far: “The closest that could come [to categorising it] is Oblivion 2.0.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As fans gather to appreciate the work that’s gone into Oblivion Remastered, Bethesda has chimed in with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-comments-on-the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-changes-we-never-wanted-to-remake-it"><u>its own explanation for how it came up with the name for its RPG re-release</u></a>. In a statement posted to social media yesterday, the studio explained that it “never wanted to remake” Oblivion. Instead, its focus was maintaining the experience players know and love while modernizing it for newcomers, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yes-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-still-has-all-the-bugs-glitches-and-memes-fans-know-and-love-from-20-years-ago"><u>warts and all</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We know many of our longtime fans will be thrilled to revisit Oblivion and the land of Cyrodiil,” Bethesda’s statement added. “But there are also so many who have never played it. We can’t thank you enough for all the support you have given us and our games over the years. Our hope with this remaster is, that no matter who you are, when you step out of the Imperial sewer – you feel like you’re experiencing it for the first time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered was revealed and released yesterday as a shadow drop from Bethesda. You can hop into its reimagined version of Cyrodiil on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S now, and if you’re an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscriber, it’s available at no extra cost.

			<p>Circana executive director and video game industry analyst Mat Piscatella has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lniaufpggs26">published</a> the latest monthly sales charts for US video game sales for March 2025, with Assassin's Creed Shadows at the top of the list.</p>
<p>Shadows was the best-selling game in the US for March 2025, which isn't surprising given that Piscatella had already reported that Shadows <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-has-been-the-best-selling-game-in-the-us-its-first-3-weeks-on-the-market/">dominated the weekly sales charts</a> during its first three weeks on the market. And that it had already risen to being the second-best-selling game in 2025 so far, just behind Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p>Following behind Shadows was MLB The Show 25, which was the second-best-selling game for March 2025, and has risen to the fourth-best-selling game for 2025 so far. Hazelight's latest release, Split-Fiction, made it to the number five spot for best-selling games in March 2025 and was just able to crack the top 10 best-selling games of the year in the number 10 spot.</p>
<p>In terms of player engagement and what was the most-played game for the month, that list is less changed, with Fortnite at the top of the list for monthly active users in March 2025 on consoles. The rest of the list was essentially the same, with the rest of the usual suspects of Marvel Rivals, Minecraft, Roblox, Call of Duty, and Grand Theft Auto V all mostly in their same places as last month or changed by only a day or two.</p>
<p>Regarding hardware sales, PlayStation 5 still came out on top, even with hardware sales declining for the month overall by 25%, and PS5 sales in particular dropping 26%, compared to March 2024. The new Midnight Black DualSense, however, led the accessories sales charts.</p>
<p>All together, a very strong start for Assassin's Creed Shadows, with Ubisoft now hoping to keep the momentum going into the rest of the year.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ready-or-not-sales-9m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ready-or-not-sales-hit-9m-ahead-of-summer-console-launch.1171548/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ready-or-not-sales-9m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher VOID Interactive has announced a major&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>sales milestone just a few months before the game's launch on consoles in summer.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>has managed to hit nine million sales since launching on Steam <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ready-or-not-release-date-coming-2021-gameplay-tutorial-shown" rel="nofollow">back in 2021</a>. The game spent two years in Early Access before its 1.0 release in 2023, and it's likely this figure includes Early Access sales as well as those the game has accrued since its full launch.</p>

<p>Still, that sales figure is pretty impressive when considering that&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>is currently only available on PC; the game is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ready-or-not-ps5-xbox-summer" rel="nofollow">due to launch on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S in summer</a>, although we don't have a specific release date for its console launch yet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ready-or-not-sales-9m-hostage.jpg?itok=bTOUK9x9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ready-or-not-sales-9m-hostage.jpg?itok=ZOXpm_rS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>has hit a big new sales milestone.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as hitting nine million sales, VOID Interactive CEO Julio Rodriguez says the game is "approach[ing] 10 million units sold", so don't be surprised if you hear&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>has broken the 10 million barrier in the next few weeks or months.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not</em>, it's a tactical shooter in which players are thrust into "high-risk and realistic scenarios involving SWAT teams".</p>

<p>Your duties might include defusing bombs, dealing with hostage-takers, or working around "barricaded suspects", with plenty of other scenarios available as well. If you like your shooters gritty and realistic,&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>is very much for you.</p>

<p>While the game seems overwhelmingly designed to be played in multiplayer, it is also possible to approach missions on your own, although you will be dealing with AI (that's CPU-controlled rather than generative AI) squadmates if you decide to do so.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. The game is also due to come to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S sometime this summer.</p>

Most major retailers — including <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-2-System%2F15949610846%2F" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fnintendo-switch-2-system-multi%2F6614313.p" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo-switch-2-console%2F-%2FA-94693225%23lnk%3Dsametab" rel="sponsored">Target</a> — will open preorders at 12AM ET on April 24th / 9PM PT on April 23rd, offering gamers a chance to reserve Nintendo’s forthcoming console ahead of its release on June 5th. Nintendo is <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Fhow-to-buy%2F" rel="sponsored">also accepting sign-ups</a> for those looking to secure a Switch 2, though, if you do go that route, be aware that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/641559/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-gameplay-requirements">there are strict requirements</a>.</p><p>Overall, Nintendo appears to be hopeful that it has built up sufficient inventory of its next-generation portable gaming system to meet US demand — something Nintendo of America President Doug Bowser <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645534/nintendo-switch-2-supply-demand-inventory-us-tariffs-doug-bowser" target="_blank">reiterated during a recent CNBC appearance</a>. Still, there’s no guarantee, which is why we recommend taking taking a few moments ahead of the preorder window to best improve your chances of securing a console.</p><p>Here’s what you should know.</p><div><nav><h2>In this article</h2><ul><li><a href="#landing-pages-and-online-start-times">Landing pages and online start times</a></li><li><a href="#what-switch-2-configurations-will-be-available">What Switch 2 configurations will be available?</a></li><li><span><a href="#how-should-i-prepare-for-preorders">How should I prepare for preorders?</a></span><ul><li><a href="#create-accounts-at-every-retailer">Create accounts at every retailer</a></li><li><a href="#download-the-mobile-apps">Download the mobile apps</a></li><li><a href="#sign-up-for-retailer-notifications">Sign up for retailer notifications</a></li><li><a href="#skip-the-accessories-for-now">Skip the accessories (for now)</a></li><li><a href="#bookmark-this-page">Bookmark this page</a></li></ul></li><li><span><a href="#where-can-i-preorder-the-switch-2">Where can I preorder the Switch 2?</a></span><ul><li><a href="#walmart">Walmart</a></li><li><a href="#how-to-preorder-at-target">GameStop</a></li><li><a href="#best-buy">Best Buy</a></li><li><a href="#target">Target</a></li></ul></li></ul></nav></div><div><p id="landing-pages-and-online-start-times"><h2>Landing pages and online start times</h2></p></div><div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->449</span></p><div><p>Preorders start at 12AM ET on April 24th / 9PM PT on April 23rd.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->450</span></p><div><p>Preorders start at 12AM ET on April 24th / 9PM PT on April 23rd.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->450</span></p><div><p>Preorders start at 12AM ET on April 24th / 9PM PT on April 23rd.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->450</span></p><div><p>Preorders start at 11AM ET / 8AM PT on April 24th.</p></div></div></div><div><p id="what-switch-2-configurations-will-be-available"><h2>What Switch 2 configurations will be available?</h2></p></div><p>At launch, the Nintendo Switch 2 will be available in two distinct configurations: a $449.99 standard version and a $499.99 bundle that includes the latest <em>Mario Kart</em> title, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642432/mario-kart-world-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World</a></em>. Nintendo is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/641933/switch-2-mario-kart-world-bundle-limited-time-production">on record saying</a> the bundle will only be available through fall 2025 (or while supplies last), which is a shame, considering picking up the console / game combo saves you $30 on what is likely to be the Switch 2’s biggest launch title. If you don’t manage to secure the bundle, you can pick up <em>Mario Kart World</em> separately <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMario-Kart-World-U-S-Version%2F15940407280" rel="sponsored">for a whopping $79.99</a>.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that prices could change down the line. Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643616/nintendo-switch-2-us-preorders-date">recently raised the price</a> of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642024/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-controllers-mouse-magnetic-attach-c-button">Switch 2 Joy-Con</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637833/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-details">Pro Controller</a> in response to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/604742/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-updates">US tariffs</a>, and has said that “other adjustments to the price of any Nintendo product are also possible in the future depending on market conditions.” The starting price of the Nintendo Switch 2 remains unchanged, but at this point, it feels like the only way to guarantee a console at $449.99 is to purchase one at launch.</p><div><p id="how-should-i-prepare-for-preorders"><h2>How should I prepare for preorders?</h2></p></div><p>If the the rollout of Sony’s PlayStation 5 is any indication, retailers aren’t always well-equipped to handle the massive influx of interest when it comes to console preorders. Inventory for the Switch 2 is likely to be limited as well, which is why we suggest taking a few steps to set yourself up for success <em>ahead</em> of when preorders open on Thursday, April 24th. We’ll do our best to let you know which retailers still have inventory as the night proceeds, but in the meantime, we’ve rounded up a few helpful tips that should help you improve your odds.</p><div><p id="create-accounts-at-every-retailer"><h3>Create accounts at every retailer</h3></p></div><p>First things first: create accounts at Walmart, GameStop, Target, Best Buy, and Amazon if you haven’t done so already. So far, none of the confirmed retailers for the Switch 2 have announced plans to implement a digital queue; however, Best Buy and Walmart have done so with prior console launches in an effort to deter scalpers. That being the case, ensure your account is set up with the appropriate credentials. Confirm your location and delivery info, get your payment details in order, and log in to your account ahead of time.</p><div><p>... most retailers won’t hold your console while you’re in the checkout line</p></div><p>Setting up and verifying this information in advance will help streamline the checkout process, thus allowing you to save precious seconds. This is crucial, given most retailers won’t hold your console while you’re in the checkout line.</p><div><p id="download-the-mobile-apps"><h3>Download the mobile apps</h3></p></div><p>If you own a smartphone, we recommend downloading — and logging into — the respective retailer apps for Walmart, Amazon, GameStop, Best Buy, and Target. In the past, we’ve found that the dedicated mobile apps for various retailers are faster than using a traditional browser; they also provide an additional means of procuring a console, thus increasing your chances of securing a Switch 2 at launch.</p><div><p id="sign-up-for-retailer-notifications"><h3>Sign up for retailer notifications</h3></p></div><p>A couple of retailers, specifically <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fnintendo%2Fnintendo-notifications%2Fpcmcat1736965129196.c%3F" rel="sponsored" target="_blank">Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fconsoles-hardware%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-2%2F20019700.html" rel="sponsored" target="_blank">GameStop,</a> allow you to sign up for preorder updates regarding the Nintendo Switch 2, games, and accessories. So far, neither retailer has divulged much beyond what is available on their retail sites; however, they do serve as yet another opportunity to stay informed regarding how each retailer plans to handle the Switch 2 rollout going forward.</p><div><p id="skip-the-accessories-for-now"><h3>Skip the accessories (for now)</h3></p></div><p>Nintendo will have a raft of new accessories available for the Switch 2 at launch, including a Switch 2 Pro Controller, carrying cases, and even a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641352/nintendo-switch-2-camera-launch">camera accessory for video chats</a>. And while it might be tempting to stack your cart with add-ons, preordering Nintendo’s first-party peripherals takes time that’s better spent on securing a console. Plus, accessory preorders don’t typically sell out nearly as fast as consoles, meaning you can always circle back for extras at Walmart, Best Buy, and other retailers once you’ve managed to reserve your Switch 2.</p><div><p id="bookmark-this-page"><h3>Bookmark this page</h3></p></div><p>This should come as no surprise, but we’ll be updating this page when preorders go live at midnight on April 24th, allowing you to see at a glance which retailers are still accepting preorders on either the standalone console or the pricier <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle.</p><p>A number of other social media accounts — including <a href="https://x.com/Wario64">Wario64</a> and <a href="https://x.com/mattswider">Matt Swider of <em>The Shortcut</em></a> — are likely going to be tracking preorder inventory as well, if you’re looking for additional publications / users to follow in the run-up to the Switch 2 launch.</p><div><p id="where-can-i-preorder-the-switch-2"><h2>Where can I preorder the Switch 2?</h2></p></div><p>Right now, the only confirmed retailers for the Nintendo Switch 2 are Walmart, GameStop, Best Buy, and Target. We anticipate Amazon opening preorders at some point, but based on our previous experience covering console launches, the rollout at Amazon is likely to be sporadic and unpredictable. Either way, we’ll update this post accordingly if Amazon and other retailers begin offering preorders.</p><div><p id="walmart"><h3>Walmart</h3></p></div><p>According to a countdown timer at the top of <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fshop%2Fswitch2" rel="sponsored">Walmart’s Switch 2 landing page</a>, the retailer will open online preorders at 12AM ET on April 24th.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">For the last two years, I've anxiously awaited a "perfect moment" to play <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/baldurs-gate-3-review-let-freedom-reign/1900-6418131/">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, the hit RPG that made D&amp;D converts of non-believers and absolute freaks out of my diehard RPG friends and family. I missed its early-access period, and lacked a capable PC when it was launched, meaning my best bet at getting in on the fun was on console. When it eventually landed there, I was dismayed by its controls, as well as the fact that I overcame a tremendous hurdle only to find a crucial party character had met an unfortunate and grisly end, and was put off at the thought of continuing--or worse, restarting--my journey.</p><p dir="ltr">At last though, Baldur's Gate 3's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3s-final-patch-introduces-cross-play-photo-mode-and-12-new-subclasses/1100-6530875/">final major patch</a> is out. The last bit of content that players are going to get out of Larian is officially in the game, rather than a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-accidentally-released-early-and-you-probably-shouldnt-use-it/1100-6529051/">rogue test branch</a>. That means there are now a metric ton of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-subclasses-in-baldurs-gate-3-and-how-to-unlock-them/2900-6480/">new subclasses to play with</a>, as if the game needed any more mechanical depth than was already present. There's (finally) a photo mode for folks who might want to scrapbook their way through the Forgotten Realms or get the perfect shot of Astarion to print out, hang in their room, and thirstily pant at. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-use-cross-play-in-baldurs-gate-3/1100-6530880/">Cross-play</a> finally allows me and numerous others to bridge the divide between consoles and PC, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-baldurs-gate-3-mods/2900-5661/" data-ref-id="2900-5661">modding tools</a> have been fully surrendered to the community. The game's future is now firmly in the hands of its most stalwart and fire-forged adventurers. It seems that if there were ever a moment to jump into Baldur's Gate 3, it's now.</p><p dir="ltr">Which got me thinking about how much Baldur's Gate 3 has outright changed--a previously abnormal quality for a largely single-player RPG, that is become more common in recent years--over the course of its lifetime, and how glad I am that the story of the game's development has finally come to a close.</p><p dir="ltr">I don't resent Baldur's Gate 3 or Larian for the game's lengthy post-launch support. In fact, I'm sure most are happy about it. When the game did arrive, it appeared to come in hot, and its various segments showed that. Anecdotally, the last act in particular seemed to sag under the weight of a lot of technical debt and deadlines that truncated the amount of care the studio could show it before shipping, and I'm glad for the players who have had this experience fine-tuned and fixed since. Every game that makes it to launch is a miracle and for all its shimmer, Baldur's Gate 3's no different. But among these much-needed fixes, as well as the additions of quality-of-life features, it also became a different game than the one many might've first heard about back in 2023 and it's done my head in trying to keep up with it after all this time.</p><p dir="ltr">That's because month after month, and indeed patch after patch, Baldur's Gate 3 took slightly different shapes than the one it'd first assumed at launch.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwCyTt8fSAU" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CwCyTt8fSAU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr"><span>It first began in the most ridiculous way possible. Within a month of the game's release, Larian admitted that the cast of heartthrobs were never supposed to be so randy, announcing that their </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-companions-were-too-horny-but-that-was-a-bug/1100-6517464/">rampant thirst would actually be toned down</a><span>. For a game whose massive breakthrough with mainstream audiences seemed to be a stream where a </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-includes-grizzly-bear-as-romance-option/1100-6515793/">player slept with a druid in their bear form</a><span>, this was a particularly funny, if fundamental, change to a consequential aspect of the game. Forget the endless choices to be made or the tactical nature of trying to fight in a game that's essentially 5e D&amp;D, what ever were we supposed to do if Gale didn't lust after us upon arriving at our camp?</span></p><p dir="ltr">With everyone's libidos back in check, the studio soon moved onto bigger patches and before long, the very nature of Baldur's Gate 3 was constantly in flux. It seemed like anytime I came close to finally picking it up and playing (whether it was on console or my increasingly dysfunctional laptop), I was consistently counseled to wait. "Minthara will be easier to recruit after Patch X." Okay. "Your Durge playthrough will feel better once Larian patches in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-adds-even-more-evil-endings/1100-6522767/">new evil endings</a>." Sure, why not? "I refuse to play until I can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-celebrates-100-million-mod-downloads-with-withers-big-naturals-mod/1100-6528842/">mod big naturals onto Withers</a>?" Alright man, whatever you say.</p><p dir="ltr">For a while, there were weeks where I heard word of some new bit of cut content (cutscenes and dialogue) that was being restored to the game, retroactively altering the text I thought was immutable. Patch 6 made the game steamier by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-brings-passionate-kisses-and-campfire-activities/1100-6521156/">altering and expanding on romantic scenes</a> and Patch 7 introduced more endings for players who completed evil playthroughs. In an almost Mass Effect 3-like move, Patch 5 actually just shipped a whole new epilogue that had never been in the game to provide more payoff for fans disgruntled by one of the game's abrupt endings, of which there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-ending-has-17000-variations/1100-6516062/">thousands of permutations</a>. In the interest of being economical about my dwindling time, and coincidentally getting the most out of the game, it seemed impossible to jump into Baldur's Gate 3 anytime but now.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite being billed as the definitive RPG for experiencing D&amp;D 5e mechanics, the simple fact is that Baldur's Gate 3, which has contorted in several different ways since its August 2023 release (and indeed its early-access launch back in 2020), hasn't really felt definitive until just now. At some point along the way, I became wholly convinced that, like other games with a tremendously outsized impact, Baldur's Gate 3 might never stop. That its post-launch-support-turned-live-servicification would unendingly toil until the game was indistinguishable from its former self. After all, as a masochistic enjoyer of many a live-service title, I've seen games I love cannibalize themselves via similar processes.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortunately the same doesn't seem to be occurring to Baldur's Gate 3. With its final patch out now, the story is done. All the edits are in and it is now largely ours to do with what we will. There is a part of me undoubtedly sad that I missed out on Baldur's Gate 3's super-horny era. There is even some nagging voice deeper down that's a little regretful I didn't get to be in on the ground floor and watch this obviously beloved thing continuously morph before achieving its final, momentous shape. But there is a greater part of me just glad that it's no longer something to keep up with and continually put off for a later and better time. Now if you don't mind, I've got a long-delayed date with Shadowheart in my near-future.</p>

            <p>Sony is bringing back those nostalgia-laced classic PlayStation console backgrounds for PS5 this week.</p>
<p>If you cast your mind back to December, you will recall Sony rolling out a console update for the PS5 which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-playstation-30th-anniversary-ps5-update-turns-your-console-retro-for-a-limited-time">added a range of custom sounds and startup options to make the console experience more akin to the likes of PlayStation consoles of times gone by</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, for a brief period during the festive season we could jazz up our PS5 to look like (at least, on the screen) the original PlayStation, or even a PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, or PlayStation 4 if we so fancied.</p>

<p>Now, this was meant to be a limited-time thing for PS5 users, released to celebrate PlayStation's 30th anniversary.</p>
<p>But, good news nostalgia-lovers! Due to an "overwhelmingly positive response from our community", those four console customisation options are making a return, allowing users to switch up their PS5 home screen once again. Hurrah!</p>
<p>Thanks to an upcoming system update, those who want to do just that will soon be able to head to the PS5's Settings menu, and select Appearance. From there, they will be able to select which background era they fancy, and Bob's your uncle.</p>

<p>As well as this welcome bit of news, this PS5 system update will also boast a new feature called Audio Focus, which aims to increase "immersion by providing presets to amplify soft sounds to meet your hearing preferences, ensuring a clearer audio experience when using headphones or headsets".</p>
<p>Sony says this feature will support "broader accessibility in audio experiences" for PS5 users, with a range of preset options available to choose from. These will make it easier for users to distinguish sounds like in-game character dialogue, subtle sound effects and more.</p>
<p>As laid out by Sony,  PS5 users will be able to choose from the following four preset focus type options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Boost Low Pitch:</strong> Amplify low-frequency sounds like roaring engines and rumbling noises.</li>
<li><strong>Boost Voices:</strong> Amplify voice chats, character voices, and other middle-frequency sounds.</li>
<li><strong>Boost High Pitch:</strong> Amplify high-frequency sounds like footsteps and metallic noises.</li>
<li><strong>Boost Quiet Sounds:</strong> Amplify low-volume sounds in a wide range of frequencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sony said this PS5 system update will roll out globally in a phased approach. It will all begin tomorrow, 24th April.</p>
<p>Further <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/23/new-ps5-system-software-update-features-audio-focus-and-the-return-of-the-classic-console-ui-customizations/">details can be found via the PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>

The Fendts did confirm that the brick-and-mortar store of Boardlandia in Appleton, Wisconsin, is not part of this closure.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Please know that this outcome is not what we ever envisioned. We are not walking away from a thriving venture.</p>

<p>This closure is a direct result of circumstances that have become beyond our control, and it carries significant personal financial consequences for us as well.</p>

<p>We understand that you, our valued customers, may have questions and even concerns during this time.</p>

<p>We want to assure you that this was not a decision taken lightly or with any intention other than to responsibly address the financial realities we now face.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Fendts confirmed that they are committed to shipping out any unfulfilled orders for which they have stock. They did not say how they will approach refunds for pre-orders or items that are out-of-stock.</p>

<p>The Boardlandia online store closure is yet another extension of the volatile actions by the Trump Administration in the past two months. Due to the vast majority of board game accessories and products are produced overseas in China, a 145% increase in important cost has severely impacted multiple tableop developers and publishers like Sentinels of the Multiverse developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/greater-than-games-shuts-down-in-response-to-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Greater Than Games</a>.</p>

<p>It is an act so devastating Stonemaier Games is <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/stonemaier-games-suing-us-president-over-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">filing a lawsuit</a> against the administration over its use of trade tariffs.</p>

After all, plenty of people play the Switch in docked mode or in handheld mode within range of their home Wi-Fi. </p><p>Regardless of whether Fergusson’s explanation holds any water, it certainly sounds like Blizzard doesn’t currently have any plans to bring <em>Diablo IV</em> to the Switch 2, at least in the console’s first year. That flies in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaafRJpzNqY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaafRJpzNqY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">face of previous rumors</a></span> that the company had a port in development. Analysts had expected a lot of Microsoft first-party support for the Switch 2 at launch, but so far the company hasn’t announced anything despite its recent multiplatform pivot. </p><p>It’s a shame in the case of <em>Diablo IV</em> specifically, given how perfectly suited the action-RPG is to PC gaming handhelds like the Steam Deck and the Rog Ally.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-shows-remakes-could-be-key-to-bethesda-getting-back-on-track<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">By Azura, by Azura, by Azura – the rumors were true. Yesterday, Bethesda set the internet on fire by finally pulling back the curtain on Virtuos’ remaster (or is it really a remake?) of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-finally-revealed-in-first-look-gameplay-and-its-out-today">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a>. An ‘Elder Scrolls Direct’ of sorts culminated in the surprise shadow-drop, which near-immediately transformed into hundreds of thousands of concurrent players. This moment of global hype and celebration feels like a much-needed port in the current storm Bethesda Game Studios has been facing in recent years. From conducting years-long damage control to rectify Fallout 76’s misfire launch, to the lackluster reception of its new sci-fi universe, Starfield, the studio’s most recent output has had many fans asking the same question: Has Bethesda lost the magic? There’s fiercer competition in the RPG space these days, with Larian Studios’ Baldur’s Gate 3 and Obsidian’s The Outer Worlds franchise both garnering critical acclaim as Elder Scrolls and Fallout spiritual successors. But while Elder Scrolls 6 and Fallout 5 may be years away from reclaiming their crowns, this re-release of Oblivion may be a step in the right direction – just not in the direction you’d expect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At its peak, Bethesda Game Studios was an RPG juggernaut. In 2020, Microsoft’s <a href="https://gamingbolt.com/fallout-4-has-shipped-25-million-units-as-of-2020-as-per-leaked-microsoft-documents" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leaked FTC documents</a> revealed that Fallout 4 had sold 25 million units-to-date. The game shifted over 5 million units in its first week alone according to <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/article/262199/fallout-4-sells-an-estimated-519m-first-week-at-retail/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VGChartz</a>. Likewise, in 2023 Todd Howard announced Skyrim had crossed <a href="https://in.ign.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/186698/news/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-has-sold-over-60-million-copies-globally" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">60 million sales</a> (though it’s worth noting rereleasing it 50 times likely helped). So what about Starfield? Estimates put it at just over <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/guides/starfield-how-many-copies-sold/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three million units</a> a year-and-a-half post launch. While taking into account Game Pass subscribers (which would boost players if not sales) and Starfield’s lack of a PlayStation presence, this must still be something of a disappointment for Bethesda. And while there <em>is</em> a Starfield fanbase, it’s far smaller than that enjoyed by The Elder Scrolls or Fallout, and even it has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-design-director-addresses-fan-concern-as-starfield-dlc-shattered-space-plunges-to-mostly-negative-steam-review-rating">voiced displeasure</a> with the game’s first expansion, Shattered Space. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This all leaves the developer with a big problem. With The Elder Scrolls 6 <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-out-of-pre-production-but-pete-hines-says-it-will-be-years-before-we-start-hearing-about-it/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“years away”</a> and Fallout 5 just a whisper in the hallowed halls of the studio’s corridors, how can this once-iconic RPG developer enchant their fanbase once more? The answer lies in its past.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rumours of the Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remaster began back in September 2023, when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document">leaked Microsoft documents</a> revealed a number of unannounced Bethesda titles, including a remaster of 2006’s landmark trip to Tamriel (it also includes another interesting remaster –  we’ll get to that soon). All was quiet until January 2025, when a former employee of Virtuos <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake-details-reportedly-leak-online">let slip more details</a>, dividing Elder Scrolls fans as to their authenticity like the Stormcloaks vs. the Imperials. Finally, last week the dam broke (albeit early), setting the internet ablaze – there were over 6.4 million Google searches for ‘The Elder Scrolls VI: Oblivion’, rising by 713% in the last week alone. At its peak, Bethesda’s reveal livestream had over half a million viewers watching. Despite the leaks (or perhaps because of them), <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5y42wvjrd3o" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 600,000 people</a> tuned in to see a 19-year-old game re-revealed to them. The intense fervent demand to play the remaster caused discount game key websites like <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/the-oblivion-remaster-is-already-discounted-but-its-so-popular-its-crashing-deal-websites" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CDKeys to crash</a>, and slowed Fanatical and Green Man Gaming to a crawl. As of yesterday, Steam’s concurrent players stood at 125,000 and the game is firmly the #1 best seller. The enthusiasm Bethesda fans have for Oblivion burns as bright as the flames that spill from the Oblivion gates themselves.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>How can this once-iconic RPG developer enchant their fanbase once more? The answer lies in its past.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The message from players is clear: if you (re)build it, they will come. What better way to keep fans engaged and invested during these long development periods than to invite them to take a trip back to the mysterious isles of Morrowind or the hollowed-out husk of the East Coast? From a commercial standpoint, it makes clear sense. While Bethesda’s main development staff toils away on long-gestating new projects, trusted partners like Virtuos can use historic blueprints to craft remasters in shorter time frames. Such remasters are based on games with built-in audiences, and for many they’re the first real RPGs gamers will have sunk their teeth into during their respective generations. Restoring these works also invites a whole new generation to become obsessed with the inner workings of the land of Tamriel or crawl out from the post-apocalyptic fallout into Las Vegas and D.C. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda has already strategically uplifted its own catalogue once before. Fallout 4 was discounted by up to 75% during the Fallout TV show’s first season on Prime Video, alongside a cleverly scheduled next-gen update which brought over certain homages from the show. As a result, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-4-sales-top-ten-europe">Fallout 4 sales jumped over 7,500% in Europe</a> alone despite being nearly a decade old.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/22/oblivion-1745334385008.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Oblivion Remastered offers a visit to the past that looks like the future. Image credit: Bethesda / Virtuos</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking back to Microsoft’s leaked Bethesda roadmap, many noted that a Fallout 3 remaster was listed to follow Oblivion two years later. It’s important to note the timelines from this original presentation have shifted – Oblivion was originally cited as fiscal year 2022. However, assuming these original gaps remain true, it appears a Fallout 3 remake could be on the cards for 2026 – just in time for Fallout Season 2, coincidentally. While a Fallout remaster seems inevitable now, given the second series’ shift to New Vegas, could it be possible that Bethesda’s early conversations with showrunners Graham Wagner and Geneva Robertson-Dworet mean that a surprise New Vegas remake could be in store? Given the synchronicity of the show’s first season to Fallout 4’s vibe and aesthetic, could Bethesda level-up its craftiness even more for the upcoming New Vegas-centric second season? It shadow-dropped Oblivion – it’s not out of the realm of possibility that a New Vegas Remastered trailer is lying in wait for us at the end of Fallout Season 2’s finale.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The message from players is clear: if you (re)build it, they will come. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">However, if there’s one game in Bethesda’s back catalogue that deserves to be remade the most, it’s undeniably The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. Many Elder Scrolls fans have spent years fus-ro-dahing on the mountaintop for this, with one group of superfans going as far as to <a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/news/the-elder-scrolls-morrowind-remake-074606-20240502" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remake Morrowind using Skyrim’s tools</a>, ala Skyblivion. However, Morrowind is not as easy a game to remake as Oblivion. It sits on the precipice between Bethesda’s evolutions as a studio – it is literally built differently to our modern understanding of an Elder Scrolls game. It’s only partially voiced, most of the story is told through text, there are no quest markers (players must literally write down directions given by NPCs, save for those with perfect memories), and combat physics are non-existent. Whereas Virtuos was able to overhaul some of the more finicky systems of Oblivion, the entirety of Morrowind <em>is</em> a finicky system. It’s why many love the game, but it’s also why it’s difficult to remake. To remake Morrowind is a dangerous tightrope. Modernize it too much and you risk losing the magic it was originally imbued with. Leave too many antiquated systems in place, and it’ll feel worse than an almighty skooma hangover.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When a studio becomes the icon of a gaming sub-genre, the challenge is this: how do you innovate and evolve whilst holding onto your audience? Rockstar Games has kept Grand Theft Auto players satisfied for over a decade through the ever-expanding multiplayer world of GTA Online, which in turn fuels the eye-wateringly expensive rumored budget for GTA 6. Bethesda’s bread-and-butter is richly detailed, expansive worlds that are resolutely single-player – Elder Scrolls Online and Fallout 76 just don’t hit in the same way. However, what’s clear through the overwhelming response to Virtuos’ Oblivion remaster is that gamers are more than on-board to dive back into the historic annals of Elder Scrolls of years-gone-by. That’s not to say any remaster is a slam dunk – this particular one is a clear product of careful consideration and skilled development, and a lesser game may have garnered a very different response, ala Rockstar’s own <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-review">GTA Definitive Editions</a> – but what better way for the former king of the modern RPG to get back on track than to breathe new life into some old classics?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Sab Astley is a freelance writer who has written for IGN, Polygon, TotalFilm, Rolling Stone, Radio Times, and Metro UK.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s GameCube controller has been the subject of some confusion since its announcement, regarding whether it would be usable with non-GameCube games on Switch 2 or not.
</p>
<p>
Officially, it has been designed for use with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-gamecube-games-coming-to-switch-2-via-switch-online-along-with-purchasable-gamecube-inspired-controller">Nintendo GameCube - Nintendo Classics collection that will be available to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscribers</a> when the console launches.
</p>
<p>
But could you use a Switch 2 GameCube controller to play <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, for example? Well, Nintendo has now provided some additional detail here - and the answer to that question is... maybe?

"The Nintendo GameCube controller is designed for use with the Nintendo GameCube – Nintendo Classics collection of games and is an optional way to play those games," a Nintendo spokesperson stated to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/switch-2-gamecube-controller-compatible-with-other-games-but-there-may-be-some-issues">Nintendo Life</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"Since it doesn't have all the buttons and features found in other controllers that can be used with the Nintendo Switch 2 system, there may be some issues when playing other games," Nintendo continued. "The Nintendo GameCube controller can only be used on Nintendo Switch 2 and is not compatible with Nintendo Switch."
</p>
<p>
So, by the nature of confirming the Switch 2 GameCube controller may have issues with non-GameCube <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-nintendo-switch-2-launch-games">Switch 2 games</a>, Nintendo is suggesting you can use it for other titles - at your peril. 
</p>
<p>
Hopefully, with a bit of button remapping, Mario Kart World play will be possible.
</p>
<p>
And helpfully, just as Nintendo answers this question, it has <a href="https://store.nintendo.co.uk/en/nintendo-gamecube-gcn-controller-nintendo-classics-000000000010015326">placed the Nintendo GameCube controller up for sale in the UK on the official My Nintendo Store</a>. Fancy one? It costs £59.
</p>
<p>
At launch, Nintendo GameCube - Nintendo Classics will include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-wind-waker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a> (the original version, so no speedy sailing!), <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/f-zero-gx">F-Zero GX</a> and SoulCalibur 2. 
</p>
<p>
Down the line, other upcoming games will include Super Mario Sunshine, Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness, Mario Smash Football, Luigi's Mansion and Chibi-Robo!
</p>
<p>
Skies of Arcadia: Legends, when?
</p>
<p>"Some of these have become quite rare to find in physical form, so it's great to see them become more widely accessible," Digital Foundry's Tom Morgan wrote in his recent look <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-gamecube-emulation-is-finally-coming-to-switch-2">behind the scenes at how Nintendo is emulating the games</a>, "even if we still wonder if perhaps all of this could have been achievable years ago on the original Switch".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
