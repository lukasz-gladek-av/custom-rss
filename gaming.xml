            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>launched almost a year ago, and since it released, players have been complaining about poor PC performance despite having machines more than capable (theoretically, at least) of handling things. Now, we might know why.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1qcy3hn/mh_wilds_bad_performance_mystery_solved/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">lengthy post</a> on Reddit, user de_Tylmarande outlines an experimental process by which they attempted to glean the reason behind <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' PC performance, which Capcom has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-winter" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="69cb0344-d686-4265-ba86-2163d899fb4c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">acknowledged and pledged to fix</a> (the performance, not the post).</p><p>To boil the post down, de_Tylmarande essentially noticed that when playing <em>Wilds </em>on their friend's Steam account, which owns all of the available DLC, the frame rate was stable and there were no drops. On their own account, however, de_Tylmarande experienced frequent drops.</p><figure role="group">

  </article>

<figcaption>The cause of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' poor PC performance may have been solved.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This naturally led the user to conclude that <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' frame drops and PC problems are down to what they call "an insanely crooked and aggressive DLC ownership check function".</p><p>In order to prove their theory, de_Tylmarande created a sort of mod that essentially fools <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>into thinking the player owns all of its associated DLC. The mod doesn't actually unlock any of that DLC; instead, it just tricks the game into passing the check.</p><p>According to de_Tylmarande, once that mod was in place, "performance went through the roof". They stress that they don't recommend trying this solution and don't promote "using mods of this type" in <em>Wilds</em>, but that they did so in order to prove a point.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1qcy3hn/comment/nzlrkxg/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">response</a>, a user suggests that this issue might be an example of "good enough for now" code being left in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, then never being fixed, leading to unpredictable problems later down the line. It's entirely possible.</p>
<p>In any case, unless you're looking to create a mod like de_Tylmarande's yourself (which they don't suggest), it's unlikely you'll be able to solve this problem for yourself. Still, it's an interesting thing to ponder.</p><p>The poor PC performance players have reported didn't stop <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a0bfff7f-18bd-4b40-b07b-fe8c94d70a1a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">selling like hot cakes</a> in its initial <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3047bd12-37c9-4b65-bd39-064968be79fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">launch window</a>, although sales have since slowed, with Capcom blaming that slowdown not on the PC version, but <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-barrier-capcom" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a0c5ff11-5fb9-4929-804b-8a8d4f7adae0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the PS5 release</a>.</p><p>You can check out <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and you can read our very own Tyler's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4b7be4a2-09a5-4299-a13c-a7bff937e081" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">review of the game here</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <title><![CDATA[Here’s Sophie Turner As Lara Croft For The New Tomb Raider Show]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/sophie-turner-lara-croft-tomb-raider-2000660139</link>
            <guid>1406920</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sophie Turner, best known for her roles as Sansa Stark in <em>Game of Thrones</em> and Jean Grey in<em> X-Men: Dark Phoenix</em>, is the new Lara Croft for the streaming <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-lara-croft-amazon-sophie-turner-2000623124">adaptation of <em>Tomb Raider</em></a>. Amazon MGM Studios revealed a first look at the actor in costume and, yup, I think she nailed it.</p> <p>Does that mean the show itself will be any good? Who knows. But it should help limit any skepticism about whether Turner is cut out to take over the English archeologist who moonlights as a puzzle-solving treasure hunter. The role was previously played by Angelina Jolie in the early 2000s and later by Alicia Vikander in the 2018 reboot. Here’s the first photo of Turner in costume, which essentially recreates Croft’s look from the 1996 game beat-for-beat:</p>   <p>The show has already started filming but we still don’t know what the live-action adaptation, helmed by <em>Fleabag</em>‘s Phoebe Waller-Bridge, will entail. Jason Isaacs will play Croft’s Uncle, Atlas DeMornay, while Martin Bobb-Semple plays Croft’s side-kick, Zip. Bill Paterson, meanwhile, will play her butler. Celina Imrie is also onboard as a museum curator while Sigourney Weaver plays someone “keen to exploit Lara’s talents,” according to Amazon.</p>

 <p>There’s no release date for the show yet, but given the production schedule I wouldn’t be surprised to see it pop up sometime in 2027. It follows Amazon’s success in spinning another hit game franchise, <em>Fallout</em>, into a streaming hit, and is part of Hollywood’s broader goldrush to exploit gaming IP instead of creating new ideas. It couldn’t be coming at a better time for the franchise, though.</p>

 <p>A reboot of the 1996 game called <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-our-first-look-at-tomb-raiders-new-lara-croft-2000652781"><em>Tomb Raider Atlantis</em></a> will launch later this year, followed by the next sequel sometime in the years ahead. That game has been in production for a while. The last new entry was <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> back in 2018.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-offloads-mini-5-pro-drone-bundles-now-at-a-record-low-with-rc2-controller-and-three-batteries-2000659926</link>
            <guid>1406917</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve been thinking about adding aerial shots to your creative toolkit, the DJI Mini 5 Pro Fly More Combo makes a compelling case for taking the leap. Designed to balance performance with portability and ease of use, this drone <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6316/">bundle is currently available for $1,099 (down from $1,599) which is a sizable 31% reduction from its usual price</a>. That discount alone makes it eye-catching, but the real value lies in how complete the package is for anyone eager to start flying immediately.</p>
<p>Inside the box, you’ll find multiple intelligent flight batteries, a dedicated RC2 controller, a charging hub, and a travel-friendly carrying bag. Whether you’re heading out for a weekend hike or planning a more deliberate filming session, everything you need comes along without added hassle.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6316/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Drone for Every Skill Level</h2>
<p>The DJI Mini 5 Pro’s capability comes from its compact, lightweight body. It’s small enough to toss into a backpack, yet powerful enough to record sharp 4K HDR video at up to 60 frames per second. The camera’s Dual Native ISO helps maintain image quality across a wide range of lighting situations, so footage stays clean and detailed whether you’re filming under bright midday sun or chasing golden-hour shots.</p>
<p>Performance in the air is equally impressive. A long-range video transmission system delivers a smooth HD feed over great distances, while strong wind resistance and a 3-axis mechanical gimbal help ensure stable, shake-free footage. Even when conditions aren’t perfect, the drone remains reliable and controlled.</p>



<p>The included DJI RC2 controller adds to the seamless experience: Its <strong>built-in 5.5-inch HD screen</strong> provides a clear, responsive view of your live feed, removing the need to rely on a smartphone. This makes flying more intuitive and lets you focus on framing the perfect shot rather than juggling devices.</p>
<p>Content creators will also appreciate the drone’s flexibility when it comes to framing. With support for both landscape and vertical shooting, it’s easy to tailor footage for different platforms. From cinematic YouTube videos to vertical clips optimized for Instagram Reels or TikTok, the DJI Mini 5 Pro drone can adapt to how and where you want to share your work.</p>
<p>Extended flight time is another major advantage. With three batteries included, you can spend hours in the air across multiple flights, rather than cutting sessions short. When it’s time to recharge, the two-way charging hub keeps downtime to a minimum.</p>
<p>Add in generous internal storage and fast wireless transfers to your phone, and the DJI Mini 5 Pro Fly More Combo becomes an all-in-one solution for aerial photography. At its current discounted price, it’s a smart investment for beginners and a capable upgrade for experienced pilots.</p>

<p>Prime Video has uncovered our first look at Sophie Turner as Lara Croft, ready and in costume for the upcoming live-action adaptation, the first since 2018’s reboot starring Alicia Vikander.</p>



<p>Fan feedback has been mixed so far, with the Tomb Raider community divided on whether they approve of the casting or not. The team at Prime Video has opted for a classic reimagination of the traditional Lara Croft from the original games, but not everyone is happy.</p>







<h2 id="h-sophie-turner-s-lara-croft-is-dividing-fans">Sophie Turner’s Lara Croft is Dividing Fans</h2>



<p>It was just a few days ago that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazons-tomb-raider-announces-multiple-castings/">Prime Video uncovered</a> an array of castings for the upcoming live-action Tomb Raider <strong>series</strong>. It has been several months since Sophie Turner was confirmed as playing the iconic lead, but others have since moved into the frame, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Sigourney Weaver</li>



<li>Jason Isaacs</li>



<li>Martin Bobb-Semple</li>



<li>Jack Bannon</li>



<li>John Heffernan</li>



<li>Bill Paterson</li>



<li>Paterson Joseph</li>



<li>Sasha Luss</li>



<li>Juliette Motamed</li>



<li>Celia Imrie</li>



<li>August Wittgenstein</li>
</ul>



<p>The more recognizable characters among the roster are the likes of Zip, Atlas, and Winston, all of whom have previously appeared in the decades-old series.</p>



<p>Sophie Turner, who will assume the role of Lara Croft, recently underwent a wardrobe test, appearing in a shot posted on social media earlier today by Prime Video. While the outfit is very much on point, fans aren’t entirely sure if she fits the <strong>look</strong>. In recent months, Turner revealed a physical regime designed to get her in shape to play the adventurous archeologist, but that’s not enough for some.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In the comments under the post, one user wrote, ‘It’s difficult seeing anyone in this role besides Angelina Jolie.’ Another wrote, ‘I don’t see Lara anywhere. Sorry.’</p>



<p>The feedback is mixed but leaning in favor of the general acceptance of Turner’s portrayal.</p>

<p>Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag is many fans’ favorite in the series. The seamless blend of traditional AC gameplay and movement was woven beautifully with pillaging and pirate pilates. There have been endless talks about an Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake for an eternity, so here’s the latest on the rumored title.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flags-steam-page-adds-new-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag</a> is a special game, and anyone who’s played it can sense this very quickly. You could argue that no other game has perfectly captured the feeling of being an exploring and exterminating pirate assassin. Nostalgia is kicking in even while writing about this—might need a lie down and a pint of grog to comfort the soul.</p>



<p>Before that, here’s a look at Black Flag Remake rumors and leaks.</p>

<p><strong>Insider Gaming can confirm that an Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake is happening, and you can start preparing yourself for its inevitable launch.</strong></p>



<p>If you haven’t been following Insider Gaming’s coverage, you have missed out on a wild adventure so far. The first confirmation that an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake was in development</a> started in January 2024. A Tom Henderson exclusive then pulled back the curtain on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-further-details-on-the-assassins-creed-roadmap-and-what-games-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Roadmap, and what games to expect</a> over the next few years.</p>



<p>It revealed that the Black Flag Remake was happening. These suspicions grew stronger after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft reuploaded Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Soundtracks</a> in January 2026, </p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-assassin-s-creed-black-flag-remake-coming-out">When Is Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake Coming Out?</h2>



<p><strong>Insider Gaming exclusively confirmed that the Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake is coming out before March 31, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>Given that it’s January 2026, you should start getting excited, if you aren’t already! The exclusive story said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake is set to launch before March 31</a>.</p>



<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/33qBiRpCj1Z9Ib5bbfbg5r/d4ab539ca9edd1fa28ebc0aec5b1af27/Ubisoft_H1_FY26_Slideshow_vFinal.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft H1 FY26 EARNINGS</a> from November 21, 2025, mentioned several games for 2026, with one game listed as an “Unannounced Title.” This is expected to be the Black Flag Remake.</p>



<p>There’s still no exact launch date, but it’s getting closer than a pirate is to water after reaching the end of the plank.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-assassin-s-creed-black-flag-resynced">What Is Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced?</h2>



<p><strong>Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced is reportedly the new title for the Black Flag Remake.</strong></p>



<p>Everyone has been referring to a reimagining of the fourth mainline game as the ‘Black Flag Remake’ for a while. Ubisoft has seemingly mooted this with the appearance of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-appears/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Resynced on the PEGI Ratings site</a>.</p>



<p>As long as it keeps ‘Assassin’s Creed Black Flag’ in the name, it could add ‘Reimagined Pirate Paradise’ on the end, and everyone would still buy it!</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-black-flag-remake-rumors-amp-leaks">Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake Rumors &amp; Leaks</h2>



<p><strong>Some of the biggest Black Flag leaks and rumors include suggestions that the game will be more RPG-Heavy than its original incarnation.</strong></p>



<p>Surprisingly, we haven’t heard too many inner details about the actual gameplay, more its release window. Leaks have indicated that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-new-details-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Remake is more RPG-Heavy</a>: “Similar to Origins and Shadows.”</p>



<p>Resynced will allegedly also get rid of the modern-day aspects that many dislike about Assassin’s Creed.</p>

                <p>This year marks the 15th anniversary of Re-Logic's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/terraria/" data-ref-id="5000-105503">Terraria</a>, and the developer is still making new content for the game after all of this time. For months, Re-Logic has teased the release of the next update, Terraria 1.4.5. Now, the release date is set for later this month.</p><p>On <a href="https://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/terraria-1-4-5-the-launch-date-revealed-at-last.145833/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the official site</a> for Terraria, Re-Logic announced that Terraria 1.4.5 will launch on January 27. The studio noted that the latest delay was caused because it needed to, "resubmit a few things, which pushed us back a bit further than expected."</p><p>Re-Logic hasn't shared a full list of the new features or improvements coming with the latest update, but it has teased a few during the game's monthly news updates. As an example, villagers will no longer need a house in order to show up in the game. However, they will ask the player to build them a house if there isn't one already.</p><p>One of the most intriguing additions to Terraria 1.4.5 is the RC Car, which was inspired by the Kwad Racer Drone. With the car, players can race around Terraria worlds and climb up backwalls. The racetracks will be customizable, and Re-Logic has invited players to "share them with us when the time comes."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4635633-terraria.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4635633" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4635633-terraria.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4635633"></a><figcaption>Promo art for Terraria.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1837/18375603/4635633-terraria.jpg"></figure><p>Last summer, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/terraria-is-invades-palworld-later-this-month/1100-6532584/" data-ref-id="1100-6532584">a collaboration with Palworld</a> brought Terraria content into that game. Terraria 1.4.5 will return the favor by adding Palworld content to Terraria. The only confirmed Pal at the moment is Digtoise, who can help players when mining. However, there will be other Pals coming.</p><p>Re-Logic has also noted that nearly 900 bugs will be fixed with Terraria 1.4.5, as well as the "countless little things ... that go into each update." More details will follow later this month when the update arrives on January 27.</p>

            <p>Amazon has released the first official image of Sophie Turner as Lara Croft, ahead of the release of its Tomb Raider TV series.</p>
<p>The wardrobe check image, which you can see yourself below, shows Turner in an outfit very reminiscent of classic <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider games</a>. She's got the pistols, the shorts, everything you'd expect from a (hopefully) faithful adaptation of the video game series.</p>

<p>Set to release on Amazon Prime, the show hasn't got an official release date as of writing. We do, however, know about various casting decisions for the show ahead of a proper trailer release. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-traitors-celia-imrie-and-more-announced-for-amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-series">Celia Imrie, Jason Isaacs, Sagourney Weaver and more have been confirmed for various roles</a> alongside the Game of Thrones star.</p><p>We also know that the show will inter-connect with the narrative present in the Tomb Raider games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-live-action-tomb-raider-adaptation-will-reinvent-the-franchise-and-interconnect-with-the-games">rather than being a standalone project or a continuation of the Angelina Jolie movies</a>. This tidbit comes from Story Kitchen, a production company working on the series.</p>

            <p>Are you excited for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> and Xbox Series X/S? If you haven't already tried out the demo to see how it'll run on both platforms, then a new update from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> might get you even more hyped for the adventures of Cloud and co. on non-PlayStation and PC platforms. The publisher has announced that next Thursday, 22nd January, 2026, a patch for the PS5 and PC versions will launch that will update existing versions of the game will all the bells and whistles coming to the new platform versions of the game. Per <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii/status/2011740264772305213">a tweet</a> from the company, this new patch introduces "Streamlined Progression, including the ability to keep HP and MP topped up", and the option to "always hit for 9,999 damage". Boosters include the option to toggle HP full, MP full, Limit gauge full, and maximum damage dealt - all of which can be turned on and off individually or as a set.</p>
<p>If you wanted to blast through the story again to enjoy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-final-fantasy-7-interview-part-3-hamaguchi">all the differences</a> from the original game before the launch of Part 3 (which, I imagine, we'll get <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-story-completed-producer-very-satisfied-as-development-continues-without-delay">an update about</a> sooner rather than later), this will make a replay pretty effortless. It remains to be seen whether these 'boosters' (as similar mechanics are called in older remasters in the Final Fantasy canon) will affect trophy unlocks on the PS5 version - if they don't, well, it'll make Platinum clean-ups easier for those of us that care about that kind of thing.</p>
<p>"I feel that the way people enjoy content has become more flexible these days, as we see with video streaming platforms, and that people also want the same thing from games, with options to tailor the experience based on the time they have and their levels of interest," said director Naoki Hamaguchi in a previous message about these updates. "I have also had personal experiences where I wanted to play something with the limited time I have but gave up because of the time it takes to level up characters or traverse the game.</p>
<p>"That’s exactly why I think that the Streamlined Progression feature is very effective - to give players smooth access to the story."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remakes-progression-helping-boosts-arent-exclusive-to-switch-2-and-xbox-will-also-arrive-via-patch-for-ps5-and-pc">We already knew</a> that this update was coming to the PS5/PC versions of the game, we just didn't know when. It's nice that Square Enix is ensuring parity with the new versions of the title, and not just leaving pre-existing customers to linger in anticipation as Switch and Xbox users get all the fun new bells and whistles.</p><p>Square Enix has confirmed the whole trilogy will be coming to Xbox and Switch 2, as well as PlayStation 5 and PC. So if you wanted to start your journey into Midgar with a bang, the publisher has you covered. Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> has hinted that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-producer-hints-at-possible-switch-2-version">the latest title in the series may also be headed to Switch2</a> soon.</p>

<p>Marching our way next week</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We are just one week away from the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> on Switch 2, and Koei Tecmo has blessed us with an all-new gameplay trailer, giving a thorough rundown of how things look on the hybrid console.</p>
<p>The above three-minute overview is only available in Japanese at the time of writing (we will sub in an English version when it crops up), but it's the gameplay that we're really interested in here, and there's a boatload of it.</p>
<p>Koei Tecmo previously announced that Origins will <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/dynasty-warriors-origins-will-run-at-a-fixed-30fps-on-switch-2">run at a "fixed 30fps</a> on Switch 2 to prioritise a stable experience with the desired 1,000+ characters on screen, and the above trailer showcases exactly that. That's not to knock it, mind you. The battles look suitably epic, with a whole host of different fighting styles to choose from and a decent amount of variety in the opponents, it seems.</p>
<p>The trailer also gives us a peek at each character's skill tree, unlockable moves and weapon options, so expect a lot of the series' signature customisation to be on display right from the jump.</p>
<p>Origins arrives on Switch 2 on <strong>22nd January</strong>, the very same day that the 'Visions of the Four Heroes' DLC drops its new weapons and story arcs. Gosh, what a busy start to 2026!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/fallout-ron-perlman-s3-intro-sandwhich-war-2000660136</link>
            <guid>1406872</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Ron Perlman has been in every<a href="https://kotaku.com/how-a-dark-time-traveling-fantasy-game-became-the-origi-1845870322"><em> Fallout</em> game</a> but he’s never played them. He seems to barely even remember narrating the now iconic line “War. War never changes,” when the first game launched back in 1997. He says he was paid basically nothing and never bothered to find out what the game, which would spawn one of the biggest franchises, was about.</p> <p>“I’m not a gamer,” Perlman said in a recent <a href="https://youtu.be/m5iSCL4o61w?si=nYsivF6kTSkD4y34" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cy="styled-link">Joe Vulpis Podcast</a> interview (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/ron-perlman-says-he-did-the-fallout-intro-for-usd40-and-a-sandwich-hes-never-played-it-and-hes-not-interested-in-trying-the-whole-fallout-thing-is-a-mystery-to-me/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a>). “I wouldn’t know how to put a game—I wouldn’t know which game goes into which piece of hardware. I’ve never played any of the games. The whole <em>Fallout</em> thing is a mystery to me.”</p>

 <p>The Hellboy actor has had character roles in some of the games but is most known for narrating the openings in which he outlines the geopolitical rivalries that precipitated a mass nuclear war. “In 2077, the storm of world war had come again,” he says at the beginning of <em>Fallout 1</em>. “In two brief hours, most of the planet was reduced to cinders. And from the ashes of nuclear devastation, a new civilization would struggle to arise.”</p>

 <p>While the lines have stuck in fans’ heads for years, Perlman doesn’t appear to have ever given them a second thought. “They invited me to do the very first Fallout back in the ’90s, I think,” he said on the podcast. “They gave me $40 and a sandwich. And a year and a half later, I get a call. ‘Hey, you remember Fallout?’ ‘No.'”</p>

 <p><em>Fallout</em> is now not just one of the biggest game series around but also one of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-series-season-two-reviews-prime-video-2000653876">most popular TV shows on streaming</a> thanks to the Amazon Prime adaptation. “I didn’t see that coming,” Perlman notes. He hasn’t appeared in the show yet, and there’s no indication that he will, but it would be pretty cool. Season 3 starts filming later this year so there’s plenty of time to make it happen.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-drops-prices-on-iconic-millennium-falcon-sets-now-one-of-the-cheapest-in-the-star-wars-line-2000659923</link>
            <guid>1406869</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="705">There’s a reason LEGO has remained relevant for generations. Few brands can appeal equally to children discovering creativity for the first time and adults rediscovering it decades later. Opening a LEGO box feels like an invitation to slow down: the soft rattle of pieces, the clean instruction book, and the promise that something meaningful will emerge from a pile of plastic bricks. Forget everything out there that’s causing you stress. Just sit down and <em>build</em>. Personally, I love to just pop on a podcast and let the time slip by as I put a set together, piece by piece.</p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="705">Few vehicles in film history carry the same instant recognition as the Millennium Falcon Star Wars set. The legendary ship that carried heroes across the galaxy and legendarily made the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs. Right now, that legend is more affordable than usual: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon set is currently discounted by 20%, dropping from $85 to $67</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="0" data-end="705">Built for Display</h2>
<p data-start="1407" data-end="1915">Unlike play-focused sets built for constant handling, this LEGO Millennium Falcon is designed primarily for display. Mounted on the included display stand at a subtle angle, it gives the impression of movement, as if it’s mid-turn in the vacuum of space. Its dimensions—just over five inches tall, about nine and a half inches long, and roughly seven and a half inches wide—make it ideal for a desk, bookshelf, or display cabinet. It commands attention without overwhelming the space.</p>


<p data-start="1917" data-end="2399">The set is made up of 921 pieces. LEGO captures the Millennium Falcon’s signature exterior while also sneaking in interior references fans will appreciate. Because of the scale, characters aren’t represented by traditional minifigures, but by abstract stacked elements that still convey the idea of the crew aboard. Small details, like the holographic dejarik chess table, serve as thoughtful callbacks that reward close inspection.</p>

            <guid>1406866</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new press release, the team at Jagex has confirmed that this year, which marks the 25th anniversary of <strong>RuneScape</strong>, will be the biggest yet in the game’s quarter-century on the market. It was promised that more investment and content development will be rolled out in 2026 than ever before, making for an ambitious roadmap for RuneScape fans everywhere.</p>



<p>The ‘RS25’ programme sets the stage for ‘the most ambitious evolution in RuneScape history.’ The pipeline includes the RuneFest event in the United Kingdom, an OSRS LAN event, better creator commitments, and a ‘reborn RuneScape.’</p>







<h2 id="h-runescape-is-evolving-more-than-ever-in-2026">RuneScape is Evolving More Than Ever in 2026</h2>



<p>RuneScape is turning 25 this year, and that’s not a milestone that many active games have ever managed to celebrate. As an MMORPG, RuneScape was part of the pioneering effort that eventually led to live-service games – titles that evolved over time and constantly provided fresh content and updates to players.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/runescape-membership-charge-tiers-online/">an entirely smooth journey</a> getting here, but the milestone year has finally arrived, and Jagex has a wealth of plans for 2026.</p>



<p>In October, RuneFest 2026 will be held in Birmingham, England, featuring live reveals, developer sessions, and ‘unforgettable community moments.’ RuneScape is taking to the stage in the US with the Deadman All-Stars Live production, and later in the year, a creator-backed LAN event will be held (location pending).</p>



<p>An all-new press release revealed what’s coming this year to the game ecosystem itself</p>



<blockquote>
<p>RuneScape will enter a new chapter with a comprehensive rejuvenation rooted in integrity, visual renewal, and a renewed focus on what makes the game special. Alongside a long-requested Player Avatar refresh and meaningful visual upgrades,&nbsp;and major improvements to player support,&nbsp;all designed to better serve the community at the heart of RuneScape.</p>



<p>This new era will also see the removal of RuneScape’s microtransaction system, Treasure Hunter, following the community vote in November 2025, marking a major step forward in player-first design and transparency.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jagex-shadow-drops-runescape-dragonwilds-in-early-access/">RuneScape: Dragonwilds</a> will also expand through 2026 after a successful launch last year.</p>



<p>Jagex was <strong>also </strong>promoting <a href="http://www.runescape.com/25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an exclusive merchandise line</a> produced to celebrate the substantial company milestone. As the year unravels, more merchandise will be released across the line.</p>



<p>In a statement, the CEO of Jagex, Jon Bellamy, wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>It’s incredible to think a quarter century has passed since&nbsp;RuneScape’s&nbsp;beginnings as a Java-based browser game</em>. <em>Today we’re speaking to the largest and most active&nbsp;RuneScape&nbsp;community in our history, and this milestone is as much theirs as it is ours.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team at Jagex uploaded an 11-minute video looking back at the last 25 years of RuneScape history, which you can see below:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>This year promises to be absolutely insane for RuneScape fans. The game has had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jagex-confirms-layoffs-pauses-key-runescape-project/">a few bumps in the road</a> in the last few years, but the community seems eager to receive what amounts to a bounty of content through 2026.</p>

            <guid>1406860</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>According to a new report, NVIDIA has stopped production of the RTX 5070 Ti GPU, and the 5060 Ti 16GB will soon follow. </p>



<p>The growth of AI has led to global memory shortages, impacting even the most prominent manufacturers. We were recently told that NVIDIA doesn’t plan to announce <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-isnt-announcing-a-new-gpu-at-ces-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">any new GPUs at CES 2026</a>. Now, another report has revealed that they might be halting production of one of their RTX 50 Series GPUs. </p>







<h2 id="h-nvidia-to-halt-production-of-rtx-5070-ti-and-5060-ti-16gb">NVIDIA to Halt Production of RTX 5070 Ti and 5060 Ti 16GB </h2>



<p>A recent YouTube video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yteN21aJEvE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hardware Unboxed</a> (thanks <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-reportedly-says-rtx-5070-ti-is-no-longer-being-produced-rtx-5060-ti-16gb-to-follow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoCardz</a>) suggests that NVIDIA is halting its production of the RTX 5070 Ti graphics cards. This information&nbsp;was provided by ASUS, NVIDIA’s largest add-in board (AIB) partner, who stated that the RTX 5070 Ti model has been “essentially killed off” and is now in an “end of life status.” ASUS has no plans to produce more 5070 Ti models, meaning that what is currently available in stores will be the last stock of this model offered by the company. <span>This information <span>aligns with an earlier report stating that NVIDIA will&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-cutting-rtx-50-series-production-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><span><span>cut</span> RTX 50 series producti</span>on</a>&nbsp;in 2026. </p>



<p>NVIDIA’s RTX 5070 Ti isn’t the only model facing supply issues; the RTX 5060 Ti 16GB has also experienced a significant reduction in availability, effectively leading to its discontinuation. ASUS has reportedly confirmed that this model has been designated as “end of life” and will no longer be produced. Currently, retailers are only able to purchase the 8GB versions, including the RTX 5060 and RTX 5060 Ti 8GB, in bulk. These shortages have resulted in increased prices for the models that remain available in stores.</p>

<p>In other news, a recent claim stated that NVIDIA will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-to-re-release-geforce-rtx-3060-in-q1-2026-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">re-release the GeForce RTX 3060</a> in Q1 2026 to battle ongoing memory shortages. Additionally, <span>NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang called the constant negativity surrounding the AI industry “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-ceo-says-ai-doomer-narrative-is-hurtful/" target="_blank">extremely hurtfu</a></span>l.” What are your thoughts on NVIDIA halting production of RTX 5070 Ti and 5060 Ti 16GB models?

            <p>Over a thousand games from a single developer have been suddenly removed from the PlayStation store in what appears to be a massive move by Sony to shift shovelware games off the PS5 and PS5 store.</p>
<p>The developer in question was ThiGames, which prior to the wipe yesterday was the fourth highest ranked developer on the PlayStation Store in terms of quantity. <a href="https://x.com/robthanatos/status/2011487254724952207">According to RobThanatos who first spotted the change</a>, all of ThiGames released games have been totally removed from the store. The only exception being trophies tied to these titles, which remain present to those who unlocked them.</p>
<p>As of writing, there has been no statement from either Sony or ThiGames as to why this widespread removal of games has happened. It is, however, worth noting that ThiGames is known for games of a particular quality. Take The Jumping Fries, in which you play fries and jump around. See also The Jumping Taco, The Jumping Hot Dog, The Jumping Soda, and The Jumping Taco TURBO. Eat your heart out, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-2">Street Fighter 2</a>.</p>

<p>As for why these games had a playerbase? Well, if you refer to the video above you'll find a full platinum trophy guide for The Jumping Taco TURBO. You may notice that the video is 95 seconds in length. That is because the trophy lists attached to these games are incredibly simple, in The Jumping Taco's case a collection of 'Jump x times' milestones. As such, these games (now removed) were valuable to those keen to inflate their PlayStation trophy collection.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-quietly-removes-slop-shovelware-ps5-games-following-investigation">This is not the first time Sony has removed shovelware games from its PS5 store</a>. Roughly a year ago, the company took action against Randomspin. That developer was suspected of using AI and/or recycled assets, and was quietly removed. It too was releasing a massive number of games within a relatively short period of time, much like ThiGames.</p>

            <p>Young'un James Bond game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/007-first-light">007: First Light</a> has had a little redo of its PC system requirements, after "an internal miscommunication" – according to developers IO Interactive – led to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-system-requirements">last week’s specs</a> reveal containing some whoopsies. "We’re sorry for the confusion this caused and appreciate everyone who brought it to our attention", <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/2011735420631982151">sayeth the company’s tXeet</a>.</p>
<p>In short, the requisite RAM for recommended settings has dropped from 32GB to 16GB – happily so, for anyone putting off an upgrade while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/predicting-steam-machine-prices-would-be-a-lot-easier-if-ram-costs-hadnt-gone-horribly-wrong">memory prices are off the charts</a> – while VRAM has been lowered across the board, and the minimum Intel CPU listing has been amended from the fictional Core i5-9500K to the all too real Core i5-9500. See? It’s all good news really. No need to point out how I wrote about the original specs list without mentioning any of these.</p>
<p>Here’s the updated specs:</p>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>IO Interactive</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I did <em>notice</em>, at the time, the discrepancy of asking for a 12GB <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">graphics card</a> while listing the 8GB RTX 3060 Ti as a recommended GPU. But then the relationship between VRAM and games performance is so inconsistent – and the people who argue that 8GB can’t run anything tougher than Puzzle Bobble are so irritating – that I let it slide. No defence on failing to clock how IOI invented an Intel CPU, mind. Ballsed that one right up, I did, and now I go to join the devs for ten nights of penance sleeping in the Apology Cave.</p>
<p>007: First Light is out on May 27th. IOI also say that "additional performance targets will be shared closer to launch", hopefully with STRENUOUSLY FACT-CHECKED insights into what you might need to run it at resolutions higher than 1080p.</p>

            <guid>1406836</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="716">Data has become one of the most powerful tools for athletes looking to improve their performance. From shaving seconds off your pace to building endurance and staying consistent with training, having access to the right metrics can make all the difference. That’s where a quality running watch comes in. Whether you’re training for a marathon or just preparing for a local 5K, a reliable device helps you measure progress and stay motivated. The Garmin Forerunner 55 is designed specifically for active lifestyles and fitness-focused individuals, and right now it’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4916/">even more appealing thanks to a limited-time Amazon deal that drops the price by $50, bringing it down to just $149</a>.</p>
<p data-start="718" data-end="1280">At its core, the Garmin Forerunner 55 acts as your personal fitness coach right on your wrist. Its built-in GPS accurately tracks your running routes while providing essential data such as distance, pace, and time. The watch also features wrist-based heart rate monitoring, making it ideal for runners who train using heart rate zones to optimize performance and recovery. Beyond running, it supports a wide range of activities, including HIIT, cycling, strength training, and other workouts, making it a versatile option for athletes who like to mix up their routines.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4916/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="718" data-end="1280">Daily Suggested Workouts</h2>
<p data-start="1282" data-end="1756">Through the Garmin Connect app, users gain access to free adaptive training plans created by expert coaches. These plans sync directly to the watch and adjust based on your progress, removing much of the guesswork from training. Instead of wondering whether you’re doing too much or too little, the watch helps ensure you’re following a structured and efficient path toward your goals.</p>


<p data-start="1758" data-end="2207">The Garmin Forerunner 55 doesn’t stop working when your workout ends. It continuously tracks your heart rate throughout the day and monitors overall health metrics. I find myself constantly checking my Garmin’s Body Battery score, which estimates your energy levels using factors like heart rate, stress, and daily activity. This insight helps you determine when to push hard and when it’s smarter to rest. Train with intent and avoid burnout.</p>
<p data-start="2209" data-end="2534">Speaking of battery, the watch’s actual battery life is another major advantage. With GPS enabled, the watch can last up to 20 hours, making it suitable for long runs or race days. Without GPS, it can go up to 14 days on a single charge. For most runners, if you’re running multiple times per week, you’ll likely end up means charging it about once a week. That’s far more convenient than many smartwatches like the Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch which basically require daily charging.</p>
<p data-start="2536" data-end="3001" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Even though its focus is fitness, the Garmin Forerunner 55 still offers other useful smart features. When paired with your phone, it can deliver notifications for calls, texts, and emails right to your wrist, keeping you connected without distraction. Normally priced at $199, the current 25% discount makes it an excellent value. Choose between three band color options including black, white, or aqua.</p>

            <guid>1406833</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Simon Collins-Laflamme is the mastermind behind Hytale and Hypixel Studios. The creator is very vocal on social media and has provided another big update on the game following its successful early access launch.</p>



<p>Hytale is the new kid on the block, and there are <em>many </em>blocks in Hytale: Wood, Stone, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-make-copper-ingots-in-hytale-copper-location-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Copper</a>, you name it. The Minecraft-like title is expected to undergo a significant period of early access before a 1.0 launch. The founder is keen to reward everyone who adopts Hytale early and has spoken out about the game’s Mining mechanic and other improvements on the way.</p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-needs-to-be-more-satisfying">Hytale Needs To Be ‘More Satisfying’</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Spooky. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Collins-Laflamme took to X to say that he and the team had “Gathered thousands of feedback inputs via social media and in-game feedback forms.”</p>







<p>Most of these issues and bits of feedback are being taken on board with a view to addressing “most of them.” Part of this includes “<strong>Lots of new avatar options.</strong>” If you thought your avatar looked cool now, wait until the character creation tools are expanded upon.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Gathered thousands of feedback inputs via social media and in-game feedback form, made plans to address most of them, lots of QoL/fixes/quick wins in the pipeline already! Staying busy.</p><p>I've also asked the art team for lots of new avatar options. Expanding the art team ASAP!</p></div>— Simon (@Simon_Hypixel) <a href="https://twitter.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2011670308076601766?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Another post talked specifically about Hytale’s Mining. Day-to-day Mining is vital for accumulating resources, giving you room to build structures, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-repair-in-hytale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">repair weapons and items</a>, and apply upgrades.</p>



<p>Collins-Laflamme himself has stated his personal dissatisfaction with this aspect of Hytale:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I need suggestions to make mining in Hytale more satisfying / fun! I’m not happy with it, finding ores or strip mining is not good enough. I’m considering adding signature ability to pickaxes + improving the sounds / visuals of mining.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There’s nothing fundamentally wrong with Mining in Hytale, and anyone who’s played Minecraft—or other similar survival games—should feel right at home. But there’s room for improvement, so expect this to be addressed, and a whole lot more, as the weeks and months pass.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I need suggestions to make mining in Hytale more satisfying / fun!

<p>What have you enjoyed about Hytale in the early stages? Is it lacking something? What changes need to be enforced sooner rather than later to get the game anywhere near Minecraft’s level?

<hr>
<p>Back when — what feels like forever ago — we found out that a new <strong>Animal Crossing</strong> game would be coming to Switch, we were told basically diddly squat about the whole thing, but excitement ensued nonetheless. As time went by and we learnt more and more about it, the hype reached ever higher rungs on the big ladder of development, only hindered <em>slightly</em> by a delay of an undisclosed number of months. Previews came and went, and frankly, we weren’t certain such an intolerable fever could happen over a game without ‘<strong>Mario</strong>’ or ‘<strong>Zelda</strong>’ in the title, but here we are; with expectations verging on the impossible and justifiable impatience about to become legal tender, can the proverbial skills of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> pay the bills?</p>
<figure><a title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons Review - Screenshot 1 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/103625/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Much like every other Animal Crossing game, you arrive fresh-faced in a town that’s seen better days. Unlike every other Animal Crossing game, the town isn’t really there yet, and it’s basically all down to you to fund a tycoon raccoon’s mad obsession with Bells, and maybe make your island into a town in the process.</p>
<p>This time you’re also able to actually choose how your character looks, rather than being asked a series of seemingly arbitrary questions by a cat of no fixed abode in order to determine your genetic makeup. You’re also under no obligation to keep the face you’ve chosen, and every single choice you make when crafting your character — from your hair colour right down to rosy cheeks — is immediately rectifiable with any sort of mirror or vanity you can get your globular hands on. It seems basic by modern standards, but credit where credit’s due and all that.</p>
<p>But just how un-towny is this island you’ve been dropped on? Well, in short, you and everyone else will be spending at least the first night in a tent, with no buildings, structures, pathways, or anything else to keep you company – besides hundreds and hundreds of weeds, that is. This is nature’s home for sure, and unless you stop playing pretty much immediately, you’re going to want to make sure it knows <em>you’re in charge</em>. Plucking weeds, gathering fruit, selling them at Resident Services to Tom Nook’s unpaid nephews who seem to have an endless supply of funds at their disposal... it all needs doing, and none of the other islanders are going to do it.</p>
<figure><a title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons Review - Screenshot 2 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/103622/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This mega-early stage of the game feels surprisingly different to Animal Crossing as a whole; you’re supremely limited on what changes you can make, and your only real goal is to lay the groundwork for what's to come. The only thing that’s established is the layout of the land itself, although that too will eventually be yours to mould. Despite it being <em>so</em> different from previous games, we found the whole thing incredibly engrossing and appealing. The feeling of being isolated on a deserted island with not a care for what’s going on in the outside world is intoxicating and even somewhat addictive. Even in highly distracting real-life environments, we couldn’t stop thinking about that patch of weeds we didn’t <em>quite</em> have time to clear.</p>
<p>Speaking of weeds, they’re now more than just a nuisance; not only can they be straight-up sold for cash, but it's also possible to use them in the game's fancy new DIY system. This allows you to take raw materials that otherwise would serve little to no purpose and fashion them into swanky new gubbins. Stone, iron, three kinds of wood – none of the island’s resources are useless. All this needs to be carried in your inventory, and as such, the infamously limited space is thankfully bigger than ever before – although the old 'storing-things-as-presents-on-old-letters' trick can no longer be used, but then when did you <em>really</em> need to carry all those letters around anyway? It doesn’t end at a measly two rows, either; eventually, you’ll be able to upgrade your inventory to include two additional lines — one at a time — of extra space, which is so painfully welcome it actually <em>hurts</em>.</p>
<figure><a title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons Review - Screenshot 3 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/103628/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>To do this, you’ll need to exchange Nook Miles, a rewards system created by Tom Nook that almost feels generous. By completing various tasks throughout the island you’ll be slapped with an amount of Nook Miles that can be redeemed for all manner of interesting prizes. These are each only one-time offers, but it won’t be long before you unlock Nook Miles+, which gives you a random selection of tasks to complete that get replaced as soon as they’re done. It’s a really great way to get players to try a variety of different tasks that they might otherwise have overlooked, and with the rewards ranging from clothing to new hairstyles, you’ll want to get as many as you can.</p>
<p>Classics of the series such as Nook’s Cranny, the Able Sisters’ shop, and the Museum all return in full form, except this time they don't appear right away – but when they do eventually arrive, you get to demand where they're built, like the dictator that you are. You’re also able to eventually change your mind and relocate amenities, as well as your home and those of other villagers. This level of flexibility is entirely optional for purists, but the fact that it’s even just possible opens up the scope of what’s available to a degree never before seen in the series – and the options don’t end there either.</p>
<figure><a title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons Review - Screenshot 4 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/103620/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The DIY system expands far further than we originally expected as well; we’ve seen a huge number of items that are available to purchase (or find) the old-fashioned way that can <em>also</em> be crafted if you happen to have the appropriate DIY recipe on hand. Said recipes can be nabbed in numerous ways, such as being gifted to you by other villagers, acquired as part of standard progression, or even found frequently as a sort of 'message in a bottle' washed up on the beach. In short, <em>we love it</em>. It might be a bit weird to hit a tree with an axe three times a day to gather from a seemingly limitless font of wood, softwood, and hardwood, but despite its arguably nonsensical qualities, the end result is a system that works beautifully.</p>
<p>You’ll need to work this system hard as well if you want any more than the starting two villagers milling about your island. Mr Nook will task you with fulfilling his lofty promises to prospective inhabitants by supplying items they deem <em>absolutely</em> necessary to live, like a birdbath. Our tanuki friend provides the DIY recipes, but everything else is (of course) down to us. This can hit your resources <em>hard</em>, and so it may be worth your while if you’ve exhausted your island’s supplies to take a trip with Dodo Airlines to a mystery island, after exchanging 2000 Nook Miles for a ticket.</p>
<figure><a title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons Review - Screenshot 5 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/103615/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>These mystery tours place you on a randomly generated mini-island where resources, fish, bugs, and even new villagers can be found. They may be small, but we’d be lying if we said we didn’t get a thrill from the whole luck-of-the-draw system at play. Most of the time we went to these islands because we needed to get more resources, but a few times we went just for a change of scenery – and when we happened upon an island full of bamboo, we felt our Nook Miles had been <em>very</em> well spent indeed.</p>
<p>So, with all the new systems in place, we were having a wonderful time; our emotions expertly tapdancing between excitement, wonder, anticipation, and relaxation. But we can’t deny that after a week or so the great steam locomotive that is our enthusiasm was beginning to slow somewhat. No sooner had this feeling arrived than the all-powerful Nook hit us with the news that the Resident Services tent would be upgraded to something that looks <em>suspiciously</em> like a town hall in just 24 hours.</p>
<p>We were pleased, but we had no idea just how much more would be opened up with this single building. Suddenly we could create ramps, a town tune was in place (which was instantly changed to ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSsfjHCFosw">At Doom’s Gate</a>’ by parties unknown), bridges could be sprinkled wherever we wanted, we could change the flag, the previously-absent hourly music appeared, the entire island had erupted in new possibilities, and our eagerness spread across our faces like a big, grinning, ear-to-ear grin.</p>
<p>It doesn’t even end there, either; our DIY horizons were expanded even further with the ability to customise objects with different colours, and in some cases even with custom designs. Bedding, cushions, even your NookPhone case can have whatever sordid graphics you wish plastered all over them. It’s something fans have understandably been asking for for a long old time, and to see it realised so effortlessly makes our hearts swell in a safe and metaphorical sense.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/accessibility-report/2209/embed @ 1768487298 -->
<p>With all this customisation in objects, building locations, paving, and even the land itself, the only major limitation (besides your wallet) is your imagination, and whether you’re willing to put in the time to make it a reality. Nothing happens overnight (actually, buildings and renovations <em>do</em> occur overnight, so scratch that), so you’d better be ready to sink some serious hours into this game – and with so much here that’s so well realised, it’s hard not to. This is the point where we’d ask a question about whether the game looks good, but come on, we all <em>know</em> it looks good.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, the presentation in every sense here is all but flawless. It’s one of the prettiest games on the Switch, so when you couple that with atmospheric lighting, a crisp 1080p docked resolution running at 30fps, sound design that hangs like honey in our ears, and undoubtedly the finest museum in video game history, this is nothing short of an audio-visual dream. Handheld play unsurprisingly feels extremely natural given the series' history, but docked is where you'll get to see the shiniest of the pretty things in the quality most deserving.</p>

<p>And the loveliness doesn't end on a pixel level; the world feels far more <em>alive</em> than ever before. Villagers will wander around holding books and examining flowers, watering them, singing on the plaza, bashing away at a DIY Bench, running up to you to give you stuff you feel you can't turn down... it's all a rich tapestry. Integral characters like Tom Nook and Isabelle also have far more life in them, dusting, sorting, busying themselves appropriately rather than just waiting for your inevitable interaction with slightly dead eyes. The leaves on the trees all move independently, the footprints you leave on the beach behave differently if it's raining. The level of charm and attention to detail is simply unparalleled.</p>
<p>You’re not restricted to the delights of your own island, either. As with previous entries, you can take your charming little self off to visit the wonders found on the islands of others, either locally or via the internet. The system remains largely unchanged from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/animal_crossing_new_leaf">New Leaf</a>, except with an extremely pleasing little classic airport information display-themed animation to announce the arrival of any new players, and it works well. We can’t say the idea of having a whole 8 people trampling around our simple but extremely personal town is something we’re clamouring to do, but the ability to do so shouldn’t be scoffed at in the slightest.</p>
<figure><a title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons Review - Screenshot 6 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/103614/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>If wireless ‘ain’t your thang’ you can also rope in another user (or three) from the same console to join you in your endeavours. A single Joy-Con is all that’s required for each player, meaning those who picked up a shiny new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/03/video_the_animal_crossing_switch_is_one_of_the_most_beautiful_things_humankind_has_ever_created">New Horizons Switch console</a> can dive right into co-op without delay. Players who aren’t classified as the singular ‘leader’ can’t pick anything up due to lacking an inventory, but it’s extremely simple and straightforward to swap who the leader is with just a few inputs. It’s a feature that will no doubt go down very well with families as well, and for a quick romp around the island, it works impressively well.</p>
<p>If we have one complaint, it would be that very occasionally the UI, whilst extremely smart and functional, isn’t as snappy as we’d expect it to be, resulting in some (thankfully rare) mistaken inputs as we feverishly rifle through menus to complete the next task. There’s no option to use the touchscreen when creating custom designs either, which is a bit strange. Those are <em>honestly</em> our only gripes.</p>
<h2>Update 3.0.0 (January 2026)</h2>
<p>Version 3.0 brings with it a fair few new additions to the base game. The standout inclusion is the hotel, now teetering off the edge of the once near-empty pier of your island, but there’s also a whole load of smaller, less shiny inclusions that are arguably just as important. More on them later, though.</p>
<figure><a title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons Review - Screenshot 7 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/103617/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>If you’re familiar with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/animal_crossing_new_horizons_-_happy_home_paradise_dlc">Happy Home Paradise DLC</a> that Nintendo released back in 2021, you’ll fall into most of what the new hotel (run by Kapp’n’s extended family) has to offer with little effort. The hotel has eight standard rooms for the common muck that waltzes in, and one VIP room for the lucky guest of your choosing. Your job is to decorate the rooms using all the furniture you’ve unlocked throughout your playtime.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:123203 @ 1768487298 -->
<p>Yeah, it’s not exactly breaking new ground, but for those without the DLC, this offers a ‘light’ version of that experience. It’s not all the same — you’re decorating rooms to attract guests rather than fulfilling their every whim — but the long and short of it is you’re decorating rooms; if that’s not your bag, you’re going to get tired of this stuff <em>fast</em>.</p>
<p>The VIP room is a bit different, as it resets each and every day, meaning you’ll have what is essentially a room-making daily ‘challenge’, which is quite a meaningful item to stick on your daily task list. We say ‘challenge’, but of course the game would be happy if you stuck an open bag of crisps slightly off-centre in the middle of a blank white box. But hey, who are we to judge <em>style</em>?</p>
<figure><a title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons Review - Screenshot 8 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/103626/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You also have a gift shop where you can spend the tickets you receive from decorating rooms for special items, just as you could on Happy Home Paradise, including retro Nintendo consoles that let NSO subscribers play classic games à la the GameCube original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/animal_crossing">Animal Crossing</a> (although only one game per system). Sounds like a racket, personally. Probably lets them dodge Nook taxes or something.</p>
<p>The best part of having eight tourists on your island is just that: your island now has a lot more characters bumbling around, and every day you’ll get a new set to take up your precious space. It’s really lovely to have a change of faces after staring at the same ten gormless stares for years and years.</p>
<p>There are plenty of smaller things to enjoy as well. You can now stick to the island’s hidden grid system and strafe by holding down 'L', which is an inarguable godsend for laying paths and terraforming; you can access the crafting materials in your home storage from any DIY bench; you can craft up to ten DIY items in a single go; you can clear vast swathes of land (and even your entire island) of any and all clutter with the help of Resetti’s exorbitant 60,000-bell clean-up service; and you can join friends on special Slumber Islands which let you fashion the terrain on a fresh island and play together more freely than before.</p>
<figure><a title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons Review - Screenshot 9 of 11" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/103613/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>And these are all separate from the additions of the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, as well. All good stuff and no mistake. Many of these new features are being introduced nearly <em>six whole years</em> after the game’s launch, granted. Better late than never, we suppose.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Animal Crossing: New Horizons takes Animal Crossing and not only drags it back onto home consoles, but improves upon every single facet imaginable. There's more to do, more to see, more to change, more to mould, and more to love; fans and first-time players are going to find themselves losing hours at a time gathering materials, creating new furniture, and making their island undeniably <em>theirs</em>. Every moment is unashamedly blissful, with excellently-written characters that truly feel alive and an island paradise that gives back infinitely more than you put in.</p>
<p>Back when Animal Crossing: New Leaf hit the shelves all those years ago and created a whole new generation of fans, many people were wondering how Nintendo could possibly top it, but here we have our answer. This is a masterpiece that has been well worth waiting for.</p></section>

            <title><![CDATA[‘When People Have Already Decided That You’re Going to Fail, It’s Actually Freeing to Some Degree’, Says Bethesda Dev About Fallout 3 Hate]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/bethesda-dev-speaks-fallout-3-pre-release-hate/</link>
            <guid>1406803</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following the news that <strong>Bethesda</strong> had acquired the <strong>Fallout</strong> license and would develop <strong>Fallout 3</strong>, the studio, known for the <strong>Elder Scrolls</strong> franchise, faced a significant amount of online criticism. In a retrospective article published in the latest issue of <strong>EDGE Magazine</strong> (<a href="https://fave.co/4aXc54h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2026, #419</a>), <strong>Angela Browder</strong>, current Studio and Production Director at Bethesda Game Studios, looked back at the controversy and found that, in a way, it freed the team to do what it wanted.</p>



<p><em>There was a section of the Fallout fandom that felt that a team famous for making elves and fantasy games should not be touching this series. It was surprising to us how much hate we got. They were not very happy that we had bought this licence. [...] I wasn’t concerned about what the haters might have thought. When a group of people have already decided that you’re going to fail, it’s actually freeing to some degree.</em></p>



<p>Now that many years have passed, Browder feels the franchise's expansion under the Bethesda banner is there for all to see (despite the <a href="https://wccftech.com/they-just-dont-fully-understand-its-roots-and-arguably-dont-care-fallout-new-vegas-lead-chris-avellone-comments-on-series-direction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">criticism levied against the studio</a> just a few days ago by <strong>Fallout: New Vegas</strong> lead <strong>Chris Avellone</strong>).</p>



<p><em>You look at the amount of fans that Fallout had for 1 and 2, which expanded with 3 and expanded with 4, and now you have a television show. That, to me, is the success of it – all these people who become lifers.</em></p>



<p>Like many Bethesda games at launch, Fallout 3 had a lot of bugs, which Browder and Studio Design Director <strong>Emil Pagliarulo</strong> explained with the following statements: </p>



<p><strong>Angela Browder</strong>: <em>We try not to say ‘no’ to the player. If you want to do something weird, you can go for it. And if we’re not saying ‘no’ to the player, why would we say ‘no’ to the staff who are making it? We had a grand vision of this thing, and a very small staff, and we just went. And if something went wrong, we just pivoted.</em></p>



<p><strong>Emil Pagliarulo</strong>: <em>We were trying to do so much and we couldn’t really comprehend the complexity of the freedom we were trying to give the player, and how that can screw things up. There’s a human element, too. As it gets deeper into development, people get tired. They make mistakes. And then, when you go to fix bugs, you have to be so careful – you can change a line of text and it blows up some art somewhere.</em></p>



<p>Fallout 3 returned in the news in the last few years following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remaster leak</a>. Lately, the rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-new-vegas-remake-fallout-3-remake-will-arrive-eventually/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has expanded to also include Fallout: New Vegas</a>; <strong>apparently, Bethesda is working on remasters for both games</strong>.</p>

              <p>January is often a quiet month for big video game releases. So this cold, wintry month becomes a perfect time to evaluate your ever-growing backlog of video games and start chipping away at it. That’s what many of us at <em>Kotaku</em> are doing right now, and so we figured hey, let’s turn our lives into content for the website.</p> <p>Welcome to the start of <a href="https://kotaku.com/reviews/backlog">Backlog Week</a>, a way to celebrate, critically evaluate, and document those massive lists of games we all have. Those lists of games we need to get around to…one day. Games we want to play. Games we want to finish. Games we want to give a second or even third chance to in the hope that maybe this time it will stick. Looking at you, <em>Cyberpunk 2077!</em></p>

 <p>So what should you expect over the next seven days? We’ll have new blogs from us and some talented freelancers about finally playing backlog games, dealing with that dreaded list, what a backlog even is in 2026, and some remastered old posts from our <a href="https://kotaku.com/welcome-to-backlog-month-1846621879">Backlog Month in 2021</a>. And with comments back, feel free to tell us about any games you’re finally getting around to after they lingered on your backlog for weeks, months, or even years.</p>

 <p>And yes, we are starting a theme week in the <em>middle</em> of the week and not on a Monday. It will even run over the weekend. We’re rebels. And like, a week is just seven days, baby. We can start that whenever we so please. And so we are starting…now. Well, actually, we started like four paragraphs up, but whatever, welcome to <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/backlog-week-2026">Backlog Week 2026</a>!</p>

<p>A brand new season in Marvel Rivals has arrived with the launch of Season 6, and with it comes the usual balancing update full of fresh nerfs and buffs. </p>



<p>Season 6 of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-players-can-now-buy-gift-items-directly-from-discord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> features many tweaks fans have long called for, along with an update to Team-Up Abilities. Some new ones have been added, whilst a couple have instead been removed. </p>







<p>If you’re looking for the full breakdown of nerfs and buffs coming alongside Season 6 of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/deadpool-is-marvel-rivals-most-versatile-character/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a>, then you’re in the right place—it’s all available below.</p>

<p><strong>Season 6 offers a large variety of balance changes, though the likes of Star-Lord and Hela manage to evade nerfs despite their OP nature.</strong></p>



<p>A handful of Vanguards have seen some notable buffs, including the likes of Doctor Strange, Hulk and Emma Frost. Hulk has received a variety of cooldown improvements, whilst Doctor Strange has been given some movement adjustments to his Cloak of Levitation. Meanwhile, Angela is slightly easier to deal with, now that her shield value has dropped from 350 to 300.</p>



<p>Duelists have seen some hefty changes, too, with Black Panther and Iron Fist both receiving buffs. Diving the backline should be slightly easier now, thanks to some damage increases to some of their abilities. Blade has seen some tweaks, as you’ll need to choose between your weapons more carefully. Sadly, though, Daredevil is the main target for nerfs, as the Devil of Hell’s Kitchen was running riot last season. </p>







<p>Finally, the Strategists have come out the worst with Season 6’s balance changes, as the likes of Rocket Raccoon, Invisible Woman, and Gambit have all been nerfed. Rocket Raccoon has been slowed down slightly during his Wild Crawl, whilst Sue Storm’s Guardian Shield has dropped from 250 to 200 health. Gambit’s overall healing output has been lowered, as NetEase look to weaken his cards.</p>
