		<p>The next Resident Evil game is in development and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/01/23/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review/">Resident Evil 7</a> director Koshi Nakanishi is seemingly leading the team behind it.</p>
<p>“It was really difficult to figure out what to do after [Resident Evil] 7,” he said, “But I found it, and to be honest it feels substantial.”</p>


<p>This absolutely sounds like the next Resident Evil will be another big reinvention for the long-running horror game series, though Nakanishi did not share any further details at this time. “I hope you’re excited for the day I can,” he said.</p>
<p>Koshi Nakanishi has a well-established place in the Resident Evil series, having been director for Mercenaries 3D and the first Resident Evil Revelations, as well as serving as lead designer on Resident Evil 5. He will, however, be most famous for leading development of Resident Evil 7: Biohazard.</p>
<p>Resident Evil 7 was hugely impactful for the series, with its shift to first person action, the introduction of Ethan Winters as a new everyman protagonist, and a much less sensationalised setting than the previous mainline game. This was the built upon with Resident Evil Village, which concluded Ethan’s story. In and around those games, Capcom has also given fans of the classics plenty to enjoy, with ground-up remakes of Resident Evil 2, 3 and 4 that have modernised their gameplay.</p>

<p>That blend of new and old is rumoured to continue, with rumours of Resident Evil 9 development (or whatever it ends up being called) also coming alongside <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1795075103169954210">rumours of remakes for Resident Evil Zero and Resident Evil: Code Veronica</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/sunnyside-review-buggy-but-absolutely-worth-it</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sunnyside-review-buggy-but-absolutely-worth-it.916965/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/sunnyside-review-buggy-but-absolutely-worth-it<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you thought you were done with cozy farming sims, think again – <em>SunnySide </em>takes everything people thought they knew and loved about the cozy farming genre and flips it on its head. Gone are the days when you’re watering individual plants with an outdated watering can. Welcome to 2024, where people can order their seeds online and text their friends to meet up.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>SunnySide</em> is a modern twist on the farming simulation games that players know and love. Combining more in-depth mechanics of the <em>Farming Simulators</em> with the cozy classics like <em>Stardew Valley</em> lets developers RainyGames create a unique, standout game. Between stellar story-telling, farming/ranching, battling, and relationship-building, <em>SunnySide </em>has earned a spot in the genre for pushing things farther than anyone else has. There are so many little details all around that elevate it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, an abundance of bugs and performance issues make it incredibly difficult to get into. The game is held back from soaring as it should, but if you can get around them, there’s a truly special game waiting underneath.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Welcome to the SunnySide</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rainy-day-bike-riding-in-sunnyside_0.jpg?itok=XIb48zXZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rainy-day-bike-riding-in-sunnyside_0.jpg?itok=uZ8qr23o 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>SunnySide&nbsp;</em>is visually stunning and has a lot of charm.</figcaption></figure><p>As a new resident in SunnySide, the player buys a nearly empty piece of land to start a farm on. The only thing available is a shed with a few tools, a water pump and hose, and a tent from the neighbor. The friendly townspeople are willing to help the player get set up for success, teaching them everything from cooking to woodworking to farming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The little town feels alive – people are constantly walking everywhere, they’re changing clothes with the seasons, they have their own lives, and they aren’t relying on the player for anything. The characters are unique enough to stand out, both in design and personality. There’s every kind of store that a small town would have, and as someone who grew up in a small town, it feels like home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The little details of the people and the town already set it apart. The way they interact with the player also feels genuine, along with how the player builds relationships with them. Getting close to people involves texting, meeting up anywhere around town, and spending time together. For each character, spending time together looks different; players can write poetry with Sebastion or fly drones with Hiro.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deck-combat-in-sunnyside.jpg?itok=N5fR665b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deck-combat-in-sunnyside.jpg?itok=dHLTTprp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Battling with spiritually-charged talismen is another outstanding area of the game.</figcaption></figure><p>These interactions feel realistic, and getting to know the characters reveals that they’re written well, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are also events pretty consistently, such as festival days or farmer’s markets where the player can interact with everyone as they come and go. Additionally, the farmer’s market is how players can sell anything they get their hands on in a way that still feels pretty realistic. If someone was trying to make a living off the land today, renting a booth and selling things would be a solid start.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the game continues, players can make deals with townspeople to source different things for them. The natural progression of building both casual and business relationships is unmatched by other games in the genre.</p>
<h2>Deep farming mechanics</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/farming-in-sunnyside.jpg?itok=tkci5C7x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/farming-in-sunnyside.jpg?itok=m7IcWE_4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's so much freedom in&nbsp;<em>SunnySide&nbsp;</em>that players can choose what kind of farm they want to have. Pick a specialty or have a variety, it's up to you.</figcaption></figure><p>Starting from the literal bottom feels satisfying in a way that other cozy farming sims don’t point out. While you may have a dilapidated house in other games, at least it’s a house. And it’s easy enough to get a few pieces of wood to upgrade. In <em>SunnySide</em>, players are given a blueprint as a pity gift, but they have to source everything from screws to glass to put it together.</p>
<p>The farming and ranching itself is reminiscent of <em>Farming Simulator</em>. There’s a lot of deep planning and thought behind how and what you’ll plant. With the internet’s array of seeds to choose from and different types of plots and seeds, there’s plenty of depth. Bringing this level of depth to a cozy farming game isn’t unheard of, but it’s a nice touch that gives players an actual choice in what they want to plant.</p>
<h2>It’s all in the details</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/playing-claw-machine-in-sunnyside.jpg?itok=9kwMMKkf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/playing-claw-machine-in-sunnyside.jpg?itok=Doqez6hP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Minigames are a fun part of certain hangout interactions, like the claw machine.</figcaption></figure><p><em>SunnySide </em>absolutely nailed the details of the genre. There’s so much that players can delve into and explore in-depth, all while having total customization of things like their phone case, its background, and even the notification sound.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The story blends into the gameplay naturally, and it doesn’t feel like any specific gameplay is forced. Instead, players have to tackle multiple different things to make it in <em>SunnySide</em>, which is the goal from the start anyway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything in&nbsp;<em>SunnySide </em>is cohesive and feels natural, and that’s because of the attention to small details in every aspect of the game. Whether you’re praying at the local shrine to upgrade your skill tree, making friends to further the story, or creating the most amazing strawberry farm in existence, everything comes together naturally and beautifully.</p>
<h2>The unfortunate reality of bugs</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/picture-taking-in-sunnyside.jpg?itok=1rtAaB5G 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/picture-taking-in-sunnyside.jpg?itok=VTU3f4Pb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Taking pictures of birds and bugs is actually part of <em>SunnySide</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, bugs are everywhere in the game. It’s easy to fall through the world when loading into areas or get stuck somewhere. This happened at least once every two hours of gameplay. However, <em>SunnySide </em>has several mechanics in place for resetting things. For example, players can respawn where they last slept at any given time. They can also summon their vehicle if it gets stuck no matter where they are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These fail-safes are great, but it’s hard to ignore the fact that the issues are glaring and abundant. It also doesn’t account for visual bugs, like characters facing the wrong way in a conversation or suddenly appearing/disappearing.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>A great game with lots to get over</h2>
<p>Despite the major bug problems, <em>SunnySide </em>is a game that shines in its genre. There’s nothing quite like it, and the overwhelmingly well-done parts of it are worth getting around the bugs for (especially when it's so easy to get around them).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wonderful character development, seamless and natural storytelling and gameplay, and perfectly polished details are far better than the bugs would suggest. Future updates could make this game shine even brighter. However, even with the bugs, <em>SunnySide </em>is such a leap for the genre that it’s worth investing time into. It's a game I'll be returning to over and over again for some time.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
SunnySide may be full of bugs, but the amazing attention to detail in the gameplay loops make it a standout title in the genre. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nickelodeon-all-star-brawl-2-more-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-in-july-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a new <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/07/02/xbox-game-pass-july-2024-wave-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official blog post</a>, Xbox announced the first wave of titles coming to Xbox Game Pass in July 2024, including Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2.</p>



<p>The following titles will join the Xbox Game Pass through mid-July 2024:</p>



<ul>
<li>Journey to the Savage Planet – July 3</li>



<li>Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 – July 3</li>



<li>Cricket 24 – July 9</li>



<li>The Case of the Golden Idol – July 9</li>



<li>Neon White – July 11</li>



<li>Tchia – July 11</li>



<li>Magical Delicacy – July 16</li>



<li>Flock – July 16</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>Pixel art platformer Magical Delicacy and creature collector Flock are both indie games that will be available day one on Game Pass.</p>



<p>The biggest title in the first wave will arrive tomorrow, with Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2. This confirms a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tchia-and-nickelodeon-all-star-brawl-are-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leak from last month</a>. The leaker successfully claimed the popular fighting game and Tchia were both coming to Game Pass. </p>



<p>Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 still has solid Metacritic ratings from both critics and users, so it’s a valuable Game Pass addition. Xbox and Best Buy even teamed up to announce a themed, limited edition <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-announces-nickelodeon-all-star-brawl-2-special-edition-bundle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Series X bundle</a> that included the game last March.</p>



<p>However, the majority of titles for the first half of July concentrate on smaller developers. This is similar to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-reveals-next-wave-of-june-2024-game-pass-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous wave in June</a>. Some of the highlights leaving Game Pass this month are The Wandering Village and Figment 2: Creed Valley, both indie darlings.</p>

Is it weird? Absolutely. Is it slightly disturbing to think that a pile of crispy chicken nuggets that used to be a human being could look so delicious? We're trying not to think too hard about it.</p><p>Like several other live-service games, cosmetics like this have helped Call of Duty stand out from the pack.

<p>The Palia developer will continue to operate independently under the leadership of its co-founders Anthony Leung and Aidan Karabiach.</p>
<p>Singularity 6 will use its expanded resources to invest in development, bring Palia to its 1.0 launch, and make the game available across multiple platforms.</p>
<p>"We ultimately want to get Palia into the hands of every gamer that wants to play it and we believe that we can best do so by partnering with Daybreak, who have a proven track record of building gaming communities that last for decades," said Leung.</p>
<p>"We look forward to benefiting from their experience, expertise, and investment into Singularity 6 and Palia."</p>
<p>Ham added: "Singularity 6 is an excellent addition to our development studios, renowned for their success in creating large-scale online games and content. Their debut title, Palia, is a fantastic addition to our online portfolio."</p>
<p>Daybreak is a subsidiary of Enad Global 7, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/eg7-acquires-daybreak">which acquired the developer in 2020</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-release-date-and-gameplay-info-revealed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced the&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster&nbsp;</em>release date, as well as some new details regarding what sort of gameplay improvements and tweaks we can expect.</p>
<p><em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-announced">originally revealed last week</a> via a teaser trailer that showed off some of its graphical boosts, but during yesterday's Capcom Next presentation, the studio revealed that the remaster will be launching across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on September 19th.</p>
<p>It's also now clearer exactly what&nbsp;<em>Deluxe Remaster&nbsp;</em>is; it's essentially occupying the middle ground between a remake and a remaster, sporting gameplay improvements like autosaving and other quality-of-life features.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-release-date-horde.jpg?itok=oT-tqa3Q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-release-date-horde.jpg?itok=JsAYTNTl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Frank West returns in&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster&nbsp;</em>this September.</figcaption></figure><p>Visually, you can look forward to refreshed character models and environments, as well as better facial expressions, material textures, and blood spatter effects.</p>
<p>If you felt like the original&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising&nbsp;</em>was too brutal, then you'll be pleased to know&nbsp;<em>Deluxe Remaster&nbsp;</em>makes a number of improvements in that direction as well, with the intent being to make the game a "smoother and friendlier" experience.</p>
<p>That means reworked controls, a better UI, and an autosave system so that you don't lose hours of progress. Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster&nbsp;</em>will be fully voiced, whereas the original occasionally defaulted to voice acting-free dialogue.</p>
<p>You can check out the new trailer for&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster&nbsp;</em>right here if you're interested in the project.</p>

<p><em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster&nbsp;</em>will serve as a reworked version of the original 2006&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising</em>, which saw photojournalist Frank West descending into a shopping mall in order to uncover evidence of a zombie plague.</p>
<p>The game's innovative format, in which objectives and events would run along a timeline operating in real time, was retained for 2010 sequel&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising 2</em>. Will that be the next game in the series to get a remaster? We can but hope.</p>
<p>While we wait for news on that,&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2527390/Dead_Rising_Deluxe_Remaster/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009074" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster/9n8bbg0zkfd5" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on September 19th.</p>

            <p>
The latest round of rule changes coming to Dungeons &amp; Dragons were partly inspired by the experience of playing Baldur's Gate 3, the game's creator Wizards of the Coast has revealed.
</p>
<p>
If you're a D&amp;D player like me, you'll likely find the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0rXo-Wp_II">new 25-minute video</a> on changes made within the game's 2024 Player's Handbook an interesting watch, as the game's lead designer Jeremy Crawford sets out some impactful tweaks to the way many fan-favourite spells operate. 
</p>
<p>
D&amp;D updating its rules is nothing new, of course, but what was surprising to hear was that the experience of playing Baldur's Gate 3 directly prompted some of these rule changes - including to spells such as Cloud of Daggers and Produce Flame. 
</p>

<p>
For example, a major buff to Cloud of Daggers, the powerful area-of-effect spell which does exactly what it says on the tin, allows players to move it around the battlefield. This is a real boon, as invariably enemies would simply manoeuvre away from its AOE, making its cost only worthwhile for a short period.
</p>
<p>
Making the spell movable was something Crawford said he'd already considered, but that was reinforced by playing Larian's brilliant role-playing game spin-off. 
</p>
<p>
"Even when I cast Cloud of Daggers in Baldur's Gate 3, I want to be able to move it," Crawford said. 
</p>
<p>
"Some spells that were really painful to cast in terms of their action economy are far less painful," Crawford continued. "An example of that is Produce Flame, the Druid cantrip. 
</p>
<p>
"That cantrip was really painful to set up - once you got it going it could be fun to hurl the fire, [but] now it's way easy to cast it. And that is, funnily enough, another one where it was not only a pain to cast in the tabletop game but when I was playing Baldur's Gate 3 was excruciating... And it was while playing Baldur's Gate 3 I thought 'we are going to redesign Produce Flame so there will not be as much friction to cast this cantrip'."
</p>
<p>
Other big changes to the 2024 Player's Handbook include an adjustment for shapeshifting and related spells such as Polymorph. These now all give players temporary hitpoints based on the form they may be changing into, rather than a separate distinct set of hit points that are effectively treated as freebie. (Playing BG3 as a Druid, I did feel this was a bit broken.)
</p>
<p>
Last month, Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian told fans that its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mod-support-in-baldurs-gate-3-will-be-final-handover-moment-to-players-says-larian-ceo">upcoming addition of mod support would mark a final handover moment to players</a>, as it prepares to move on to what's next. The studio has confirmed it is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">not making Baldur's Gate 4</a>, and is instead <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developer-opens-poland-studio-as-work-on-new-projects-ramps-up">working on something fresh instead</a>.
</p>
<p>
A Baldur's Gate 4 seems inevitable, however, regardless. Indeed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wizards-of-the-coast-now-talking-to-lots-of-partners-about-next-baldurs-gate">Wizards of the Coast is "now talking to lots of partners" to determine who will make it</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/mutant-year-zero-zone-wars-review-skirmish-done-right</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mutant-year-zero-zone-wars-review-skirmish-done-right.916923/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/mutant-year-zero-zone-wars-review-skirmish-done-right<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A flannel-clad Moose/man hybrid comes stampeding out of the facade of a ruined old building. Your huge insect wings flitter in annoyance as you fly up to perch on the outcropping of a rundown soda shop. You take aim with this ancient artifact known as a rifle, waiting for your chance to take the shot. This is the world of <i>Mutant Year Zero: Zone Wars</i>, a new skirmish tabletop wargame by Free League Publishing. We got a chance to try the game out for ourselves, so read on to see if this rules-light skirmish game is right for you!</p>

<p><em>Mutant Year Zero: Zone Wars</em>&nbsp;is a new skirmish-sized tabletop miniature wargame for one to two players (and can be expanded to three or four players with the&nbsp;<em>Robots &amp; Psionics&nbsp;</em>expansion), produced by Free League Publishing. In it, players take on the role of a number of characters in the post-apocalyptic world of&nbsp;<em>Mutant Year Zero&nbsp;</em>(which is both <a href="https://freeleaguepublishing.com/shop/mutant-year-zero/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a tabletop RPG</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/mutant-year-zero-road-to-eden-review-mutated-muppets">a video game</a>, which we previously reviewed).</p>
<p>Players will move their characters around a map with (included) 3D cardboard terrain, moving on movement templates and rolling dice to attack their opponents, all while attempting to secure ancient artifacts from a forgotten age.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mutant-year-zero-zone-wars-dux-is-ready.jpg?itok=BLbCnzfJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mutant-year-zero-zone-wars-dux-is-ready.jpg?itok=tiwjlcKh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Dux (the aptly named duck man) is ready for anything!</figcaption></figure><p>Included in this core box is everything two players need to get started, with 10 high-quality miniatures (assembled and base-coat painted), cards for each character, custom dice, cardboard terrain, and more!</p>
<h2>Getting Into The Action Quickly</h2>
<p>One of the things that I most appreciate about&nbsp;<em>Zone Wars</em>&nbsp;is how easy and quick it is to get into the action with this box set. You'll choose an agreed upon amount of models per side to bring to the table (usually three to five), choose a scenario and follow along on the very simple setup instructions in the rules booklet, deploy your miniatures, and start chucking dice!</p>
<p>With no assembly required on these colored plastic minis, and what they call a "sun-drop coat of paint" (which is a phrase I've never heard before, but seems to mean "base coated and dry-brushed") on top, it takes zero time to get them to the table if you're not trying to do a full paint job.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mutant-year-zero-zone-wars-group-photo.jpg?itok=4PzAPBTd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mutant-year-zero-zone-wars-group-photo.jpg?itok=nRnBk9ru 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each character comes in a base color according to their faction.</figcaption></figure><p>And the rules could not be more straight-forward. You have an attack value, and you'll roll dice equal to that value&nbsp;<em>plus</em>&nbsp;the attack value of your weapon, and you hit on a 6. You can also always push your roll, but that comes with a risk of damaging your weapon.&nbsp; Though there are rules of cover, climbing, flying, special abilities (which you spend m-points on that you gain from rolling 1's), and more - it never feels overwhelming at all.</p>
<h2>But Is It Deep?</h2>
<p>This, to be honest, is where there's room for some valid criticism with the game. Because you're&nbsp;<em>always&nbsp;</em>trying to hit on 6's, each character can end up feeling somewhat similar (when it comes to attacking). There are other ways the characters feel special - like some are melee focused while some can fly, shout out a warning call, and more - but when it comes down to it, you're rolling a bunch of dice and hoping for 6's.</p>
<p>This is a strength for the game as it welcomes newcomers into the wargaming hobby, but more advanced skirmish gamers (like players of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-warcry-crypt-of-blood-review-skirmish-gaming-101"><em>Warcry</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/frostgrave-fireheart-and-blood-legacy-preview-new-rules-for-frozen-north"><i>Frostgrave</i></a>, or even the new&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/how-to-get-started-with-age-of-sigmar-4th-edition-with-spearhead"><em>Warhammer </em><em>Spearhead</em></a>) may feel a little lacking for things to&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;or ways to make their units feel special.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mutant-year-zero-zone-wars-standoff.jpg?itok=_1yGyZPb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mutant-year-zero-zone-wars-standoff.jpg?itok=zLV9Whw2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A standoff for the ages!</figcaption></figure><h2>A Deluxe-Feeling, Approachable Package</h2>
<p>There's a&nbsp;<em>lot</em>&nbsp;packed into this box, considering its MSRP of $66 USD. The inclusion of two complete five-person teams of fighters is a great start, and hopefully you can see from the images throughout how fun, full of character, and detailed they all are. I also really, <i>really</i>&nbsp;like the cardboard terrain included in this box.</p>
<p>As a certified and proven <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/battle-systems-gothic-cityscape-review-hassle-free-terrain">lover of cardboard terrain</a>, the stuff included within this starter set is super engaging, sturdy, and even has some signage in Swedish, which creates this sort of version of the apocalypse that I find most compelling about the&nbsp;<em>Mutant Year Zero</em>&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>It's not the rust-colored, irradiated Route 66 stuff we're used to seeing in the U.S. - instead, everything feels bombed out, overgrown, and dangerous in its own unique way.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mutant-year-zero-zone-wars-franton-photo.jpg?itok=XWBRMR82 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mutant-year-zero-zone-wars-franton-photo.jpg?itok=f1gjc1X4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Franton, and his upgrade cards, ready to battle for scraps of junk!</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Mutant Year Zero: Zone Wars - Final Thoughts</em></h2>
<p>There's quite a lot to like in this box, and I have to say overall I'm pretty charmed by this new little skirmish game. What you lose in the ability to list build (which will likely expand as time goes on, if the game sells well) with pre-built forces you make up for in an out-of-the-box, ready to play game and system.</p>
<p>Because this is based on a well-fleshed out, well-loved Tabletop RPG, it comes across full of engaging personality, little bits of humor (artifacts you secure could include expired medicine, a leather jacket, a vacuum, etc.), and a very realized sense of style.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a game you can pull off the shelf and have ready to go in about 9 minutes,&nbsp;<em>Mutant Year Zero: Zone Wars</em>&nbsp;is the one for you. If, however, you need a bit more depth in your skirmish games (though, one would argue that's what full-sized miniature wargames are for!), then this may not have enough "meat on the bone."&nbsp;</p>

Universal may have been motivated (read: scared) by the astonishing box office performance of Disney and Pixar’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24178014/inside-out-2-review"><em>Inside Out 2</em></a>, which has racked up <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/inside-out-2-joins-billion-dollar-box-office-club-1235935762/">over $1 billion globally</a> in a little over two weeks, setting a new record for an animated film.</p>
<p id="zjBa8G">But the date change also sets up another, potentially more exciting clash: <em>Wicked</em>, which stars Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo, will now hit theaters on the same day as Ridley Scott’s historical action drama <em>Gladiator II</em>, starring Paul Mescal and Pedro Pascal. <em>Wicked </em>is the first part of a two-part adaptation of the hit stage musical, which prefigures the 1939 classic <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>, telling the witches’ backstory. <em>Gladiator II</em> is a generation-later sequel to Scott’s Oscar-winning 2000 epic. (Vanity Fair just published a <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/paul-mescal-pedro-pascal-gladiator-ii-first-look">surprisingly meaty preview</a> of <em>Gladiator II</em>, which is stuffed with first-look images, plot details, and good quotes from Scott and the cast; it’s worth checking out.)</p>
<p id="PiKwxR">The contest between these two movies instantly recalls “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23801761/barbenheimer-barbie-oppenheimer-double-feature-theme-connections">Barbenheimer</a>,” the 2023 box office phenomenon that pitted Greta Gerwig’s candy-colored comedy <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23799502/barbie-movie-review-margot-robbie-ryan-gosling"><em>Barbie</em></a> against Christopher Nolan’s somber nuclear bomb drama <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23800273/oppenheimer-review-christopher-nolan-cillian-murphy"><em>Oppenheimer</em></a>. That date clash created a storm of publicity and a kind of unofficial festival of moviegoing that worked out to the benefit of both movies, which finished 2023 as the biggest and third-biggest films of the year worldwide.</p>
<p id="uEHVko">Theater owners, if no one else, will be hoping for similar from <em>Wicked </em>and <em>Gladiator II</em>, but the juxtaposition isn’t quite so striking this time around.<em> </em>It’s true that one is a colorful, fantastical stage musical centering female characters and the other is a violent action movie front-loaded with manly actors.</p>
<p id="Pcn13I">But they’re both big, old-school spectacles with Old Hollywood feel, and they don’t make for as stark (or as funny) a contrast as between a toy-branded meta comedy and a three-hour biopic about physics and nuclear holocaust. <em>Wicked</em> and <em>Gladiator II</em> are also both franchise movies of a sort, relying on brand familiarity, whereas <em>Barbie </em>and <em>Oppenheimer </em>are both daring, original films from auteur directors.</p>
<p id="OWeCtF">Also, it’s hard to come up with a compound name for them that rolls off the tongue as smoothly “Barbenheimer” does. Gladicked? Surely not. The best I can do is “Wickiator.”</p>
<p id="o7rAz1">None of that matters quite as much as what <em>Wicked</em> and <em>Gladiator II</em> have in common with <em>Barbie</em> and <em>Oppenheimer</em>, though: They’re both exciting-looking movies that present very compelling reasons to see them on the big screen, that complement each other in fun ways, and that stand to do very well with audiences. It’s going to be a fun November.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombats-scorpion-possibly-teased-for-multiversus/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/ajax_hq/status/1807853851862499380" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a recent post</a> on X, Player 1st Games’ community manager @AJAX_HQ possibly teased that Scorpion from Mortal Kombat is coming to MultiVersus.</p>



<p>The post is a reply to fan-made concept art of Scorpion from Mortal Kombat as they might appear in MultiVersus. The post only includes an “eyes” emoji, but that does still suggest the fans should watch out for related news.</p>



<p>Since Warner Bros. owns NetherRealm, and Warner Bros. Games is the publisher behind MultiVersus, the collaboration does seem possible. If Scorpion does join the roster, it could open the door for other Mortal Kombat characters like Sub-Zero. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The community manager, @AJAX_HQ, has previously teased other concrete information. Just this week, they teased the anticipated Agent Smith <a href="https://x.com/AJAX_HQ/status/1807895876658217363">via Twitter</a> with a “sunglasses” emoji. </p>



<p>MultiVersus unveiled a new Agent Smith “Sounds Like Inevitability” trailer with gameplay today ahead of the character’s launch. A new <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-US/New-MultiVersus-Trailer-Reveals-First-Gameplay-of-Upcoming-Playable-Ch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a> from Player 1st Games says that Agent Smith “will join the roster on July 8 as part of Season 1: Puns &amp; Villainy.”</p>



<p>Although @AJAX_HQ may have teased Scorpion, Player 1st Games did not officially confirm anything about them joining the MultiVersus roster at this time.</p>



<p>In late May 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-leaks-tease-possible-new-characters-stages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new leaks surfaced</a> hinting at some of the other characters and stages possibly coming to MultiVersus. Some of those included Daffy Duck, Samurai Jack, Candy Kingdom, and more.</p>

Although Graceborne is still in an early stage of development, the accompanying trailer is very impressive.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he3dqe_6ZjY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/he3dqe_6ZjY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Several characters in Elden Ring have gotten redesigns for Graceborne, including the playable character--the Tarnished--who is now reborn as Bloodborne's Hunter. But the changes are more than just cosmetic. This mod has added Bloodborne's gun-parrying and quick-step ability, while also reworking the way that the main character heals. There are also 22 sets of armor, 35 weapons, 17 trick weapons, and five firearms that have been added to the player's arsenal.</p><p>CorvianNoctis hasn't provided a timetable for when Graceborne will be completed, but it's already growing in popularity on Nexus Mods. As with many early mods, there are still some bugs that have yet to be worked out. But even at this stage, Graceborne appears to be very polished. Hopefully the response to this mod will help convince Sony to finally bring From Software's earlier masterpiece to PC, and give Bloodborne the larger audience that it deserves.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-i-developed-good-communication-skills-while-working-on-fastival.916899/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/how-i-developed-good-communication-skills<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many people find it easy to communicate in calm and relaxed environments. However, communication can become challenging in work settings, especially in unfamiliar environments or urgent situations where the focus shifts towards quick problem resolution. During these times, communication problems often arise, leading to conversations stalling or ideas being poorly exchanged. I'd like to share some lessons I learned from my first large scale team game development project.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Lesson 01: Trust as the Foundation of Long-term Good Communication"><span>Lesson 01: Trust as the Foundation of Long-term Good Communication</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As part of the Southern Methodist University (SMU) Guildhall program, I worked on a team of 47 developers to publish a carnival arcade racing game called </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fastival</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (available on Steam). On the project, I served as the Art Producer. Right at the outset, I ran into the challenge of forming a good communication pipeline with the art team. This task was especially difficult because I had no prior experience working with artists before. Reflecting on my experience, I realized that the biggest challenge was creating trust within the team. Initially, they hesitated to share their thoughts with me because they did not know me or understand my specific role. I needed to take action to create trust within the team and facilitate communication.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To build trust, I began helping the artists with various tasks, even small ones. For example, I adjusted seat arrangements and lighting conditions after learning that the art team preferred to work in a darker environment. I also assisted them with questions related to Perforce (a version control software) and Unreal Engine 5. I approached the artists calmly and respectfully, patiently explaining concepts to those for whom English was a second language. My actions demonstrated my commitment to the team. Gradually, they started to view me as a helper and understood my roles better. With their trust, I was able to make further adjustments to team arrangements and the communication pipeline, such as forming sub-teams that included artists, programmers, and level designers.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Lesson 02: Camly Communicating in “Emergency” Situations"><span>Lesson 02: Camly Communicating in “Emergency” Situations</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Moving on from my experience of creating trust within the team, I want to discuss another lesson I learned, which is calmly communicating in “emergency” situations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During the first week of our alpha development, I discovered a problem, which was troubling several artists: some models imported into the game had black spots and appeared distorted. After class, I investigated the issue and suspected that Nanite, a recently applied setting in Unreal Engine 5, was to blame.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Excited about my findings, I messaged the group channel that night, urging everyone to disable the Nanite setting. However, my unilateral decision caught the attention of our professors, who expressed concerns. The next morning, I discussed the issue with our TGP2 Art Instructor. I tried to persuade the Art Instructor to adopt my solution. In response, he raised valid questions about other potential factors contributing to the problem. Unfortunately, our conversation did not yield much progress, as we were both entrenched in our viewpoints.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After nearly an hour, I decided to step back and consult with other team members, allowing the Art Instructor to investigate the problem independently. Later that day, we reconvened with the Art Instructor, this time with our game’s Software Development lead, a programmer experienced with Nanite, and a Level Design Professor. Together, we examined the issue and identified Nanite LOD as the likely cause of the black spots. Following a thorough discussion, we all agreed to address the issue in the next milestone.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This experience taught me why my initial communication with the Art Instructor failed and highlighted key principles of good communication:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Stay calm: Analyze the core issue, your understanding of the problem, and your proposed solution. Clear thinking is only possible in a calm state of mind.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Focus on the subject: During discussions, focus on the matter at hand rather than the individual. Avoid phrases like "I think you are wrong" or "You're not seeing the big picture," as they divert the conversation away from productive dialogue.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Step back when necessary: If communication stalls, take a step back to reorganize your thoughts and reassess the situation. Consider involving individuals with relevant expertise to facilitate progress.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Lesson 03: Communicating Across Disciplines"><span>Lesson 03: Communicating Across Disciplines</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another lesson I want to discuss is communication across disciplines, specifically between artists and level designers. During TGP2, we were divided into separate teams: Level Designers and Artists, and communication between these two groups was not smooth from the beginning. Both teams brainstormed independently and did not communicate with each other during the early production stages. This resulted in two different visions for the environment and the props that needed to be created. The problem became evident when we started integrating art assets into the levels; many level designers felt that the props did not match their designs and that their opinions were not respected.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Aware of this situation, I began to engage more with the Level Designers team, asking individual track teams about their visions and expectations. My goal was to ensure that the level designers felt respected so that we could move forward collaboratively. Then, I worked with the Level Design producer and leader to establish a communication pipeline for artists and level designers. We used Miro boards and Excel sheets to exchange ideas and reach mutual agreements on which assets would be delivered. During this process, I learned that a good way to communicate a proposal is to clearly explain how it benefits everyone. I explained the current situation sincerely and honestly and showed how the proposal could solve the problem to both teams and earned their supports.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our efforts alleviated the issue and improved communication between Level Designers and Artists. However, because we implemented these changes halfway through the production stage, we did not have enough time to resolve every issue, and some decisions from either the art or level design teams still deviated from the pipeline. If I could go back in time, I would have the Level Designers and Artists work more closely together from the brainstorming stage. Establishing a clear and mutual vision from the beginning of the project is crucial and can prevent many problems later. This is an important lesson I learned as well.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion"><span>Conclusion</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Communication is an integral part of a producer's everyday life, and becoming proficient at it is a continuous learning process. A producer should not only be a good communicator but also facilitate effective communication within the entire development team. This is key to producing quality work and benefiting everyone involved.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In <a href="https://mfn.se/a/enad-global-7/daybreak-acquires-singularity-6-developer-of-popular-online-game-palia" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a press release</a>, Daybreak says it will wholly acquire Singularity 6 and that the transaction will be "funded through the group's available cash balance", leaving "ample cash reserves" after the purchase is complete.</p>
<p>Daybreak goes on to say that it expects this acquisition to "deliver attractive returns above the group's minimum returns threshold", due in part to&nbsp;<em>Palia</em>'s "potential for significant further growth in player base" in future.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palia-singularity-6-daybreak-acquisition-fishing.jpg?itok=xN4Ld_Hu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palia-singularity-6-daybreak-acquisition-fishing.jpg?itok=WZXlUgV6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Palia&nbsp;</em>developer Singularity 6 has a new owner.</figcaption></figure><p>In the aforementioned press release, Daybreak says the "key highlights" of Singularity 6's purchase include an "excellent alignment" with the company and its experience with live-service games.</p>
<p>Highlights also include an "expected meaningful contribution" towards Daybreak's goal of 3 billion SEK in net revenue for the 2026 fiscal year, as well as the chance to invest in a game "at a later stage of development", which Daybreak says helps to minimize risk.</p>
<p>Ji Ham, CEO of Daybreak's parent company Enad Global 7, describes Singularity 6 as a "perfect new addition" to Daybreak's lineup of studios, pledging to "expand and support&nbsp;<em>Palia</em>" and its community for "years to come".</p>
<p>Singularity 6 CEO Anthony Leung, meanwhile, says it's "incredibly exciting" to be acquired by a studio that is "home to some of the most beloved MMO franchises and games in the industry".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/singularity-6-daybreak-acquisition-lord-of-the-rings-online.jpg?itok=5T1JDsjl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/singularity-6-daybreak-acquisition-lord-of-the-rings-online.jpg?itok=DC9CSNMi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Daybreak is responsible for MMOs like&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings Online</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Daybreak's acquisition of Singularity 6 comes after a time of turmoil for the studio, which has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palia-developer-singularity-6-layoffs">been impacted by layoffs</a>&nbsp;on <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/singularity-6-laying-off-36-staff" rel="noopener" target="_blank">two separate occasions</a> over the past couple of months.</p>
<p>This is despite what appears to be&nbsp;<em>Palia</em>'s rather impressive success; back in 2021, Singularity 6 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/singularity-6-raises-30m-for-community-mmo-palia">managed to raise $30 million</a> to make the game, and it's still routinely <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2707930/charts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">attracting around 11,000 to 12,000 players per day</a>, enjoying its all-time peak of 12,607 players just a couple of days ago at time of writing.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what Daybreak, which is more well-known for MMOs than for cozy farming sims like&nbsp;<em>Palia</em>, will do with the game and its developer. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>Headland said Jacinto's character, Qimir AKA The Stranger, is so skilled at fighting that he doesn't wear armor. People pushed back on Headland's decision to do this, but she stood her ground and said, "Why would you wear armor if you're not going to get hit?" She said it's similar to how immensely skilled some people are at Elden Ring.</p><p>"It's like the Elden Ring costume. The Elden Bling. When you summon people, you always summon the people that aren't wearing anything, and it's like, 'These people are f**king crazy.'"</p><p>Headland said the best way to defeat Elden Ring's toughest bosses is to have full confidence, even if that means charging into battle instead of holding back and being more conservative in your approach.</p><p>"You have to go in with that offensive attitude, especially with those bosses.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-dutys-new-extra-crispy-gun-lets-you-cook-eat-and-turn-your-enemies-into-fried-chicken-and-people-are-blaming-it-all-on-fortnite-once-again<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The impact of all-conquering metaverse battle royale Fortnite on Call of Duty — indeed the competitive multiplayer video game landscape — is a topic of long-running debate. In truth, Activision left Call of Duty’s military sim tone behind long ago, resulting in what players have now: a no-holds barred fusion of pop culture and modern warfare.</p><p>But Call of Duty’s latest gun has thrust that debate back into forums and social media once again, and that’s because it’s perhaps the silliest weapon ever seen in the first-person shooter franchise.</p><p>Dataminers unearthed the trailer for the “Extra Crispy” gun, which lets users cook, eat, and turn their enemies into fried chicken. Call of Duty dataminer <a href="https://x.com/realityuk_" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@realityuk_</a> was first to bring it to fans' attention.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Extra Crispy Keep Trailer <a href="https://t.co/a3DfLd6y28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/a3DfLd6y28</a></p>— Reality (@realityuk_) <a href="https://twitter.com/realityuk_/status/1807501354086060472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 30, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>This weapon, currently exclusive to <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile">Call of Duty Warzone Mobile</a>, has an elaborate weapon inspect animation that sees the player stick a raw chicken on the end of the barrel of the gun, cook it, and eat it. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You can officially eat and cook fried chicken in Call of Duty with the weapon inspection on the “Extra Crispy” bundle 🍗<a href="https://t.co/a2v7mAa4Vo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/a2v7mAa4Vo</a></p>— ModernWarzone (@ModernWarzone) <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/1807166495618720183?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 29, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Shooting enemies with the gun, meanwhile, turns them into pieces of fried chicken.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">HQ Kill Effect for the Extra Crispy HCR56 <a href="https://t.co/6Af5KMHwPB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/6Af5KMHwPB</a></p>— Reality (@realityuk_) <a href="https://twitter.com/realityuk_/status/1807500343791747313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 30, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>It’s fair to say some of Call of Duty’s more hardcore fans, perhaps those who played the series before battle royale Warzone became the focus from 2020, are in a flap over this new fried chicken gun. Activision, however, might argue the chicken gun is getting a raw deal. "When will they stop adding nonsense to the game?" asked @Junxrrcarter.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The damage Fortnite has unintentionally done to the multiplayer game aesthetic is unrepairable <a href="https://t.co/CbTXQ4JHOc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/CbTXQ4JHOc</a></p>— Kelski (@kelskiYT) <a href="https://twitter.com/kelskiYT/status/1807864888318218295?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 1, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Others, meanwhile, don't see the problem with this sort of thing as an optional cosmetic in Call of Duty, while pointing out that the Zombies mode is about as unrealistic as you can get in a shooter. Indeed many are having a joke about it all.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Spectre (@SpectreOG) <a href="https://twitter.com/SpectreOG/status/1807361941460983933?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 30, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>It seems Activision is happy to go a step further for Call of Duty mobile weapon skins than it is for the main game on console and PC. Perhaps that has something to do with mobile players being less inclined to take issue with this sort of thing because they haven't had that history with the series before Call of Duty Mobile came out. Either way, the official X/Twitter account for Call of Duty Warzone Mobile has leaned into the negative reaction, perhaps wisely so.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Watching our big reveal get cooked <a href="https://t.co/AaJKwKku0x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/AaJKwKku0x</a></p>— Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile (@WarzoneMobile) <a href="https://twitter.com/WarzoneMobile/status/1807897307146604720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 1, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Call of Duty makes Activision, and now parent company Microsoft, billions of dollars in microtransactions, and much of this comes from outlandish bundles sold post-launch. High-profile crossovers have seen everything from Warhammer 40,000 characters to Gundam mechs running around Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone in recent months. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-dataminers-unearth-what-looks-like-an-unannounced-deadpool-wolverine-crossover">There’s even evidence of an upcoming Deadpool &amp; Wolverine crossover</a>. Truly, in the world of Call of Duty, anything goes, and Activision won’t stop here.</p><p>But it’s worth pointing out that with the release of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a> later this year, Call of Duty cosmetics will see something of a fresh start. That’s because all those bundles you’ve bought for Modern Warfare 2 and 3 won’t carry over to Black Ops 6, which means for launch, at least, we’re back to some semblance of realism.</p><p>Enjoy it while it lasts!</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

</div><div>



            <p>Capcom spat a little squirt of news bile on us yesterday, like a hideous zombie vomiting up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/demon-battling-escort-em-up-kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-gets-a-demo-on-steam">demos</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-gets-a-steam-release-date-also-confirmed-graphics">release dates</a>. One of the smaller chunks was a brief comment by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-7-biohazard">Resident Evil 7</a> director Koshi Nakanishi, who confirmed that a new Resident Evil game is in the works. That's not too much of a surprise - big franchise gonna franchise - but still, it's nice to hear.  "It was really difficult to figure out what to do after [Resident Evil] 7," he said, "but I found it. And to be honest it feels substantial."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We did not get more information than that, unfortunately. The quick and easy assumption to make is that this will be Resident Evil 9, or whatever the developers decide to call it. But Nakanishi stops short of saying this outright. Considering there are unconfirmed rumours that claim both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-0-remakes-are-rumoured-to-be-in-development-at-capcom">Resident Evil 0 and Resident Evil - Code: Veronica will be getting remakes</a>, I feel iffy about jumping to conclusions about exactly which Resi this heavyweight director will be lending his overseership to. It probably is number 9, which has seen its own leaks and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-revenant-shadows-pops-up-online-along-with-ps5-versions-of-code-veronica-zero-and-resi-5">reportedly called Resident Evil 9: Revenant Shadows</a>. But still, no official confirmation of that.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd83elIk_aI">Capcom Next broadcast</a>, Nakanishi reminisced about Resident Evil 7's shift away from action and back to horror.</p>
<p>"When we first started development [on Resi 7], Resident Evil was... well, if I'm being honest, as a brand we were off-track. The action element had been expanded and fans reacted much more negatively than expected. In the end an RE game has to be scary... the general consensus from fans of the series was that a Resident Evil game is one that should scare the hell out of you. That was the starting point for Resident Evil 7."</p>
<p>If Nakanishi is heading development of Resident Evil 9, my hope is that he continues to push the team back into the dark realm of horror. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a> was interesting, but I found it much more shooty than expected, especially after the seventh game's hobbled houseboundness. Then again, I like my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> slow and creepy. I'd be happy if a Resi game came out with, like, three monsters in it. So long as it was dark and tense.</p>
<p>PC-loyal Resi fans desirous of the classics have seen some good news recently, now that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-original-resident-evil-from-1996-comes-back-to-pc-after-decades-of-gathering-flies">original 1996 Resident Evil is available to download on PC for the first time</a>. And ye olde Resi 2 and 3 are coming soon, according to <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil_2">placeholder pages</a> <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil_3">at GOG</a>. No word on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil-code-veronica">Resident Evil - Code: Veronica</a> though, which holds the distinguished honour of being the only Resident Evil game with my granny's name in the title. </p>

			<p>A new gameplay video for an upcoming Splinter Cell RTX Remix mod has been released, showing off path tracing.</p>
<p>While we wait for <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft's Splinter Cell Remake</a>, modder '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@skurtyyskirts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">skurtyyskirts</a>' is working on an NVIDIA RTX remix mod path tracing mod for the original Splinter Cell. Last month, the modder released the first video showing off this WIP mod, and today we wanted to share a new gameplay video (<a href="https://www.dsogaming.com/videotrailer-news/heres-another-look-at-the-tom-clancys-splinter-cell-rtx-remix-path-tracing-mod/#more-181431" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via</a> DSOGaming). As this mod is still in active development, there are some issues with culling, but it has to be said that the initial results look impressive. Check out the new WIP gameplay video below:</p>
<p><iframe title="Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell RTX - (WIP)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TL3xNtLiJQ8?start=163&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Initially released for the original Xbox in 2002 as a Metal Gear Solid killer, Splinter Cell featured amazing lighting effects at that time. As said, Ubisoft is <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-snowdrop-engine-linear-not-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now working on a remake</a> of the game, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-helmed-farcry-6-lead-game-designer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">being spearheaded by Far Cry 6's Lead Game Designer</a>. The remake will offer a <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-remake-rewritten-updated-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rewritten and updated story for a modern-day audience, according to Ubisoft</a>.</p>
<p>The Splinter Cell Remake is slated for a release on PC and consoles, but has yet to receive a release date.</p>
<p>We've included some information about the original Splinter Cell from the game's initial press release below:</p>
<p><em>You are Sam Fisher. A lone shadow-operative in a world where lost seconds can allow terrorist plans to become deadly reality. You operate in the heart of hostile territory. Sent to execute desperate missions, you're the last resort of your government. Should you be captured or killed, all knowledge of your existence will be denied. You are a Splinter Cell.</em></p>
<p><em>When two CIA agents mysteriously vanish in the former Soviet republic of Georgia, the NSA's secret sub agency, Third Echelon, deploys Sam Fisher-its most capable splinter cell operative-to recover them. Fisher soon uncovers a deeper conspiracy: a plot that threatens to destabilize the world order and spark nuclear conflict.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dark Souls 2 DLAA/DLSS Mod Shows Greatly Reduced Aliasing]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/dark-souls-2-dlaa-dlss-mod-shows-greatly-reduced-aliasing/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dark-souls-2-dlaa-dlss-mod-shows-greatly-reduced-aliasing.916845/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dark-souls-2-dlaa-dlss-mod-shows-greatly-reduced-aliasing/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin Lighting Engine mod, originally published on Nexus <a href="https://wccftech.com/dark-souls-2mod-volumetric-fog-ambient-occlusion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in May 2023</a>, has aimed since its inception to improve the visuals of FromSoftware's game released in 2014. It started with volumetric fog, ground truth ambient occlusion (GTAO), new distant geometry and many more lights casting shadows, improved material rendering for metals/non-metals, and adaptive tessellation.</p>
<p>Over time, modder GanaBoy added more features, such as parallax occlusion mapping and PCSS (Percentage Closer Soft Shadows) shadow filtering. The most interesting addition, however, is NVIDIA DLAA/DLSS support. GanaBoy is still testing the upscaler, but he published two videos showing how much of an improvement DLAA and DLSS can bring to Dark Souls 2's visual, especially when it comes to reducing aliasing on grass.</p>
<p><iframe title="DLSS Grass Test" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5zkTG5aDGNo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><iframe title="DLAA Test 1" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n_63hPFFLA0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you're so impressed with the enhancements that you cannot wait for GanaBoy to upload the new mod version on Nexus, a beta release is available via the <a href="https://discord.gg/fBcZVW2Sb4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Discord of the Dark Souls 2 Lighting Engine mod</a>. While there is already a sharpening slider, the modder said it doesn't currently work, probably due to the lack of another library. As with any DLAA/DLSS mod, it requires a PC equipped with NVIDIA's GeForce RTX 20/30/40 Series graphics cards. That said, someone may reverse engineer support for AMD's FidelityFX Super Resolution and/or Intel XeSS, which work cross-platform. It has happened before with several PC games.</p>
<p>Dark Souls 2 is considered to be the least successful game in FromSoftware's series, though it does have a sizable following despite its flaws. Following the third installment in Dark Souls, FromSoftware has moved on to create Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice, Armored Core VI: Fires of Rubicon, and Elden Ring, the latter of which has broken all of the studio's previous records when it comes to critical and commercial reception.</p>

                <p>There are so many active Capcom franchises that it seems like a big deal whenever a new franchise is added to the lineup. Later this month, Capcom is dropping Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess on most of the major consoles and PC. But you don't have to wait long to play it, because the Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess demo is out right now. There's no limit on the playtime, so you can play it as often as you want. Capcom has also released a trailer for the demo, which you can see below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBbz12bhyE8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/TBbz12bhyE8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game puts players in control of Soh, a warrior who is driven to protect a divine maiden, Yoshiro, and the village she lives in from evil. It's an action game with some real-time strategy and tower-defense elements. During the day, Soh has to prepare the villages' defenses and utilize his resources at hand. By night, the enemy creatures attack and not even injuries can stop Soh from his sworn duties. Through Soh, players can still direct the village's defenses even when severely wounded.</p><p>Additionally, Capcom announced a collaboration between Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess and Okami, the classic 2006 video game that put players in control of the Shinto sun goddess Amaterasu. Although Amaterasu doesn't appear in Path of the Goddess, Soh's costume is clearly inspired by her in the video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wc89yTB1XDs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Wc89yTB1XDs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The Okami collaboration is running between now and July 17, and it features more than just special outfits. Music and weapons from Okami are also available. And as an added incentive to players, Capcom will release the Okami items as a free update for Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess if enough players complete the demo by the end of the Okami collaboration.</p><p>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess will hit PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC on July 19.</p>

            <p>"Should we bother with Summer Game Fest this year? Are there other shows better suited for our title? Should we do our own event?"</p>
<p>Every year, I see the same questions getting thrown my way when it comes to what used to be E3's spot in the calendar. What was once a singular event that brought every publisher, developer, journalist and gamer together to celebrate the industry and its latest and greatest has since morphed into a series of smaller events scattered about before, during and after the typical E3 scheduled week.</p>
<p>Opinions have always been mixed on the newer methods of announcement delivery with some liking its wider and longer lasting presence during June and others seeing it as messy and too thinly spread. Regardless of opinion though, there's little denying the impact these events have across the summer; gamers are watching in anticipation much like they used to with a conference from one of the platform holders at E3.</p>
<p>With so many options for publishers and developers in which to announce or show off their new and exciting title, where should they turn? Who is going to provide them with not just the most sets of eyes but more importantly an engaged audience? That has been and continues to be the million–dollar question.</p>
<blockquote><p>More games in a show sounds great to consumers, but it makes things especially tough from games businesses</p></blockquote>
<p>At the end of the day, these events are about one thing: exposure. Whether that's with press going hands on, influencers reacting to shows and reveals or just general discussion over social media, the hope of each event is that it acts as a catalyst to generate attention. This summer was particularly busy with events big and small, so snatching that spotlight and standing out from the crowd has been no easy feat (much like it wasn't when E3 was still a thing). However, instead of a condensed few days, shows are now spread out across several weeks.</p>
<p>Comparing several June events, Fancensus analysed every featured game, measuring its overall PR and social flare score achieved up to 72 hours after each respective event. This score out of 100, combines a game's performance across around 3,000 websites, plus channels across YouTube, TikTok, Instagram and X. Everything was analysed, from front page placement on websites and video views to X interactions and YouTube engagement rate, weighing each outlet based on its impact on a title's campaign.</p>
<p>A score of 100 on a game, for example, would mean that essentially it dominated every single metric on all five channels (website, YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and X) – highly unlikely but not impossible with Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 the only close candidate scoring in the 90s. Doing this not only allows for a fair comparison across hundreds of titles, but considers multiple outlets all key to raising their awareness with consumers.</p>

<p>For starters, looking at the shows overall, Xbox Games Showcase and Summer Game Fest have the highest sum total flare scores between all their featured titles. On paper that sounds great for both – after all, they've scored well over double that of any other competing shows this summer so far. However, when you account for the total number of games featured in said shows, that statistic becomes less impressive for Summer Game Fest.</p>
<p>Last year's The Game Awards saw its number of featured titles increase by 50% year-on-year to over 60, with Summer Game Fest following suit with a similar count and increase. With that in mind, the average press and social flare score per game would wind up falling to just 8.7 out of 100, placing it well behind all three platform holder shows and the Ubisoft Forward. So while, as an event, it may have seen its games shine bright collectively, individually they would tend to struggle to grab the spotlight.</p>
<p>A survey of over 1,300 US and UK regular PC and console gamers conducted by Fancensus, would ask which gaming events they were aware of and watched or were interested in, with the feedback generally showing they were more aware and willing to watch platform holder streams from Nintendo, Xbox and PlayStation, aligning with the trend of content produced on websites and social media.</p>

<p>Not only that but of Geoff Keighley's three major events across the year, Summer Game Fest and Gamescom Opening Night Live ranked tenth and twelfth respectively, with just under 50% of those surveyed aware of the latter and half of those interested in watching. Clearly, consumer expectation for Keighley's shows is highest for The Game Awards, with little in the way of competition in December and the bigger announcements usually expected. However, while enthusiasm toward ONL and Summer Game Fest may not be as high for gamers when compared with other competing events, it's tough to deny that the shows still do big numbers for some of its featured titles.</p>
<p>All this tracks too with the data IGN revealed recently for the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/astro-bot-beats-doom-as-the-no1-wishlisted-game-of-the-summer-games-showcases">highest wishlisted games from any shows this June</a>, five of those featured in the Xbox Games Showcase, three from the Nintendo Direct, the bursting-with-creativity Astro Bot from the State of Play, and Assassin's Creed Shadows, which appeared in both the Xbox Games Showcase as well as Ubisoft Forward. Any games shown in shows outside the three platform holders it would seem didn't resonate as strongly with IGN visitors.</p>

<p>Breaking things down to the games themselves, it's clear that Xbox had a very strong showing, accounting for half those featured in the top ten when ranked by flare score. Not only that, it would also see 17 of its featured titles within the top fifty performers, the highest of any show and around 55% of all Xbox Games Showcase games.</p>
<p>The State of Play, meanwhile – an event that back in May was met with a relatively lukewarm reception from gamers – performed admirably too with ten of its 14 featured titles making the top fifty list.</p>
<p>As for Summer Game Fest, with such a large quantity of titles, 14 would find themselves scoring among the top fifty performers; not an amazing proportion of its 61 but still making some noticeable waves online. It's worth noting though, that of the four games from its show ranking 20 or higher, these included two games currently out (Street Fighter 6 and Valorant), the world premiere of LEGO Horizon Adventures, and Star Wars: Outlaws, whose tease performed lower than the gameplay reveal of the Ubisoft Forward several days later.</p>

<p>While more games in a show might sound great from a consumer standpoint, it often makes things especially tough from a business one as the quantity of competition is so much higher. It can also result in a case of there being too much to remember, evidenced in my conversations just days after the Summer Game Fest or Future Games Show where friends would struggle to name off more than two or three standouts. Compare that with June's Nintendo Direct or Xbox Games Showcase and suddenly they'd recite off game after game as if they were some sort of Broadway stage actor.</p>
<p>It sounds silly but sometimes you can have too much of a good thing. Of those surveyed by Fancensus who watched all or some of Summer Game Fest 2024, the top performing title from the show achieved less than a 50% recall rate with other big AAA titles seeing rates in the 30s, a sign perhaps that too many games can overwhelm.</p>

<figcaption>AAA games like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 dominated consumer attention</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's unsurprising but nearly half of the top fifty consisted of AAA titles, with a further 36% A–tier. That meant mid–tier and indie accounted for just 16% and 2% respectively. As a result, Future Games Show and PC Gaming Show – two shows that tend to focus on smaller projects – would see none of their feature games score among the top fifty titles overall.</p>
<p>It was clear from the shows that the platform holders were more focused on bigger titles, proof that their consoles have big things to look forward to, and as a result indie games felt like they fell by the wayside. It would be Keighley then that would deliver on the indie front, accounting for 24 of the show's 60 titles and even going so far as to open the show highlighting the success smaller studios have had in 2024.</p>

<p>And while its great these smaller releases would get their moment on such a large platform, looking at the noise created with press and social, flare scores for indie titles scored an average of five out of 100 versus the seven, eight and 11 of Nintendo, Xbox and PlayStation shows.</p>
<p>In fact, the Summer Game Fest average flare score was closer to Future Games Show and PC Gaming Show. It's a similar story with mid–tier titles as well; Summer Game Fest was sandwiched between the platform holder shows and the smaller PC Gaming Show and Future Games Show. Considering the expense of even a 30-second slot in Summer Game Fest it does raise the question: if you're a smaller publisher or developer, would you be better off utilising the smaller shows, potentially producing similar results?</p>
<blockquote><p>If you're a smaller publisher or developer, would you be better off utilising the smaller shows?</p></blockquote>
<p>Even the aided recall rate of Summer Game Fest titles for gamers who watched the show would reveal the best performing mid–tier or indie title as Killer Bean with 23% while indie titles in general would fall as low as 8%.</p>
<p>2024 has certainly been interesting for the 'unofficial E3' period. After the so–so State of Play in May and Keighley's expectation–lowering talk on a stream before Summer Game Fest, many expected a quieter June with smaller announcements and little in the way of surprises. What followed could be described as anything but, with some journalists even claiming some shows like the Xbox Game Showcase summoned feelings of old E3 again. It saw platform holders relying on themselves to reach their fans, shows like Future Games Show, PC Gaming Show and plenty more offer a stage for smaller studios and bigger companies hedge their bets between multiple.</p>
<p>The result has been interesting to watch unfold, showing how big publishers can yield strong results from simply doing their own thing, while indies and mid–tier titles hit their audience through cheaper shows. Summer Game Fest finds itself in a rather unique spot upping its quantity of titles but not necessarily their impact, whilst delivering quieter results for the smaller projects it set its focus to.</p>
<p>Next year will likely continue to see the same options available to publishers and developers, but perhaps the main takeaway here is that the biggest and loudest show with the most charismatic presenter may not be the one for you.</p>

			<p>Aarik and The Ruined Kingdom wraps up the mystery of a kingdom fallen into ruin in an isometric, perspective-shifting puzzle game. Taking control of Aarik, you have to find a path through the mystery which has seen your father, the King, become bedbound and your mother, the Queen, disappear on her own quest to save the kingdom.</p>

<p>The debut title from Shatterproof Games, Aarik and The Ruined Kingdom uses a number of different mechanisms for its puzzles, including perspective shifting, time manipulation, and object control, allowing for the levels to offer different challenges, though none of them are too difficult to solve. That level simplicity feeds into what appears to be Shatterproof’s aim of creating a relaxing and cosy puzzle game that will entertain rather than tax your brain too much. That isn’t to say there aren’t some headscratchers thrown in, but you should be able to complete the game within a few hours.</p>


<p>The game will draw comparisons to others that have populated the genre, most notably the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/31/monument-valley-pc-panoramic-collection-release-date-12-july/">Monument Valley</a> games, but Aarik and The Ruined Kingdom has a whimsical charm of its own and moments of comedy interspersed throughout. While there is not much dialogue in the game, when it is present it nicely moves the story along and helps build the world just enough to allow you to fill in some of the blanks, but never all of them.</p>


<p>Aarik’s powers come from gems that are embedded in his father’s crown. None of the gems are present at the start of the game, and it is only through going through the levels that each gem is found, unlocking a new power for Aarik to use. The perspective shifting is there from the start. With this you change the angle from which you view the puzzle, and doing so can create paths that Aarik can walk along, or find objects that were previously hidden from view, like the hidden crowns dotted in every level. The first gem you get then allows Aarik to move objects via telekinesis to move objects that help create or open paths up. That is soon followed by the power to turn gears and wheels, then an ability to control robots to get their assistance to solve the more complex puzzles, and changing the course of time to rebuild ruins and shift the sands. Each of these powers compliments the other, with the latter puzzles using a mix of all of these elements to really create fun brain teasers.</p>
<p>You cannot fault the visual design of Aarik and The Ruined Kingdom. It looks lovely with very well thought out puzzles in a vibrantly colourful world. As you traverse the world you see the ruin that has engulfed it, yet there is always this sense of underlying hope that it can be rebuilt and saved. The music is well composed too, lending itself to the relaxing and cosy atmosphere that the game evokes.</p>

<p>While Aarik and The Ruined Kingdom is fun, it is not without some issues and gripes. One of those is how finicky it can be to place objects in the correct place. Even if you think you have everything lined up, you cannot always tell for certain. If you’re wrong the object will go back to where you originally picked it up from. Some feedback in these scenarios would be welcome, even if it is as basic as a click sound to indicate a connection has been made. There is also a puzzle where you need to move barrels out of the way physically to open a path, but there is no animation or prompt that indicates that at first. It was the only time in the game that Aarik had to physically walk into something to move it out of the way. Another bug was movement sounds playing when robots/objects under your control had seized moving.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Aarik and The Ruined Kingdom is a well crafted and great looking puzzle game that entertains for its 2-3 hour playtime. It is let down by various bugs, like sounds playing unprompted, and the issue of placing objects being more cumbersome than it needs to be. However, for less than £7 it is worth a playthrough if you enjoy perspective shifting puzzle games.	</p></div>
