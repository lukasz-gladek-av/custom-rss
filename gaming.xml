As Mario, pilot your spaceship at the gate of the Alleyway and destroy the space grids by deflecting the energy ball toward them. Keep your vessel moving and the ball in play until every block has been cleared to finish the stage. As you progress through each level, you’ll be confronted with the challenge of alternating stages, bonus rounds and more. Speed and quick reflexes will become your strongest allies as you reach to beat the top score. You’re in command in the Alleyway.</li><li><strong><em>Baseball</em></strong> – Pitch in and batter up in this 1989 Game Boy classic. As the pitching team, deliver a series of fastballs while adjusting curve and speed—but be careful not to wear out your pitcher. If the batter connects, your outfield or infield can back you up. Strike out the opposing team, and it’s your turn at offense. As the batting team, shift your batter on the home plate and time their swing at the incoming ball. Try to safely reach the next base, or score for a home run. Strategize your team’s moves and lead your team to victory. Play ball!</li><li><strong><em>Super Mario Land</em></strong> – Relive Mario’s first Game Boy <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,466 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>! Obstacles and enemies of all sorts await you in the scenic kingdoms of Sarasaland, where you’ll travel through ancient ruins, stay afloat in tempestuous waters and navigate challenges aplenty. As Mario, you’ll run, jump and bounce your way to glory on his mission to save Princess Daisy (in her first appearance!) from a mysterious alien and restore peace to the land. This game features some distinct gameplay quirks to discover too, including the Superball Mario powerup and even levels where Mario pilots an airplane and submarine.</li></ul></blockquote><p>In Japan, <em>Kaeru no Tame ni Kane wa Naru</em> was also added to the <em>Game Boy – Nintendo Switch Online</em> app.</p><!-- AD: content -->

That's why you might want to jump on the deal Walmart is currently running. The retailer is offering <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FKirby-Star-Allies-Nintendo-Switch%2F909816989%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-your-kirby-fix-with-this-extremely-good-deal-on-kirby-star-allies-for-nintendo-switch%2F1100-6523451%2F%3Fcomment_page%3D1&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kirby Star Allies </a>for $30, half its $60 list price, and the lowest price Walmart has ever offered for the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Setting Kirby Star Allies apart from other games in the series is that the "allies" part is literal--while other Kirby games have also offered cooperative play, Star Allies makes co-op a major focus. You'll get the usual enemy-eating, power-stealing, platform-jumping gameplay Kirby is known for, but with an emphasis on recruiting enemies to your side along the way. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kirby-star-allies-review-take-it-easy/1900-6416874/">GameSpot's Peter Brown gave the game an 8</a> when it released, saying, "Star Allies is yet another Kirby game, but it's up there with some of the best. It's an artistic showcase, and a great opportunity for co-op platforming."</p><p dir="ltr">That's not the only Kirby Switch game that Walmart is offering on sale, although Star Allies has the best discount.

While some of the presets are engineered to enhance the audio experience overall, others are tuned to heighten specific elements of the sound mix--like one Call of Duty preset that makes it easier to hear enemy footsteps. The companion app is exclusive to the trio of Nova 5 headsets; it does not work with other headsets in the Nova line.</p><p dir="ltr">Usually, you would need to be using a headset on PC with a proprietary desktop app to use audio customization features like this, but since the Arctis Nova 5 supports both 2.4GHz and Bluetooth wireless connectivity, you can connect it to your PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, or PC via the 2.4GHz dongle and your smartphone over Bluetooth, so the mobile app is always available to you. The headset is also equipped with a connection hot-swap button, so you can switch between 2.4GHz and Bluetooth audio sources at will.</p><p dir="ltr">Along with the app and multiple connection options, the Nova 5 also has a noise-canceling microphone that fully retracts into the left earcup, and sports up to 60 hours of battery life and has fast charging via the included USB-C cable.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4303078-nova5hero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4303078" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4303078-nova5hero.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4303078"></a><figcaption>SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5, 5P, and 5X</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4303078-nova5hero.jpg"></figure><p>The Arctis Nova 5 headset is now available in three different models: the Nova 5, Nova 5P, and Nova 5X.

I've been a fan of the Arctis headsets since the original Arctis Pro launched back in 2018, and the Nova 5 is a great addition to the lineup. While the Nova Pro is packed with high-end features and the Nova 7 is still <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-ps5-headset/1100-6482578/" data-ref-id="1100-6482578">our favorite gaming headset overall</a>, the Nova 5 maintains the fundamentals that make the entire Arctis Nova line so appealing. Most importantly, the sound quality is excellent. While they sound great out of the box, switching to a preset for the game you're playing--or at least one with similar audio presentation--in the new mobile companion app does make a marked difference in the listening experience, and is by far the Nova 5's standout feature.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the other reasons the Arctis Nova headset line is so well regarded is comfort. Like its siblings, the Nova 5 uses the ingenious headband strap design, which is the most comfortable form of headphone "padding" I've tested over the years. The Nova 5 is also slightly lighter than some of the more expensive Arctis models like the Nova Pro, making them even more comfortable and great for long-term use. That lighter build doesn't come at the cost of durability, either--the headband is flexible and the earcups feel sturdy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4303079-nova5companionapp.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4303079" data-ratio="0.552" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4303079-nova5companionapp.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4303079"></a><figcaption>Arctis Nova 5 companion app</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4303079-nova5companionapp.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If there's one minor misgiving I have about the Nova 5 so far, it's the app--or, more accurately, the concession made to make the app always available. While you technically can connect the Nova 5 to two devices at once--one via 2.4GHz and the other via Bluetooth--the only thing you can do with that simultaneous connection is adjust the app on your phone over Bluetooth while gaming on PC or console via 2.4GHz. You cannot listen to two audio sources at once. To be clear, I think the app is great; it's easy to navigate, and the streamlined audio presets are well-engineered. It's just a bummer the headset doesn't let you listen to a podcast from your phone at the same time you're playing a game on your PC or console, which is something most other headsets with simultaneous device connectivity support, including the Nova 7 and Nova Pro.</p><p dir="ltr">That said, the lack of simultaneous audio playback is by no means a dealbreaker, especially at this price range. If you've been eyeing an Arctis Nova headset but the pricing on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Headset/dp/B0B15QM5LL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nova 7</a> is just out of reach, then the Nova 5 is definitely worth checking out.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apple-ipad-pro-ipad-air-2024-preorder-guide/1100-6523258/">Preorder Apple's 2024 iPad Pro And iPad Air - How To Get The Best Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-preorder-guide-nintendo-switch/1100-6523267/">Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition Preorders Are Selling Out Fast</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-portal-restock-guide/1100-6520876/">PlayStation Portal Is Back In Stock At Multiple Major Retailers</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (3)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grab-7-awesome-dungeon-crawlers-for-only-15/1100-6523253/">Grab 7 Awesome Dungeon Crawlers For Only $15</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-deal-saves-you-over-50-for-12-month-membership/1100-6523230/">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate Deal Saves You Over $50 For 12-Month Membership</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-star-wars-and-marvel-disney-plus-blu-rays-have-arrived-but-you-may-want-to-order-soon/1100-6521604/">New Star Wars And Marvel Disney Plus Blu-Rays Have Arrived, But You May Want To Order Soon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<p>When EA Sports College Football 25 releases in July one key platform will be missing, PC. According to reliable <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ea-sports-college-football-25-on-vous-devoile-nos-informations-exclusives-a-propos-du-nouveau-jeu-de-football-americain-universitaire-a-venir-cet-ete-50532" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data miner billbil-kun</a>, the first college football video game in 11 years will only be available on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>In addition to no PC, the game won’t be available on last-gen Xbox One or PlayStation 4.</p>



<div>
<p>“College Football 25&nbsp;will be available only on&nbsp;PS5&nbsp;and&nbsp;Xbox Series X|S,” the report says. “It will therefore unfortunately not be available on PC, as the old games in the NCAA Football series were.”</p>



<figure></figure>
</div>



<p>Insider Gaming has learned that the plan from the start was for the game to be released on PC “at some point”. However, based on the state of the development of the first game, it appears to be slated for a future version of the game.</p>



<p>In addition to the reveal that the game won’t be on PC or last-gen systems, billbil-kun adds that the game will have three editions: Standard, Deluxe, and Collector’s. The official cover of the game will be revealed on Thursday, May 16.</p>



<p>Billbil-kun describes the game’s cover as follows:</p>



<p><em>“[W]e can see in this cover&nbsp;from left to right&nbsp;the following players seen from the front,&nbsp;Quinn Ewers&nbsp;of Texas carrying an American football,&nbsp;Travis Hunter&nbsp;of Colorado and&nbsp;Donovan Edwards&nbsp;of Michigan. In addition, these players, all&nbsp;smiles, are in the center of a stadium empty of supporters.”</em></p>



<p>EA Sports has yet to confirm the platforms for EA Sports College Football 25. It’s other football franchise, Madden NFL, is available on PC and is par with the current-gen console versions.</p>

For those who have not touched those games, Echoes are like item drops that come with various sets of stats, all of which directly influence how powerful your characters are. Every Echo comes with a <strong>Main Stat</strong>, the stat with the highest value, and several <strong>Sub Stats</strong>, secondary stats with lower values. Typically, when building your characters in <em>Wuthering Waves</em><strong>, </strong>you want to make sure you’re using the correct Main Stats for an Echo before even looking at the Sub Stats. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wuthering-Waves-Echoes-Guide-Add-1.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image via Kuro Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="515" data-current-count="815" data-injectable="true">Beyond stats, Echoes also double as additional abilities you can equip on your characters. The top-most slot for an Echo, on a character, determines which Echo active ability you can use since you equip up to five Echoes on a character at any given time. Echo abilities vary greatly, from support healing to damage buffing, to raw damage in general. There is a large assortment of Echo Abilities to choose from in <em>Wuthering Wave</em>, and you’ll want to make good use of these for the game’s hardest content.</p>
 <h3 id="h-echo-values" data-injectable="false">Echo Values</h3> <p data-characters="513" data-current-count="513" data-injectable="true">While you can equip several Echoes at a time on any given character, you are limited on which ones can all be equipped at the same time. Every Echo in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> comes with a cost value number that determines its stat range. The higher the number, the better the stats will be on the Echo. However, the downside to this is that you cannot equip too many high-cost Echoes, because you’ll too quickly reach the Echo value cap, and will be missing stats due to being unable to equip an Echo in every slot.</p>
 <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="434" data-injectable="true">To combat this, you’ll want to make sure you never exceed the value cap by ensuring you have an Echo in every single slot. This means using lower-value Echos if need be. If you have even one Echo slot with no Echo equipped, you’ll be greatly weakening your character’s overall strength. The Echo value cap is determined by your progression in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> and will be increased over time as you continue playing. </p>
 <h3 id="h-echo-rarities" data-injectable="false">Echo Rarities</h3> <p data-characters="242" data-current-count="242" data-injectable="false">While all Echoes come with a value number attached that determines their stat range, an Echo’s rarity further boosts that range, allowing you to level them up further, the higher their rarity. There are five rarities in <em>Wuthering Waves.</em></p> <figure data-current-count="542" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wuthering-Waves-Echoes-Guide-Add-2.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image via Kuro Games</figcaption></figure>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Common</strong> <strong>– </strong>Highlighted in Gray</li> <li><strong>Uncommon</strong> <strong>– </strong>Highlighted in Green</li> <li><strong>Rare</strong> <strong>– </strong>Highlighted in Blue</li> <li><strong>Epic</strong> <strong>–</strong> Highlighted in Purple</li> <li><strong>Legendary</strong> <strong>– </strong>Highlighted in Yellow</li> </ul> <p data-characters="370" data-current-count="570" data-injectable="true">When you begin <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, you’ll be using Common and Uncommon rarity Echoes for a good portion of your initial experience. As your account levels up, higher rarity Echoes will automatically begin to drop for you. Eventually, you’ll want to make sure all of your characters are glad in <strong>Legendary</strong> rarity Echoes, as they offer the best stats in the game. </p>
 <h3 id="h-echo-abilities" data-injectable="false">Echo Abilities</h3> <p data-characters="466" data-current-count="466" data-injectable="true">As mentioned already, every Echo you obtain will come with a unique ability to that Echo. <strong>All</strong> of these abilities are active, meaning you’ll need to press them for them to have any effect. In relation to Echo Value, the power of an Echo ability tends to be determined by how high or low the value of it is. For example, a Value One Echo will have a weak ability with a very short cooldown and a Value Four Echo will have a powerful ability with a long cooldown.</p>
 <h3 id="h-echo-set-bonuses" data-injectable="false">Echo Set Bonuses</h3> <p data-characters="452" data-current-count="452" data-injectable="true">All Echos, regardless of Rarity will also have a set bonus attached to it. A set bonus grants the equipped character additional bonus effects if they are using Echos that belong to the same set. You’ll be able to determine this by looking at the Echo and viewing its set bonus. You’ll know you’re getting a set bonus effect if the bonus on the Echo is lit up <strong>Green</strong>. If you’re not getting the effect, it will appear <strong>Grey </strong>instead.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wuthering-Waves-Echoes-Guide-Add-3.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image via Kuro Games</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-how-to-get-echoes-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">How to get Echoes in <em>Wuthering Waves</em></h2> <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="706" data-injectable="true">Normally, in Gacha games, items like Echoes are obtained by using your precious Stamina resource in a short, specific dungeon. However, <em>Wuthering Waves</em> does away with this limitation, allowing you to farm Echoes for free from the Overworld. This is fantastic because you always have something productive to do in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> when you’re out of Stamina. This does come at a separate cost, however.</p>
 <p data-characters="471" data-current-count="471" data-injectable="true"><strong>Every Echo you obtain will come from an enemy you slay in the Overworld</strong>. When an enemy is killed, they have a chance, based on your Account Level (think Adventure Rank), to leave an afterimage of themselves behind. When you see this, walk up to it, and absorb it to receive an ‘Echo’ of that enemy. This has no actual cost, so you can, theoretically, farm up as many Echoes as you’d like. However, a couple of things do prevent you from farming forever.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wuthering-Waves-Echoes-Guide-Add-4.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image via Kuro Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="675" data-injectable="true">Firstly, there are a finite amount of enemies in the Overworld, so you can actually kill off everything and have nothing left to free farm, excluding boss encounters. Now, this would take some serious dedication to do, as the Overworld of Wuthering Waves is rather large and packed full of enemies around every corner. However, a dedicated player will be able to pull it off.</p>
 <p data-characters="472" data-current-count="472" data-injectable="false">Secondly, even though you can freely farm Echoes, in order to unlock their Sub Stats, you’ll need to use an item called a<strong> Tuner</strong>. You’ll be given a very large amount of Tuners initially just playing through <strong>Wuthering Waves</strong>‘ main story and side quests, but eventually, you’ll run out and need to farm them from the dedicated dungeon that drops them. Naturally, this dungeon requires you to use your Stamina; it’s a bummer, but it is what it is.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/xcom-the-sims-veterans-found-midsummer-studios-a-new-team-tackling-the-life-sim-genre/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xcom-the-sims-veterans-found-midsummer-studios-a-new-team-tackling-the-life-sim-genre<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="335" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’ve followed PC strategy games for a while, you may recognize names like Jake Solomon, Will Miller, and Grant Rodiek. You’re certainly familiar with the games on their resumes; Solomon helmed the <em>XCOM </em>franchise for years, and collaborated with Miller on <em>Marvel’s Midnight Suns</em>, while Rodiek hails from <em>The Sims</em>.</p> <p data-characters="181" data-current-count="181" data-injectable="false">These three, alongside COO/CFO Nelsie Birch, have founded Midsummer Studios, a new developer looking to break into the life sim genre. Yes, it’s some competition for <em>The Sims</em>.</p> <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="596" data-injectable="true">Formally announced today, Solomon will be CEO and Creative Director, Miller will be Game Director, and Rodiek will be Executive Producer on an as-yet-unnamed project. The pitch? Well, it’s all about life. Speaking to Solomon ahead of the official reveal, the CEO tells me their company name came from both his own life, experiencing midsummer festivals, and wanting something “welcoming and warm.”</p>
 <h2 id="h-a-new-venture" data-injectable="false">A new venture</h2> <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="269" data-injectable="false">Midsummer is starting small, having just about 11 people at the moment. There’s some talent here, from Firaxis. And when I asked Solomon about starting a new studio in the current industry conditions, he notes how <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/gta-publisher-take-two-is-laying-off-five-percent-of-staff-a-few-months-after-saying-it-had-no-current-plans-for-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rough layoffs</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/the-game-industry-is-fed-indie-devs-are-dying-off-because-getting-funding-is-a-battlefield-right-now-even-for-critically-acclaimed-veterans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">funding restrictions</a> have been.</p> <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="604" data-injectable="true">For Midsummer, the company is opting for venture capital, with $6 million raised from investors so ar, including Transcend Fund, Tirta Ventures, Betaworks Ventures, 1Up Ventures, F4 Fund, Krafton, and Day Zero Productions. Additionally, Midsummer is establishing some policies up-front: unlimited PTO, and shared equity in the company.</p>
 <p data-characters="538" data-current-count="538" data-injectable="true">“I think it just makes sense,” Solomon told me. “I think that a new game studio is a start-up. I know they don’t all work like this, but we just kind of viewed it as, the people who are joining us are taking a risk, for sure. Even if we’ve worked together for a long time, we’re a small studio. We, you know, haven’t done anything. So for people to join us, they’re taking a risk. We’re the lucky ones to have them. So I think it made sense to say, anybody who joins the studio is going to get equity.”</p>
 <h2 id="h-a-day-in-the-life" data-injectable="false">A day in the life</h2> <p data-characters="227" data-current-count="227" data-injectable="false">So why a life sim? Well, in some ways, it felt natural. <em>XCOM </em>does lend itself to some systems-driven storytelling, after all, and the <em>War of the Chosen </em>DLC for <em>XCOM 2 </em>leaned further into those ideas with bonds between soldiers.</p> <p data-characters="391" data-current-count="618" data-injectable="true">“Genuinely, what happened was, I made <em>XCOM</em> and I loved <em>XCOM</em>,” said Solomon. “And one of my favorite parts of it was <em>XCOM</em> was like, player-driven narrative. We had a very thin narrative in <em>XCOM</em>, but really, the story was the ones you made up with your soldiers, and how they survived, and the choices they made. And there’s a lot of head-canon, a lot of projecting.”</p>
 <p data-characters="409" data-current-count="409" data-injectable="true">As Solomon iterated on this, a modern life sim looked like the right answer for how to keep pursuing that. The unnamed sim is set in a “small town,” where everyone has lines connecting their lives, whether through family, friendship, romance, rivalry, or other situations. The creative director remarks that, from Stephen King to <em>Gilmore Girls</em>, small towns are a recurring setting in storytelling.</p>
 <p data-characters="245" data-current-count="245" data-injectable="false">The idea is to have the player manage drama, big and small, while going about their day. But in a broader sense, the angle is storytelling. There are “themes,” as Solomon describes, that the player will be able to establish early on.</p> <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="644" data-injectable="true">“I want it to be, I’m looking for my soulmate and the town is filled with wacky characters,” said Solomon. “Or I have a close group of friends, and I’m estranged from my family. I want to succeed in my business, and whatever. And the game goes oh, if you’re trying to tell that story, then I’m actually going to generate a cast of characters in the town to help you.”</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-power-of-creation" data-injectable="false">The power of creation</h2> <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="270" data-injectable="false">While you can set the framework, though, Solomon also says there will be a creative mode. The systems of this life sim will be open to storytelling, but also manipulation, whether that’s altering characters’ looks, moods, or tinkering with any other setting.</p> <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="600" data-injectable="true">Ultimately, Solomon points to those narratives and community as pillars of their project moving forward. It’s why it seems likely that Midsummer’s games will launch in early access—that’s just the plan now, though—and hear out feedback. It’s also why systems play a big role in talking about this game.</p>
 <p data-characters="234" data-current-count="234" data-injectable="false">“I think a game like this is like, half a toy,” Solomon tells me. “That’s probably what’s most different about this from other games that we’ve made, is that this one is at least half a toy, if not more.”</p> <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="585" data-injectable="true">That sort of creativity and freedom could lead to a burgeoning community, built up by word-of-mouth, sharing their stories and creations. The idea of creating a town, whether based around a compelling concept or a pre-existing set-up, veering into fan fiction, and sharing those with other players to have their own takes on the stories is compelling.</p>
 <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="297" data-injectable="false">We’ll have to see how Midsummer shakes up the life sim genre. While <em>The Sims </em>has long reigned supreme, new competitors seem to be emerging. And if it’s got a bit of the emergent storytelling I personally dug from games like <em>XCOM 2</em>, then I’m all ears for whatever the full reveal.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-gundam-breaker-4-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Bandai Namco is ready for a fresh start after the disappointment of New Gundam Breaker.</h2></div><section><p>It’s best not to put too much stock in Gundam Breaker 4’s name. Despite its title, it’s not the fourth game in the series. That honor goes to New Gundam Breaker, which Bandai Namco prefers to overlook due to its middling reviews and overall poor reputation with the fanbase. Instead, <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/gundam-breaker-4-official-announcement-trailer-nintendo-direct-2024">Gundam Breaker 4 will be the fifth console release in the now decade-old series</a>, and what Bandai Namco hopes will be a fresh start for the franchise overall.</p><p>In an exclusive interview with IGN, Masanori Tanaka says that the team collected “a lot” of feedback from New Gundam Breaker before heading into Gundam Breaker 4. The main takeaway? Fans were confused about the number. But more importantly, they wanted the series to get back to what it did best: letting players smash up AI-controlled mobile suits to build up new and bizarre designs of their own.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“New Gundam Breaker was [player-versus-player] focused,” Tanaka explains. “Now we're actually focusing on PvE for Gundam Breaker 4. So that's a change that was made from the feedback…now we can focus on supporting the quality and letting the game evolve. So for example, the diorama mode [a new mode that lets you pose your models in various scenes] is one of those things. And just refining the action compared to the previous game.”</p><h2>Gundam Breaker gets back to basics</h2><p>First released on Playstation 3 and Vita back in 2013, Gundam Breaker earned a following by leaning into the franchise’s pervasive model culture, colloquially known as “Gunpla.” The series takes a traditional hack-and-slash approach to its gameplay, but what makes it stand out is the ability to mix-and-match parts from real-life model kits to create your own ridiculous designs. The unintentional hilarity of these digital kitbash creations taps into an enduring part of the Gundam subculture.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Now we can focus on supporting the quality and letting the game evolve</p></div><p>The series continued through three entries before getting a reboot of sorts with New Gundam Breaker. New Gundam Breaker was criticized for being unpolished and for stripping down the customization and story, hence the return to numbered entries. With Gundam Breaker 4, Bandai Namco is eager to emphasize that it has heard fan feedback and that it is returning to what worked by pivoting back to a more single-player focused experience and optional co-op.</p><p>Among other things, the customization has been beefed up, including adding the ability to dual wield one-handed weapons and equip different arms. To emphasize the enhancements to the customization, Kentaro Matano shows off his own creation – a monstrous pink Ball with a bear head, Neo-Zeong legs, and claws.</p><p>“So as you saw, you could change the background, highly customizable, different colors. You can also add weathering which we weren't even able to show you,” Matano says, referencing a popular technique used by model-builders to add realism to their designs. “So there's just really vast amounts of combinations that users can just let their creativity just run wild. So those are really the focus.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/14/cute-3-1715715732430.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Gundam Breaker fans will have plenty of options in the new release.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Players will have plenty of parts to choose from. With Witch From Mercury proving popular with fans on both sides of the Pacific, Gundam Breaker 4 will feature the Gundam Aerial and Daribalde in what will be the largest roster of models to date, as well as a full English dub.</p><h2>Technical trade-offs on Switch</h2><p>Notably, Gundam Breaker 4 will mark the franchise’s debut on the Nintendo Switch after mostly sticking with PlayStation (it’s also releasing on PS4, PS5, and Steam). Asked if there are any technical compromises fans can expect, Tanaka says it will mostly feature a lower framerate, subsequently clarifying that it will be 60fps on PS5 and 30fps on Nintendo Switch..</p><p>“I believe the only major technical thing you might see on the Switch is just a different framerate compared to the other platforms,” Tanaka explains. “It might be a slightly different experience compared to a different platform so that our fans can be able to play with the understanding of what they will get on the different platforms. But overall, just the actual gameplay itself, it won’t be a huge difference.”</p><p>One way or another, it will be a fresh start for Gundam Breaker 4 as it seeks to reestablish itself with old fans and new fans alike. “We want our fans to really take in Gundam Breaker 4,” says Matano, “because we read everything, we read all the feedback…to create the next generation, the next game with everyone's feedback."</p><p>Gundam Breaker 4 will release August 29 on Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, and PC.

The game was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2023/2023/12/07/the-casting-of-frank-stone-is-supermassives-single-player-horror">first announced</a> at the 2023 Game Awards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The story unfolds in 1980 in the town of Cedar Hills, a town scarred by the murderous killer Frank Stone. It stars four friends who set out to create a horror film at a derelict steel mill dubbed Murder Mill. Naturally, that goes as horribly as you’d imagine, and players must survive by making choices that decide the characters’ relationships and fates. Sudden quick-time events can also be the deciding factor between whether someone lives or dies.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O1xixINNd6I" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Similar to Supermassive’s previous titles like The Quarry and the Dark Pictures Anthology, The Casting of Frank Stone can go down multiple paths based on your choices. Players will also solve environmental puzzles and gather clues to learn more about Cedar Hills</p>

<p>The Casting of Frank Stone still has no release date, but it will launch later this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/hades-2-boon-elements-how-they-work-and-best-infusions/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=hades-2-boon-elements-how-they-work-and-best-infusions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="242" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Early on during your adventures in <em>Hades 2</em>, you learn about elements and how they relate to the godly boons you so often hoover up. <em>Hades 2</em> Boon Elements offer you a new way to grow stronger with Infusions, and the best ones may help you win.</p> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false">It doesn’t take long for elements to appear in <em>Hades 2.</em> By the time you summon the Fated List of Minor Prophecies, the incantation you require should appear in the Cauldron menu. <strong>It’s called ‘Divination of the Elements’, and it costs a mere 5 Psyche to activate</strong>. Once you do, boons offered by your Olympian kin will bear the mark of an element. </p> <h2 id="h-hades-2-boon-elements-explained" data-injectable="false"><em>Hades 2</em> Boon Elements explained</h2> <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="690" data-injectable="true"><strong>Once you can see the elemental affinity of boons, you’ll notice small symbols appearing on the top-right corners of their icons</strong>. These icons represent the typical elements we all know: Earth, Fire, Water, and Air. Picking a boon with an element adds it to the list, which you can see by opening your boon info menu.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="393" data-current-count="693" data-injectable="true"><strong>Boon Elements work by stacking them up and activating a new type of boon called an Infusion</strong>. You can find Infusion boons even if you don’t have enough elements stacked, but once you do, it becomes activated automatically. Each god has their own Infusion boon, often requiring a set amount of elements before working. They can increase damage or health, or offer some other kind of buff. </p>
 <p data-characters="371" data-current-count="371" data-injectable="false"><strong>Every god in <em>Hades 2</em> offers you boons tied to an element</strong>. For the most part, the kind of elements you get from the various gods makes logical sense. Poseidon, for example, offers Water boons. Hestia, on the other hand, deals mostly with Fire. But some combine elements, such as Hephaestus who dishes out Earth and Fire boons. Hermes offers a mix of Air, Earth, and Fire. </p> <figure data-current-count="671" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="304" data-current-count="304" data-injectable="false"><strong>You can also find elements out in the wild</strong>. The City of Ephyra on the surface includes Locations that, when completed, sometimes have optional doors to clear. These doors also offer up some kind of smaller reward, such as Psyche or Gold Crowns. But on rare occasions, you may find a tiny element appear. </p> <figure data-current-count="604" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-best-infusion-boons-in-hades-2" data-injectable="false">Best Infusion boons in <em>Hades 2</em></h2> <p data-characters="218" data-current-count="218" data-injectable="false"><strong>There aren’t many Infusion boons in <em>Hades 2</em>, and fewer are worth talking about</strong>. Most grant a small buff that’s worth taking, so long as you’ve stayed cognizant of what elements you’ve gathered. </p> <figure data-current-count="518" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="95" data-current-count="95" data-injectable="false">Regardless, the best Infusion Boons in <em>Hades 2</em> can actually help — maybe even save your life.</p> <figure data-found-rows="6" data-current-count="635" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th>God</th><th>Type</th><th>Infusion Boon</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Aphrodite</td><td>Air</td><td>Wispy Wiles</td><td>While you have at least <strong>4 Air</strong>, you gain a 15% chance to dodge any damage.</td></tr><tr><td>Apollo</td><td>Fire</td><td>Self Healing</td><td>While you have at least <strong>3 Fire</strong>, restore 30% life when you take damage.</td></tr><tr><td>Hera</td><td>Earth</td><td>Proper Upbringing</td><td>When you have at least <strong>3 Earth</strong>, all your Common Boons gain Rarity.</td></tr><tr><td>Hestia</td><td>Fire</td><td>Slow Cooker</td><td>Your Attacks and Specials gain Power for each <strong>Fire </strong>you have.</td></tr><tr><td>Hephaestus</td><td>Earth</td><td>Martial Art</td><td>Your Attack and Special deal more damage for each <strong>Earth</strong> you have.</td></tr><tr><td>Demeter</td><td>Earth</td><td>Coarse Grit</td><td>When you have at least <strong>6 Earth</strong>, you will not take more than 15 damage per hit.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="201" data-current-count="201" data-injectable="false">The amount of Infusion boons is rather sparse. But as you can glean from the list, some are certainly worth seeking out. Hopefully Poseidon can show up with something worth grabbing one of these days. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xdefiant-will-have-no-sbmm-in-casual-playlists.870852/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-no-sbmm-casual-playlists/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Ubisoft has confirmed that when XDefiant is released on May 21, it’ll have no SBMM mechanics applied to casual playlists. That means that unranked multiplayer modes won’t use skill-based matchmaking algorithms to ‘intelligently’ link players with one another. This was revealed by a post published on the Ubisoft website earlier today, with Ubisoft dubbing the lack of SBMM ‘paramount to a fun and varied game experience’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-size-of-this-w">The Size of This W</h2>



<p>SBMM has long been a sticking point for FPS fans worldwide. Many claim that SBMM ruins the entertainment value of a shooter, shoehorning players into more challenging situations than they’d like whenever they get on a hot streak in a game. It can be argued that Call of Duty is the most notorious series when it comes to SBMM ruining the fun, but other shooters have applied SBMM algorithms to their multiplayer platforms over the years.</p>



<p>It’s typically something that people would rather have confined to ranked playlists and not casual ones. After all, the clue is in the name: ‘casual’. Most people aren’t getting on for a game or two here and there and wanting to be matched against semi-pro players in public lobbies.</p>



<p>Here’s <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-ca/game/xdefiant/news/73QFbfzYxQbbL4ua8DValH/matchmaking-in-xdefiant#:~:text=The%20most%20important%20thing%20to,experience%20in%20the%20long%2Dterm." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the full statement from Ubisoft</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The most important thing to know is-&nbsp;<strong>there is no skill-based matchmaking in our casual playlist.</strong>&nbsp;We believe that no SBMM is paramount to a fun and varied game experience in the long-term. Frankly, skill-based match making means every casual game is repetitive- constantly repeating matches that are just as stressful and matched as ranked. We believe casual playlist should be fun and no SBMM is the way to do that. If you want that competitive every second counts go all out playstyle – you’ll find our ranked mode to your liking.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There are some elements that’ll determine who you play against, though.</p>



<p>For instance, casual play will study your region, latency, any avoided players, your party size, input device, and platform – all natural things that you’d expect to be considered when matchmaking against other users. For Ranked Play, Ubisoft’s platform will also look at ‘Rank Points’. </p>



<p>It was noted that once all the players are assembled in a lobby, there will be a tweak applied to balance the lobbies – that’s as far as it goes. It was also confirmed that XDefiant will feature persistent lobbies, which means you’ll stay with who you’re matched with in the first place – if you choose to, that is.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-pc-psn-crossplay-beta-launch-steam-deck-optimized/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/ghost-of-tsushima/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut</a> arrives on PC this week, and port developer Nixxes has laid out a few additional details about the launch. As we’ve reported, Ghost of Tsushima is the latest Sony-published title to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-pc-delisted-steam-psn-despite-singleplayer-not-needing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generate controversy for requiring a PlayStation Network sign-in on PC</a>. Granted, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-pc-psn-account-single-player/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GoT only requires PSN on PC for the Legends multiplayer mode</a>, you can play the single-player campaign without it, but the game has still been delisted from Steam in a long list of countries without access to PSN.</p>
<p>Well, interestingly, Nixxes now claims that Ghost of Tsushima PC-console crossplay, presumably the main reason a PSN sign-in is required, <a href="https://twitter.com/NixxesSoftware/article/1790396884873355624" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will launch in “beta.”</a></p>
<p><em>“As previously announced, Legends co-op multiplayer mode will include cross-play between players on PS4 consoles, PS5 consoles and PC. Legends will be functional on PC at launch, but you won't be automatically matched with players on different platforms. Cross-play will launch in beta, meaning you can try it out by inviting your PlayStation Network friends.”</em></p>
<p>As may have pointed out, it feels like this could be Sony providing themselves an out – if there’s too much backlash to PSN, they can simply remove the PSN requirement as they move crossplay out of beta without having to officially backtrack.</p>
<p>In another oddity related to PSN, Nixxes claims they’ve fully optimized Ghost of Tsushima for Steam Deck and other portable gaming PCs, but the game is still listed as “unsupported” because, you guessed it, accessing PSN requires Windows.</p>
<p><em>“We know many of you are eager to play Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut on handheld gaming devices like the Steam Deck. We're happy to share that the single player experience, including the Iki Island expansion, can be enjoyed on Steam Deck and similar handheld gaming PCs as we’ve worked extensively to optimize performance and deliver the best possible experience on these devices. You may notice that Steam marks the game as 'Unsupported' for Steam Deck. This is due to the Legends co-op multiplayer mode requiring Windows to access PlayStation Network integrated features.”</em></p>
<p>Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut launches on PC on May 16, and is currently available on PS4 and PS5.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/for-queen-review-pure-storytelling</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/for-the-queen-review-pure-storytelling.870831/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/for-queen-review-pure-storytelling<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's so interesting that when you pick up something that is a game you intrinsically think about winning, or competition, maybe points to keep track of. That's what I expected opening up <em>For The Queen</em>, a Storytelling Card Game by Alex Roberts. What I got though totally relaxed my definition of a game and I was so happy for it.</p>
<p><em>For The Queen</em> is an improvisational character and world-building game where questions are posed to you about a fictitious Queen and your relationship and history with them while you journey to a foreign land.</p>
<p>You can decide on the Queen you're travelling with from any of the twenty-five included Queens, or make up your own.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/for-the-queen-review-box-open.jpg?itok=VTlFi2-_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/for-the-queen-review-box-open.jpg?itok=pOz5UFsb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The box, designed to look like a book, opens to reveal the hook of the game and all of the cards</figcaption></figure><h2>Choose Your Queen</h2>
<p>I loved the selection of Queens. You have traditional Disney princess-styled queens, 21st-century pantsuit queens, high-fantasy, edo, and even futuristic Queens. While there are some Queens that immediately build a friendly aura, there are others that you likely wouldn't dare talk back on.</p>
<p>The game does recommend picking a Queen as a group, for a planned session with a theme and approach in mind this makes a lot of sense but I ended up enjoying letting fate decide by shuffling the Queens around and having to adapt.</p>
<p>Players will then begin to pull cards from the shuffled deck of questions. These questions will prod you with character and world-building questions forcing you to be introspective of a character you're creating on the fly.</p>

<p>Examples of these questions include "What question do you wish you could ask the Queen? What keeps you from asking it?", "The Queen trusts you, but no one else in the royal court does. Why?", or "What promise did the Queen make to you before this journey? Do you think she'll keep it?"</p>
<p>There are certainly no simple questions to be found in this box, and as you continue to build up the idea of who the players are and what kind of person their Queen is each question can become increasingly complex.</p>
<p>The tone of the game can also change as different players reveal new things. My answer to "What makes you want to abandon the retinue, and who, besides the Queen makes you stay?" was wildly influenced after another player revealed something they had been ordered to do by the Queen that they regretted.</p>
<h2>The Unplayed Character of <em>For The Queen</em></h2>
<p>The focus of the game, the Queen, is an unrepresented entity at the table and is shaped by the stories. I was really intrigued by a narrative game about a character that's a blank slate for everyone to craft in their own way. The same Queen may end up entirely different depending on who you're playing the game with.</p>

<p>The game ends as the question "The Queen is under attack. Do you defend her?" is drawn. Each player makes their decision and with that the game is over.</p>
<p>Each game can last for as long as you wish to place the attack card into the deck making it as short as a 15-minute game, or it can go on for two hours.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><em>For The Queen</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Playing <em>For The Queen</em> was an incredibly refreshing experience. From it's lack of innate competitivity, to it's simple setup and premise this is a fun exercise in worldbuilding and introspection that I have yet to experience before.</p>
<p>Understandably if the idea of roleplay isn't something that you are a fan of then this certainly isn't going to move your dial, but if you're looking for a fun storytelling game that can be set up in seconds and that can have wildly different outcomes you should keep this in reach.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>

<p>
For The Queen is an entertaining Storytelling game that relies on roleplay and building up a world and characters through interesting prompts. While it did take a bit to wrap my head around the concept once we got to playing it was nothing but a unique experience. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

Though they feature totally different worlds, characters, and stories, they work together as almost narrative cousins in an inspiring and fascinating way.</p><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-ff7-review-1997-worth-playing-1851411735&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-ff7-review-1997-worth-playing-1851411735"><em>Final Fantasy VII</em>: The <em>Kotaku</em> Retro Review</a></span></p><p>Though they have their clear differences, I was always struck by how<em>FF7 and FF8 </em>operate on similar wavelengths. They tell similar stories—albeit with very different tones, and are both a fusion of science fiction and fantasy, utilizing the tech of the ‘90s with 3D models superimposed over pre-rendered backgrounds with fixed camera angles. Playing them often feels like a very similar experience. And, notably, both games feature characters who struggle with memory loss.</p><figure id="" data-id="c19af06cc8baa1146ed3a84bc3bc46bd" data-recommend-id="image://c19af06cc8baa1146ed3a84bc3bc46bd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cloud questions if his memories are a lie in Final Fantasy VII." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cloud questions if his memories are a lie in Final Fantasy VII." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c19af06cc8baa1146ed3a84bc3bc46bd" data-recommend-id="image://c19af06cc8baa1146ed3a84bc3bc46bd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cloud questions if his memories are a lie in Final Fantasy VII." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But whereas <em>FF7</em> puts its protagonist, Cloud, through crippling episodes of pain at the reemergence of his memories, <em>FF8</em> is far more gentle with its cast of orphans, almost as if it wants to imagine a better future and present for them than <em>FF7</em> affords its cast. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-8-ff8-worth-playing-remastered-1851417540&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-8-ff8-worth-playing-remastered-1851417540">Playing <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> In 2024: Everything You Need To Know</a></span></p><p><em>FF7</em>’s narrative often feels sinister at times, with bursts of static punctuating the frail mind of the aptly named Cloud Strife, with the menacing threats of the game’s antagonists Jenova and Sephiroth lurking behind every corner. Cloud is rarely afforded a moment to be a normal person, to have normal thoughts. Instead, he spends much of the game posing as someone he’s not. </p><figure id="" data-id="97746ae15a5cf09e4899a372c6aa15cb" data-recommend-id="image://97746ae15a5cf09e4899a372c6aa15cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jenova taunts Cloud by calling him a puppet." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jenova taunts Cloud by calling him a puppet." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="97746ae15a5cf09e4899a372c6aa15cb" data-recommend-id="image://97746ae15a5cf09e4899a372c6aa15cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jenova taunts Cloud by calling him a puppet." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While <em>FF8</em>’s characters have also lost their memories, they’re allowed more space to be themselves. Protagonist Squall’s realizations and internal monologues are allowed to breathe and mentally wander. <em>FF8</em> features far more internal monologues, many of which document the characters working through difficult and confusing situations. It’s something that Cloud is rarely afforded the opportunity to do. Squall’s thoughts are befitting of an awkward 17-year-old kid whose childhood memories have faded, as he’s forced to contend with a set of cosmic expectations that are hard to fully comprehend. Whereas Cloud emerges from a far more traumatic past, with sharp internal thoughts that quite literally wound him. Unpacking his memories is a violent ordeal, one that forces him, and his childhood friend Tifa, to go through a surreal and painful journey of recollection. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-ff7-aeris-aerith-death-ghost-1851476144&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-ff7-aeris-aerith-death-ghost-1851476144">Is This Aerith’s Ghost In The Original <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>?</a></span></p><p>In <em>FF8</em>, the pressures of the geo-political situation around Squall and the other characters are intimidating, no doubt, but the tone is wildly different. This is especially true of the moment the characters regain their memories of themselves and each other.</p><p><em>FF7</em>’s biggest tragedy is impactful, sharp, and harrowing, featuring the irreversible death of a character. <em>FF8</em> feels like it wants to be kinder to its cast. Moments that could be a matter of life and death, such as deciding how to split the party when Galbadia launches missiles at Balamb Garden, don’t end in irreversible tragedy. <em>FF8</em>’s characters live to see each other again, and live to remember each other in a more gentle way. </p><figure id="" data-id="da9417ece719120d2f90fc08108394b1" data-recommend-id="image://da9417ece719120d2f90fc08108394b1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A young Squall stands in a rainstorm and says he'll be okay." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A young Squall stands in a rainstorm and says he'll be okay." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="da9417ece719120d2f90fc08108394b1" data-recommend-id="image://da9417ece719120d2f90fc08108394b1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A young Squall stands in a rainstorm and says he'll be okay." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The differences in how both games depict their worlds, and the spaces give to the player are also of note. <em>FF8</em>’s Balamb Garden, for example, is a kind of home that <em>FF7</em>’s characters, perhaps with the exception of Red XIII and maybe Yuffie, are afforded. Most places in <em>FF7</em> are in some state of oppression and tragedy. <em>FF8</em>, though, portrays more normal, varied domestic settings that aren’t as downtrodden and reliant on a risky energy source owned and distributed by a vicious, militant corporation. I often find the world of <em>FF8</em> more alluring to day dream about because of this. Or, at the very least, it’s a setting that inspires more optimism.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-original-worth-playing-before-rebirth-1851390539&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-original-worth-playing-before-rebirth-1851390539">So You Want To Play The Original <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>?</a></span></p><p>That difference is what makes playing these two back-to-back always a pleasant experience. It’s easy to walk away from <em>FF7</em>, I think, with a sense of despair and uncertainty. True, <em>FF8</em>’s conclusion is also quite mysterious, but it spends less time under immediate narrative pressure like <em>FF7</em> does. As a result, playing <em>FF8</em> immediately after <em>FF7</em> provides alternate perspectives and inspires different emotional contours. The experience of playing both affords a kind of trans-narrative resolution that’s refreshing in a world dominated by a steady progression of direct sequels, prequels, and remakes in games.</p><figure id="" data-id="ed1a5a953bd828896ccfeb9151f2030b" data-recommend-id="image://ed1a5a953bd828896ccfeb9151f2030b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Squall ponders why people depend on each other." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Squall ponders why people depend on each other." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ed1a5a953bd828896ccfeb9151f2030b" data-recommend-id="image://ed1a5a953bd828896ccfeb9151f2030b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Squall ponders why people depend on each other." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>FF8</em> will always be my favorite <em>Final Fantasy</em>, but I do love thinking of <em>FF7 </em>and <em>FF8</em> as related to one another, handling similar settings and themes with different approaches. And moving from one universe to a completely different one, as <em>Final Fantasy </em>used to, is the kind of thing I hope the series regains. Much as I’ve enjoyed some sequels like <em>X-2</em>, <em>XIII-2</em>, and both <em>FF7 </em>remake installments, moving across separate worlds while still vibing on compatible themes is something <em>Final Fantasy</em> used to do well, and is in my opinion far more interesting than sequels that offer little more than additional lore dumps. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="274" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The three goblin leaders in&nbsp;<em>Baldur’s Gate 3&nbsp;</em>are tough to handle, especially Dror Ragzlin. He deals a ton of damage to anyone he hits. However, with the right preparations, you can make it through. Here’s how to take out Dror Ragzlin in <em>Baldur’s Gate 3.&nbsp;</em></p> <div data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <p><span>Tip:</span></p><p> Whether or not you fight Dror Ragzlin depends on whether you side with him and Minthara or the Tieflings in the Emerald Grove. You can avoid this fight entirely if you ally with him and his army during this section of Act One’s story. </p> </div> <h2 id="h-how-to-make-it-past-the-guards" data-injectable="false">How to make it past the guards</h2> <p data-characters="514" data-current-count="714" data-injectable="true">Once you enter the goblin’s prison, you’re stopped at the front gate by security. Warrior Trinzas asks what your intentions are. There are multiple ways to go about this. As a magical class, I was able to peer through her mind. There’s an Intelligence check, but it’s fairly easy to beat, especially if you <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/its-worth-embracing-a-few-failed-rolls-in-baldurs-gate-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">manually save just before</a> the encounter. If you lose the roll, they will all attack you. When you succeed, she’ll tell you about the True Souls that have gathered in their base.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="610" data-injectable="true">Tell Trinzas that you’re here for the True Souls, and they’ll let you through. You can also use some Deception to pass through the guards. This is difficult, however, as you’ll need roll over 15 on your D20 dice. The first option is likely better if you’re not specialized in Deception.</p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-take-out-the-baldur-s-gate-3-dror-ragzlin-boss" data-injectable="false">How to take out the Baldur’s Gate 3 Dror Ragzlin boss</h2> <p data-characters="488" data-current-count="488" data-injectable="true">If you’ve already fought another one of the goblin leaders in <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, make sure to rest up before the Dror Ragzlin fight begins. Either a Short or a Long Rest at the camp will do. Taking the latter, however, will let you recover your more powerful spells and abilities. This red-skinned goblin Dror Ragzlin is much more powerful than the other two goblin bosses. He has 52 HP and is Level 5. He can dish out upwards of 21 damage in one strike, as well, so be careful.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="743" data-injectable="true">Before taking on the Dror Ragzlin fight, find the war drum on the right-hand side. It’s next to the stairway in that area. If you fail to destroy it straight away with an arrow or a spell, you’ll be facing nine enemies in total after taking out Dror Ragzlin. It could be too much to handle, but honestly, it can also be tough to take out on your first turn. You might want to have someone like Astarion nearby to eliminate it ASAP.</p>
 <p data-characters="749" data-current-count="749" data-injectable="true">Try to take out Dror Ragzlin as quickly as possible during the fight. In order to do this, try to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-handy-guide-to-baldurs-gate-3s-classes-subclasses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use a spell</a> that stuns him for a move or two. I used Tasha’s Hideous Laughter on him. It’s not a guaranteed move, but if it lands, it will leave Dror Ragzlin prone with crazed laughter. He’ll be phased, leaving you a chance to get a lot of damage in before he could even say hello. You can get in an extra attack with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-complete-gauntlet-of-shar-in-baldurs-gate-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lae’zel</a>‘s Action Surge and then try to take his hammer off his hands with a powerful Disarming Strike. Using several strikes in a row can really rack up the damage on him. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-origin-characters-in-baldurs-gate-3-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shadowheart</a>‘s Inflict Wounds can also effectively lower a foe’s health. His 52 HP will dwindle down to zero in no time.</p>
 <p data-characters="653" data-current-count="653" data-injectable="true">Dror Ragzlin may also take a lot of health from your party, so try to get a healer into the squad to remedy a potentially bad situation. Just be careful while doing this during <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-beat-dror-ragzlin-in-bg3-honour-mode-including-new-legendary-actions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dror Ragzlin’s Honour Mode fight</a>, as buffing your allies can make things complicated with his passive. Outside of that, you’ll want to remove his minions from the picture. They’ll be fairly easy to dispatch, but just in case, you can quicksave after eliminating Ragzlin if you’re in one of the regular difficulty modes. On the left-hand side, near the stairway, there’s a ladder that can help archers get a better aim at their victims down below.</p>
 <p data-characters="80" data-current-count="80" data-injectable="false">You’ve now defeated the <em><a href="https://baldursgate3.game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Baldur’s Gate 3</a> </em>Dror Ragzlin boss. Congrats!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/interview-with-the-vampire-amc-anne-rice-lestat<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>My favorite gay vampires have returned, and they’re just as toxic as I remember. If you’re not yet caught up on AMC’s <em>Interview With The Vampire</em>, now is the time. Season 2 started on Sunday, and they’re about to get to the Good Shit.</p><p>The first season of <em>Interview with the Vampire</em> almost passed me by. I have been a longtime fan of the original 1994 movie, starring Brad Pitt as Louis Pointe du Lac and Tom Cruise as Lestat de Lioncourt. I believed that even though that movie wasn’t perfect, it was a lovely adaptation of Anne Rice’s work. AMC’s series showed me that I was absolutely wrong on that count—while the new adaptation makes radical changes to the text, they all serve to bring the viewer closer to the sumptuous, melodramatic tone of the original novel. In particular, Sam Reid as Lestat is a delight, constantly prancing around every scene like a pony on cocaine.&nbsp;</p><p>This adaptation also makes good use of the actual narrative conceit of the interview occurring, which the movie kept in the background. Half the show takes place in the present day, where Louis has shacked up with his new lover, Armand (played by theater actor Assad Zaman with evil glee), in Dubai. There, Daniel Molloy, played by the wonderful Eric Bogosian doing Anthony-Bourdain-if-he-were-a-journalist, interviews Louis and pokes holes in the smoothed-over version of history that he presents.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="An Extended Look at Season 2 | Interview with the Vampire | Premieres May 12 | AMC+" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w1DNtxOO0DI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Lestat will sadly be absent for much of this season, as it is adapting the second half of <em>Interview</em>, which takes place after Louis believes he has killed his lover. I am so pumped for what they’re going to cover this season that it becomes hard not to spoil it for newcomers. Suffice it to say, the tragedy that these characters are hurtling towards will be heartbreaking and I am gnawing my fingernails down to the quick in anticipation. This season will be Paris and the Theatre des Vampires—these are some of the iconic aspects of the original novel, and the place where Rice’s vampire cosmology expands into a whole world of love and loss rather than focusing exclusively on Louis’ perspective. Because I know where this season is headed, I know that it will hurt my feelings a lot, and therefore I need to get everyone else on board so we can all share in the delicious pain.</p><p>Last Sunday’s premiere episode was just a taste of the angst that these characters will endure. Louis Pointe du Lac, played by <em>Game of Thrones</em>’ Jacod Anderson, is essentially drowning in guilt as he and his teenage sire Claudia, <a href="https://ew.com/interview-with-the-vampire-season-2-delainey-hayles-claudia-8646133" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this season</a> played by Delainey Hayles, traverse war-torn Europe for evidence of other vampires. Louis hallucinates a dead Lestat to torment himself, while Claudia mostly ignores his mounting mental health issues. It’s a meditative episode—a lot of the forward motion in the plot happens in the present day interview sequences—but it leaves the audience at a perfect place to prepare themselves for the events to come. By the end of the episode they prepare to travel to Paris. Louis declares to Claudia that he is devoted to her like a father is to a child, but he delivers his impassioned monologue while a hallucination of his dead lover smirks at him. The dramatic turns of the season will balance on that fulcrum. Can Louis protect Claudia, or does he still long for a love that he betrayed and left for dead?</p><p>Lestat haunts the interview sequences as well, but mostly in the way that Louis and Armand insist that they’re perfectly happy while it is obvious that despite loving each other, they don’t quite connect. In one scene they enter the room aggressively holding hands as a power play, while Molloy struggles not to roll his eyes at this manufactured depiction of a healthy relationship. Fascinatingly, Molloy appears to have more chemistry with Armand than Louis does. Again, I don’t want to spoil where this might be headed but please, I pray on all that is holy: I need that vampire to fuck that old man.</p><figure><figcaption>Image Source: Interview with the Vampire, AMC</figcaption></figure><p>If you haven’t watched this show but any of that sounds appealing, please, for the love of god, get caught up on the first season and join me. <em>Interview with the Vampire</em> is a rare jewel of a television show. The acting is often revelatory—as much as I love Sam Reid’s Lestat, Jacob Anderson has completely changed how I feel about Louis, unearthing richness and subtlety in a character I used to find boring. Sometimes watching this show feels like going to the theater every Sunday; when I turn off the lights and settle into the couch, I feel like I’m letting the curtains rise before I get whisked away just on the energy of the performances and writing. As Louis says early on in the first season, let the tale seduce you—though the price of that seduction may be more than you’ve bargained for.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> Season 4, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-loot-reborn-update-will-make-its-items-and-players-more-powerful-than-ever/1100-6523061/" data-ref-id="1100-6523061">Loot Reborn</a>, is now live on all platforms, and it brings the biggest changes yet for Blizzard's ARPG across both the Eternal and seasonal realms. We've also gotten a very extensive set of patch notes for the update.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike previous Diablo 4 seasons, which introduced new questlines and unique seasonal mechanics, Season 4 instead focuses on and retools core aspects of the game going forward. Gear in the demon-slaying ARPG has undergone a significant overhaul as a result.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdSehRhUOXM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QdSehRhUOXM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Items will now roll with fewer, but more-potent and less-niche affixes, and can be upgraded in two new ways. One is by Tempering, which adds an additional affix from a new Tempering Recipes, while Masterworking makes the affixes on an item even more powerful. Legendary Aspects are now automatically added to the Codex of Power, no extracting required, allowing players to more freely swap their Legendary Powers in and out as they acquire new gear. In another nice change, playing on World Tier 3 will always reward Sacred items, while playing on World Tier 4 will always reward Ancestral items.</p><p dir="ltr">That should result in players being more powerful than ever before, and they'll need that power to conquer a challenging new 200-floor endgame dungeon, where higher-level Masterworking materials are found. There are significant changes to Helltides, too, with the addition of the endgame activity to lower-level World Tiers, new Accursed Rituals within the Helltides that can be used to summon the new Blood Maiden mini-boss, and a new threat mechanic within Helltides that will see players face off against evil versions of each Diablo 4 class called the Hellborne.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, it wouldn't be a new season without balance changes, and there are plenty of class adjustments and tweaks to Legendary Powers and Unique items. Diablo 4 Season 4 was the first of the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-first-ever-public-test-realm-is-live-now/1100-6522348/" data-ref-id="1100-6522348">seasons to undergo extensive playtesting on a public test realm</a>, and it looks like Blizzard gained some invaluable feedback as part of that process. Some of the changes thanks to player feedback from the PTR include the fact that Masterworking no longer has a chance to fail, improvements to the new Tempering and Masterworking UIs, better rewards from defeating the Blood Maiden, an icon to designate when an item has rolled with a rare Greater Affix, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">With such a massive update, some fans were upset to learn there was no way to pre-download the patch days in advance. According to <a href="https://x.com/PezRadar/status/1790432064019341447" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Diablo community development director Adam Fletcher</a>, Blizzard will look to address that complaint in future seasons to allow for "more of a window for players to grab the patch earlier."</p><p dir="ltr">You can see a selection from the patch notes below, but you'll need to head over to <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/23964909/diablo-iv-patch-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Blizzard's site</a> to see the full list--they are <em>long.</em><em><br></em></p><h2>UPDATES FROM THE PUBLIC TEST REALM</h2><p><em>Developer’s Note: We appreciate all the feedback our players provided us during our Public Test Realm for Season 4: Loot Reborn.

Solomon, who </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/firaxis-veterans-jake-solomon-and-steve-martin-depart-studio">departed Firaxis in 2023</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> after the game released, was the brain behind the game's card-based combat system.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In an interview with Game Developer discussing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/firaxis-vet-jake-solomon-unveils-new-studio-working-on-a-life-sim-game">the founding of Midsummer Studios</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Solomon looked back on his final project at Firaxis and admitted his passion for the system may have missed the mark with players. "I think about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Midnight Suns</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> a lot, and I think about the card mechanic—which I designed, so I take responsibility for it—I think that [discouraged] players from even trying trying the game because they saw it and went 'what the heck is that?'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hindsight is 20/20, but Solomon's observation holds weight if you think back to what Firaxis and Take-Two were pitching players. The game was a turn-based tactical game (targeting a niche audience), themed on Marvel characters (targeting a mainstream audience), with combat built on a card-drawing, deckbuilding mechanic that visualized the characters' superhero abilities (not a feature something either audience would be familiar with).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To top it off, Firaxis faced headwinds from audience disinterest in Marvel-branded narrative games.

"I'm very naïve when it comes to the business side of things," he admitted. "You want to believe 'if I just make a good game, everything will take care of itself.' That's not true anymore. That used to be true 20 years ago. There are so many games out there, and so many things vying for people's attention."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For context, 20 years ago, Solomon was fresh out of college and working on Sid Meier's Civilization III.

<p data-characters="227" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Following the gameplay reveal of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/behaviour-interactive-teases-dungeons-dragons-coming-to-dead-by-daylight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dead by Daylight Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Chapter</a>, Behaviour Interactive announced a new product for its growing line of merch: a set of dice inspired by <em>Dead by Daylight</em> for use in any TTRPG.</p> <p data-characters="476" data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true">The Entity’s tentacles have successfully breached almost every realm in existence. By far the most impressive is that of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, dragging the almighty Vecna into Trials to feed the unknowable creature with the screams and suffering of even more Survivors. To celebrate this mashup of monsters, you can purchase the <em>Dead by Daylight Pools of Blood Dice Set</em> and bring a little piece of The Entity to help you or hinder you while your party ventures forth. </p>
 <h2 id="h-where-to-buy-the-dead-by-daylight-pools-of-blood-dice-set" data-injectable="false">Where to buy the <em>Dead by Daylight Pools of Blood Dice Set</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Behaviour Interactive</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="541" data-injectable="true">You can buy the <em>Dead by Daylight Pools of Blood Dice Set</em> from the <a href="https://shop.deadbydaylight.com/en-gb/products/dead-by-daylight-deluxe-blood-core-dice-set?_pos=2&amp;_sid=d8ff66fe2&amp;_ss=r">official <em>Dead by Daylight</em> merch store</a>. For the first 48 hours, the set is on sale, those who buy it can get it at a 10% discount. After that, the set will cost $39.95/£40.28.</p>
 <p data-characters="451" data-current-count="451" data-injectable="true">This set was announced during the <em>Dead by Daylight</em> 8th Anniversary livestream event but only as a footnote at the end of the stream. Coupled with the crush on Behaviour Interactive’s servers from launching <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/what-the-fog-is-a-free-dbd-co-op-shooter-and-surprise-its-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What the Fog</a></em> for free, finding where you could buy these dice was impossible. I had to wait a few hours, open the merch store, and search for “dice” to find them because they weren’t advertised anywhere on the home page. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">What is the <em>Dead by Daylight Pools of Blood Dice Set</em>?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Behaviour Interactive</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="686" data-injectable="true">The <em>Dead by Daylight Pools of Blood Dice Set</em> is a set of 7 dice that come with a core of bloody red liquid and the Dead by Daylight logo on the 20 of the D20 to make a natural 20 even more special. The dice are packed in a case inspired by the Med-Kit item from the game, so it looks like you’re rocking up to your next <em>D&amp;D</em> session, ready to take a lot of hits for the party. </p>
 <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="282" data-injectable="false">The set might include a D20, but there are smaller dice as well, so it can be used in dozens of games. If you want to bring a bit of flair to Monopoly or any board game that uses dice you’re playing with friends, this is a great set to use to add some personality to the mix. </p> <p data-characters="178" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="false">In addition to the dice set, the product also entitles all those who purchase it to 2 million Bloodpoints in <em>Dead by Daylight</em>. That’s enough to Prestige a character twice. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/flee-mortals-now-available-on-dd-beyond<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The go-to platform for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> content has received another third-party supplement. The new content is <em>Flee, Mortals!</em>, a monster-focused supplement developed by TTRPG personality and game designer Matt Colville.</p>

<p>According to its <a href="https://marketplace.dndbeyond.com/rulebooks/SRC-00142" rel="noopener" target="_blank">store page</a> listing, <em>Flee, Mortals! </em>is a supplement all about adding new and interesting monsters to your <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/dungeons-dragons"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> campaign. Facing challenging monsters is the biggest draw to the world's most popular fantasy TTRPG.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/flee-mortals-goblin-artwork.jpg?itok=yc_GIvIa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/flee-mortals-goblin-artwork.jpg?itok=z-diEKt3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Even goblins are a little extra in this book.</figcaption></figure><p>The supplement contains 293 unique monster statblocks. These include variations on classic <em>D&amp;D</em> monsters, special abilities meant to surprise veteran players, and rules and mechanics for minions. Minions are designed as challenging cannon fodder to make players feel powerful.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <em>Flee, Mortals!</em> contains rules for allies and retainers. These support NPCs can even level up alongside an adventuring party. Lastly, the supplement contains 9 battlemaps and 19 magic items for DMs to use as they see fit.</p>
<p>The D&amp;D Beyond store page shows that this will not be the last supplement developed by Matt Colville and MCDM featured on the platform. In addition to buying standalone, there is an option for a bundle, which includes another MCDM supplement: the boss battle-focused book <em>Where Evil Lives</em>.</p>
<p>Matt Colville's influence in the TTRPG space cannot be understated. He has contributed to multiple books including <em>Explorer's Guide to Wildemount</em>, the CODA System <em>Star Trek RPG</em>, the (now-discontinued) <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mcdm-announces-end-of-arcadia-magazine"><em>Arcadia</em></a> magazine, and multiple supplements for <em>D&amp;D 3e</em>.</p>
<p>Notably, Colville's MCDM studio has also developed their own fantasy TTRPG competitor to <em>D&amp;D</em>. The aptly titled <a href="https://mcdm-rpg.backerkit.com/hosted_preorders" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>MCDM RPG</em></a> was successfully crowdfunded on Gamefound, raising a staggering $4.5 million during its initial campaign.</p>
<p><em>Flee, Mortals!</em> joins a handful of beloved third-party supplements on D&amp;D Beyond. Those supplements include Darrington Press' <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/taldorei-reborn-now-available-on-dd-beyond"><em>Tal'Dorei Reborn</em></a>, Hitpoint Press' <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/humblewood-debuts-on-dd-beyond"><em>Humblewood</em></a>, and the Dungeon Dudes' <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-of-drakkenheim-now-available-on-dd-beyond"><em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim</em></a>.</p>

			<p>While the generative AI technology for NPCs (non-player characters) <a href="https://wccftech.com/inworld-ai-npc-gdc-2024-hands-on-nvidia-and-ubisoft-show-a-glimpse-of-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demonstrated at GDC 2024</a> by Inworld is very exciting for its potential applications in games, one of the main drawbacks is the cost associated with it. The simulation currently has to run on Inworld's servers, which comes at a price.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-big-inworld-ai-qa-everyone-in-gaming-sees-the-potential-of-generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our big interview</a> with Inworld GM of Labs Nathan Yu, we asked how they're planning to overcome such a big hurdle. Yu was confident that costs would go down significantly, especially when applied to a large-scale game.</p>
<p><em>Moving forward, the costs are going to go down significantly; we all understand that. But even then, it's the design, right? Do you really need all secondary NPCs to be hyper-intelligent? Maybe not; maybe we use smaller models there, but for the core companion character, there is a value added.</em></p>
<p><em>But I'm not too concerned. </em><em>I think if we give it another couple of months, the conversation will be different as soon as we see viable, profitable use cases being deployed.</em></p>
<p><em>I do see experiences where players will be contributing to the cost directly because there's like a premium upsell there that makes sense for them. I do see other examples where it doesn't make sense. Players are purchasing a flat game cost for $59.99 or other and it'll be fully maintained just through other monetization structures, or it's already amortized over time.</em></p>
<p><em>As we get to scale for AAA titles, costs will go down so that it's no longer variable. If we've got millions of users, there's lots of techniques that can be leveraged to drive down costs there.</em></p>
<p>One way to reduce costs would be to run the generative AI technology locally on the device used. Would that work for Inworld? The answer was positive.</p>
<p><em>Yes. we'll definitely get there. We saw a lot of exciting announcements even at GTC for dedicated hardware in the future for AI versus rendering.</em></p>
<p><em>Today, t</em><em>here's a lot of questions, like, if we do move to on devices, will that impact graphics rendering? That becomes a nonstarter conversation for a lot of studios. But at Inworld we do support hybrid as well. Some services could run locally, some services run on cloud inferencing and that can short-term optimize costs and latency. But in the future, I think we can all agree that it's going to get there. It's gonna run locally, offline, on devices like consoles. It's just a matter of time. I'm excited to see that as well.</em></p>
<p>We'll continue to follow the implementation of Inworld technology in games and game making tools very closely. Stay tuned on Wccftech for more on the subject.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valheim-heats-up-with-new-ultra-deadly-biome-in-ashlands-update.870756/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24156665/valheim-firelands-update-live-new-biome-siege-weapons-charred<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="W2oYsr"><em>Valheim</em> is a fantastic sandbox survival game, set in a fantastical 10th realm of the Norse afterlife. Adventurers explore from the peaceful meadows <a href="https://www.polygon.com/valheim-guide/22295460/biome-progression-order-meadow-black-forest-swamp-plains-mountain-ocean-mistaland-deep-north-ashland">out into more dangerous biomes</a>, and today, the most dangerous one yet is available to explore. The last biome update was the Mistlands; today, players can venture out into the Ashlands.</p>
<p id="Gu9PJf">Of course, that’s much easier said than done, since the Ashlands is a very hostile environment. Vikings will need to build ships strong enough to survive its boiling waters, and things don’t get better upon landfall. Undead known as Charred wander the lands, a fearsome Fallen Valkyrie attacks from the skies, and a beastly creature known as the Morgen hunts prey, along with other enemies. </p>
<p id="3VTZvG">Luckily, new enemies means new loot, which can be turned into new weapons. Flametal can be crafted into a new greatsword, spear, and crossbow, and further enhanced with jade, bloodstone, and isoite gems. Building outposts in the Ashlands is meant to feel like a constant struggle, and the Charred control the territory from fortresses. Luckily, players can now craft siege weaponry. Catapults and battering rams allow players to attack fortresses directly, expanding their reach over the new biome.</p>
<p id="72bBHw">“Ashlands is supposed to feel like a struggle, and players should expect a challenge. Every inch of territory you claim has to be earned, and every outpost has to be reinforced before you venture deeper. We’re entering endgame territory here, and players need to be ready for what comes in the Deep North,” said Andreas Tomasson,<em> Valheim </em>producer, in a press release.</p>
<p id="rTxvH0"><em>Valheim</em> is available on PC, and is still in early access. The Viking survival game <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22303522/valheim-review-coffee-stain-early-access-pc">had a huge launch in 2021</a>, thanks to developer Iron Gate’s ability to craft a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22340357/valheim-game-design-coziness-hygge-danger-trees-hunger-cottagecore">compelling range of experiences across the biomes</a>, from cozy and comfortable to striving for survival. The game has remained relevant through to 2024,<a href="https://www.polygon.com/24099909/open-world-survival-crafting-games-2024"> attracting an audience of survival game fans</a>. The Mistlands update expanded the game with a mysterious, mountainous region with low visibility and insectoid enemies, but the Ashlands sounds like a whole new level of danger.</p>

<p id="nmsNdX">The set depicts Sauron’s massive tower as well as his glowing Eye that sits at its peak. The tower also opens up into a detailed throne room that includes a hidden map and a ladder to the top floor. The middle sections of the tower also have a variety of different modable options, including a feast table, an orc armory, and more, while the bottom of the tower includes a working door at the base..</p>
<p id="sEGJ0s">The Lego set will stand at over 32 inches tall, 11 inches wide, and 17 inches long. It comes with a hidden secret as well: if you buy multiple sets, you can stack several different versions of the middle section to make an even more imposing version of Barad-dûr. But the price for multiple versions of this new 5,471 piece Lord of the Rings set will be pretty steep, with each one running $459.99. </p>

<p id="K2gKin">Along with the tower itself, and a glowing center brick for the Eye of Sauron, the Barad-dûr set will include 10 minifigures, including Sauron, the Mouth of Sauron, an Orc, Frodo, Sam, Gollum, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/lord-of-the-rings/2021/2/10/22272503/orcs-lotr-movies-ranked">Gothmog</a>, and more. On top of all that, if you buy the set between June 1 and June 7, you’ll also get a Lord of the Rings: Fell Beast Lego seat, which features a version of the ominous flying creature with fully posable wings alongside A Nazgul minifigure. </p>
<p id="beV9x6">The Lord of the Rings: Barad-dûr set comes out on June 1. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-keyart-leaked/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Several new images of Assassin’s Creed Shadows keyart have leaked online ahead of the game’s official reveal.</p>



<p>The images were first posted by dataminer user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/fraxR6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">/u/fraxR6</a>, who obtains information and images from the Ubisoft store backend. While the original images have since been deleted, Insider Gaming’s Mike Straw has uploaded the images to his Twitter account.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The images confirm <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-red-yasuke/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s past reporting that the game</a> will feature two protagonists, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/who-is-yasuke-in-assassins-creed-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">male samurai named Yasuke</a> and a female Shinobi named Naoe. Warning, some slight story spoilers ahead.</p>



<p>Yasuke’s story starts off with tragedy and unlike his real-life story, his story has been rewritten. In Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Yasuke was a slave traveling on a slave ship when it was attacked and everyone was killed, including his lover, but he survived. Yasuke was then rescued and brought to Japan, where he learned the way of the samurai under Nobunaga’s service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s understood that at the beginning of the game, Naoe and Yasuke are fierce enemies, but later become allies on their desire for Japan’s unification.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Insider Gaming understands that the other historical characters to make their appearance in Assassin’s Creed Red include; Fujibayashi Nagato (Naoe’s father), Oda Nobunaga, Akechi Mitsuhide, Hattori Hanzo (returning character), Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Kōdai-in (Hideyoshi’s wife), Oichi, Ashikaga Yoshiaki, Akechi Kagemitsu, and more.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Sony might not be ready to bankroll a Bloodborne remaster for PS5, but who really needs it when you can make your own Yharnam adventures? Thanks to this affordable Figma action figure of the game's titular Hunter--which is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Max-Factory-Bloodborne-Hunter-Action/dp/B075N75GYQ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on sale at Amazon for $86.30 (was $116)</a>--you can tackle terrifying new bosses like your uninterested cat or hyperactive dog instead. Or you can figure out a great pose for this collectible, lock it in, and proudly display it. This figure tends to sell out fairly quickly, and Amazon doesn't often refresh its stock, so grab it while you can.</p><p><em>Note: To get this deal, you may need to click "Other sellers on Amazon" below the "Buy Now" button on mobile or desktop. The listing defaults to a third-party reseller instead of the deal that's shipped and sold by Amazon. The Amazon listing should be the top option in that list. Click "Add to Cart" and the correct price will be reflected in your order total.</em></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302786-figma-bloodborne.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4302786" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302786-figma-bloodborne.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4302786"></a><figcaption>Figma Bloodborne Hunter</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302786-figma-bloodborne.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302787-figmabloodbornehunter%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302788-figmabloodbornehunter%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302789-figmabloodbornehunter%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302790-figmabloodbornehunter%284%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302791-figmabloodbornehunter%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302792-figmabloodbornehunter%286%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4302787,1300-4302788,1300-4302789,1300-4302790,1300-4302791,1300-4302792" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4302787-figmabloodbornehunter%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4302788-figmabloodbornehunter%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4302789-figmabloodbornehunter%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4302790-figmabloodbornehunter%284%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4302791-figmabloodbornehunter%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4302792-figmabloodbornehunter%286%29.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302787-figmabloodbornehunter%281%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302788-figmabloodbornehunter%282%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302789-figmabloodbornehunter%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302790-figmabloodbornehunter%284%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302791-figmabloodbornehunter%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302792-figmabloodbornehunter%286%29.jpg"></figure><p>Whatever your choice, this is a nice deal on an even nicer action figure. Like other Figma figures, the Bloodborne Hunter is highly detailed and features an impressive amount of articulation. It has a great shelf presence, and with its included cleaver and blunderbuss weapons, you can pose it in several exciting ways. The saw cleaver can be transformed into the extended cleaver mode just like in the game, and you'll get a display stand for those more dynamic poses you think up.</p><p>While there's no (sadly) word yet on a Bloodborne remaster or sequel, you can explore more of its captivating universe with other media that has released over the last couple of years. Several Bloodborne graphic novels are available, and if you're interested, you can get a pretty good box set deal on the first three trade paperbacks. Normally $50, it can be yours for just $30.

                <p>The next Madden game will be announced this week, release in August, and include a $100 premium edition that gets players into the game a few days early. That's according to a leak from <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/on-connait-la-date-de-sortie-du-prochain-madden-nfl-25-50251" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a> (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/madden-nfl-25-will-be-revealed-this-week-ahead-of-august-release-its-claimed/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via VGC</a>), who has a solid track record for reporting on unannounced video game news.</p><p>The game will be announced on May 16, the report said, and that's the same day that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-cover-leaks-early-full-reveal-coming-next-week/1100-6523365/" data-ref-id="1100-6523365">official countdown clock for EA Sports College Football expires</a>. So EA may have two big football announcements to make that day.</p><p>The report said Madden NFL 25 will launch on August 16, but people who buy the Deluxe edition or subscribe to EA Play can begin playing on August 12. This is standard procedure for Madden games, as EA is known to give early access to people who spend more money.</p><p>The report said Madden NFL 25's standard edition will go for $70, with the Deluxe edition selling for $100. The story didn't have any information on who might be the cover star for Madden NFL 25, however, though the report said the cover star may be announced after the game is.</p><p>This year's Madden game could have the same name as 2013's Madden title, which was also called Madden NFL 25 due to its celebration of the franchise's 25th anniversary. It remains to be seen how EA might address that this year.</p><p>In other Madden news, Prime Video just announced a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-nfl-video-game-documentary-announced-by-prime-video/1100-6523426/" data-ref-id="1100-6523426">four-part documentary series about the video game franchise</a>.
