                <p dir="ltr">Today during the Day Of The Devs Summer Game Fest Showcase, South African developer Nyamakop, in partnership with Mooncat Games, revealed Relooted, a heist game where a group of thieves try to return priceless artifacts to the cultures that revere them.</p><p dir="ltr">Each mission in Relooted plays out in three phases: First, players will scope out the museum and locate the target artifact. Next, they'll enter the building and create their getaway path as quietly as possible, avoiding guards and other obstacles along the way. Finally, it's time to grab the artifact and escape using the path created in phase two.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4507609-relooted.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507609" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4507609-relooted.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507609"></a><figcaption>Relooted</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4507609-relooted.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">In an interesting twist, the artifacts players will be targeting in Relooted are not fictional ones made up for the game. Instead, they are real-world artifacts that are currently sitting in Western museums, and each in-game artifact comes with a brief biography of its origin, the culture in which it originated, and why that artifact is so revered by that culture.</p><p dir="ltr">For example, one of the artifacts shown in the Day Of The Devs segment is the Ngadji Drum, a drum of the Pokomo people discovered in Africa in the 1870s. The drum was stolen by British colonists in the early 1900s and sent to a museum--114 years later, the brother of the Pokomo king became the first person to see the drum since its theft, when he was brought to the museum and allowed to view it in storage.</p><p dir="ltr">The Day Of The Devs presentation has featured world premieres and updates for multiple upcoming indie games, including Big Walk from Untitled Goose Game developer House House and mixtape from The Artful Escape dev Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur. It also announced Snap And Grab, an '80s-themed heist game from No Goblin and Annapurna Interactive, as well as a new look at Possessors from Heart Machine and Devolver Digital.</p><p dir="ltr">Relooted is scheduled to release on Xbox Series X|S and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store. No release window was announced during the Day Of The Devs livestream.</p>

		<p>Day of the Devs returned as a follow-on from Summer Game Fest 2025, bringing a bunch of curated indie games, some of which had just been announced, as well as some world premieres! Let’s dive in with the full stream, and the breakdown with any new trailers below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Day of the Devs: Summer 2025 Edition" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oEm6wAdqfEY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Coming from No Goblin and publisher Annapurna Interactive, you plan out cool crimes by scoping out high ticket items in a location, as well as snapping pics of any helps and hindrances to your heist.

<p>The next game from Untitled Goose Game developer HouseHouse, Big Walk is a big co-op adventure that’s all about just walking around and doing puzzles together. There’s proximity chat in a relatively photorealistic setting, while some of the puzzles will challenge your ability to communicate with things like soundproof glass meaning you need to point and jump and things. But you can also just mess around and go orienteering.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Sword of the Sea</strong></p>

<p>A spicy RPG that’s all about cooking, you have to take on your evil sister’s food-in-tubes empire.

<hr>
<p><strong>Please Watch The Artwork</strong></p>
<p>Coming from Thomas Waterzool of Please Touch The Artwork fame is a psychological spot the difference game set in the Museum of Animated Art. No jump scares, just spookies.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</strong></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="MARVEL Cosmic Invasion - Character Reveal - She-Hulk &amp; Rocket Raccoon" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dlNbzKH-hfc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<hr>
<p><strong>Neverway</strong></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Neverway - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c-ZYBv3qzN8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ever want Stardew to be more… horror? Well here’s Neverway. Fiona heads off to get away from it all, but then she ends up indebted to a demon. Still, you get to befriend and romance people, each with their own routines. There’s a nice three-block time progression that lets you choose when to move on to the next time span, instead of an ever-ticking clock.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Relooted</strong></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Relooted Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KgPxPfXb734?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Semblance developer Nyamokop has created a side-scrolling heister that ties in with the real world. With museums refusing to repatriate artifacts to their origins –&nbsp;in the game, they’re using a loophole to avoid fictional laws –&nbsp;you go and steal them back instead. Real world artifacts are featured in the game, giving their stories.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Ratatan</strong></p>
<p>Patapon’s spiritual successor just had a demo released, and here’s another trailer.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Thick as Thieves</strong></p>
<p>Warren Spector and Otherside are trying to revolutionise the stealth genre again, mixing immersive sim stealth with multiplayer and shared levels. Players all have their own objectives, but can mess with one another and interrupt. Meanwhile, you need to “Play with your ears” as things like rain could cover your sounds for more than just the Ai.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Pocket Boss</strong></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Pocket Boss – Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nqpm7li2oiw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Manipulate data. Make charts look better… until they go all floppy and weird.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Consume Me</strong></p>
<p>Can you survive life, which is trying to consume you? Can you get hot? Can you find $20 while walking the dog?</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>OFF</strong></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="OFF for Nintendo Switch and Steam Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P2CuUUYuYw0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A Japanese inspired RPG where you chase ghosts with a baseball bat. OFF is now haunted. Oh dear.</p>
<p>The game that was an inspiration for Undertale is being ported to PC and Switch for the 17th anniversary. It has six new bosses and revamped combat, though.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Tire Boy</strong></p>
<p>You’re a tyre, and you’re a boy. A rubber wheel with arms and legs. It’s quite strange. You were also raised by an owl called Nestwick…</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Toem 2</strong></p>
<p>The first gameplay for the photography adventure sequel has been shared. It’s more 3D now, and there’s new camera tools, like scissors to cut things in view finder, a hammer to smash things. There’s a new movement system that includes jumping, but the all-important camera has been made snappier and faster too.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Heart Machine’s side-scrolling metroidvania platformer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/possessors">Possessor(s)</a> is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> with a splash of Amanita Design’s <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/creaks">Creaks</a>. The bulk of your enemies are household objects - vending machines, plant pots, office printers and other fittings that have become vessels for demons. From this premise springs a note of tragedy powerful enough to conquer my outrage at a game title that has brackets in it. The demons are not, in themselves, violent - it’s inhabiting the inanimate that maddens them. “Possessing something cold and dead is agony… so they lash out,” explains Rhem, a mortally wounded devil you meet in the prologue. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The demon invasion is also more of an uprising, triggered by a nefarious corporation, Agradyne, who have been bottling the fiends like bacteria and carrying out dreadful experiments. Or at least, such is my understanding after 20 minutes with a demo at a Devolver event last week. It all makes me feel positively awful about chain-whipping the hellspawn for power-up points. And yet. Here’s a trailer.
</p>
<figure>

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd32M4-muA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
Aside from making me reconsider my prejudices against demons, Possessor is notable for some winsome anime character design. You are Luca, a snub-nosed, apple-cheeked teenager who loses her legs while trying to escape the interdimensional onslaught. Luca is saved from death by raven-haired hellboy Rhem, who is himself in need of a fresh body after getting his chest ripped open. With Rhem tagging along as one of the titular possessors, Luca both regrows her legs and acquires a sizzling set of knives, a combat grapple, a wall-kick, a double-jump, and more besides. It’s clearly a Faustian pact, possibly also a doomed romance, but hush now, away with your talk of Consequences – there are new abilities to unlock, and weapons to find.
</p>
<p>
The game is set in a huge, trashed, quarantined city with some kind of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/berserk">Berserk</a>-ass singularity popping off in the background. It’s a towering expanse of soft neon glows and gladiatorial shadows, very much a depth I’m willing to plumb, though I’m not yet blown away by the combat. 
</p>
<p>
It works well enough, once you adjust to some slightly curt animations, but so far, it’s playing the hits – dodge, combo, launch. I do like the ordinariness of the tools: one of the early secondary weapons is a computer mouse you swing by its cable.  See, this is why new computing tech isn’t automatically better computing tech. Can’t juggle underworld hooligans with a bluetooth connection, can you? Later you get a guitar – “shredding” is a word with at least two senses – and a hockey stick. 
</p>
<p>
I broke off playing the demo after I was saddled with the sub-objective of locating somebody’s eyeballs so that I could fool the retina scanners for a laboratory door. I stopped playing mostly because I was at an event and on the clock, but it’s also fair to say that being handed a key quest blunted the enthusiasm amassed by the world and characters. 
</p>
<p>
Still, this feels both more florid than many metroidvanias and more sensitive in its writing, as you might expect from some of the people behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-drifter">Hyper Light Drifter</a> and, less positively, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-breaker">Hyper Light Breaker</a>. I will end with the throwaway thought that the main characters remind me a bit of the lead characters from volleyball anime Haikyuu. Probably, a volleyball would make a sensible addition to Luca's arsenal. More stopping power than a hockey stick, surely? Anyway, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2132890/Possessors/">read more about the demo on Steam</a>.

That was when I realized the vibes were off. Everyone was running on fumes. People were desperate.

It was a show dominated by the same kinds of games getting announced and showcased over and over and over. There were six trailers for six different <em>Souls</em>-like/E<em>lden Ring</em>-inspired games. A ton of anime action things that blended together. A trailer for a <em>Fortnite Star Wars </em>event. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/deadpool-vr-trailer-neil-patrick-harris-meta-quest-1851783937?_gl=1*3rbeve*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDkyNTM5NDgkbzQyOSRnMSR0MTc0OTI1NDUzNSRqMjUkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-vr-trailer-neil-patrick-harris-meta-quest-1851783937?_gl=1*3rbeve*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDkyNTM5NDgkbzQyOSRnMSR0MTc0OTI1NDUzNSRqMjUkbDAkaDA.">A Deadpool VR game</a></span>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-thrones-rts-westeros-jon-snow-george-rr-martin-1851783926&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-thrones-rts-westeros-jon-snow-george-rr-martin-1851783926">A <em>Game of Thrones</em> RTS</a></span>.

The two-hour event (YEAH) dragged on and on, with each time a trailer ended the crowd sounded far less enthused about being there. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/re9-resident-evil-9-trailer-teaser-sgf-summer-game-fest-1851783941&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/re9-resident-evil-9-trailer-teaser-sgf-summer-game-fest-1851783941">Sure, we got a fun<em> Resident Evil 9 </em>reveal</a></span>, and there were a few cool games announced during the show, like a puppet boxing game, and <em>Jurassic World Evolution 3 </em>looks neat.

The only mention of <em>Silksong </em>was a joke about it being absent. It was an empty show that felt lifeless and sad. It’s clear that publishers are chasing trends and only greenlighting and funding games that look like other things that people bought. </p><p>Geoff, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/nicolecarpenter.bsky.social/post/3lqxqnvifmc2b&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/nicolecarpenter.bsky.social/post/3lqxqnvifmc2b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wearing what appeared to be $750 sneakers</a></span>, seemed desperate from the jump to convince fans watching at home that the lack of big AAA games wasn’t a bad thing. He dedicated the opening minutes of the show to praising indie games and how awesome they are and how popular they are. In hindsight, this was him setting the stage for his viewers: You aren’t getting <em>Half-Life 3, GTA 6</em>, or anything else like that tonight. Those games take 10 years to make now and come less often than ever before. And whle I do agree indie games are cool and doing awseome stuff, this showcase sucked. Two hours of the same games squeezed between ads is a horrible way to showcase anything. And doing it for this long should be classified as torture. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-2025-switch-2-launch-geoff-keighley&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-2025-switch-2-launch-geoff-keighley" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As summed up recently and perfectly by Luke Plunkett over at <em>Aftermath</em></a></span>: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Games—or at least the kind of games this week used to be about—are trapped in the belly of the machine. We love to talk shit about Andrew Wilson, but he isn’t to blame for every terrible decision at EA, because he’s the executive of a publicly-traded company in 2025, and any other person in his line of work would and is doing the same thing. Almost every major industry in the world, whether it’s games or cars or music or energy, is now at the mercy of Wall Street Weirdos, private equity in particular. We’re not looking at a bad time for the video game industry, we’re looking at just <em>bad times</em>.</p></blockquote><p>But hey, <em>Resident Evil 9</em> looks neat, I guess. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Coffee Stain, the publisher behind Goat Simulator, Valheim, and Satisfactory, has announced a new roguelike called Into the Unwell. In development at Swedish studio She Was Such A Good Horse, the game is designed to look like an early 20th-century cartoon.</p><p>Built around cooperative hack-and-slash mechanics, Into the Unwell focuses on chaotic gameplay and over-the-top enemies and environments. Its most striking feature is its art style, which specifically pulls on "rubber hose" animation associated with cartoons like Mickey Mouse, Tom and Jerry, and early Looney Tunes. Its aesthetic also seems evocative of the imagery of animated films like Alice in Wonderland.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2tBGtZXwM8" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/s2tBGtZXwM8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><span>While similar in inspiration to </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cuphead/" data-ref-id="5000-285254">Cuphead</a><span>, Into the Unwell is distinct in that it features 3D combat and platforming. The announcement trailer shows off some of the environmental challenges and boss fights that players can expect from the game, which seem from this short glimpse that they might be quite punishing.</span></p><p>According to a press release, the gameplay will also embrace the weird and psychedelic vibes of the aesthetics. Coffee Stain writes, "Players will find themselves in a cartoonish fever dream where they'll encounter eccentric anthropomorphic enemies, and attempt boss fights as bizarre as they are belligerent."</p><p>Into the Unwell is built to be played solo or with up to four players in co-op, and it is launching in Steam Early Access in the near future. It is the debut game from studio She Was Such A Good Horse, which is composed of a handful of veteran developers from across the games industry. No details have been shared about whether it is coming to other platforms beyond PC.</p>

                <p>Yakuza developer RGG Studio's Project Century has two new trailers and a new name, both revealed at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6648/" data-ref-id="2900-6648">Summer Game Fest</a>. Now dubbed Stranger Than Heaven, the game takes place in Japan during the early 20th century. In the trailer, we get some looks at the scenery and nightlife of the time period, along with some glimpses of hard-hitting, bloody action gameplay.</p><p>The story trailer showcases our main character in a smoky nightclub watching a performance before going outside for a panoramic view of Japan, showing how modernization and increased international influence have transformed the country. While the previous trailer for Stranger than Heaven showed the time setting as 1915--the Taisho Era--this trailer indicates the action is taking place in 1943, which would be in the midst of World War II. This could be a sign that the game will take place over a lengthy period of time.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHUs5_vSYHY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dHUs5_vSYHY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>We also see our character, Daito, taking on some foes, including a choice of whether or not to show a character mercy--potentially indicating a choice/morality system. At the end, Daito converses with a clearly Western character--who even drops a 1940s slur asking about Daito's ethnic origins--only for Daito to reveal that he has blue eyes, something associated with Western heritage.</p><p>No platforms or a release date were mentioned, but we assume that Stranger than Heaven will be targeting current-gen consoles and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/yakuza-studios-project-century-gets-a-proper-name-and-a-stylish-new-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Cast your mind back to the distant days of last December, and you might remember Sega unveiling Project Century, a curious new venture from Yakuza developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio. Well, it's not been given a proper name alongside a new trailer.
</p>
<p>
Project Century's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-unveils-new-virtua-fighter-sonic-racing-and-like-a-dragon">initial showing</a> was eye-catching but not entirely informative, revealing it to be a Yakuza-style third-person action game with real-time combat set in an open city located somewhere in 1915. And honestly, its latest appearance isn't a whole lot more illuminating. But! We've shifted to 1943 this time around, perhaps suggesting the game - just like its codename implies - does indeed unfold across the course of 100 years.
</p>
<p>
Aside from that curiosity, we get an extremely evocative new trailer, featuring some era-appropriate music, a whole lot of fisticuffs, and more of that lovely warm art style. More crucially though, Sega has jettisoned the Project Century moniker in favour of its final title, Stranger Than Heaven.

<p>
But, unfortunately, that's your lot. There's no hint of a release date, or even the platforms Stranger Than Heaven might be coming to, so for now about all we can do is soak up the ambience of its new trailer and patiently wait to learn more.

		<p>Semblance developer Nyamakop has revealed Relooted, a heisting game that has ties back to a very real issue facing cultures around the world. Relooted is in development for Xbox and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Relooted Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KgPxPfXb734?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set in the near future where a treaty has been signed that is meant to force museums to repatriate artifacts to their home countries – most significantly for this game, to Africa – museums have found a loophole that only artifacts on display need to be repatriated, so shove everything back into storage.</p>
<p>In Retooled, you manage a team based in Johannesburg in South Africa, following leads and cooking up plans to break in to museums and private collections around the world and steal those artifacts back.</p>
<p>While the game is in a fictional future, the 70 artifacts from Western museums and private collections are real, each with history to learn about in-game. There’s been estimates that some 90% of sub-Saharan African artifacts, including human remains, are in museums and collections.</p>

<p>For the game itself, you’ll have to figure out a way to sneak into each level, before grabbing the artifact and then racing out as fast as you can, avoiding hazards, drones and traps as you go.</p>
<p>Here’s hoping that this raises awareness of this issue so that, next time Greece asks if they can have the Elgin Marbles back, maybe the UK gives it half a thought?</p>

		<p>It’s time to go back to higher education with Escape Academy: Back 2 School, as Coin Crew Games has revealed their escape room sequel.</p>
<p><iframe title="Escape Academy 2: Back 2 School - Summer Game Fest 2025 Announcement Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/owh9OAeOMYQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Escape Academy 2 looks to go bigger and broader than the original. Yes, there’s still the individual escape room challenges to take on, but this game has an all-new campus that you can wander around, filled with free roam puzzles. Can you unravel the conspiracy that swirls around the school again?</p>
<p>As with the original, you’ll be able to play solo, or get a buddy to play with you in either online or local co-op.</p>
<p>The first Escape Academy was an escape room delight, Coin Crew putting their real escape room designing chops to use in video game form. In our original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/13/escape-academy-review/">Escape Academy review</a>, I said, “Escape Academy captures the spirit of escape rooms in excellent fashion, wrapping up a string of thoroughly enjoyable puzzle-filled levels in a light and quirky story. Puzzle aficionados might find it a little easy, but it’s a commendable first effort that left me wanting more.”</p>

			<p>Capcom has finally revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-has-a-good-chance-of-being-revealed-during-summer-game-fest-rumor/">Resident Evil 9</a>, officially titled Resident Evil Requiem. Not only did Capcom finally reveal RE9, but it also gave us a release date of February 27, 2026, for its arrival on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>
<p>The rumors leading into Summer Game Fest 2025 were indeed true, though we definitely got more than we expected considering that we already have a release date to look forward to, and we saw what is almost definitely the most terrifying trailer for a Resident Evil game in the series' history.</p>
<p>You can check out the reveal trailer for Resident Evil Requiem, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem - Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/POz1-EmLsTY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the announcement for Resident Evil Requiem answered a main question that players had around the game (when it'll be out), it left plenty more questions. For example, the trailer stars someone named Grace, not Rose, which is what players who got to the end of Resident Evil Village might've expected.</p>
<p>We don't have too many concrete story details, but we do know that Grace will be going back to the same hotel where her mother was killed, and that Raccoon City is somehow involved once again. We also didn't see any concrete gameplay, so we still don't know if this will be a first or third-person game.</p>
<p>We'll continue to have questions about Resident Evil Requiem until February 27, 2026, when it's finally out on consoles and PC and we can all play it. Until then, it's at least good to know what it is officially called, and to have a date to look forward to.</p>

            <p>What's this? A game with big robots smashing each other to tiny little pieces above a large sci-fi cityscape, and we have <em>not</em> yet covered it. For shame. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mechabreak">Mecha Break</a> is a free-to-play multiplayer robo-battler in which you fly around and wreck online foes at speeds no mere human should ever be exposed to, and it now has a release date, as announced in a flashy trailer at the Summer Game Fest. I have no idea if playing this will be as intense as the visual heart attack it looks to be. But maybe when it comes out next month I'll try it out. </p>

<p>It's due out on July 2nd. Mecha Break is set on our planet, post-catastrophe, where a shadowy organisation called, uh, S.H.A.D.O.W. have hired you as a pilot and cannonfodder in a grand and doubtless unending war. </p>
<p>"Assault, melee, sniper, reconnaissance, support," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2452280/Mecha_BREAK/">the Steam page</a>. "Choose your preferred mech and take on enemies across three distinct combat modes: 3v3 Deathmatch, 6v6 Hero Shooter, or PvPvE Extraction Shooter." </p>
<p>Why that's basically all the flavours of live service you could possibly want, squished into one game. I don't know whether to be worried or impressed.</p>
<p>The shame I feel for not having covered Mecha Break thus far is only half a joke. Institutionally speaking, RPS has long welcomed the giant robots and robotic suits that smoke with the embers of battle. Whether that's the greeble and grit of ye olde <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hawken">Hawken</a>, the fearful mechmommies of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-forever-winter">The Forever Winter</a>, or the cocaine-infused mechamurder of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/psycho-patrol-r">Psycho Patrol R</a>.

            <p>The makers of the Yakuza games have revealed the title of the historical brawler they teased at last year's Game Awards, then known as "Project Century".

<p>Nice fedora. The character we follow looks to be detectiving a bit. Knocking on doors and inspecting a cigarettes which will "draw immense hostility" if you choose to smoke them. Disgusting habit. The player also gets a petrol bomb thrown at them, they dodge a bullet, they throw a man off a bridge. Just everyday hijinks they got up to last century, those lovable scamps.</p>
<p>Although this sample of fighting goons and clearing out alleyways is set in wartime Japan, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-makers-of-yakuza-are-working-on-project-century-a-new-third-person-brawler-set-in-1915">the previous trailer</a> was set in 1915. That means there's some jumping around in history going on. It'll be intersting to see what's going on here. An intergenerational story of fmaily, betrayal and redemption that'll span the entire 20th century? I'm not saying that's what's definitely going on - just speculatising - but if anyone can do that, the folks at Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio probably can.</p>
<p>Ah, but will it be on PC? Probably, although Sega aren't telling us how or when. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Ghostface Killah asks you to rescue his Wu brothers so that you can battle alongside them and use their legendary skills to restore Shaolin, the home of Wu-Tang. As you progress, you'll collect jewels to customize your fighting style and from the description of the game, it sounds like you'll see your work reflected in the community of Shaolin.</p><p>The game sports an "afro-surrealist meets anime-inspired" art design and increasingly difficult battles against fantastical enemies through the "Chambers" of the world. The game sports a soundtrack that includes classic Wu-Tang tracks and new material overseen by producer Just Blaze. You can play with up to two friends for three-player co-op gaming.</p><p>No release date is available so far, but the game is set to come to PC via Steam and Epic Games Store when it does release.</p>

Unlike Grounded, there's a lot more than just big bugs to deal with in Infinitesimals' world. The group of explorers you play as encounters an alien civilization with advanced robotics, and they don't all seem pleased to meet you.</p><p dir="ltr">"Play as the leader of an elite alien squadron stranded on a mysterious planet after a catastrophic crash," the game's official description reads. "Barely the size of an insect, you must navigate an enormous world filled with towering terrain, local wildlife, and deadly machines. As you search for the missing members of your team and uncover the fate of the vanished colony you were meant to join, you’ll face the relentless threat of the Hunter Gatherers, the mechanical sentinels that dominate the landscape."</p><p dir="ltr">Epic Games will publish Infinitesimals, and it's set for a 2026 release date on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
