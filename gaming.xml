            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> is out today and it‚Äôs already blowing up on Steam. The multiplayer military shooter is already well on its way to a million concurrents on Steam alone as fans race to witness the franchise‚Äôs revival after years of <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912">stumbles and collective disappointment</a>. The record-breaking influx initially meant long queues but now some players are facing others issues, including a weird bug that tells them they need to buy and download a multiplayer mode they already own to start playing.</p> <p>Currently in the top-five most played games on Steam, <em>Battlefield</em> is the only game in the top four that‚Äôs paid. A $70 price tag hasn‚Äôt stopped it from overtaking Valve‚Äôs<em> Dota 2</em> and <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, or the perennial chart-topping battle royale<em> PUBG</em>. Players logging on when the game went live around 11:00 a.m. ET on Friday were immediately greeted by absurd queue positions featuring hundreds of thousands of other players trying to get into the always-online game.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">350,000 in the queue for Battlefield 6 already ü§Ø <a href="https://t.co/O6tPcS7e7R">pic.twitter.com/O6tPcS7e7R</a></p> <p>‚Äî Tyler James (@FreakyMusic_) <a href="https://twitter.com/FreakyMusic_/status/1976666403723006090?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Battlefield</em> lead producer David Sirland <a href="https://twitter.com/tiggr_/status/1974844687484641683?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1974844687484641683%7Ctwgr%5Ebe0e9b592c93c25f20d70e73f251027fe236f8e8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamesradar.com%2Fgames%2Fbattlefield%2Fbattlefield-6-lead-tempts-fate-says-servers-should-be-ready-for-launch-after-numerous-betas-across-pc-and-consoles%2F">previously</a> seemed confident that the sequel would be prepared to welcome in the flood of day-one players following months of beta hype and promising feedback. DICE was quick to point out that login queues are part of trying to keep the ramp-up process ‚Äúsmooth and stable for everyone.‚Äù That didn‚Äôt stop fans from jabbing each other with screenshots of their positions on social media and the Battlefield subreddit. Long before anyone has a KDA to brag about in <em>Battlefield 6</em>, fans are turning to queue positions as high-score markers of elite status. Can anyone <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o340g7/i_think_people_are_trying_to_play_bf6_idk_maybe/">beat 458,400</a>?</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bro‚Ä¶.<br>how doe i play the game now? <a href="https://t.co/wMwXmmHGWm">pic.twitter.com/wMwXmmHGWm</a></p> <p>‚Äî DjKr4m3r Gaming (@djkr4m3r) <a href="https://twitter.com/djkr4m3r/status/1976671821476073568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>But other players have been facing a strange issue in which, even after getting into the game, they would be asked to install it. ‚ÄúRunning into an error with <em>Battlefield 6</em> that states I need to install multiplayer, and it shows me all the files I need to install,‚Äù one wrote on X. ‚ÄúDoes anyone have any fixes? I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm going to have to queue again.‚Äù <a href="https://x.com/NachoCapart/status/1976678451252953251">Someone else</a> even tried deleting the game, reinstalling everything, and queuing again to try and get in. ‚ÄúIf it works, please tell me,‚Äù another player wrote back.</p>

 <p>So far, EA has said it‚Äôs aware of the problem but hasn‚Äôt shared advice on how to address it. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre aware of an issue preventing players from accessing the game with some receiving an error stating they need to purchase DLC or similar,‚Äù it announced around noon on Friday. ‚ÄúStay tuned for further updates as the team investigates this issue.‚Äù</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000634048" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634048"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634048">Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>In the meantime, <em>Battlefield 6</em> seems well on its way to living up to to the initial blitz of player interest some had been predicting. Data firm Ampere Analysis <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/about-that-ea-deal">told <em>The Game Business</em></a> it was forecasting 1.7 million copies pre-ordered on Steam alone. If all of them login within the first 24 hours, the fall blockbuster will be well on its way to being Steam‚Äôs most-played game so far this month.</p> <p>To break into the top 10 of all-time highest concurrent player counts, it‚Äôll need to beat <em>Banana</em>‚Äòs 917,000 record. The top spot is still held by <em>PUBG</em> at over 3.2 million players simultaneously. EA will probably be content with having already edged out its own free-to-play giant <em>Apex Legends</em>, though. No wonder Activision seems so worried <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-free-battlefield-6-call-of-duty-rivalry-2000633176">about <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> this year</a>. It‚Äôs the first time in six years it‚Äôs had to go head-to-head with a <em>Battlefield</em> that had a single-player campaign, even if this one has <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379">left many critics overwhelmed</a>.</p>

The bad news, the prices might be a little too hot to handle for some. Here's what's available, alongside some handy tips on how to find the restocked items and even just a little less right now.</p><div catalogid="4aaeaa5d-9765-4a22-8fef-b266790ea2f0" id="227468"><div id="227468" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Elite Trainer Box (Mega Gardevoir)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Let's start things off with the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aeKpbl?object_uuid=18c603a1-2e09-401e-8571-a4f74e078d10&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mega Evolution Elite Trainer Box (ETB)</a>. You're getting nine Mega Evolution booster packs, one full-art foil promo card featuring Riolu or Alakazam, 65 card sleeves, 40 energy cards, a player‚Äôs guide to the Mega Evolution expansion, six damage-counter dice, one competition-legal coin-flip die, and the collector‚Äôs box to hold everything.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">MSRP is $49.99, but these run at a 100% markup right now, and the market price sits around $90-$100 at the time of writing. So, while Amazon does have this in stock, it is also listed at <em>market </em>price ($99.99), not MSRP. It's good for those who have the cash and want an easy and reliable free delivery. You might even have some gift card credit leftover you want to use.</p></div><div catalogid="4aaeaa5d-9765-4a22-8fef-b266790ea2f0" id="227470"><div id="227470" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>ME01: Mega Evolution (MEG)</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Booster Bundle (6 Packs)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Mega Evolution Booster Bundle is in similar situation, and in stock for <a href="https://zdcs.link/QOgykM?object_uuid=18c603a1-2e09-401e-8571-a4f74e078d10&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$59.99 at Amazon</a>. That's around a 100% markup from the MSRP of $29.99. It includes six Mega Evolution boosters, which works out at almost exactly $10 per pack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, if those prices arent what you're looking for, you're next best bet for finding ETBs or Booster Bundles for the new set is via trusted resale sites like <a href="https://zdcs.link/zj7Gpv?object_uuid=18c603a1-2e09-401e-8571-a4f74e078d10&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TCGPlayer</a>. In my opinion its the best place to find sealed booster sets like these, and often enough it's cheaper than paying directly through Amazon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Right now, that's certainly the case, as you can buy the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wRDGx?object_uuid=18c603a1-2e09-401e-8571-a4f74e078d10&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ETB for around $90-$92</a> including shipping, and the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z12dY?object_uuid=18c603a1-2e09-401e-8571-a4f74e078d10&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Booster Bundle for around $54-$56</a>. It's a small saving compared to Amazon, but still a saving nonetheless.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Mega Evolution Chase Cards</h3><h2 data-cy="title2">Pok√©mon TCG: Upcoming Black Friday Deals</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The closer we get to the November, the more likely you are to see the word "Black Friday" peppered across your every waking moment. Pok√©mon TCG deals during the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/black-friday">Black Friday</a> sales are a complicated beast, as it's unlikely you're going to find much at all that's actually below its original MSRP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for something more immediate, the best advice I can give is to consider <a href="https://zdcs.link/weNPx?object_uuid=18c603a1-2e09-401e-8571-a4f74e078d10&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon's Prime Visa Card</a>. If you're a Prime Member already, you'll bag a $150 gift card (that you can immediately use to buy Pok√©mon cards if you so wish), and up to 7% cashback on purchaes using the card. It's a little niche, but if you don't mind the credit check it's not a bad deal.</p></div><div catalogid="a6b8451e-4fef-449d-8d7e-2f84cb84f315" id="203056"><div id="203056" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Amazon Prime Visa Card</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>7% cashback on Amazon purchases, no annual fee</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're not keen, for now you're better off holding out for another Walmart+ drop like the one that went down most recently. In case you missed the news, Walmart was granting early access to rare elusive TCG sets as part of its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walmart-collector-con-sale-includes-rare-magic-the-gathering-commander-decks-boosters-prime-day">Collector Con sale</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That includes <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-prime-day-elite-trainer-box-discount-walmart-plus-early-access">Prismastic Evolution ETBs for $59.99</a>, a huge discount compared to the $200 minimum you‚Äôll currently find on other marketplaces like <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxxLBp?object_uuid=18c603a1-2e09-401e-8571-a4f74e078d10&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>TCGPlayer</u></a> for the same set. There was also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-phantasmal-flames-preorder-walmart-plus-early-access-in-stock">Phantasmal Flame preorders</a>, including ETBs for $55, another giant saving considering these go for $150+ resale right now as well. There was a bunch more included as well, such as action figures, Magic: The Gathering sets, and more, but you get the gist.</p></div><div catalogid="33f87b44-ee72-4240-98ad-021acd5d3806" id="192311"><div id="192311" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Walmart+ Membership</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>30-day free trial available. Then it's $12.95/month, or $98/year.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea is that after that early access period, the deals will then be made available to the wider public who don‚Äôt have Walmart+. However, given how quickly almost any MSRP-priced stock sells out, most items are typically gone way before general buyers can even get a sniff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don't want to miss out on the next one, alongside any of Walmart's upcoming Black Friday deals (which they also put on early access for), I'd suggest picking up a Walmart+ membership when you can. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's $12.95/mo, or $98 annually, and offers a range of benefits beyond early shopping privileges. Members receive free delivery with no order minimum, savings on fuel, access to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/paramount-plus"><u>Paramount+</u></a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/peacock"><u>Peacock</u></a> at no extra cost, and additional perks such as pharmacy delivery and discounts at selected partners.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is Senior Commerce Editor and IGN's resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/motordoom">Mot√∂rdoom</a> boasts one of those genre mash-ups that it can be difficult to understand, on paper, what's going on. It's a "freestyle-sports roguelite horde shooter that combines high octane, visceral combat with fluid movement and trick mechanics," its <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/motordoom-switch/?srsltid=AfmBOoqTU8fWvPp7Dq5U_BZMlbV3GIMzEFtFiA_kA3ELJP5YUD__DqMb">eShop listing</a> reads, which feels like a lot of words for what can basically be boiled down to, <em>kill demons while pulling off sick BMX skills</em>.</p>
<p>This one arrives on the Switch eShop on <strong>7th November</strong> for <strong>$16.99</strong> (the EU page is not live at the time of writing), and it looks really rather gnarly. The above trailer tells you everything you need to know. It's a roguelike where you have to kill as many of the horde demons as possible while pulling off combos on your chainsaw-driven pit bike. Has anything made you want to shout "<em>dude!!</em>" more?</p>
<p>Developer Hobo Cat Games has added a dash of deckbuilder gameplay (because <em>of course</em>) in the shape of cards that boost your abilities, and there are unlockable characters and bikes to give you something to work towards between runs. And putting the 'k' in rogueli<em>k</em>e, an overall meta-progression system will have you gaining bike add-ons for better builds as you go.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the key features and a handful of screenshots from the eShop listing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‚óÜCareer Mode (Inspired by classic extreme sports games)<br>
‚óÜSingle Run Mode (Highscore Mode)<br>
‚óÜEndless Run Mode (Highscore Mode without Time or Level limit)<br>
‚óÜFree Ride Mode<br>
‚óÜDifficulty settings for all skill levels<br>
‚óÜ5 Arenas<br>
‚óÜ7 Characters<br>
‚óÜ5 Bosses<br>
‚óÜ35 different Demonic Offering Cards<br>
‚óÜUnlockable Bike Add-Ons<br>
‚óÜUnlockable Bike and Rider Skins</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The old school polygonal art style might not be to everyone's tastes, but after launching on Steam last year, you just know that such a gnarly mash-up will be up someone's street.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-as-told-by-steam-reviews.1322071/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Borderlands 4</i> arrived last month on September 12‚Äìand some people are <i>still</i> waiting for shader compilation! That‚Äôs a preview of what you can expect in this edition of ‚ÄúAs Told By Steam Reviews,‚Äù because, ya‚Äôll, either this game really, truly runs that poorly or the mimetic nature of the internet is working overdrive here.</p> <p>You‚Äôll quickly spot a trend when it comes to perusing <i>BL4</i>‚Äôs user reviews on Steam: Folks are generally struggling to enjoy this game&nbsp; not because of the story or the gunplay‚Äì the reviews mostly speak favorably of those elements. No, that pale orange ‚ÄúMixed‚Äù review status on the game‚Äôs Steam page is the result of countless reviews trashing how this game runs, with particular ire directed toward Unreal Engine 5, and for Gearbox‚Äôs talkative CEO who also <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-patch-console-crash-pitchford-2000626826">spent some time doubling as tech support</a> after this game‚Äôs bumpy release.</p>

 <p>It‚Äôs hard to find a negative review that doesn‚Äôt just meditate on the misery of eternal shader compilation and signature UE5 stuttering. But those who ain‚Äôt too hot on what <i>BL4</i> is selling seem to find the open world a little shallow. On top of that, there are some who seem to just prefer <i>BL2</i>‚Äôs writing over the narrative and dialogue here.</p> <p>Positive reviews, however, reflect that <i>Borderlands</i>‚Äô gun-handling has come a long way since the awkwardness it exhibited of the earlier entries. It feels like a more refined shooter experience than ever, and, to some at least, it seems the writing is much better.</p> <p>So let‚Äôs get onto <i>Borderlands 4</i>, as told by Steam reviews!</p> <h2>‚ÄòWho are you and what have you done to the borderlands writing team?!‚Äô</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000634026" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634026"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634026">¬© Screenshot: Valve / SkeleBen / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>‚ÄòYou straight up can‚Äôt play this game if you‚Äôre broke.‚Äô</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000634029" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634029"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634029">¬© Screenshot: Valve / OnionMuncher / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000634030" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634030"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634030">¬© Screenshot: Valve / Mister Macaroni / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>‚ÄòThe structure of the balance, postgame and gear has actual thought behind it for once.‚Äô</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000634031" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634031"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634031">¬© Screenshot: Valve / LazyData / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000634032" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634032"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634032">¬© Screenshot: Valve / Tchii / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>‚ÄòBorderlands 4 feels like that first sip of an energy drink at 2 AM when you know you‚Äôre gaming all night.‚Äô</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000634034" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634034"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634034">¬© Screenshot: Valve / Shinigami/ Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>‚ÄòMost importantly the writing has taken a step in the right direction.‚Äô</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000634036" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000634036"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000634036">¬© Screenshot: Valve / Xzanos / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>‚ÄòRandy needs to get off twitter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has revealed the latest in its&nbsp;<em>Universes Beyond&nbsp;</em>series of&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering&nbsp;</em>crossovers, and I hope you're ready to get tubular, because the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are on their way to a tabletop near you.</p>

<p>Launching on March 6th, the new&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering - Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&nbsp;</em>set will feature new sets of boosters, as well as a brand new Commander deck featuring none other than the Turtles' leader himself, Leonardo.</p>

<p>Per a press release, while Leonardo will serve as the Commander deck's face commander, you'll also be able to take advantage of a new mechanic that allows you to combine the strength of two Commanders with the Partner ability.</p>

<p>Eastman himself has returned to illustrate the new set's four headliner cards, which all feature "original borderless artwork" by the&nbsp;<em>TMNT&nbsp;</em>creator, as well as a "shiny stamp" of his signature.</p>

<p>Additionally, existing&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering&nbsp;</em>cards will be tricked out with&nbsp;<em>TMNT</em>-themed artwork in the new set's Collector Boosters. Wizards has revealed a new&nbsp;<em>Turtles</em>-themed version of Doubling Season, but there are 20 source material cards with new artwork in total.</p>

<p>Not only that, but lands in the new set will be decked out with new full-art pizza variants as part of new Pizza Bundles, although Wizards promises that "the toppings are sure to be contentious". I think that's probably an understatement, given what we've seen so far.</p>

            <p>Drive faster, she screams as a cacophony of meepy noises, it's coming! I know, headstand lady, I know, comes my response from behind the wheel. We'd be safe if I hadn't botched one of the switchbacks and gently skidded into a low wall. I'd best put my foot down if I want to escape the demo of mysterious delivery driver Truckful without finding out what happens when a little truck is swallowed by a bigger truck.</p>

<p>This is the sort of mystery promised by Truckful's trundling down otherwise picturesque forest lanes and tracks. Another mystery is how you, the player, ended up permanently stuck in the cab of a plucky little pickup. The game tries to play that one one off as a joke. To be fair, the pretty brief and linear demo is keen to get on with the quick slice of a day and night's trucking it offers to delve too deep into any mysteries just yet.</p>
<p>Assuming the rest of the game follows suit, your time when the sun's up in Truckful is spent making deliveries to various locations. I had to pick up a lady called Rotti whose van had broken down. I pulled up behind it and loaded both her and her cargo into my pickup's bed. There's some nice physics stacking to packing seven objects into just four slots, and amid the precarious balancing I discover that I can flip items upside down. I have to pack Rotti in the back too, so decide to plonk her on her bonce. She doesn't seem to mind. </p><p>Truckful's side-on camera and narrow, windy roads aren't too challenging when your only obstacle's the occasional herd of sheep blocking the road, but they are tricky enough to punish carelessness. My racing instincts kicked in at one point while descending a hill, and the resulting bunch of flowers sent flying from the truck bed instantly failed the mission and sent me back to the previous roadside checkpoint.</p>
<p>Delivering the goods to an old lady's garage was repaid by her restoring the truck's lights and horn, allowing myself and Rotti to venture out into the night. Rotti now elected to sit the right way up and in the passenger seat, which I found slightly disappointing. Just as the darkness was making the game's chill woodland vibes really sing, a great noise erupted behind us. A haunting horn, somewhere between an air raid siren that needs to blow its nose and a cargo ship's mournful cry. The ghost truck. Despite the need to haul ass making the flowing turns even tougher to thread through, I was on track to easily outrun the beast until the mistake. The fact I survived and was able to re-open a gap pretty rapidly on the way out of the woods maybe suggests the revenant rig will need to up its game to be a threat.</p>
<p>This was only a short taste of Truckful though, so there's every chance it does. I've come out of it still in two minds as to whether the game'll have much to offer in terms of in-depth mysterious substance beyond the initial spectral semi intrigue, but what I've played certainly wasn't lacking in charm or chill driving atmos.</p>
<p>Truckful's set to release in 2026, and you can find this new demo on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3090810/Truckful/">Steam page</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>AI‚Äôs all-encompassing usefulness is now well beyond debate. A stellar AI tool is great. An AI tool on sale for 82% off is even better. An AI tool on sale for 82% off that you can also stack with a special checkout code that drops another $10 from the price and gives you a lifetime subscription for just $30? That‚Äôs downright unbeatable, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4692/">that‚Äôs what‚Äôs waiting for you right how at StackSocial ‚Äî a lifetime license to 1min.AI is all yours for $30.</a></p>
<p>1min.AI also spares you from doing the deep dive to find out which of the ever-growing number of AI models is the best one to use, because 1min.AI is not an AI model ‚Äî it‚Äôs a smorgasbord of several AI models all in one interface. So if you‚Äôre already signed up for several model subscriptions, now‚Äôs your chance to streamline them, reduce your bills, and not miss out on any of the latest AI advances.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4692/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2>Newbies Welcome</h2>
<p>Even if you‚Äôre just now dipping your toe into the AI pond (which is more like an ocean by now), and the idea of suddenly having several different models at your fingertips is intimidating, there‚Äôs no need for concern. 1min.AI is amazingly accessible even for newbies. The intuitive user interface is easy to learn once you start feeding it text and/or images and asking it to generate your desired output.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre working with visuals, you can even backtrack if you don‚Äôt like what 1min.AI has done with your creative suggestions. It has a Generative Remove tool to take out unwanted elements, giving you ultimate control over your own creative vision. And that vision can take its form virtually any way you like when you deploy the AI models of 1min.AI: image generation, keyword research, content creation ‚Äî it‚Äôs basically limitless.</p>



<h2>One Payment, All the Power</h2>
<p>The one-time purchase of a lifetime subscription to 1min.AI gives you access to AI models including GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini Pro 1.5, Llama 3, MistralAI, Command, and more. In time you‚Äôll find which one suits your needs best, and the odds are different needs will be handled best by different models.</p>
<p>The lifetime subscription to 1min.AI‚Äôs Pro plan is all-inclusive, with all future updates covered ‚Äî no recurring costs or monthly fees buried in the small print. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4692/">It normally sells for $234, but StackSocial‚Äôs 82% off deal brings the price down to $40, and when you add the code <strong>SAVE10</strong> at checkout, the price gets knocked down to just $30</a>. It doesn‚Äôt require any artificial intelligence to see what a great deal this is.</p>

              <p>How will Radiance Cores make make web-slinging even better in <em>Spider-Man 3</em>? How much of<em> Battlefield 7</em> will be AI-generated once Saudi Arabia takes over? And why is licensed DLC fueling a <em>Sonic</em> kart-racing renaissance? Welcome to another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‚Äòs daily roundup of gaming news and culture. The Eagles spiked another one last night. Now begins the annual Philly football crashout before things start to recover after Thanksgiving.</p>   <p>The architect behind Sony‚Äôs upcoming gaming hardware sat down with AMD‚Äôs senior VP of computing, Jack Huynh, to discuss how the two companies‚Äô joint partnership in advancing GPU tech will make Joel‚Äôs beard in <em>The Last of Us Part I</em> look even more awe-inducing on next-gen hardware. They talked about Neural Arrays, Radiance Cores, and Universal Compression. No, these aren‚Äôt <a href="https://x.com/JackMHuynh/status/1976272374543630842?s=19"><em>Destiny 2</em> patch notes</a>, they‚Äôre a roadmap to what will seemingly make gaming on PS6 marginally better than current-gen tech.</p>

 <p>In layman‚Äôs terms, it‚Äôs all supposed to mean more efficiency that lets developers draw better performance and visual fidelity out of the existing GPU. It will seemingly scale with AI tech to give you more bang for your buck across the spectrum, whether you‚Äôre playing on a high-end living room console or the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-leak-specs-sony-handheld-price-release-date-2000614206">rumored PlayStation handheld</a> that‚Äôs coming. Cerny didn‚Äôt call out the PS6 by name but did suggest it will be here in the next ‚Äúfew years.‚Äù</p>

 <p>‚ÄúOverall, it‚Äôs of course still very early days for these technologies, they only exist in simulation right now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut the results are quite promising and I‚Äôm really excited about bringing them to a future console in a few years‚Äô time.‚Äù Microsoft is also working with AMD on its next-gen hardware, which it <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-next-gen-console-leak-rumor-costco-sams-club-2000632026">promises it hasn‚Äôt canceled</a>.</p>

 <h2>Players are having too much fun with the new <em>Minecraft</em> pack in <em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</em></h2>   <p>The <em>Minecraft</em> pack arrived in-game this week and costs $6 for the addition of Steve, Alex, Creeper, the<em> Minecraft</em> vehicle and World course, and other cosmetics.

 <h2>EA exec calls generative AI ‚Äúvery seducing‚Äù</h2> <p>Speaking of everyone‚Äôs favorite $1 trillion Ponzi scheme, EA‚Äôs general manager of DICE and Criterion Games, Rebecka Coutaz, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8xrkxdkkrno">told the <em>BBC</em></a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-exec-insists-players-wont-see-anything-made-by-very-seducing-generative-ai-in-battlefield-6"><em>IGN</em></a>) that there is no generative AI in the finished version of <em>Battlefield 6</em>, though the technology is used early in the development process ‚Äúto allow more time and more space to be creative.‚Äù CEO Andrew Wilson previously told investors that AI was going to be at the heart of everything the company does moving forward, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-bioware-ai-lgbtq-debt-junk-bond-2000630647">some developers within the company</a> have told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> there‚Äôs new pressure from above to experiment with AI tools wherever possible.</p>

 <p><em>The Financial Times</em> reported that EA‚Äôs new Saudi and private equity owners are banking on an AI transformation to help it pay off $20 billion in debt. &nbsp;‚ÄúIf we can break the magic with AI it will help us be more innovative and more creative,‚Äù Coutaz told the<em> BBC</em>.</p> <h2><em>Fortnite</em>‚Äòs new Ghostface mythic weapon is wrecking people</h2>   <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/blueskynoise.com/post/3m2rxomnvss2u">The Last Call Knife</a> changes your costume to the <em>Scream</em> icon and offers voice lines and a speed bonus.

<p>Battlefield 6 has launched, and its all-time player peak on Steam keeps rising by the second, with the number sitting at over 700k at the time of writing, surpassing Call of Duty‚Äôs record. </p>



<p>The anticipation for Battlefield 6‚Äôs launch has been at an all-time high since the open-beta weekends, where players flocked in huge numbers. However, the beta has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-betas-smaller-maps-were-intentional/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">smaller maps</a> and fewer features to try out. The full version of BF6 has been released right now, and players are pouring in by the thousands. </p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-all-time-steam-peak-surpasses-700k-within-the-first-hour">Battlefield 6 All-Time Steam Peak Surpasses 700k Within the First Hour</h2>



<p>As spotted on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, Battlefield 6‚Äôs all-time Steam peak concurrent number sits at 704,005 at the time of writing, and the number keeps going higher every time you refresh the page. That‚Äôs not all, Battlefield 6‚Äôs launch numbers on Steam have also beaten Call of Duty‚Äôs all-time peak, which stands at 491,670. </p>



<p>The game has additionally beaten its all-time peak from the open beta weekends, which sat at 521,000. Moreover, it is just Friday; a whole weekend remains, so the number could go even higher as the days go on. </p>



<p>For those who haven‚Äôt checked out the title, Battlefield 6 brings back iconic all-out warfare, where players can wage war with infantry and vehicle combat, including fighter jets, tanks, and more. The game features tactical destruction, where players destroy their surroundings to gain a tactical advantage over their opponents. The title also introduces the new Kinesthetic Combat System, a global-scale campaign, several multiplayer modes, the massive sandbox mode, Portal, and an upcoming battle royale mode. </p>



<p>In other news, the developers of Battlefield 6 have confirmed that the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-wont-use-anything-made-by-generative-ai-devs-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not use generative AI</a>. Also, players are already making <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-community-is-already-making-star-wars-ships/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars ships</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-maps-remade-in-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty maps</a> in the game‚Äôs Portal mode.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">During its panel at New York Comic Con, Playground Productions not only looked back on the return and relaunch of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/backyard-sports-revival-officially-announced-by-playground-productions">the beloved Backyard Sports video games,</a> but it also announced it will be completing its Backyard Sports retro collection with Backyard Basketball '01 and Backyard Hockey '02 in mid-November, that there are high scores and events coming to Backyard Baseball '97, and it shared a few new details for the series' upcoming animated special. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To learn more, IGN had the chance to speak to Playground Productions CEO Linday Barnett and Chief Product Officer Chris Waters about the past and future of this fan-favorite franchise, and we began by chatting about what makes these games so special.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We think it works because the games have always been character-first, comedy-forward, and accessible," Waters said. "These games weren't, 'Hey, let's make the most incredibly realistic simulation,' they were, 'let's recreate the experience of what it felt like to go out and pick up a bat and a ball, grab whatever friends you had around whether they're athletic or not, and go out and play baseball and see what madness ensues.' That madness transcends time and transcends technology." </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Backyard Sports' Retro Library Will Be Complete in Mid-November, New Features Headed to Backyard Baseball '97</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you are new to the franchise or returning to it, you'll be happy to know that the Backyard Sports retro library will be complete when Backyard Basketball '01 and Backyard Hockey '02 are released on Steam in mid-November. Oh, and did we mention both will be free to download and keep?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These games, alongside Baseball '97, Baseball '01, Football '99, Soccer '98, will also be part of the Backyard Sports Retro Bundle, which will be available for $26 - a 40% savings from buying all the games individually. Players will even be able to 'Complete the Set' and only pay for the games you don't have yet at the cheaper price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Furthermore, the Backyard Soccer '98 and Backyard Basketball '01 mobile versions will be free on iOS and Android when that Steam retro bundle goes live later next month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of mobile, Backyard Baseball '97 is getting a new gamification feature in collaboration with Lucra. Fans can now compete against each other in week-long and month-long events like Home Run Competitions or Most Strikeouts. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/10/123-1760093189150.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Global high scores will be tracked in real-time, and the new feature will be free for fans and even includes a chance to win tickets to the 2025 World Series, a Pablo Sanchez trading card, and more. This feature will begin on iOS to start, and players will need to opt-iin and provide some personal information. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What we want to do is allow that community to grow and for players to be able to engage with each other," Waters said of the new gamification features. "And again, without the source code, we can't make these games, but by adding a tournament layer onto them, we're sort of creating a backdoor co-op mode."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fun fact, Playground Productions did not get the source code for most of these games when they acquired the rights, so the team had to hack the old CD-ROMs and rebuilt the games themselves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We thought those games were just dead," Barrnett told us. "And it was an incredible feat that Mega Kat Studios was able to do, which is reverse engineer and hack the CD-ROMs to make them playable. The thing that we didn't know in all of this, however, was that we'd be able to make the games even better and we were able to remove certain bugs that existed in the original games and add leaderboards and add competitions and just make them playable on systems that didn't even exist back then, like Nintendo Switch."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Future of Backyard Sports Includes an Animated Special That Just Finished Production</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We then shifted our talk to the future. While the team wasn't ready to reveal anything about future games, they did confirm that Backyard Sports officially wrapped production on their new animated special that builds upon the brand's beloved IP and characters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This special is being produced by Lighthouse Studios, which is known for its work on Bob's Burgers and Rick &amp; Morty, and it will feature an "all-star cast" that will be announced in early November. As for when you can see it, the special will be released at Dave &amp; Buster's in early 2026 and direct to consumer shortly after. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What makes Backyard Sports special is the characters," Waters said. "For us, the opportunity to take your favorite characters and bring them to life in a new way was a no-brainer as we've already said this is a multi-platform franchise we want to go beyond games. We all loved how beautiful the animation was in the games and how much love and care they put in, and it made you love and understand the characters and made you want to pick a certain character. So, we are really, really humbled to be able to extend that into more animation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This special was our way of establishing a tone, establishing a look, and really putting our flag down to say, Backyard is a multi-platform franchise. You're going to be able to experience it in lots of different ways. I can't wait until we can say more, but I can promise you that I've got a 20-year history in animation and we have pulled out all the stops to make something that captures the tone and magic and comedy of this world."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/10/20240818-055213000-ios-1724085212284-1760093211100.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">First look at the Backyard Sports revival from 2024, featuring Pablo Sanchez and Stephanie Morgan</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With Backyard Sports, the team wants these games and multimedia projects to showcase just how fun sports can be and for this new generation to enjoy all of this alongside those that grew up with them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Streamers have picked these games up and people aren't watching them because they're amazing video game players," Waters said. "They're watching them because they're bringing these kids to life through their own lens. It reminds you of what it was like to play baseball the first time you picked up a glove and a bat and a ball and you were just playing for fun. I think that's been the big thing for why this really is a timeless and classic franchise."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It is celebrating all of the different characters in your backyard and all their strengths and maybe even some of the weaknesses," Barnett added. "You laugh and you get through everything together. You play together and you might win, you might lose, but you always had fun doing it. And unfortunately, a lot of sports, not just sports video games, but also just sports in general aren't really like that anymore."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Adam Bankhurst is a writer for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"You repeatedly refused to listen."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">More than 90 staff who worked on this year's blockbuster flop <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> have sent a searing open letter to the company's management calling for change, after "one of the worst video game launches this decade."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://x.com/IWGB_GW/status/1976622237848658253" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">letter</a> states that between 250 and 300 staff have now lost their jobs due to MindsEye's failure, something which is blamed squarely on the decisions of company bosses. There's strong criticism, too, of the way layoffs were handled, with the suggestion that misinformation may have lead to the "wrongful dismissal of dozens of staff members."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's letter, published through UK game development worker union IWGB, calls on MindsEye developer Build a Rocket Boy, and specifically its founder Leslie Benzies and co-CEO Mark Gerhard, to apologise for the "mistreatment" of staff and provide "proper compensation for laid-off employees," as well as make improvements to layoff processes, ahead of what sounds like expected "future reduncies."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"For years, you have expected [employees] to adapt to your every whim, with those in disagreement being shut down or cast aside," the letter reads. "These layoffs happened because you repeatedly refused to listen to your workforce's years of experience, resulting in one of the worst video game launches this decade."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Examples of issues faced due to management failures include "radical changes" to working practices with little explanation, "confusion and distress for all staff" as redundancies began ‚Äî including various errors in the dismissal process, and four months of mandatory overtime ahead of MindsEye's launch for which staff say they still have not been fully compensated.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"These and many other issues," the letter continues, "have caused pain and stress for your employees. Our experience at the company has been one of burnout, job insecurity, health issues, and the failure of a game that many of us have put years of our lives into."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">MindsEye Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In an email to IGN, the IWGB provided further quotes from former staff members backing up the letter's claims. One ex-MindsEye developer said that Build A Rocket Boy's "public statements of care have not matched the reality of working conditions" at the company. Another detailed seeing "mental and even physical illnesses, beyond the usual burnout" among fellow staff due to the months of overtime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Studio leadership have chosen not to take responsibility for the game's failure and instead blamed saboteurs, as if individual employees or online influencers could have caused this," one former employee stated, referencing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-co-ceo-claims-there-is-a-concerted-effort-by-some-to-trash-the-game-and-the-studio-suggests-people-are-being-paid-or-using-spam-bots-to-post-negative-comments">the bizarre comments made by Gerhard ahead of release</a> that blamed unnamed hostile forces for the game's poor reception ‚Äî a position that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-boss-says-he-doesnt-believe-people-are-being-paid-to-post-negative-comments-about-mindseye">MindsEye publisher IO Interactive later distanced itself from</a>. "The arrogance of leadership to believe they can act with impunity throughout development and the following redundancies has pushed myself and many former and continuing employees to take a stand."</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/10/barb-image-04-1500x1125-1760105423781.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Originally planned as a single-player component for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everywhere-the-ex-gta-devs-game-creator-that-may-be-too-late-to-the-party">Everywhere, a seemingly now-abandoned metaverse-style platform</a>, MindsEye ultimately launched to a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-dev-says-its-working-around-the-clock-to-improve-performance-amid-mixed-steam-user-reviews">negative response and lackluster sales</a>. Build a Rocket Boy has since said it wants to continue working on the game and give it something of a relaunch, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-delays-hitman-crossover-update-says-updates-may-be-less-frequent-going-forward">though more recently cautioned that this would take longer than planned</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's letter concludes with demands for a public apology and proper compensation, for remaining staff still at risk of redundancy to take payment in leave of notice, a commitment to use an external partner in future layoffs to prevent unfair treatment, and for a "concerted, meaningful and documented effort to improve conditions and processes within the company."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The treatment that workers at Build A Rocket Boy have been facing in the past 12 months has been shocking," IWGB Game Workers chairperson Spring McparlinJones said in a statement passed to IGN. "They have been routinely belittled, cheated, and manipulated by the company they dedicated years of their lives to. Despite this, they were able to keep trust in each other and work together to fight for fair treatment."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: IWGB </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

                <p dir="ltr">At the end of 2022, an unknown number of online leagues in Madden 23 were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-23s-disastrous-franchise-problems-continue-with-saves-permanently-lost/1100-6510276/">deleted overnight</a> due to what EA called a "data-storage issue that resulted in Franchise files being corrupted." Some players who were affected eventually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-restores-a-limited-number-of-madden-cloud-franchises-others-lost-for-good/1100-6510742/">got their leagues back</a>, while others never did. The total number of affected players or leagues was never revealed, but it wasn't an especially rare event, as the game's subreddit, EA Forums, and various Discord servers were flooded with players decrying their leagues' disappearances. Now, in Madden 26, something similar seems to be happening.</p><p dir="ltr">It hasn't occurred in one fell swoop, and a different--possibly more hopeful--error message is greeting affected players, but it's unclear why it's happening or if affected leagues can be salvaged.</p><p dir="ltr">The error message some players are getting reads, "Error: The requested league is temporarily unavailable. Please try again later. We apologize for any inconvenience. You have been returned to the Franchise launcher."</p><p dir="ltr">Normally, this is the message players may see if they try to access their league while a patch is being rolled out. But in this case, some players have been stuck staring at this message for weeks. One player in my league said his other league has been inaccessible for a month and a half. Yesterday, our 32-player league was hit with the same bug. We're now tentatively structuring our Plan B in case we need it.</p><p dir="ltr">There's no shortage of forum threads in which players are worried about their leagues having become permanently unavailable, like <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/madden-nfl-26-franchise-en/re-franchise-mode-league-unavailable-error/12680427" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/madden-nfl-26-franchise-en/franchise-mode-league-unavailable-error/12702061" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, and <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/madden-nfl-26-franchise-en/online-franchise-is-temporarily-unavailable/12646488" rel="nofollow">this one</a>. In fact, <a href="https://forums.ea.com/category/madden-nfl-26-en/discussions/madden-nfl-26-franchise-en" rel="nofollow">browsing by Franchise-related posts turns up many similar threads</a>. Naturally, the same is happening on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Madden/comments/1o29f5l/madden_franchise_error/" rel="nofollow">Reddit</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4583234-qo-8cxdw.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4583234" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4583234-qo-8cxdw.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4583234"></a><figcaption>Madden leagues are locking players out without apparent rhyme or reason.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4583234-qo-8cxdw.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's hard to say if the issue is happening more recently, but it's definitely affecting different leagues at different times, rather than hitting a number of leagues all at once like in 2022. Some players have reported that their leagues came back to life after a few days, while others have given up after weeks of waiting. On the EA Forums, a <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/madden-nfl-26-franchise-en/online-league-error/12635493/replies/12725728" rel="nofollow">community manager provided an update yesterday</a>, saying, "Apologies for the late reply on this one. We have notified the team that this has been happening with the leagues, and they are currently investigating this. Once we have more info on these or need any further information, we will update this thread."</p><p dir="ltr">This latest Franchise lockout doesn't seem to be occurring for the same reasons as when it happened in late 2022, but for affected players, the result is the same: A great deal of investment, sometimes hundreds of hours, is getting wiped out in the blink of an eye.</p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot has contacted EA for comment on this issue and will update this story if the publisher responds.</p>

                <p>In Battlefield lore, a Rendezook is a legendary maneuver that dates back to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-3/" data-ref-id="5000-43761">Battlefield 3</a>. It's become so ubiquitous with the series that DICE included a Rendezook in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-trailer-references-the-rendezook-feat-and-one-of-the-creators-is-stoked/1100-6492598/" data-ref-id="1100-6492598">the Battlefield 2042 announcement trailer</a>.

However, the platform-holders do not share up-to-the-minute player data like Valve does with Steam.</p><p>So far, the Battlefield 6 servers appear to be holding up against the influx of players.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> has just launched and already players are facing huge queues as servers reach maximum capacity.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, lead producer <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1974844687484641683">David Sirland stated on social media</a> the team was planning for launch day queues, adding the "open beta helped gauge the interest as well".</p>
<p>Indeed, the beta - which ran in August - had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-has-almost-250000-people-waiting-in-an-open-beta-queue">almost 250,000 players waiting in queues ahead of its launch</a>. It would seem, so far, launch day queues for the full game are just as busy.</p>

In reality, it‚Äôs primarily a speaker that can connect to sources over Bluetooth, a USB cable, or an analog audio cable, <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Speakers-in-the-design-of-a-gaming-PC-Edifier-New-Cyber-displays-CPU-load-via-2-8-inch-display.1134125.0.html">as spotted by <em>Notebookcheck</em></a>. The <a href="https://www.edifier.com/cn/product/product-866.html">Huazai New Cyber speaker</a> is currently available in China 1,499 yuan, or around $210 in aurora white and phantom black color options. It‚Äôs unclear if the company plans a wider global release.</p><p>The Cyber speaker pairs a 4-inch subwoofer on the with three passive radiators to further boost lower frequencies and two 52mm mid-high range drivers. Those are all hidden on the lower half of the speaker behind a fabric screen, while the upper portion features electronics like amplifiers, a power supply, braided speaker cables, and a signal processor that are arranged and mounted to look like components you‚Äôll find inside a gaming PC such as a graphics card and memory slots.</p><p>There are five circular RGB lighting elements with animated effects that make them appear to spin, mimicking the appearance of cooling fans, while a 2.8-inch screen can be used as a decorative element displaying images, screensavers, or custom messages. But it has some practical uses, too, such as showing performance metrics like CPU, RAM, and GPU usage while the speaker is connected to an actual computer with a USB cable, or song lyrics while streaming music from a smartphone.</p><p>The Cyber speaker‚Äôs footprint is comparable to bookshelf speakers which are often used as part of desktop PC setups. But to expand its usefulness while it‚Äôs gobbling up a sizable chunk of your desktop real estate, Edifier includes an additional USB-A and USB-C port you can use to charge other devices.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/798148/edifier-huazai-new-cyber-speaker-bluetooth-gaming-pc]]></content:encoded>

              <p><span>Last week, a Portland protestor named Seth Todd showed up at the ICE protests in the Oregon city dressed up in an inflatable frog costume. Footage of armed soldiers backing up as the protester confidently walked toward them went viral on social media, along with a video of an agent spraying pepper spray into the costume‚Äôs air filter. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/trump-autism-tylenol-press-conference-reaction-jokes-2000627950"><span>President Donald Trump</span></a><span> has been trying to </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/us/portland-oregon-trump-history"><span>paint a grim picture of the protests</span></a><span>, saying the city has become ‚Äúwar-ravaged,‚Äù but seeing a protestor dressed in a frog costume tells another story. Now, the frog costume has inspired dozens of other Portland citizens to dress up as animals as they continue to fight against ICE and America‚Äôs continued descent into fascism.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><i><span>The Oregonian</span></i><span>, a local outlet in Portland, interviewed several protesters last night, October 9, who came to the ICE facility dressed up as frogs in an act of solidarity.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 has officially launched worldwide. Even though it has a shiny new campaign, everyone wants to play online multiplayer. Unfortunately, the EA servers are biting back, so let‚Äôs check why you can‚Äôt play Battlefield 6 right now, and what‚Äôs happening with the server queues.</p>



<p>It was claimed by a Battlefield 6 dev that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-servers-should-be-ready-for-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">servers ‚ÄòShould be‚Äô ready for launch day</a>. This was not the case as players were left queuing for the brand-new game. Messages don‚Äôt always spread very quickly or widely. Meaning, many of you Battlefield 6 owners have been left in the dark over the game‚Äôs servers and long queues.</p>



<p>This quick explainer should help you if you‚Äôre one of the many having trouble with BF 6 servers.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-can-t-i-get-into-battlefield-6-servers-right-now-are-they-down">Why Can‚Äôt I Get Into Battlefield 6 Servers Right Now? Are They Down?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It‚Äôs a war, in more ways than one. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Battlefield 6 launch day queues are excessive because so many people are trying to play the game at once. The player base is so big that it‚Äôs overloading the EA servers, meaning players have to wait for other players to quit the game before being able to play.</strong></p>



<p>If you‚Äôre being met with a ‚ÄúGame Servers Full‚Äù screen when trying to play <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>, this is because the game‚Äôs maximum occupancy has been reached. The servers physically can‚Äôt handle any more players. It‚Äôs not because they‚Äôre down, they‚Äôre just full.</p>



<p>Again, EA was confident the servers would be ready, but it hasn‚Äôt worked out like that.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-the-battlefield-6-server-queue">How Long is The Battlefield 6 Server Queue?</h2>



<p><strong>The Battlefield 6 launch day queue is several hundred thousand players deep at times, meaning you could potentially be waiting a long time to play Battlefield 6.</strong></p>



<p>Consider these queues like a random ballot: Some people got in right away, and some of you could potentially have to wait 10 minutes, all the way up to an hour or more, if you‚Äôre unlucky. The server queues will likely never be this bad again, and it‚Äôs up to EA to add more servers and allow more people into the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-battlefield-6-right-now">How To Play Battlefield 6 Right Now</h2>



<p><strong>The only way to play Battlefield 6 online multiplayer right now is to wait in the queue until it‚Äôs your turn to get in.</strong></p>



<p>We absolutely understand this isn‚Äôt the answer you want‚Äî<em>believe us</em>. But it‚Äôs the simple reality of the situation. Battlefield 6 is one of the hottest game launches of 2025. The beta broke record numbers, and this launch was always going to be fierce.</p>



<p>Battlefield Studios did issue a warning ahead of launch, but it hasn‚Äôt spread as quickly as the company probably would‚Äôve liked.</p>

                <p>Once Battlefield 6 players start digging into user-created Portal content, they'll find that someone already made a familiar map from Battlefield's biggest competitor.</p><p>As Portal tools were already available a day before the release of Battlefield 6 itself, creator DANNYonPC took it upon himself to recreate Call of Duty's Shipment map using the Portal editor. In a YouTube video, the creator specified that this version of Shipment is based on the iteration seen in the 2019 Call of Duty: Modern Warfare reboot, which added some extra routes on higher ground.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZvmYdnQ_d0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FZvmYdnQ_d0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>First appearing in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, Shipment has brought its simple layout and unique brand of chaos to several titles, only rivaled by Nuketown in number of reappearances.</p><p>Shipment is a sensible first project to make in a map editor, given the map's tight quarters. Its small space almost always leads to frantic and explosive encounters where it's hard to last even a full minute before being gunned down or blown up. Arguably, Shipment is the antithesis of Battlefield's gameplay, which is more focused on large-scale encounters in a wide area.</p><p>With this creator revealing the map before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-times-seemingly-revealed-and-there-is-no-early-access/1100-6535079/" data-ref-id="1100-6535079">Battlefield 6 went live</a>, there was no actual gameplay footage in this Battlefield-ized Shipment, but people were already joking about it on social media, with user <a href="https://x.com/BrokenMachine/status/1976427319356203379" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">BrokenMachine</a> on X remarking: "We got Shipment in Battlefield 6 before GTA 6."</p><p>And that isn't all that happened to the game pre-launch--according to a report, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-generated-100-million-on-steam-from-pre-sales-report/1100-6535361/" data-ref-id="1100-6535361">Battlefield 6 already made $100 million</a> in revenue from pre-sales alone.
