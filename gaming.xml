              <p>In 2025 Marc-Alexis Côté, the head of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-mirage-red-hexe-multiplayer-delays-1850442019"><em>Assassin’s Creed</em> franchise </a>and a 20 year veteran of Ubisoft, abruptly left the publisher following the <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-sales-ubisoft-politics-culture-war-2000641428">launch of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a>. Three months ago he broke his silence to claim that he didn’t leave voluntarily but was pushed out of the company. Now he’s suing Ubisoft for nearly $1 million over what he alleges was a “constructive dismissal” after being demoted from leading the publisher’s biggest franchise.</p> <p><a href="https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2221328/marc-alexis-cote-ubisoft-assassins-creed">Radio-Canada reports</a> that the lawsuit was recently filed in the Superior Court of Quebec and claims $1.3 million Canadian dollars in damages, or roughly $935,000. In it, Côté details the events leading up to his departure from the company, including a meeting in the summer of 2025 when it apparently became clear that he would no longer remain in charge of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, the franchise he had led sine <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-infinity-live-service-mirage-valhalla-1849518253">a 2022 strategy reboot</a> outlined its ambitious future.</p>

 <p>Last year, Ubisoft launched a <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-charlie-yves-guillemot-tencent-far-cry-7-1851786421">subsidiary called Vantage Studios</a> backed by $1.25 billion in funding&nbsp; from Tencent that would house the publisher’s most profitable franchises: <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, and <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>. It’s led by North American studios head Christophe Derennes and CEO Yves Guillemot’s son,&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-guillemot-son-of-ubisoft-s-ceo-is-leaving-the-1846986415">Charlie Guillemot</a>. Prior to the move, Côté reported directly to Yves Guillemot.</p>

 <h2>An <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> veteran allegedly demoted</h2> <p>But under this new model, Ubisoft was looking to hire a Head of Franchise that would oversee all of its major IP, including <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, effectively demoting Côté, according to his lawsuit. The new position would also only be located in France, meaning Côté wouldn’t be eligible unless he was willing to relocate his life across the Atlantic.</p>

 <p>The veteran developer was reportedly offered a new position of franchise production head or an ambiguous role leading a “Creative House” overseeing a separate, lesser franchise within the company’s portfolio. When he declined and requested his severance for effectively losing his position in October, he alleges that Ubisoft took the surprise step of <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/i-did-not-walk-away-former-assassins-creed-boss-says-he-didnt-resign-he-was-asked-to-step-aside-by-ubisoft/">both internally</a> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-franchise-boss-departs-ubisoft">and publicly</a> announcing his “voluntary” departure the next day.</p>

 <p>“The past 24 hours have been deeply emotional,” he <a href="https://kotaku.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-says-he-didnt-jump-ubisoft-pushed-2000636542">wrote on LinkedIn at the time</a>. “Many of you have expressed surprise that I would choose to leave <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> after so many years, especially given the passion I still hold for it. The truth is simple: I did not make that choice.”&nbsp;Côté is now asking the Quebec court not only for damages and his severance, but to be released from a non-compete clause that limits the roles he can take elsewhere in the video game industry.</p>

 <h2>Longer dev cycles, fewer games</h2> <p>The lawsuit comes on the eve of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>‘ one-year anniversary, the last game in the franchise to ship with Côté, who has been working on the historical action series since 2010’s<em> Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood</em>, at the helm. That game was originally supposed to come out in 2024 but was delayed to provide additional development time after already marking the longest lull ever between new releases in the series.</p>

 <p>“We’re also shifting our development model to make it more sustainable for our teams, as previously we used to average about three years for each development cycle on <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>,” Côté <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/227nBAMiGtBTXKouvVkNyF/the-future-of-assassins-creed-feudal-japan-standalone-multiplayer-much-more">announced</a> back in 2022. “So we’re moving to longer dev cycles to make them more sustainable from a human and technological point of view, so that we can truly build on the shoulders of one another and then support our games for a longer period of time.”</p> <p>He said the franchise would evolve along two separate tracks, with <em>Shadows</em> representing the continued evolution of the open-world RPG formula that began with <em>Assassin’s Creed Origins</em> and the next entry, <em>Assassin’s Creed Hexe</em> directed by Clint Hocking, taking an approach that would feel “fresh and different.” Years later, however, some projects like the multiplayer spin-off <em>Invictus</em> and the mobile “AAA” game <em>Jade</em> remain MIA. A remake of <em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em>, meanwhile, is rumored to be launching in the next few months.</p> <p>Ubisoft and Côté did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

The game arrived under immense expectation, and it’s fair to say it ultimately proved more divisive than Nintendo and developer Retro Studios had hoped.</p>
<p>If <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/metroid-prime-4-beyond/">Metacritic scores</a> are anything to go by, Prime 4 reviewed well but stopped short of the near-universal acclaim enjoyed by the original trilogy. It’s been described as a game of ‘high highs and low lows,’ a characterisation that I feel broadly holds true. In hindsight, though, it’s a game I wish I could have experienced with less of the noise that surrounded it.</p><div><figure data-videoid="6TAq6m9hxyY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt6TAq6m9hxyY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6TAq6m9hxyY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed76f4cexqwnom&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>I was initially quite riveted by the game’s opening hours, but was taken aback after going online to find much of the gaming commentariat lambasting the title as an epic disappointment, if not an outright failure. As I pushed on with my playthrough, that narrative began to colour the experience itself, becoming almost as intrusive as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-so-now-the-dust-has-settled-how-did-you-find-myles-mackenzie">Prime 4’s NPCs</a>.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/metroid/related-articles:195790 @ 1768752003 -->

<p>Algorithm-chasing YouTube critiques, searing post-mortems, finger-pointing at its troubled development history, and a relentless focus on what Prime 4 <em>wasn’t</em> seemed to characterise the mood following its release, making me feel like I was playing a fundamentally different game from the one being litigated online.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I found myself mentally auditing and second-guessing my own enjoyment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s not to dismiss criticism of the game, because there are certainly aspects that deserve it. Too often, though, the discourse felt less like measured appraisal and more like performative dunking. It felt like not enough was being said about what Prime 4 does right, such that I found myself mentally auditing and second-guessing my own enjoyment.</p>
<p>The backlash was initially surprising because I felt it was generally delivering exactly what a Metroid Prime game should: It’s a technical showcase; its controls are sublime; its world design is visually stunning; it offers exploration, scanning, and plenty of well-hidden items; its boss fights stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the best the series has ever produced.</p>
<p>Having recently revisited the series with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a>, Prime 4 feels like it takes gameplay cues from that lauded entry while opting for far more linear biomes that feel more approachable to newcomers. Still, moment to moment, I found it harder to put down than any other major first-party release of the current hardware generation.</p>

<p>I even enjoyed Sol Valley, the desert hub world routinely derided as an empty, 'half-baked' open world. People misread the <em>intent</em> of this space – it exists as a palate cleanser to blast through on the fun-to-control Vi-O-La bike between tense sessions of dungeon-crawling in tight corridors. With a few collectibles, lore, and story beats to discover, it does what it should.</p>
<p>Admittedly, Prime 4 manages to repeatedly break its own spell with its narrative choices. Metroid’s traditional strengths of isolation, atmosphere, and player-driven discovery are all there, but it really fumbles in delivering a coherent character-driven story. Its attempts to do so more often than not felt like tonal misfires that broke my immersion.</p>
<p>That dissonance was, for me, most apparent in the game’s use of NPC companions whose quips and chatter just felt <em>wrong</em> in a Metroid game. After decades of largely solitary adventures, there’s an obvious temptation to push Metroid toward a more character-driven structure, especially in a game positioned as an entry point to the series.</p>

<p>But in this case, the execution of that premise — along with sequences that felt closer to a conventional, dialogue-driven campaign shooter — understandably felt like too much of a departure from what defines Metroid. While I don’t believe Prime 4 deserved the pile-on it received, I won’t deny feeling somewhat conflicted once I rolled the credits.</p>
<p>I have my own qualms with the game, but I still struggled to reconcile them with how much of the conversation had already settled on Prime 4 as a disappointment. The conclusion I’ve reached is that the game was judged both on what it actually is <em>and</em> on what it was supposed to represent as the long-awaited successor to a near-mythic trilogy.</p>
<p>After years of anticipation, the bar wasn’t simply high. Prime 4 was expected to justify its own resurrection, to reaffirm the legacy of its namesake series, and to reward years of fan patience with something transformative. Anything less than a series-defining triumph was always going to be framed as a letdown. Being 'good enough' was never going to be enough.</p>
<figure data-uuid="82e69260d3fd2"><a title="7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/82e69260d3fd2/7.large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Stripped of the hype and the scrutiny, though, this is a game that succeeds far more often than it stumbles, one that repeatedly compelled me to keep going long after I should have stopped, one that I deeply enjoyed playing. How it will be remembered remains to be seen, but I wouldn’t be surprised if hindsight proves kinder than the moment it was released into.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being on TV for nearly 30 years, with 28 seasons and over 330 episodes so far, there have been shockingly few video games based on the hit animated television series, South Park. That could be down to the fact that video games take <em>years </em>to make and the average South Park episode only takes <em>a few days</em>, meaning the usual topical pop culture references that fuel the show might feel positively ancient by the time a video game hits shelves. Regardless, a dozen South Park games have managed to buck that trend and actually get released since the show debuted in 1997. Some of them great and some of them..not so great. Here are the best, worst, and weirdest South Park games.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">South Park</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/15/south-park-game-1768482867774.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The first <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/south-park-1998">South Park</a> video game ever made was an ambitious one, even if a first-person snowball fighting simulator didn’t exactly make a ton of sense for the brand. But since local multiplayer FPS games like Goldeneye were all the rage on the N64 in 1998, it’s no surprise that South Park got a similar treatment, even if the end result was much sillier. Developer Iguana Entertainment (known mostly for the Turok game series at the time) and publisher Acclaim Entertainment came together to create a solid FPS game packed with South Park references, including a recreation of the show’s theme song, multiple playable characters, and Kenny dying brutally before the title screen even appears. It’s not a great game by any stretch, and seeing the traditionally flat and hand drawn South Park characters as low poly 3D models was an odd fit, but it had enough South Park fan service to make it worth checking out at the time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">South Park: Chef's Luv Shack</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/15/south-park-chefs-luv-shack-1768483114876.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">A year later <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/south-park-chefs-luv-shack">South Park: Chef’s Luv Shack</a> arrived, this time with a graphical style much truer to the show’s 2D look. Developed once again by Acclaim, it moved away from first person combat, instead providing a game show-style minigame and trivia collection for Kyle, Stan, Kenny, and Cartman to compete in. Unfortunately, it’s impossible to play this game without other human players, so if you were an only child (or just a loser like Butters), you were pretty much out of luck. Additionally, the limited trivia question set led to a lot of repetition, meaning the joke got old pretty fast, and fans were once again left holding a licensed video game letdown.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">South Park Rally</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/15/south-park-rally-1768483288838.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The third and final Acclaim Entertainment South Park video game once again delivered an experience that critics disliked and diehard fans merely tolerated, this time attempting to take on the popular kart racing genre with the South Park license slapped on. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/south-park-rally">South Park Rally</a> is a crude and ugly kart racer with unreliable controls and lackluster track design, but hey, you can drive Big Gay Al’s car and throw Mr. Hanky turds at other players, so at least there’s that. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the show’s immense popularity, South Park video games ended up taking a seven year hiatus after this capped off Acclaim's trilogy of games, which probably pleased South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, seeing as they once said during a DVD commentary for an episode of the show:  “Oh God, the South Park games were so bad. We were so bummed out on those, because we love playing video games.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">South Park 10: The Game</h2><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2007, South Park celebrated its 10th season on the air less than spectacularly by releasing a bare bones, Europe exclusive mobile game that referenced key moments from the show. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/south-park-10-the-game">South Park 10: The Game </a>is a short and very no-frills platformer that looks like a fan made flash game. Aside from collecting hidden Cheesy Poofs in each level, there’s not much to do or see once you roll credits in under an hour. Still, it was nice to see somebody utilizing the license again, even if the final product was totally average. But you could play as a cow nearly two decades before Mario Kart World let you, so hey, there’s that. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">South Park: Let's Go Tower Defense Play!</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/15/south-park-lets-go-tower-defense-play-1768483544007.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Two years later, Xbox Live Arcade got its own South Park tower defense game, pitting its main characters against waves of ginger kids, hippies, cows, and more as they tried to save their idyllic and weird little town. The 2D art direction, official voices and sound effects, and iconic humor elevated a pretty bog standard tower defense outing into an actually solid South Park video game. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">South Park Mega Millionaire</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/15/mega-millionaire-1768483703290.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Once again revisiting the game show setting for reasons that are unclear, 2009’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/south-park-megamillionaire">South Park Mega Millionaire</a> - hot off the heels of 2008’s hit film, Slumdog Millionaire - was a mobile game that decided it was a good idea to strap roller skates to the South Park kids and put them in precarious platforming situations in front of a live studio audience. It’s not a great game by any stretch, but it does have one of the best South Park video game jokes of all time, as the kids survive a Japanese game show in hopes to win a ten thousand yen prize; unbeknownst to them, ten thousand yen equates to roughly sixty three dollars.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">South Park: Tenorman's Revenge</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/15/south-park-tenormans-revenge-1768483759309.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">2012's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/south-park-tenormans-revenge">Tenorman’s Revenge</a> is another Xbox exclusive South Park game, this time revisiting Scott Tenorman, a character from the infamous South Park episode where Cartman makes Scott eat chili made from the bodies of Scott’s own dead parents. Well, Scott Tenorman has returned to get revenge in video game form in this brief and mediocre platforming game which is only briefly improved by the occasional boss fight and its central plot device, which focuses on the kids having to recover a stolen Xbox 360 hard drive along with all of their precious game save files.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">South Park: The Stick of Truth</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/15/south-park-stick-of-truth-1768482630594.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">As you can probably tell by now, the first 16 years of South Park games left a lot to be desired. Everything changed in 2014 with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/south-park-the-stick-of-truth">South Park: The Stick of Truth</a>, a genuinely great RPG that, unlike previous South Park games,  was made with direct input from the show’s creators. Known for their previous work on franchises like Fallout and Star Wars, developer Obsidian Entertainment built a fantastic and hilarious 2.5D role playing game that looked and felt almost <em>exactly </em>like an episode of the show. It’s not just one of the best licensed games ever made, it's also a fantastic turn-based RPG in its own right, and definitely the only game in the genre where you have to shrink down your character small enough to explore a human anus so you can disarm a bomb. Take that, Final Fantasy.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">South Park: Pinball</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/15/south-park-pinball-1768482609636.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Zen Studios, creators of the excellent digital pinball franchise Zen Pinball, created a set of South Park pinball tables that totally understood the assignment, mixing rock solid gameplay and hilarious show references to excellent results. There’s even a dedicated Butters pinball table, as well as Mr. Hanky inspired brown pinballs, in case you ever wanted to knock a bunch of pellet-shaped turds around to compete for high scores. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">South Park: The Fractured But Whole</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/15/south-park-fractured-but-whole-1768482584870.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">2017’s sequel to The Stick of Truth was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole">The Fractured But Whole</a>, which was probably/possibly legally as close as they could get to putting the word “butthole” in a video game title. Fractured But Whole is another fantastic and funny RPG, this time satirizing the superhero movie genre more than just role playing games in general, and once again looking exactly like an episode of the show. This time around the battle system takes place on a grid complete with environmental hazards like LEGO bricks that can injure characters when stepped on, and features levels like the Peppermint Hippo, a strip club complete with a lapdance minigame sequence, just in case you were worried that South Park would lose its edge in a Ubisoft published video game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">South Park: Phone Destroyer</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/15/south-park-phone-destroyer-1768483864289.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">That same year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/south-park-phone-destroyer">South Park: Phone Destroyer</a> was - you guessed it - a mobile game, which just so happens to be the only South Park mobile game you can still download and play on your phone today. Phone Destroyer is a free-to-play card battling game that does a surprisingly good job of playing to the strengths of its platform. You’ll receive believable calls and texts from Cartman, and you can unlock multiple endings based on how much real money players spend on premium microtransactions, even shaming you and telling you to seek help with addiction if you spend too much. More mobile games should do that. The world would be a better place.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">South Park: Snow Day!</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/15/south-park-snow-day-1768482571850.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><span data-cy="objectcard-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest (but hopefully not the last) South Park video game is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/south-park-snow-day">South Park: Snow Day</a>, a sloppy action adventure roguelike that simultaneously attempts to complete the story established in Stick of Truth and Fractured But Whole, while also returning to the original South Park game’s snowball fighting roots. It’s a shame that Snow Day doesn’t even come close to being fun or funny, with IGN’s own review calling it “thoroughly unenjoyable,” and “uncharacteristicly toothless and unfunny.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s been a weird, windy road for South Park games, but with the recent Fortnite collaboration and megadeal renewal of the show, something tells me we’re just getting started and that hopefully, more South Park games are on the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what’s your favorite South Park video game ever made?

            <p>Rockstar has helped a terminally ill fan play <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> ahead of its November release date.</p>
<p>In a heartfelt plea on LinkedIn, developer at Ubisoft Toronto, Anthony Armstrong, reached out to colleagues and peers at Rockstar about a month ago to ask if they could help a member of their family who had been given "the worst possible news", and could may well lose their battle with cancer before the highly-anticipated sequel release.</p>

<p>"To any of my connections at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> and Rockstar Toronto, or anyone else that may be able to help. A member of my family who has been battling cancer for years just recently got the worst possible news, he was given 6-12 months to live," Armstrong wrote in a now-deleted post (thanks, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-terminally-ill-fan-wish-play-gta-6-early/">Insider Gaming</a>).</p><p>"The reason I'm reaching out is that they are a huge GTA fan and, with this latest updates [sic], he may not be around long enough to actually get to see GTA6 launch, best case scenario he will be leaving us the same month it does. He currently lives only a stones throw from the Oakville studio, so its my hope that one of you may be able to set up an exclusive playtest, so he can have a chance to experience the game, before passing.</p>
<p>"I absolutely understand the need for secrecy at this point of development, so at the very least an NDA is probably needed. If anyone could send me a private m[e]ssage about this or provide any contact who could point us in the right direction, please do."</p> <div>

<p>Fast forward a few weeks, and Armstong was able to provide an update: "The CEO of Take-Two reached out and we are just waiting to hear from the Rockstar team to discuss this further. Thank you to everyone who has shown support, reshared, and reached out to your contacts for us."</p>
<p>The final update said: "We spoke to them today and got great news. That's all I can really say, but thank you all from the bottom of my heart".</p>
<p>Last November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a> published its latest financial report, revealing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-gta-6-is-delayed-again-by-half-a-year-to-november-2026-take-two-stock-immediately-begins-to-drop">GTA 6 had been delayed from 26th May, 2026 to 19th November, 2026</a>. According to Take-Two, this delay is designed to give "some additional time to finish the game with the high level of polish players expect and deserve. Rockstar has our full support, of course, and we are confident they will deliver an unrivalled blockbuster entertainment experience".</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-mario-power-tennis-gamecube">Last week</a>, we checked out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_power_tennis">Mario Power Tennis</a> for the GameCube and, as expected, the results weren't even remotely close. With a much more interesting cover, Europe and North America easily won the day with 70% of the vote, leaving Japan to mop up the remaining 30%.</p>
<p>This week, we're heading to the land of the DS to look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/final_fantasy_tactics_a2_grimoire_of_the_rift">Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift</a>. Originally released in 2007, it was very well regarded at the time and remains a firm fan-favourite to this day. With the recent success of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a> on Switch and Switch 2, many (including us) are no doubt hoping to see its sequels remastered in a similar manner.</p><div><figure data-videoid="PA87rC9nG4k" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytPA87rC9nG4k" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PA87rC9nG4k?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f11fyrnzwj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>For now, let's check out the box arts for Grimoire of the Rift. This time, Europe and Japan team up to take on North America.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/ds/related-articles:195904,195979 @ 1768752062 -->
<h2>Europe / Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="f4741f6d2bc59"><a title="Tactics A2 - EU / JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f4741f6d2bc59/tactics-a2-eu-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6510-final-fantasy-tactics-a2-grimoire-of-the-rift">Square Enix / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Europe and Japan have gone for what could arguably be described as a more 'traditional' approach for a Final Fantasy game, opting for a white background to allow the logo and characters to really stand out. It's clean, it's eye-catching, and we like it.</p>
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="b56d735ef9284"><a title="Tactics A2 - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b56d735ef9284/tactics-a2-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6510-final-fantasy-tactics-a2-grimoire-of-the-rift">Square Enix / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>North America, meanwhile, has gone for a much darker approach, showcasing a black background with a dark blue outline of a key character. Very ominous stuff, indeed. It's cool though, and despite the change in approach, it's still quite classy and restrained. This might be a tough one to call.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-taken-down-by-cd-projekt-red/</link>
            <guid>1409374</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Renowned virtual reality modder Luke Ross <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/another-one-dust-148437771" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed yesterday</a> that his <strong>Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod</strong> was taken down after a DMCA request from the game's developer, <strong>CD Projekt RED</strong>.</p>



<p>The mod allowed virtual reality gamers to experience the splendor of Night City through their headsets, significantly increasing immersion. It was originally released in <strong>late February 2022</strong>, so it's not like it's anything new. It is unclear exactly what prompted CDPR to take action now; perhaps they were simply unaware so far, and someone brought the Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod to their attention just recently.</p>



<p>And no, <strong>it's not that the game development studio is working on an official VR mode for their game</strong>. Luke Ross says that explicitly, having actually been able to talk this through with CDPR's VP of business development and legal department (unlike what happened a few years ago with <a href="https://wccftech.com/vr-modder-luke-ross-gets-dmca-notice-for-his-rdr2-gta-and-mafia-vr-mods/"><strong>Take-Two</strong>'s DMCA takedown of his <strong>Red Dead Redemption 2</strong>, <strong>Grand Theft Auto V</strong>, and <strong>Mafia Definitive Edition</strong> VR mods</a>, when Ross couldn't get through to anyone there).</p>



<p>The VR modder was very bitter in his Patreon post, complaining about the 'duplicity with which the corpo mind thinks and reacts. The bottom line is all that matters, and gamers be damned.' That said, looking at the comments on Reddit, forum boards, and social media, many gamers are not very surprised. Companies can't allow others to profit from their own IPs without a license, after all, and this could have been avoided if Ross simply released the mod for free and then asked for donations to his Patreon. </p>



<p>CD Projekt RED doesn't have any problem with free mods, as evidenced by their support of the modding communities of <strong>The Witcher 3</strong> and Cyberpunk 2077. They even <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-redkit-q-further-improvements-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released the full mod tools (<strong>REDkit</strong>) for the former</a> a couple of years ago, encouraging more modders to tinker with the game. Cyberpunk 2077 is the fastest-growing game on Nexus by mod downloads, having just surpassed <strong>Fallout: New Vegas</strong> and being only behind <strong>Skyrim</strong> (both base and Special Edition) and <strong>Fallout 4</strong> when it comes to total mod downloads.</p>



<p>The Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod <strong>was instead hidden behind the paywall</strong>, though, which prompted the legal action. That said, the modder isn't quitting. In fact, he just <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/looking-down-at-148469092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a new VR mod for <strong>Larian's Baldur's Gate 3</strong>, a challenging proposition since it uses an isometric-style camera (albeit in a fully 3D game) that the modder hadn't yet converted to virtual reality. Once again, though, it is locked behind the paywall, potentially inviting legal action by license holder Wizards of the Coast.</p>



<p>In other news, VR gaming just took a major hit, with Meta <a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-shuts-down-deadpool-vr-twisted-pixel-games-asgards-wrath-sanzaru-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutting down three of its studios</a> (<strong>Sanzaru Games</strong>, <strong>Twisted Pixel</strong>, and <strong>Armature Studio</strong>) as part of its 10% layoffs at the Reality Labs division. <strong>Camouflaj</strong>, the developer behind <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/republique-review-zeroes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">République</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-iron-man-vr-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Iron Man VR</a></strong>, and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-shadow-is-an-exclusive-meta-quest-3-vr-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a></strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-shadow-sequel-cancelled-camouflaj-hit-with-significant-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was also affected by layoffs</a>, canceling its Arkham Shadow sequel and reportedly abandoning any future VR gaming projects.</p>

            <guid>1409362</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Apex Legends Global Series Championship 2026 has <strong>just wrapped</strong>, and it was OBLIVION sitting at the top of the table after a hard-fought grand final. The final series was dragged out by so many teams racking up enough points to land themselves on <strong>match point</strong>, waiting on one final win to claim the trophy and the $600,000 prize.</p>



<p>Team Falcons was the first squad to reach match point after a dominant run throughout the tournament. It seems that nothing, not even a banned controller, could stop ImperialHal – <strong>except OBLIVION</strong></p>







<p>It has been a pretty mixed year for the Apex Legends Global Series. We saw Team Falcons storm to the top spot time and again, running through much of the season as <strong>the team to beat</strong>. The year came to a close in Sapporo (again), a site fast becoming the <strong>home </strong>of Apex esports, with a hugely polished event backed by some stunning sponsorships.</p>



<p>It was easily one of the biggest years for Apex esports.</p>



<p>This year introduced an all-new LAN structure, a <strong>monumental </strong>ALGS Open featuring 160 teams, a revamped points system, <strong>and </strong>an expanded map pool, just to make things more varied.</p>



<p>It all came to a head at the ALGS Championship 2026, live in Sapporo. By the time the grand final of the tournament was set to end, six teams sat on match point, making for an exhilarating showdown in front of a <strong>huge </strong>and energetic crowd in the Daiwa House Dome in Japan.</p>



<p>As Team Falcons sat with toes touching the finish line, Fnatic stepped up and threw themselves into the running with a huge upset, especially buffed as the team was playing on <strong>home turf</strong>.</p>



<p>The next map went wild, and the final fight came down to a razor-sharp line, with the last three teams fighting in the most minuscule circle, trading shots and playing as patient a game as possible, everyone conscious of the fact that E36 sat on match point while nobody else did. That became the focal point, E36 was wiped, and another round was lined up against all odds.</p>



<p>Eight teams now sat in the match point realm.</p>



<p>The <strong>very final map </strong>saw Oblivion surge out of nowhere, with the LCQ champions breaking into the final three and storming to success in Sapporo. The mostly North American squad put up a masterclass in the Apex space, securing the biggest underdog win in the history of the space.</p>



<p>Until now, the organization had won just $10,000 in the Apex tournament world; the team has claimed a $600,000 prize, while not even having team jerseys on the stage. Huge congratulations to Monsoon, Blinkzr, and FunFPS.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-terminally-ill-fan-wish-play-gta-6-early/</link>
            <guid>1409356</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In December, a Ubisoft Toronto developer posted on LinkedIn with a heartfelt, emotional message. The developer, Anthony Armstrong, revealed that a member of their family had been battling cancer ‘for years’ and had been given the news that nobody <strong>ever </strong>wants to hear: they had months left to live.</p>



<p>Armstrong explained that they were <strong>a huge </strong>GTA fan, but the final timeline meant that they wouldn’t get to play Grand Theft Auto 6 after <strong>years </strong>of waiting. It was recently confirmed by Armstrong that they’d finally managed to talk with Rockstar Games and that they’d received ‘great news’ and issued thanks to the developer.</p>







<h2 id="h-gamer-with-months-to-live-may-get-to-play-gta-6-early">Gamer with Months to Live May Get to Play GTA 6 Early</h2>



<p>The post on Anthony Armstrong’s LinkedIn page was deleted after final adjustments were made, keeping followers updated about the situation. It has been theorized that this was due to some kind of legal requirement, given that the post almost <strong>confirmed </strong>that the family member would get hands-on with GTA 6 <strong>early</strong>.</p>



<p>Here’s the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/anthony-armstrong-793453110_final-update-we-spoke-to-them-today-and-activity-7402775456988770313-aBME" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">original post</a> text:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>To any of my connections at Rockstar Games and Rockstar Toronto, or anyone else that may be able to help. A member of my family woh has been battling cancer for years just recently got the worst possible news, he was given 6 – 12 months to live.</p>



<p>The reason I’m reaching out is that they are a huge GTA fan and, with this latest update, he may not be around long enough to actually get to see GTA 6 launch, best case scenario he will be leaving us the same month it does. He currently lives only a stones throw from the Oakville studio, so its my hope that one of you may be able to set up an exclusive playtest, so he can have a chance to experience the game, before passing.</p>



<p>I absolutely understand the need for secrecy at this point of development, so at the very least an NDA is probably needed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Weeks later, Armstrong updated the post with two more lines:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Update: The CEO of Take-Two reached out and we are just waiting to hear from the Rockstar team to discuss this further. Thank you to everyone who has shown support, reshared, and reached out to your contacts for us.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>And:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Final Update: We spoke to them today and got great news. That’s all I can really say, but thank you all from the bottom of my heart.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When you run a quick search, you can see that Google still has the post cached, but it has since been deleted from LinkedIn:</p>



<figure><figcaption>Note: The ‘1 month ago’ refers to the original post date and not the subsequent updates</figcaption></figure>







<p>On social media, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/1qfznje/rockstar_games_gave_a_terminally_ill_fan_with/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">some channels</a> were able to grab screencaptures of the post before it was deleted by Armstrong.</p>



<p>This is far from the first time a situation like this has surfaced in gaming, and it’s not the first time Rockstar Games has granted such a wish.</p>



<p>In 2018, a terminally ill gamer was allowed to <a href="https://gamerant.com/red-dead-redemption-2-terminally-ill-fan-play-early/">play Red Dead Redemption 2 early</a>, weeks before the game was set to launch. Bethesda Game Studios has honored the passing of fans by immortalizing them in games, such as Fallout 4 and Starfield.</p>







<p>Do you think this is a huge win for Rockstar Games, or is it a bout of positive PR at a time when the developer is facing bad press? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>It was recently confirmed that Amazon’s New World: Aeternum will be shut down next year, going offline forever and locking players out of the game they might have loved for a good while. The MMORPG was released in September 2021, soaring to epic player counts, but it quickly dwindled and the ever-marching progress of time saw the game fall out of favor <strong>fast</strong>.</p>



<p>Following the announcement that New World: Aeternum will be taken offline in 2027, an unlikely figure stood up and offered $25 million to keep the game alive, because ‘games should never die.’</p>



<h2 id="h-will-facepunch-keep-new-world-aeternum-alive">Will Facepunch Keep New World: Aeternum Alive?</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/Alistair_McF/status/2011894052128768316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Alistair McFarlane, the director of Rust and COO at Facepunch Studios, said:</p>

<p>The original post was made in response to a Facepunch employee joking that they’d asked ‘Ali’ to buy New World for them, but he told them to f*** off. This line is enough to make users doubt the validity of McFarlane’s messages, but who knows? We’ve seen stranger things.</p>



<p>As the comments unfolded, McFarlane explained when asked what Amazon should do for the players:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>As with everything we do at Facepunch, empower the community. Give them control, make servers publicly hostable. A game will live forever in the hands of a dedicated community.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In October 2025, Amazon <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-world-development-cancelled-amazon-layoffs/">issued layoffs and ended</a> any more development on New World: Aeternum, and on January 15, it was revealed that the game would be taken <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-world-aeternum-to-be-taken-offline-next-year/">offline forever</a> in 2027.</p>



<p>This has been a major point of contention in the gaming space for the longest time. It surfaced most recently (and prolifically) with Ubisoft’s The Crew being pulled offline, a situation that spawned <strong>a court case</strong>, raised by disgruntled fans.</p>



<p>For the last few years, the concept of online-only games ending development has been a major debate, with many claiming that games should <strong>never, ever </strong>go offline.</p>



<p>It seems highly unlikely that Facepunch Studios will acquire New World: Aeternum, but what do you think? Do you think it’s up to <strong>other studios </strong>to keep games alive when they’re shut down by their creators?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Apex Legends Global Series is gearing up for another ambitious season, now that the ALGS Championship 2026 has wrapped. Electronic Arts has unveiled the full ALGS Year 6 roadmap, outlining a <strong>packed </strong>competitive calendar bursting with international events and structural changes.</p>



<p>At the heart of the announcement sits a renewed commitment to that perspective of global competition. This year, the three-event international LAN circuit returns, giving teams around the world more chances to make their name heard.</p>







<h2 id="h-algs-year-6-roadmap-is-bigger-than-ever">ALGS Year 6 Roadmap is Bigger Than Ever</h2>



<p>The season kicks off early with the Online Open, with qualifiers set to run from February 28 to March 23. Following that, the first Pro League Split will take place in April, running until June. The Challenger Circuit Split arrives in April and runs through to early June, spread across <strong>four </strong>circuits.</p>



<p>The first major LAN date to mark in your book is the Split 1 Playoffs at the 2026 Esports World Cup in Riyadh from July 7 to 11. </p>



<p>In the latter half of 2026, we’ll get the second round start, with the Pro League Qualifier taking place in late July, followed by the Pro League Split 2 in August to October. The second Challenger Circuit Split arrives in August and runs to October, and then the <strong>big events start unfolding</strong>.</p>



<p>Las Vegas plays host to the Split 2 Playoffs from October 29 to November 1, and the LCQ from November 20 to 22.</p>



<p>The ALGS Year 6 season comes to a close in Sapporo, Japan, from January 28 to 31, 2027. That’s when the Apex Legends Global Series Championship 2027 will take place, putting a cap on a bold season.</p>



<p>Electronic Arts has established a massive <strong>$7 million global prize pool </strong>for Year 6 of Apex Legends’ esports ecosystem, including $2 million reserved for each international event.</p>



<p>It was revealed that competitive integrity is becoming an increasing focus of the team this season. Legend bans will now be extended into the Challenger Circuit realm, ensuring the utmost consistency across all tiers of competition. Teams will face stricter roster rules, tighter transfer windows, and more control around Championship Points.</p>

<p>Former Sega producer reveals "funny" Mario &amp; Sonic demand</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="8b2e4b1167916"><a title="Mario and Sonic" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8b2e4b1167916/mario-and-sonic.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: SEGA, Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Developers who have worked with Nintendo's intellectual properties have often shared stories about odd requests and demands from the video game giant. With this in mind, the latest story to surface comes from former Sega of Japan producer, Ryoichi Hasegawa.</p>
<p>During a chat with <a href="https://www.arcadeattack.co.uk/sega-of-japan-ryoichi-hasegawa-interview/">Arcade Attack Retro Gaming Network</a> recently, <a href="https://segaretro.org/Ryoichi_Hasegawa">the Sega legend</a> (who was at the company between 1992-98 and 2007-12) retold a "funny story" about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_and_sonic_at_the_olympic_games_tokyo_2020">Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games</a> and a certain demand Nintendo apparently made at the time. Here it is in full:</p><div><figure data-videoid="rD2-TWrSjpI" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rD2-TWrSjpI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytrD2-TWrSjpI" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rD2-TWrSjpI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rD2-TWrSjpI?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed31c928hnqkro&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ryoichi Hasegawa:</strong> There was one funny story...There was artwork of Mario and Sonic, and you know, other characters standing on the field. And those artworks were used for the package, the instruction manual cover, and the cartridge label, and things like that...There was one small error and Sonic's foot was in front of Mario's foot, and Nintendo demanded us to change the priority".</p>
<p><strong>Arcade Attack:</strong> So, what? Mario had to be slightly ahead? Oh, for goodness sake.</p>
<p><strong>Hasegawa</strong>: (nods) Yes...I still remember that.</p>
<p><strong>Aracde Attack:</strong> And you did change it, I take it?</p>
<p><strong>Hasegawa:</strong> Of course, of course, we were like 'oh my god' we have to change it, or there will be no deal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, it's not the first time we've heard stories like this from third-party developers about Nintendo, and Nintendo is well-known for being extremely protective of its IP. As for the Sonic &amp; Mario at the Olympic Games series, based on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/rumour-mario-and-sonic-at-the-olympic-games-finished">some rumours a few years ago</a>, it might not be returning.</p>

<p>Kouji Okada, co-founder of Atlas, is signed on to a game project for the first time in 18 years.</p>



<p>Kouji Okada has 40 years of experience in the video game industry. He’s best known for co-founding Atlus and his work on the Shin Megami Tensei and Persona titles. Now, he is slated to return to produce a new “school life RPG” being developed by Compile Heart.</p>







<p>Compile Heart announced on Thursday, January 15, that they were working on the new game and promised to deliver more information two weeks later, on January 29.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-other-jrpg-veterans-are-working-on-the-game-alongside-kouji-okada">Other JRPG Veterans Are Working on the Game Alongside Kouji Okada</h2>



<p>Not only is Okada signed on to produce the game, but Tadashi Satomi, one of the original writers in the Persona series, is linked to the project as well. Additionally, Tsukasa Masuko, one of the composers for the early Shin Megami Tensei titles, is on board.</p>



<p>A teaser trailer was uploaded to YouTube in Japanese. There were old-school anime sci-fi visuals, imagery of DNA, and a close-up of a character’s eye, before a visual of junk characters sitting at tables, making panicked motions, as shrieking sounds of despair briefly played in the background.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>After leaving Atlus, Kouji Okada worked on a handful of games with Gaia studio, including Folklore on the Sony PlayStation 3. The Persona franchise remains the cornerstone of Atlus.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Kurt Kuhlmann spent two decades working at Bethesda on several games in the Elder Scrolls and Fallout franchises, as well as Starfield. Now, he’s opening up about his vision for the 6th Elder Scrolls game and the potential role the delay in that game’s development played in his leaving the studio.</p>



<p>Kurt Kuhlmann is known as an Elder Scrolls loremaster specifically because of his longevity at the studio and the many games he’s working on. He hoped to be given the lead design role on Elder Scrolls 6. </p>







<p>However, the studio chose someone else, and that person has yet to be publicly named. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/bethesdas-former-elder-scrolls-loremaster-on-why-he-left-starfields-communication-breakdowns-and-how-he-wanted-the-elder-scrolls-6-to-be-the-empire-strikes-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Speaking with PC Gamer, </a>Kuhlmann claimed that Todd Howard promised him the lead design role in the forthcoming game, but the project kept being pushed off to focus on other releases and ultimately never came to fruition.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“After Fallout 4, we didn’t go to TES6, we made Fallout 76, and then even then, we didn’t make TES6, we made Starfield, which became this extremely long project compared to other ones. So from my point of view, I’ve been waiting like 11 years to be the lead on TES6,” he says. “Bruce [Nesmith] and I had been the co-leads on Skyrim. I think most people would call it a successful project, so I thought that it wasn’t unreasonable for me to think that I could be a successful lead on TES6. It wasn’t just my expectation—I had been told that that was going to happen.</p>
</blockquote>











<p>Speaking a little on his vision for the game’s storyline and direction, Kuhlmann notes that he drew inspiration from the second Star Wars film, The Empire Strikes Back.</p>



<p>He’d wanted The Thalmor to be the villains that would end up conquering the day by the end of the campaign, paving the way for the next entrant in the series. To him, this was a welcome diversion from the typical storytelling Bethesda relies on.</p>



<p>Bethesda is currently working on Fallout 5, and the team hopes you play the game for many hours, potentially 600. Still, there is no release window for that game at this time. Todd Howard recently said that most employees are engaged with work on Elder Scrolls 6, while also claiming that Fallout is the game they’re working on the most.

<p>GOG’s Managing Director, Maciej Gołębiewski, has opened up about the current state of the gaming industry and the rise of always-online games, noting that it’s essential to discuss preservation and what a proper end-of-life cycle looks like in the current industry.</p>



<p>As more multiplayer games adopt always-online models, players are increasingly facing the reality that servers do not remain online forever. When games fail to meet developer expectations, some are shut down abruptly, even while they still have active communities. EA <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/anthem-servers-to-be-shut-down-in-january/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recently took Anthem’s servers offline</a> seven years after launch, and the company stated in its FAQ that because the game was designed to require an online connection, it is no longer playable.</p>



<h2 id="h-gog-s-managing-director-expresses-concern">GOG’s Managing Director Expresses Concern</h2>



<p>Digital storefront GOG is very dedicated to game preservation and launched a program in 2024 to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gog-launches-game-preservation-program/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">preserve classic titles.</a> Now, GOG’s Maciej Gołębiewski is weighing in on what preservation looks like in the modern age of always-online games, telling <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-weighs-complicated-riddle-of-multiplayer-game-preservation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer </a>that he’s afraid there may be fewer games for gamers to play in the future because of the expectation of maintaining servers for decades.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“If we put too many barriers on game creators and what the end-of-life cycle looks like, we might get fewer games,” he said, “because people will be scared of ‘okay now I need to put up the funds to create it, promote it, and then upkeep it for 10 years, 20 years, because the regulator said so’. That might in turn cause there to be fewer cool games for gamers. I don’t have the perfect answer yet, but it’s good that the discussion is taking place.”</p>
</blockquote>







<p>In one example of an attempt to address this problem, The Crew 2 recently received an update that introduced a hybrid mode and enabled offline play, hopefully ensuring long-term access to the game.
