		<p>Manticore Games has released a new gameplay trailer for Out of Time, the anachronistic co-op roguelike shooter that is set to launch on 25th September, exclusively on the Epic Games Store for PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Out of Time Official Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S8Iisl6CU6k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Time and reality have been broken in Out of Time by an event known as The Shattering, blending anything and everything together in a mad mish-mash of periods, themes and technology. Depending on the different properties of each roguelike, you could be battling dragons, killer robots or mutant crabs, using medieval swords, plasma cannons, or riding dinosaurs.</p>
<p>There’s a whopping 24 characters to choose to play as, going from the Cyber Medic Yasmine, who features angel wings, to the purple skinned druid Talyndra, mobster Ming, and just a plain ol’ lumberjack named Freya. Each has specific starting abilities, weapons and skills, but comes without a defined class, so you’re free to customise beyond that. You will be pushed to co-operate though, as the game will push you to stay together beyond having complimentary abilities by a tethering system that shares healing and buffs between you.</p>

<p>There’s a shared space called Infinitopia before you head out on each run, with the game worlds taking you to various biomes and the promise that seasonal updates will evolve and change each space.</p>

<p>More specifically, <strong>22nd March 2026</strong> marks the 30th anniversary of the original Resident Evil on PS1. We're unsure what Capcom has in store for us to celebrate the milestone, but the website has a section marked 'Coming Soon' toward the bottom, so chances are the publisher has some big plans.</p>
<p>We do know one thing, however. 27th February 2026 will see the release of the latest mainline entry: <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/resident_evil_requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>. Currently, the title is not scheduled to launch on Switch 2, but given how much Capcom has supported the Switch over the years, we're not prepared to completely rule it out.</p>
<p>Otherwise, that's about it for now! We'll leave you with a look at two logos for the upcoming 30th anniversary; one designed to look like an archway encompassing the Umbrella logo, and the other quite literally depicting a raccoon wearing 30th anniversary shades. Badass.</p>

<p>Capcom recently provided updated sales figures for its best-selling titles, with half of the top ten games being Resident Evil titles. The best-selling of all time is currently <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_2_-_cloud_version">Resident Evil 2</a> remake, which is available on Switch as a Cloud download.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Wilds PC Optimizations Coming in Winter, Capcom Promises]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-winter</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-coming-in-winter-capcom-promises.1273599/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has revealed that PC optimizations are on their way to&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>later this year, likely in an attempt to combat the negative feedback the game has been receiving for its PC version in recent months.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1957473035885121806" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on social media, Capcom says that Title Update 4, which is on the way this winter (but which won't be the game's next major update, with Title Update 3 still yet to arrive), will bring "CPU and GPU related optimizations".</p>

<p>This round of improvements will be followed by "a second stage of mitigation measures afterwards". It's all part of what the developer and publisher calls a "multifaceted plan" to improve&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' PC performance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-winter-birds.jpg?itok=Qa2QenZK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-winter-birds.jpg?itok=-iLU-It7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Presumably because the PC port could give up at any minute.</figcaption></figure><p>Capcom says it'll share more specifics about the optimizations in question "in the future", and that "gradual improvements" will also be implemented in the weeks ahead as part of other updates.</p>

<p>Just in case you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>&nbsp;launched back in February to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">pretty rapturous</a> (or perhaps that should be "raptor"ous) sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-record" rel="nofollow">reception</a>, but players bemoaned its PC performance, with many reporting serious issues even on high-end machines.</p>

<p>In the last couple of months, those criticisms have become even louder, with&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>dipping to a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mostly Negative rating</a> on Steam. A quick glance at the negative reviews accruing on the game's page shows that PC performance is still a huge point of contention.</p>

<p>Still, there's reason to be optimistic that Capcom will fix&nbsp;<em>Wilds</em>' PC problems. Another big problem players brought up was the game's lack of endgame content, and Capcom <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-update-1021-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">recently released an update</a> to address that issue, so hopefully, Title Update 4 will do the same for players' PC woes.</p>

Dubbed the Sega Villains Stage, details are still pretty light on the DLC, but Sonic the Hedgehog's Dr. Eggman is set to appear as a boss fight. Alongside that, protagonist Joe Musashi will have two other guest villains to take on, though they are yet to be revealed. If you're picking up the digital deluxe edition of Shinobi: Art of Vengeance, you'll automatically unlock it whenever the DLC does arrive next year.</p><p dir="ltr">Sega also announced that Young Dirty Bastard (YDB), i.e. the son of the late Ol' Dirty Bastard from Wu-Tang Clan, is releasing a song called The Path Has Just Begun inspired by the Shinobi series. It'll be released on streaming services this week, August 21, and you can expect a new trailer for the game on the same day.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Shinobi: Art of Vengeance - Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Shinobi: Art of Vengeance was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sega-announces-new-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi-and-more-long-awaited-sequels/1100-6519798/" data-ref-id="1100-6519798">teased back at The Game Awards in 2023</a> before getting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sega-reveals-new-shinobi-game-art-of-vengance-during-february-2025s-state-of-play/1100-6529458/" data-ref-id="1100-6529458">proper reveal earlier this year</a>, bringing the series back to its roots with 2D action-platforming. It's also the first new game in the series since 2011's Shinobi 3D, a 3DS title that received average reviews at the time. This new Shinobi game comes as part of a broader move by Sega to bring back some of its legacy titles that haven't received a new entry in many years, like Jet Set Radio and Crazy Taxi. A movie adaptation of the Shinobi series is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/classic-sega-arcade-game-lands-director-for-a-new-movie/1100-6527028/">also in the works</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll be able to pick up Shinobi: Art of Vengeance on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC when it launches on August 29.</p>

Instead, what's seen in the video is a "mega jump upgrade from the campaign," apparently.</p><p>The original video <a href="https://x.com/tu_nikal_/status/1957655348481012029" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">remains online if you know where to look.</a></p><p>More details about Black Ops 7 should be announced during Gamescom Opening Night Live today beginning at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET. Some of the surprises may have been spoiled already, though, including this gameplay video and the game's reported price and release date. According to reliable source <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1957017550044168449" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a>, the game will be priced at $70 for its standard edition and will launch on November 14.</p><p>The price being below $70 is not a surprise, as Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-u-turns-on-80-xbox-games/1100-6533374/" data-ref-id="1100-6533374">already did a U-turn on its plans to charge $80 for games this year.</a> Like Black Ops 6 in 2024, Black Ops 7 will be available at launch on Xbox Game Pass.</p><p>Black Ops 7's development is being led by Raven Software and Treyarch, the same two co-lead developers on last year's Black Ops 6. This is the first time ever that Activision is releasing Black Ops games in consecutive years.</p><p>Recently, a report said Black Ops 7's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-blend-the-campaign-and-multiplayer-like-never-before-report/1100-6533962/" data-ref-id="1100-6533962">final campaign mission will morph into a 32-player extraction-style multiplayer mode.</a></p><p>If the rumored November 14 release date for Black Ops 7 is real, that's about a month after EA's highly anticipated Battlefield 6 is set to launch on October 10. The game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">just wrapped up its second and final open beta test</a>, and it was hugely popular.</p>

<p>Black Myth: Wukong is finally poised to make a debut on Xbox, which means there are a bunch of achievements to grind towards. Here, we’ve got details of them all.</p>



<p>Releasing on Xbox on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-coming-to-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 20</a>, albeit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-black-myth-wukong-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not on the Xbox Game Pass service</a>, it’s been a long year of waiting for the title that was previously a PlayStation console timed-exclusive, but there’s still every reason to be excited.</p>



<p>If you’re planning on working your way through Black Myth: Wukong to gather every achievement and secure all the Gamerscore available, we’ve got the complete list for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-black-myth-wukong-achievements">All Black Myth: Wukong Achievements</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Finally here. Image via Game Science.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Black Myth: Wukong’s list of achievements will have you ticking off challenges of every type, though the descriptions can be rather mysterious.</strong></p>



<p>Rather than provide a detailed breakdown of the task at hand, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/black-myth-wukong/9NWQ1Q1FR0C9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Myth: Wukong</a> keeps its cards close to its chest, with all the achievements having a sort of riddle to solve. Some are easier to crack than others, and some become clearer while playing the game.</p>



<p>The table below has all the achievements in Black Myth: Wukong, excluding the secret achievements (more on those later).</p>

<p><strong>The majority of Black Myth: Wukong achievements are secret, and the description won’t show unless manually revealed. Therefore, spoilers follow here.</strong></p>

"When we think about the future of the Xbox, we're really focused on how do we put the player at the center of the experience, and when you really look at how modern players play games today, the vast majority play across multiple different devices," Ronald said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biXDUvQByBw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/biXDUvQByBw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>According to the VP, Microsoft envisions players having options like the Xbox ROG Ally for when they're on the move, and dedicated hardware when they come home that'll allow them to pick up from right where they left off.</p><p>"So what we're really focused on is how do we evolve the Xbox ecosystem to allow players to play the games wherever you want to play them, while at the same time, we're continuing to build dedicated devices that are optimized for gaming, like the Xbox Ally or next-generation console," Ronald said. "So it's really just focused on how players like playing games in the current environment and just designing and building a platform with them at the center."</p><p>So far, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/">what we do know about the next-gen Xbox</a> is that it'll be powered by AMD technology, which Microsoft says will be able to allow for a "deeper level of visual quality" with "immersive gameplay" that's "enhanced" with the power of AI. The company also hinted at games not being "locked to a single store" or only supported on a single device, and in February, Xbox president Sarah Bond said the in-development console will offer the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-talks-next-gen-hardware-teases-new-console-controller-for-this-fall/1100-6521133/">"largest technical leap you will have ever seen in a hardware generation."</a></p><p>On the handheld side, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-x-impressions-green-with-envy/1100-6532506/">the Xbox ROG Ally will launch during the holiday season</a> and there'll be two models to choose from. The ROG Xbox Ally X has a black color scheme and is equipped with an AMD Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme chipset, 24GB RAM, and a 1TB SSD, while the base model ROG Xbox Ally is white and has an AMD Ryzen Z2A chipset, 16GB RAM, and a 512GB SSD. Pricing for these units haven't been officially revealed yet, but recent leaks claim that the premium "X" model could cost as much as $1,050, while the ROG Xbox Ally is rumored to be $699.</p>

            <p>
It's been a busy couple of week in Nintendo presentation land. First we had that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">third-party-focused partner showcase</a>, then it was the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-indie-world-showcase-heres-everything-announced">turn of the indies</a>, leaving everyone to speculate that a proper Direct showcase much <em>surely</em> be on the way. And, well, here we are, sort of. Today's 45-minute Direct is apparently focused exclusively on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>'s upcoming Kirby Air Riders - and if that appeals, here's where you'll be able to watch it unfold.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's Kirby Air Riders Direct officially gets underway today, 19th August, at 2pm BST. That's 3pm CEST for our European chums, and 6am PDT/9am EDT/7am MDT/8am CDT for anyone over in the US. And, yes, you did read that right earlier; Nintendo has confirmed we're in for a full 45 minutes focused entirely on Kirby Air Riders - which seems like a lot considering it managed to squeeze its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> Direct into less than 18 minutes.

<p>
As you might expect, today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn5c4RkoYAc">Kirby Air Riders Direct airs on YouTube</a> and promises an "in-depth look" at the game, as presented by its director, the legendary Masahiro Sakurai - who also created its underrated 2003 predecessor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-air-ride">Kirby Air Ride</a>, alongside the considerably more fondly remembered Smash Bros. series.
</p>
<p>

And if you need a reminder, all we've seen of Kirby Air Riders so far is its announcement trailer from back in April, which you can watch below while we await today's full Direct reveal.

            <title><![CDATA[Safe In Our World Launches Industry-First Gaming Mental Health Accreditation]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/safe-in-our-world-mental-health-star-accreditation</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/safe-in-our-world-launches-industry-first-gaming-mental-health-accreditation.1273554/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gaming mental health charity Safe In Our World has launched the Mental Health Star Accreditation, an industry-first method to help gaming industry companies and studios shore up their efforts when it comes to employee mental health.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release, the Mental Health Star Accreditation is "designed to provide companies with the opportunity to achieve a mark of excellence in workplace wellbeing", something that's sorely needed in today's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spiders-layoffs" rel="nofollow">uncertain</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/supermassive-games-layoffs-directive-8020-delayed" rel="nofollow">volatile</a>, and often <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-revenue-up-microsoft-2025" rel="nofollow">seemingly cruel</a> industry.</p>

<p>If a company chooses to undergo the process of accreditation, it will first be audited by Safe In Our World; the charity says it'll carry out a "company-wide audit of mental health policies, practices, culture, and sentiment".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/safe-in-our-world-mental-health-accreditation-star.jpg?itok=ymPCBpfD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/safe-in-our-world-mental-health-accreditation-star.jpg?itok=ajXDgoBG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Safe In Our World's new Mental Health Star accreditation aims to bolster companies' efforts to support mental health initiatives.</figcaption></figure><p>Using the data gathered from that audit, Safe In Our World then puts together a report that will tell a company what it's doing well to support its employees' mental health, as well as what could be done better.</p>

<p>If a company successfully completes the accreditation, they'll be awarded with one of three tiers: Dedicated, Accomplished, or Outstanding, depending on how satisfied Safe In Our World is with the company's performance.</p>

<p>Each accreditation lasts three years and comes complete with "annual check-ins and support" from the charity, as well as badges and other media assets for companies to display on their platforms to show off their achievement.</p>

<p>Companies that don't succeed in attaining the accreditation will be provided with a "thorough and detailed report" regarding why they didn't make the cut, as well as "practical advice and resources to aid improvement". They'll also be able to re-apply whenever they like.</p>




<p>Mental health remains a serious issue when it comes to the gaming industry, especially when <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">even employees of massive gaming corporations</a> could find themselves in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-ea-cuts-titanfall-game" rel="nofollow">layoff firing line</a> with very little warning.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see whether the Mental Health Star Accreditation is adopted en masse by the industry, but if you ask me, it's a much-needed step in the right direction for protecting employee mental health. Stay tuned for more.</p>

              <p>Mitch William Gross, a 34-year-old man from Earling, Iowa, is about to spend four months in federal prison for the crime of buying $145,000 worth of <em>Pokémon</em> cards and gaming items. The mistake he made was to buy them by defrauding the logistics company he worked for.</p> <p>It’s a tale as old as time itself. Man works for transportation corporation, man uses company credit cards to buy tens of thousands of dollars on <em>Pokémon</em> cards, man falsifies receipts on expense reports to make the payments appear as regular business costs, man gets caught by the FBI and charged with wire fraud. We’ve all been there at one time or another.</p> <p>Mitch William Gross managed to rack up an extraordinary $146,590.15 in fraudulent purchases, which <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdia/pr/earling-man-sentenced-four-months-federal-prison-wire-fraud">the Southern District of Iowa’s Attorney’s Office</a> said (thanks,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ktiv.com/2025/08/18/iowa-man-spent-140k-company-funds-pokemon-cards-gaming-items/"><em>KTIV</em></a>) were spent on “prepaid gift cards, <em>Pokémon</em> cards, and gaming items.” He is then said to have “submitted falsified receipts and mischaracterized fraudulent charges on his expense reports so that the purchases appeared as legitimate business expenses.”</p>

 <p>As a result of an investigation by the FBI and Des Moines Police Department, Gross has been ordered to repay the full amount of his elicit shopping, as well as serving four months in a federal prison,&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em>three further years of post-release supervision. The report notes, “There is no parole in the federal system.”</p> <p>As is all too often the case in these circumstances, we don’t have the key information: which <em>Pokémon</em> cards did he buy? Was this one big spend on a rare Charizard, or did he pick up a wealth of booster boxes? (The crimes all took place between September 2021 and October 2022, back in the glory days <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920">when you could buy Pokémon cards in stores</a>.)</p> <p>Gross pleaded guilty back in April, and was sentenced in the past couple of days. If he kept the <em>Pokémon</em> cards, he could sell them now four about five times whatever he paid.</p>

<p>Gears of War: Reloaded is right around the corner, bringing the franchise to PlayStation players for the first time, and the full achievement and trophy list is available.</p>



<p>Releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 26</a>, with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-gears-of-war-reloaded-review-embargo-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review embargo lifting on the same date</a>, Gears of War: Reloaded rolls the franchise back to the very beginning and will raise attention ahead of the release prequel title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-e-day-release-window-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War: E-Day next year</a>.</p>



<p>That means there’s plenty of time to achieve full completion of Gears of War: Reloaded before the next instalment releases, and we’ve got the details of every task you need to complete.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-gears-of-war-reloaded-achievements-amp-trophies">All Gears of War: Reloaded Achievements &amp; Trophies</h2>

<p><strong>Unlocking all the achievements and trophies in Gears of War: Reloaded requires mastering all game modes, including completing the campaign on the highest difficulty and killing 10,000 enemies in multiplayer.</strong></p>



<p>If the list below looks familiar, it’s because the achievement and trophy list is the exact same as it is in <a href="https://www.gearsofwar.com/games/gears-reloaded/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gears of War</a>: Ultimate Edition. While that may be disappointing for Xbox players who have done the grind before, it’s the first time for PlayStation trophy-hunters to join the fray.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-many-achievements-amp-trophies-in-gears-of-war-reloaded">How Many Achievements &amp; Trophies in Gears of War: Reloaded?</h2>



<p><strong>There are 56 achievements with a total of 1,250 Gamerscore to earn on Xbox, while there are 57 trophies to hunt on PlayStation—including the illustrious Platinum trophy for 100% completion.</strong></p>



<p>The collection is split with the usual mix of low-earning Gamerscore achievements and Bronze trophies, alongside higher rewards and rarer trophies. As mentioned, you’ll have to become a master of all modes.</p>



<p>At the very least, you’ll need to complete the game in co-op, complete the game on Insane Difficulty, and kill 10,000 enemies online. If you can tick off those three, you’ll probably be very close to full completion.</p>



<p>Are you disappointed that the Gears of War: Reloaded achievement and trophy list is the same as Gears of War: Ultimate Edition? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>The games set to leave PlayStation Plus Extra in September have been revealed. The eight titles include some very good games, so you might want to make some time before 16th September to get them played.</p>
<p>As these games are part of the Game Catalogue and not the monthly games that you claim as part of PS Plus Essential, these games will no longer be playable from 16th September even if they are in your library.</p>
<p>Leaving PS Plus Extra on 16th September:</p>
<ul>
<li>UFC 5 (PS5)</li>
<li>The Plucky Squire (PS5)</li>
<li>Night in the Woods (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Road 96 (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Pistol Whip (PSVR2)</li>
<li>Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir (PS4)</li>
<li>FIST: Forged In Shadow Torch (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Dragon's Crown Pro (PS4)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of the bunch, I'd certainly recommend FIST: Forged In Shadow Torch, especially if you are partial to a Metroidvania. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pistol-whip">Pistol Whip</a> is superb if you have PS VR2, and the Plucky Squire is definitely worth a look even though it didn't quite live up to pre-launch expectations. Night in the Woods is also excellent.</p><p>In fact, why stop there... Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir and Dragon's Crown Pro are also very good games. So, really, what I'm saying is, don't rush to play UFC 5 (which is fine, but just more UFC) or Road 96 (didn't enjoy the writing on this, unfortunately), but all the others are worth your time.</p>

            <p>Gears of War creator Cliff 'CliffyB' Bleszinski is "thrilled" more people will be able to experience the original game when it arrives on PlayStation.</p>
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded is set to be released later this month, on 26th August, across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. It's a revamped edition of the original Gears of War, which first debuted on Xbox almost 20 years ago (yes, it has really been that long). </p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-coming-to-playstation">upcoming souped up version will come complete with faster frame rates and "deeper visual fidelity"</a>, and while he hasn't had a hand in it personally, Bleszinski is delighted that soon those on PlayStation will finally be able to experience the first Gears of War game for themselves.</p>

<p>"It doesn't feel strange," Bleszinski told Eurogamer when asked if it will be odd seeing the once Xbox exclusive popping up on Sony's newest consoles. "I'm thrilled that more people are going to get to experience a big part of my legacy that I worked so hard on."</p><p>The series creator added he is "asked nearly every day on social media" to return to Gears of War. "And I'm like 'uh, I've said it a thousand times I'm open to consult on any of it'," Bleszinski said, before closing:</p>

<p>"Crickets. On to the next!"</p>
<p>Along with his legacy in video games, Bleszinski is also a Broadway producer, restaurant owner and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-of-war-creator-cliffyb-says-series-needs-a-god-of-war-style-reboot">comic book creator</a>.</p>
<p>As for Gears of War, in addition to this month's Reloaded release there's also a new series entry in the works. It's known as Gears of War: E-Day, and will be a prequel title <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marcus-fenix-returns-in-gears-of-war-prequel-e-day">set 14 years before the events of the original game</a>. Gears of War: E-Day is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bulletstorm-studio-confirms-project-maverick-is-a-gears-of-war-game">being co-developed with People Can Fly</a>.</p>
<p>Late last year, it was revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gears-is-so-back-as-original-voice-talents-are-confirmed-for-gears-of-war-e-day">John DiMiaggio and Carlos Ferro will be reprising their roles as Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago</a> in Gears of War: E-Day. "We are so back," a post announcing their inclusion teased.</p>

            <p>True to the game's billing as the twistiest of duty-shooters, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>'s release date trailer appears to have leaked ahead of a possible <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-livestream-watch-all-todays-announcements-here">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a> showing tonight. The new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> will launch on 14th November, close to a month after rival Battlefield 6's release on October 10th. Also, it appears to have jet packs and mechs.</p><!--more-->
<p>The leak comes care of that ever-dependable source of military intelligence, a video advertisement that seems to have been accidentally published early. The ad has now been removed, but not before CharlieIntel spotted it and shared it on the Xeetbox, along with some <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1957614174768689197?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet">thoughts based on the user's own pre-release access</a>. "Just to tone down expectations, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 7 does not have jet packs or double jumps as part of its movement," CharlieIntel claims. Alas for Black Ops 3 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-reach">Halo: Reach</a> players. Good news, I guess, for people who relish the 'omnimovement' of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-best-guns">Black Ops 6</a>.</p>
<p>Here is what we know of Call of Duty: Bleven for sure: it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-follows-battlefield-6s-lead-will-also-require-secure-boot-on-pc">requires secure boot, to avoid cheaters</a>. It's got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-has-been-announced-can-someone-please-explain-the-plot-of-these-games-to-me">the usual co-op, zombies and competitive multiplayer bits</a>. The campaign is set in 2035, hence the mechs and jet packs, and expands upon the global calamities unleashed in Black Ops 2 and Black Ops 6. It sees grizzly grumbleface David Mason chasing after an enigmatic new foe who "weaponise fear". There will probably be hallucinations and other Manchurian Candidate-esque horseplay to wash down the gadgets and gunnery.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/leaked-black-ops-7-video-features-mechs-jet-packs-and-a-release-date/">reported by VGC</a>, today's release date whoopsie corroborates a previous leak that also included a price tag for the Standard Edition - $70 or €80 - with a Vault Edition priced at $100 or €110. If legit, this means that Microsoft has still yet to cross the Rubicon and raise the game's base US price to $80, as they tried to do with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-u-turn-on-charging-80-for-the-outer-worlds-2-and-other-xbox-games-cue-memes-and-pre-order-refunds">until the internet started screaming at them</a>.</p>

                <p>Nvidia has announced that its RTX Hair feature will be added to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> on September 4. In a nutshell, RTX Hair uses Disjoint Orthogonal Triangle Strips (DOTS) to improve lighting and shadows in video game hair, which Nvidia says is a solution that doesn't require a lot of extra memory as opposed to using triangles to render hair for every frame.</p><p>By using linear swept spheres, hair will look more realistic because the geometry is naturally round, thus making it easier to avoid self-intersection when casting shadow and reflection rays. This will allow Harrison Ford's digital doppelganger in the Indiana Jones game to sport a fuller head of hair when the update to the real-time path tracing mode arrives next month. The feature will be available to RTX-50 series GPUs, and earlier this year, <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/render-path-traced-hair-in-real-time-with-nvidia-geforce-rtx-50-series-gpus/" rel="nofollow ">Nvidia added</a> that this is a "big step toward rendering high-quality digital humans" in real time.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Indiana Jones and the Great Circle - 14 Minute Gameplay Deep Dive</p>
      </div>
<p>Hair and related elements like fur have been one of the more challenging things to accurately render in video games over the years. Fortunately, great strides have been made over the years as video game characters went from having what looked like static blobs of meat for hairdos--or buzz-cuts for many protagonists throughout the 2000s and early 2010s--to longer hair that moved realistically during gameplay.</p><p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle launched last year for PC and Xbox Series X|S--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-launches-in-april-on-ps5/1100-6530308/" data-ref-id="1100-6530308">and in April 2025 for PS5</a>--and September will see the arrival of its expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-dlc-the-order-of-giants-coming-in-september/1100-6532248/" data-ref-id="1100-6532248">The Order of Giants</a>. The DLC will see Dr. Jones embark on an expedition to uncover the secrets of the Nephilim Order.</p>

<p>Gamescom is set to unveil a flood of news, reveals, and trailers, with Future Games Show taking a central role with a lengthy livestream, and we’ve got all the details you need.</p>



<p>The latter end of 2025 is shaping up to be a big one with the likes of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-release-date-officially-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-releases-november-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> among the big releases, though the calendar will likely be even more stacked following all the reveals at Gamescom.</p>



<p>Though <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-start-date-times-how-to-watch-how-long-is-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Opening Night Live</a> may take the majority of the headlines, plenty more will be shown at Future Games Show, so we’re providing the details so you don’t miss out.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-future-games-show-at-gamescom">When is Future Games Show at Gamescom?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Big names. Image via Future Games Show</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Future Games Show at Gamescom takes place on Wednesday, August 20, the day after Opening Night Live, with a host of new reveals and news.</strong></p>



<p>Gamescom itself runs until Sunday, August 24, with a host of in-person events and showcases streamed online. This includes several Future Games Show streams, though the main one is on Wednesday.</p>







<p><strong>Future Games Show at Gamescom takes place at 8pm CEST, which is 11am PT. We’ve got a full breakdown of timezones below.</strong></p>



<p>The showcase will start bang on time, with no countdown beyond the start time, so make sure you’re locked in ahead of time. If you do miss any announcements for one reason or another, we’ll have all the biggest news and reveals on Insider Gaming.</p>



<p>Check out the table below to see the start time of Future Games Show in your timezone.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">11:00</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">13:00</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">14:00</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">British Summer Time (BST)</td><td data-align="center">19:00</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST)</td><td data-align="center">04:00 (August 21)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-to-watch-future-games-show-at-gamescom">How to Watch Future Games Show at Gamescom</h2>



<p><strong>Future Games Show at Gamescom will be available to watch directly on YouTube and Twitch, along with TikTok, and plenty of other streaming platforms.</strong></p>



<p>From experience, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/futuregamesshow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch</a> is the best place to follow the live stream as it’s often slightly ahead of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ZVRK-bSdkjo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>, so if you’re scrolling social media at the same time, I highly recommend watching via Twitch to avoid spoilers.</p>



<p>Choose whichever platform works for you, though, and keep Insider Gaming open to track all the biggest news as it breaks.</p>







<p><strong>Future Games Show takes place on the ground at Gamescom in Cologne, Germany, the home of the event.</strong></p>



<p>The showcase will be hosted by David Hayter, the voice of Solid Snake in the Metal Gear Solid franchise, and Maggie Robertson, the star behind Lady Dimitrescu in Resident Evil: Village. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-future-games-show-at-gamescom">How Long is Future Games Show at Gamescom?</h2>



<p><strong>The main Future Games Show stream is 90 minutes long, though it will be immediately followed by FGS Live, a 40-minute show with additional trailers and reveals.</strong></p>



<p>Given the show is set to be action-packed from beginning to end, I’d advise making sure you have everything you need to lock in for over two hours so you don’t miss any of the reveals.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Let’s be clear, the Grand is definitely not haunted, but that doesn’t go for other parts of the British seaside town. There Are No Ghosts at the Grand is a truly quirky mix of ideas, a real hodge-podge that blends hotel renovations, slice-of-life storytelling, horror mysteries and even reggae-infused musical numbers into something that’s quite unique.</p>
<p>The Gamescom 2025 demo –&nbsp;playable at the Xbox booth this week –&nbsp;follows on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/08/no-ghosts-at-the-grand-is-a-musical-supernatural-hotel-renovator-with-a-talking-cat/">the game’s appearance during Microsoft’s summer showcase</a>, and gives a great serving of each of the game’s elements to explore.</p>
<p><iframe title="There are No Ghosts at the Grand Xbox Showcase Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5-TaSv2hL2c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>It starts with a bit of light renovation, as you look to refurnish and spruce up part of the lobby of the hotel that Chris David has just inherited. It’s in a bit of a state, but thankfully the multi-purpose DIY gun and the thoroughly helpful Robert C McBrushy is on hand to guide you through it. He’s a funny little AI DIY mascot, imbued with bags of personality thanks to the decidedly human writing that goes into his being. He’s sure to be a great source of humour and quirky oddities deep into the game.</p>
<p>The gun has multiple modes, right off the bat. A sandblaster can be used to basically shoot old wallpaper off and get back to the plaster underneath, ready for a very forgiving painting mode to spray and shoot globs of patterned paint at the wall – both of these modes autocompleting after you’ve dealt with around 80–90% of a section, and will neatly target through obstacles. A vacuum mode will scoop up plenty of large debris, and a furniture mode can pick up reorient the tumbled furniture and even hang paintings on the wall. Each mode has its own ping function to highlight what’s left to do. It’s all very slick and easy to get to grips with, and honestly, if this weren’t a physics-defying impossibility, I reckon Friday Sundae would make a killing on Dragons Den.</p>


<p>But there’s so much more to this game than just decorating. Miss Green, the town’s mayor hassles you until you answer the ancient Nokia-like brick phone, asking you to come out and help with a little something else around town? It turns out that there’s a mysterious black slime that’s been appearing on the beaches, and she thinks that it could be tracked, quite logically, to an old WW2 installation on the nearby Crammond Island.</p>
<p>So — much to McBrushy’s dismay — you drop what you were doing, hop onto her moped with her and her cat, Mr. Bones, and pootle along to the jetty, driving through some lovely autumnal scenery as you go, and even offroading down the path to get down to the sea shore.</p>
<p>The boat’s an absolute state, though, and needs a bit of help to get it into working order, with McBrushy more than willing to help. It gets even worse when you crash it into Crammond Island after a sudden fog rolls in. You can use the furniture grabber to pick up items like the front crane, railings and buoys to reattach them to the boat, while the vacuum gains a new feature to repurpose certain types of debris to fix up broken sections of hull or even create new furniture.</p>
<p>But getting to the island is an area where There Are No Ghosts at the Grand showcases its most distinctive element. Miss Green has a real chip on her shoulder about you taking over the hotel, stating that it really should be given over to the town to become a tourist attraction instead of being in your hands to mess around with and modernise — she expects the worst of Chris, since he is an American.</p>

<p>Her grousing bursts into song as you take to the water and pilot the boat through checkpoints, which I let wash over me while watching the demo be played by writer and game director Anil Glendinning — I rarely listen closely to song lyrics, and instead just appreciate a good tune, with her music having a bit of a folk reggae fusion to it. Each character in the game has their own theme tune and songs to unlock as you progress through the story, but it’s really all a part of the game’s dialogue system and relationships.</p>
<p>Where many video game dramas will give you dialogue options, here you’re given song options, the ability to respond with a verse of Chris’s own, bouncing the lyrics down a different path as the character then responds in kind. Each character has a relationship meter for you to build up, both through dialogue and completing tasks and missions, and this does feed into the game’s overarching narrative and some of the endings that will become available to you.</p>
<p>The team are aiming for a game that’s around 8–10 hours to complete, but there will be plenty of side content, people and jobs to take on. You’ll be redecorating so much more than the Grand in this… including a WW2 bunker, it turns out.</p>
<p>Stranded on the island and forced to wait for the low tide when a land bridge will appear, Chris has to make the best of the situation and spruce up a corner of the bunker to be a little bedroom. Anil went for more of a pink and flowery princess bedroom style here, with dressers, ornate lights, bright and colourful wallpaper, but you can obviously take it in some very different directions.</p>

<p>But suddenly there’s a sound. Miss Green said The Grand’s not haunted, but what about this island? Exploring the bunker reveals a shimmering ball of gold that expands as you get near, with humanoid forms within. It’s a memory, a portal back to historical events and people that you need to engage with in a number of ways to fix the scene and nudge the story along. McBrushy comes in all handy yet again, letting you move items back into place, to blast out-of-place boxes, and the other usual things. It gives a peek back into what the bunker’s true purpose was, though really you’re only left with more questions as you delve deeper and deeper into the bunker…. ably helped by McBrushy adding a little…. atmosphere.</p>

<p>Oh, and then Mr. Bones starts talking to you. What’s that? A talking cat? While he loves a good scratch and tickle round the ears during the day, eagerly hopping into moped basket and boat window to appreciate the journey, at night he speaks with an Aussie accent and encourages you as the more bizarre and surreal Lovecraftian horrors take hold.</p>
<p>Emerging from the bunker’s tunnels in another part of the island, you come across a bunch of red plush chairs set about the place. How charmingly odd, you might think, but you won’t for long. Mr. Bones hurries you along, cautioning you not to get too close — either way, they suddenly sprout extra legs and eyes and start chasing you, while McBrushy transforms into an actual gun to let you get blasting.</p>

<p>It’s a pretty wild turn, but just hints at the many more barmy twists and supernatural goings on that you’ll encounter through There Are No Ghosts at the Grand. After the music-filled announcement and the otherworldly twists that tail-ended that trailer, seeing the game in action, with the oh-so-easy to use redecorating tools, the characters and the ways that they’re brought together in inventive ways is a true delight. There Are No Ghosts at the Grand deserves its place on your wishlist for 2026.</p>

<p>There's just one thing bugging us...</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Gulikit - ES | ES PRO 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2304f4170f9b1/gulikit-es-es-pro-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Gulikit</em></figcaption></figure><p>Accessory manufacturer Gulikit has launched a new range of budget controllers with Switch 2 wake-up support.</p>
<p>The ES and ES PRO Wireless Controllers are out now and priced at <strong>£24.99 / $24.99</strong> and <strong>£29.99 / $29.99</strong> respectively (exchange rates working wonders there, we see). Aesthetically, both models are pretty similar and seem to be based on the overall design of the Xbox controller, with off-set concave analogue sticks, a faceted d-pad, and an almost identical shape.</p>
<p>The ES PRO comes in black or white, while the standard ES is more of a light grey colour with matching sticks and face buttons.</p>
<p>As for the specific features, the ES boasts Hall Effect sticks, while the ES PRO comes rocking 4000-level TMR anti-drift joysticks. Gyro aiming is supported along with d-pad directional adjustment, various vibration settings, and face button re-mapping.</p>
<p>The latter seems particularly important, since there's one thing about the ES and ES PRO that's bugging us. You've probably noticed it already, right..? Yes, the ABXY layout isn't suited to the Switch out of the box. They're the wrong way around! Oof, vexing... Still, the ability to re-map will likely resolve this issue, and let's face it, nobody stares down at their controller whilst playing a game. For the relatively cheap price, it's something we can probably forgive.</p>

                <p>Aggro Crab has finally revealed the answer to a question we've all been asking about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/peak/" data-ref-id="5000-682347">Peak</a>, its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/co-op-climbing-game-peak-has-exploded-on-steam-with-huge-player-numbers/1100-6532633/" data-ref-id="1100-6532633">surprise hit co-op climbing </a>collab with Landfall--is Bing Bong sentient?</p><p>The answer is yes, or at least, he used to be. The studio revealed in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/kgWKv_iQ1Vg" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent video</a> that developers used to possess Bing Bong to talk to streamers, but no longer will be doing so. In a video that shows a look behind the curtain, Aggro Crab revealed that devs would talk to players through Bing Bong, but only in cases where they were publicly sharing their game.</p><p>"It was a really funny way to give creators a wild experience in the first few weeks of us releasing Peak," the video explains. Aggro Crab also clarifies that devs weren't able to join private games, and that talking Bing Bong was only really present in those first few weeks. "We removed this feature mid-June, so if you are seeing anyone claiming that the devs are joining them through Bing Bong or any other way, they're full of sh**."</p><p>Bing Bong, a lumpy green plushie, is found on the crashed plane at the start of Peak. Even though he may no longer be sentient, he has become something of a mascot for the game, and many players give up precious pack space just to cart him to the top of the mountain.</p><p>This kind of direct interaction with streamers isn't out of character for Landfall--on the studio's previous title Clustertruck, the developers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wB7xRFTlahU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"hacked" a version of the game</a> being run at Summer Games Done Quick, interacting with the speedrunner through messages on the screen and modifying game visuals on the fly.</p><p>Peak has been surprisingly successful for a game developed largely in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-the-developers-of-peak-primarily-made-the-game-out-of-jealousy/1100-6532754/" data-ref-id="1100-6532754">one-month game jam</a>, selling over a million copies in its first week and continuing to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aptly-named-co-op-climbing-game-peak-continues-to-scale-past-higher-and-higher-all-time-peak-player-counts/1100-6533021/" data-ref-id="1100-6533021">reach higher player peaks</a> over time.

                <p>Despite the legendary dragon Pokemon's popularity, a large number of Pokemon fans are going around pronouncing Rayquaza's name wrong--and The Pokemon Company is trying to teach us how it's actually said.</p><p>If you use the common pronunciation of ray-KWAH-zuh, you would be incorrect according to official sources. A reminder of this--and the correct pronunciation--was popped up on the big screen at the Pokemon World Championships 2025 over the weekend, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/turns-out-weve-been-saying-this-pokemons-name-wrong-all-these-years" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN reports</a>. According to the "mispronounced Pokemon" graphic shared by The Pokemon Company, the correct pronunciation is ray-KWAY-zuh, sounding closer to the word quasar.</p><p>While some fans reacted with shock to the official pronunciation, others flat-out refuse to adopt it. The iconic legendary has been around for a long time, making its first appearance in 2002's Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire, before becoming the mascot Pokemon for Pokemon Emerald two years later. Having been a part of the series for over two decades, it's no wonder players would refuse to change how they've been pronouncing Rayquaza all this time.</p><p>Of course, some fans on social media point out that they already use the correct pronunciation, which is used more often than not in Rayquaza's infrequent but memorable appearances in the Pokemon anime.</p><p>The next big Pokemon release is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a/" data-ref-id="5000-619901">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>, and while the game has more of a focus on Mega Evolutions as part of its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-shakes-up-pokemons-combat-for-the-first-time-in-decades/1100-6533977/" data-ref-id="1100-6533977">major combat shakeup</a>, it's not clear if fan-favorite Mega Rayquaza will be making an appearance.</p>

The new guy is called Denari, and he's got the potential to be a game-changing defender thanks to his ability to lay down laser traps.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuwW4zfpvE4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VuwW4zfpvE4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Denari is a Swiss military veteran who wields a Scorpion EVO 3 SMG or an FMG-9 SMG, and an optional P226 Mk 25 pistol in conjunction with his Glaive-12 shotgun sidearm. But the real attraction is his ability to use T.R.I.P. connectors to make laser grid traps that can slow down enemies or even temporarily trap them. The lasers do inflict damage, and simply powering through won't get rid of them because the devices reactive after a few seconds.</p><p>There are a few ways to counter Denari's T.R.I.P. connectors, including shooting them, melee attacks, or using explosives. Drones can also be used to dismantle the connections. However, the most effective tactic appears to an impact EMP grenade that can disable the laser field. Unfortunately, many of those options leave attackers wide open for a trap by Denari or his allies.  </p><p>Ubisoft also announced that Lair, Nighthaven Labs, and Consulate will be added to the pool of modernized maps. The Dual Front mode is also adding a safe room that will allow teams to regroup in the middle of a match to take the advantage. Some of the other balancing tweaks include the removal of magnified scopes from Doc, Rook, Frost, Echo, Castle, Tachanka, and Goyo. Sledge, Oryx, Pulse, Rook, and Ying will also be able to use the Reaper MK2 machine pistol, which was previously exclusively wielded by Rauora.</p><p>Rainbow Six Siege X: Operation High Stakes will begin on September 2.</p>

<p>This time, however, something feels different. We're mere hours away from Gamescom's Opening Night Live showcase, and host Geoff Keighley has posted a rather intriguing tease via <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1957492830374650018">X</a>. It simply shows himself in what looks to be a rather fancy hotel room, looking in the mirror whilst wearing a clown nose (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oh-boy-geoff-keighley-is-teasing-hollow-knight-silksong-for-gamescom-opening-night-live">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>The accompanying caption reads "First time? See you tomorrow for @gamescom ONL", with a clown emoji included for good measure.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067zoswtr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Now, if you're unaware of what the heck this all means, it's essentially a blatant nod toward Silksong fans who have made it somewhat of a tradition to post clown memes and emojis during major gaming events, indicating their fruitless hope that Silksong might finally be showcased.</p>
<p>So, there are two possible outcomes here, as far as we can tell. Either Geoff is simply being a complete tool and purposefully winding up Silksong fans, or... Silksong will <em>actually</em> be shown during Gamescom ONL.</p>
<p>It seems wild to us that Keighley would go out of his way to procure a clown nose just to p*** people off, but who knows! We reckon he's fully aware of the intense backlash that would occur if that was indeed the case. So as it stands, we're leaning <em>slightly</em> toward the genuine possibility that we might finally get a release date for Silksong.</p>
<p>Or maybe the joke's on us.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Review scores. Who needs 'em? Well, Valve reckon Steam didn't have enough two word verdicts on games, so they've introduced a "language-specific" scoring system, which offers separate ratings based on user reviews penned in certain tongues.</p>
<p>The goal's to paint a more detailed picture of what folks in different parts of the world think of what they've played, allowing you to see at a glance whether that game you've been putting off adding to your backlog is the bees' knees among Korean-speaking players. That's provided said game meets the threshold of having 2,000 publicly visible reviews in total and at least 200 written in the specific language you're looking for.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Steam's growth since then into an even larger global presence means customers in different regions of the world may have vastly different experiences from each other for the same game," Valve <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/500579345320904530?utm_source=SteamDB">explained</a>. "There are a variety of reasons this may happen for a particular game, including translation issues, cultural references, poor network connections, and many others; things that the overall review scores haven't been able to capture until now. Calculating a language-specific review score means that we can better distill the sentiment of these different groups of customers, and in doing so, better serve potential customers that belong to those groups."</p>
<p>"When there are enough reviews written in a particular language, Steam will calculate a review score for that language," they added. "The Review Score displayed to users will be based on their primary language. What this means is that some languages may show more positive review scores, while others may show more negative ones, for the same game."</p><p>So, the usual scores you're shown when you first navigate to a game's Steam page haven't gone anywhere. To see the "language-specific" scores, which are enabled by default, you'll need to head into the game's reviews section, then sort via a new drop-down menu labelled language. Below is what doing so currently shows you for shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Valve / Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There's a reason I've picked that game too. Around the time the Illuminate faction invaded Super Earth, the game saw a spike in negative reviews specifically from Chinese players, rooted in an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-battle-for-super-earth-makes-chinese-news-following-the-successful-and-slightly-review-bomby-defense-of-equality-on-sea">apparent translation mixup</a> specific to the version of the game in that language. The result was a bit of confusion as players in other regions struggled to work out why the game's overall rating had suddenly taken a hit. While scrolling back through recent reviews offered an idea of what had happened, in splitting up reviews like this, hopefully Valve have made it easier to tell when something like this has happened.</p>
<p>That'll probably be useful for developers, who'll be able to quickly see the change in sentiment among players speaking a certain language, and investigate whether the cause is something they can fix. On the other hand, there's the potential that in letting players see what certain regions think, we might get some hijinks or chicanery if folks decide to mess around in bad faith. For example, fomenting fresh culture wars by doing battle over which continent has the consensus, or otherwise trying to push verdicts in specfic directions just because of what other folks are doing.</p><p>People not using Steam reviews to offer straight-laced, in-depth analysis of a game's strengths and weaknesses? As someone who prior to getting into this profession left a sarky two line <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> review based entirely around disappointment that its character creator didn't boast an inch-based penis size slider, I can't imagine such a thing.</p>

<p>Kai Cenat has unveiled his Fortnite Icon Series skin and announced his next Mafiathon, both of which arrive in September.</p>



<p>Cenat used the Las Vegas sphere to show off the first look at his Fortnite skin, alongside announcing the start date of Mafiathon 3—with both landing on the same day.</p>



<p>Fortnite and Cenat had already teased the reveal of the skin, which came on the eve of the latest Fortnite update that drops August 19, and big things lie ahead.</p>



<h2 id="h-kai-cenat-fortnite-skin-lands-september-12">Kai Cenat Fortnite Skin Lands September 12</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1957670133281018326" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Las Vegas sphere unveiling</a> from Kai Cenat showed off the Icon Series Skin alongside what appears to be an aura emote, while his hamster, Lil Cenat, also featured—which may be a hint towards the drop of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-pets-are-reportedly-being-reworked-to-be-a-bit-more-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite’s leaked companion update</a>.</p>



<p>Releasing September 12, the drop of Cenat’s Fortnite skin coincides with the start date of his mega Mafiathon 3 streaming event. The previous event, held in December 2024, saw the streamer reclaim the Twitch subscriber record.</p>



<p>Mafiathon has featured a host of special guests in the past, with the next event set to be no different, and, with the start on the same date as the Fortnite skin drop, we can expect Fortnite to feature heavily.</p>



<p>Cenat is the third content creator to receive an Icon Series skin in 2025, following on from Clix and Sparx in March. Other Icon Series skins released this year include baseball star Shohei Ohtani, former Tottenham captain Son Heung-Min, and the stars of Fortnite Festival seasons.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/gamescom-2025">Gamescom 2025</a> begins today, Tuesday August 19th, with Opening Night Live - the annual livestream showcase of trailers, teasers and release date announcements, in which helpless videogames are dragged on-stage and hacked into 90-second gobbets by Geoff Keighley. 
</p>
<p>
You can watch Gamescom Opening Night Live on this very page, care of the below video embed. The show starts at <strong>2pm EDT, 11 am PDT, 7pm BST and 8pm CEST</strong>, and should last around two hours, because that's approximately as long as the summoning magic can keep Geoff bound to our mortal plane. There's also a pre-show at <strong>1.30pm EDT, 10.30am PDT, 6.30pm BST, and 7.30pm CEST</strong>, but nothing noteworthy ever happens in those. Prove me wrong, host Kyle Boseman!

It's going to be an absolute festival of indignities, and what better way to add insult to injury than in the form of a dedicated RPS liveblog. I'll be writing up the announcements as they come, with input from Mark, Ollie and James. We welcome your speculations, exhilaration, outrage and consternation in the comments section. Feed the Maw!

<p>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance will receive DLC themed around iconic SEGA villains next year, it has been revealed, with the release date rapidly approaching.</p>



<p>Set to be released on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-release-date-revealed-at-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 29</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch, rebooting the Shinobi franchise that has lain dormant since 2011.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.sega.com/news/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-dlc-speedrun-challenge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SEGA announced</a> the SEGA Villains Stage will be released in early 2026, featuring iconic Sonic the Hedgehog villain Dr. Eggman, with two additional villains due to be announced.</p>



<p>Although a precise release date for the DLC was not shown, more news could be on the horizon as the release date edges closer, and the news continues SEGA’s heavy crossover content.</p>



<p>Sonic Racing Crossworlds, another SEGA title due to launch on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-racing-crossworld-release-date-trailer-features-minecraft-persona-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 25</a>, has already announced that characters from Minecraft, Persona, SpongeBob SquarePants, Avatar: The Last Airbender, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will feature.</p>



<p>SEGA’s push to revive its dormant franchises, like Shinobi, after over 14 years, could bring a new audience to the title, particularly with additional crossover content.</p>



<p>The announcement also included details of a Speedrun challenge to celebrate the upcoming launch, with players competing to set the best completion times in Shinobi 3: Return of the Ninja Master and the demo for Shinobi: Art of Vengeance.</p>
