            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-pc-upgrade-adds-mandatory-psn-account-requirement/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite this being one of the most controversial decisions made in the PC ports of their PlayStation games, Sony is doing it again. The PC version of Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered on PC will add a mandatory PSN account requirement. The decision to do this in their previous games has already had Sony under fire by the masses, and it seems that they haven't read the criticisms, or they would stray from making such a decision.</p>
<p>While the<a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-launching-this-october-on-pc-and-ps5/"> PC upgrade</a> will come with benefits, this serves as a huge inconvenience to those who don't want to have to make a PlayStation account to play their PC game. Once you have a PlayStation account set up for the game, it will come with a PlayStation overlay with Trophy Support, as well as its own set of features which includes support for ultra-wide resolutions.</p>
<p>Additionally, the upgrade will use performance-enhancing technologies such as NVIDIA DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3.1 with frame generation. All of this information will be covered in another blog post at a later date.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-is-coming-to-ps5-pc-october-31-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post released on the PlayStation</a> website after the announcement, Jan-Bart Van Beek discusses the decision to remaster the game and how it came to be. Jan-Bart van Beek is the Studio Director, as well as the Studio Art &amp; Animation Director at Guerilla. To help remaster the game, Nixxes got involved and has been leading the charge on remastering the game. Nixxes was acquired by Sony Interactive Entertainment in July 2021, with the specific job of bringing PlayStation games to PC. They have worked on port developments for games such as Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, and Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut.</p>
<p>The Horizon Zero Dawn Remaster will of course have the technological improvements and visual enhancements. Still, this version of the game will also include The Frozen Wilds, which is the huge expansion created for the game, adding extra environments, weapons, and machines for you to explore.</p>
<p>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered has also been announced to come with native support for the Playstation 5 Pro. The game will utilize all of the features of the PlayStation 5 and the DualSense controller by adding custom haptics to make it more tactile and immersive. The blog post states that the game will allow you to access your old save games from the older version, allowing players to dive into a New Game+ or utilize the Photo Mode available.</p>
<p>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered will be available on PC via Steam or the Epic Game Store, priced at $49.99. Although those who previously owned the PS4 or PC version of the game can get the remaster for $9.99, those who have a disc-less console and own the previous iteration on a disc won't be able to access the upgrade offer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/25/24253649/ps5-pro-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Eight years ago, PlayStation lead architect Mark Cerny showed me the power of the PS4 Pro in this very room. Today, I’m checking out the new PS5 Pro instead — and feeling some major déjà vu. </p><p>Like before, Sony is showing journalists a room full of screens at its PlayStation US headquarters just outside of San Francisco, playing 11 games side by side on both the original hardware and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24240801/ps5-pro-details-playstation-event-september-2024">the guts of the new $700 Pro</a>. Like before, you’ll pay a hefty premium for graphical improvements rather than new titles. Like before, games will need to be patched to give you most of those boosts, and not all patches will be equal.</p><p>And like before, those improvements are <em>seriously impressive</em> if your TV is close enough to your couch. This time, it brings out details like individual blades of grass, improves the density of particles onscreen, unlocks optional 8K and ray tracing modes, and even reduces the distracting shimmering that often popped up in games on the original console. </p><p>Michiel van der Leeuw, technical director on all the <em>Horizon </em>games, shows me how much smoother <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> can be on the PS5 Pro, how much sharper now that it’s sampling textures that render more crisply, and how it no longer needs to display the same ugly clouds.</p><p>“It was as if a pair of dirty goggles had been lifted from my eyes,” <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/playstation-4-pro-4k-tv-games-checkerboard-rendering/">I wrote in 2016 about the PS4 Pro</a>. I get the exact same vibe from <em>Horizon</em> and most other PS5 Pro Enhanced games I’m trying now. </p><div><p><figcaption>Horizon Forbidden West<em> technical director Michiel van der Leeuw shows me another scene, where the PS5 Pro loads this dino’s skin at higher quality, sooner, than the PS5 below.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>I’ll get into more details below, but I want you to know my conclusion <em>isn’t</em> quite the same as it was eight years ago. While it’s clearly better than the PS5, I’m not yet sold. That’s mostly because Sony is charging several hundred dollars more than last time — but also partly because I had to stand so close to the 4K screen to get that eye-popping result. </p><p>Sony’s demos keep us so close to the TVs it’s impossible not to see improvements, with fixed-length wired controllers encouraging us to stay nearby. When I step back anyhow, the PS5 Pro’s graphical improvements get harder to make out. Some disappear at six feet, most of them at 10 feet, in game after game. That’s a bit further than I measured with the PS4 Pro vs. PS4 eight years ago.</p><p>But if you’re the kind of person who already sets your PS5 games to “Quality” or “Fidelity” or “Graphics” mode rather than “Performance,” I bet you’ll see a huge increase in smoothness with the PS5 Pro no matter how far away you sit. Some went from utterly choppy to downright buttery for me on the PS5 Pro, with almost all the visual quality (if not more) than the original PS5’s fidelity modes.</p><p>The biggest surprise for me, though, was seeing a console that can offer so many of the immersive benefits of ray tracing without massive slowdowns. It’s unlikely many games will <em>add</em> ray tracing modes specifically for the PS5 Pro, but Formula One racing game <em>F1 24 </em>already had them — and it now lets you drive at an upscaled 4K and 60fps with them turned on. </p><p>When producer Simon Lumb flicks ray-traced graphics on and off for me, it feels like the whole image comes to life. Suddenly, the car’s crash-protection halo casts realistic shadows on the bodywork; reflections naturally appear in puddles on the track and on the car’s shiny hood; windows appear to refract light.</p><div><p><figcaption>Demon’s Souls<em>’ smoky boss barriers now have more particles — an interesting feature of Sony’s PSSR. </em></figcaption></p></div><p>Both <em>F1 24</em> and <em>Gran Turismo 7</em> will let you choose other modes instead of ray tracing. They can optionally use the PS5 Pro’s extra horsepower and AI upscaling to offer an 8K picture (for the few and proud with 8K TVs), or a smoother 120Hz mode at 4K upscaled resolution instead. But now that I’ve experienced it, I’d pick ray tracing every time. </p><p><strong>Quick note</strong>: if a developer says their game is running at “4K” resolution, you should know that’s not necessarily an apples-to-apples comparison with other “4K” games. In every case, the PS5 Pro is outputting<em> </em>a 4K picture to your TV thanks to the magic of AI upscaling, with all the crispness that provides. The game’s internal render resolution may be quite a bit lower, though, and it <em>varies</em> as you play, all of which can affect the end quality.</p><div><p><strong>Just for transparency’s sake:</strong></p><div><ul><li>Sony didn’t grant us an interview about the PS5 Pro, so we weren’t able to answer any new questions about the hardware itself. </li><li>Sony wouldn’t let us touch the new console hardware. </li><li>The demos were technically running on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-playstation-5-dev-kit-photo-sets-tongues-wagging">PS5 devkits</a> representing the PS5 and PS5 Pro, not the consoles <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/20/24249600/ps5-pro-30th-anniversary-photos">in my photos</a>. Scott Stein tells me <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/exclusive-hands-on-i-played-sonys-all-new-ps5-pro/">his early preview at <em>CNET</em></a> also did not run on the console in his photos. This isn’t entirely unusual for new hardware: I once reviewed an Xbox 360 game on a Microsoft-provided devkit. </li><li>We couldn’t take photos or video close to the screens, in case you’re wondering why we didn’t do so.</li></ul></div></div><p>Developers tell me that Sony’s PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) upscaling can keep up with all of that, turning a 720p image into a 4K one on the fly at 59.94 frames per second — but 720p upscaled to 2160p may not look as good as 1440p upscaled to 2160p, of course. Some developers might still want to sacrifice frame rate for resolution if Sony lets them. (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/16/24131799/sony-ps5-pro-enhanced-requirements-ultra-boost-mode">A leaked document suggests they might</a>, but Sony has not confirmed.)</p><p>Also: while developer after developer tells me the PS5 Pro provides “the best of both worlds” with fidelity and performance, the PS5 Pro doesn’t <em>quite</em> offer double the performance of the original console — so some small sacrifices are being made.  </p><p>For example, Insomniac’s <em>Spider-Man 2</em> actually runs at a lower render resolution in its new PS5 Pro “Performance Pro” mode than it does in the “Fidelity” mode on the original PS5. While I <em>vastly preferred</em> the PS5 Pro experience, it does lead to some interesting edge cases where fine detail on certain objects (like windows on distant buildings) might not be quite as easy to make out. </p><div><p><figcaption>Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart <em>technical director Mike Fitzgerald</em> <em>shows me how picture quality has improved — at a slight expense of crowd density.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>With <em>Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart</em>, the same developer took a different tack: if you look closely, there are actually fewer spectators in the stands in the PS5 Pro’s “Performance Pro” mode compared to the vanilla PS5’s “Fidelity” mode. Still, the game looks both smoother and crisper thanks to the PS5 Pro changes, so it’s hard for me to complain. More detail in some areas too!</p><p>When developers do have to choose, several tell me they decided to prioritize “stability,” fixing the most glaring sacrifices they had to make on the original console. But some games will ship with their original Performance and Fidelity modes, too, in case you prefer them. </p><p>And a few games really do look like the best of both worlds: I couldn’t find a single sacrifice in my short time with <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth — </em>the hair and fine details on PS5 Pro even exceed the original PS5’s “Graphics” mode.</p><p>We’re looking forward to getting a PS5 Pro in for testing so we can do a full review. Meanwhile, I’ll leave you with some rough notes on each game I saw!</p><div><ul><li><strong><em>Demon’s Souls</em>:</strong> One single PS5 Pro mode that targets 60fps at a PSSR-upscaled 4K resolution — may not always hit 60 but feels very smooth for a FromSoftware game. Will retain old modes, too. Lots of extra souls-like particle effects thanks to PSSR! Can see flagpoles on a castle in the distance from Boletaria Bridge that aren’t visible on the original PS5, as long as I’m no further than five feet from the TV.</li><li><strong><em>Dragon’s Dogma II</em>:  </strong>PS5 Pro mode currently hitting 55–60fps VRR in the city, capped at 60fps outside, at PSSR-upscaled 4K resolution. Wouldn’t discuss internal resolution.</li><li><strong><em>F1 24</em>:<em> </em></strong>1440p render resolution, PSSR-upscaled to 4K at locked 60fps. Ray-tracing mode also 4K, locked 60fps. 4K120 and 8K60 modes, too. On original PS5, had to run at half-res internally to hit 4K60, so 1440p is an improvement.</li><li><strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>:<em> </em></strong>One single PS5 Pro mode at PSSR-upscaled 4K60, variable internal resolution. Best showcase game for the PS5 Pro, as the original PS5’s performance mode looks muddy by comparison. Can clearly see scratches on Cloud’s sword from five feet that are invisible in original PS5’s performance mode; can barely make them out at eight feet. </li><li><em><strong>Gran Turismo 7: </strong></em>Four PS5 Pro modes: prioritize ray tracing, prioritize frame rate, 8K mode, 120Hz 4K mode, all using PSSR for upscaling and all targeting 60fps; 8K mode slightly sharper than 4K. Ray tracing mode clearly lets cars show reflections of one another. </li><li><strong><em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>: </strong>Three PS5 Pro modes: fidelity, fidelity + ray tracing, performance. PS5 Pro perf mode has more detail than original PS5 perf mode. Ray tracing looks impressive, now includes ray-traced shadows and more detail in reflections. All modes dynamic internal resolution, but now capped at 80 percent of 4K rather than 67 percent of 4K. </li><li><strong><em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>: </strong>One single PS5 Pro mode at PSSR-upscaled 4K60, based on “higher than 1440p” variable internal resolution. Will also offer old PS5 modes. On original PS5, offered 1800p checkerboard based on lower internal resolution. Far less distracting shimmering on distant details, increased texture detail (all textures one mipmap crisper), increased shadow filtering quality in faces, and more.</li><li><em><strong>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2: </strong></em>One single PS5 Pro mode at PSSR-upscaled 4K60, based on lower render resolution than original Fidelity mode. Considering a “Fidelity Pro” mode as well. Shimmering cleaned up dramatically at distance. </li><li><strong><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em>: </strong>One single PS5 Pro mode at PSSR-upscaled 4K60, based on “generally a tick or two higher” internal render resolution than on PS5. (Original render resolution varied but minimum ranged from 1080p to around 1280p depending on mode.) Small details like bits of confetti don’t disappear as easily; reduced shimmering on details.</li><li><strong><em>The Crew Motorfest</em>: </strong>One single PS5 Pro mode at PSSR-upscaled 4K60. Increased load distances, shadow distances, but can’t quite tell the difference at racing speeds. Increased internal resolution too, though: I can make out a spoiler’s carbon fiber texture at five feet from TV, which I can’t see on original PS5. </li><li><strong><em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</em>: </strong>One single PS5 Pro mode at 4K60, PSSR-upscaled from 1440p. On original PS5, only offered native 4K30 or 1440p60. It’s clearly far sharper than 1440p60 (the grass!) and far smoother than 4K30. Some slight details in the original native 4K30 arguably look better. </li></ul></div><p><em>Photos by Sean Hollister / The Verge</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But perhaps the most exciting among these collaborations is the upcoming one with DC Comics, which was first teased with a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZrNVa5McCo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZrNVa5McCo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brief animated clip</a></span> of Sonic’s rival Shadow dressed in Batman’s garb and fighting criminals in Gotham on September 21. Well, it turns out this wasn’t just a tribute to the caped crusader on Batman Day, but a tease for a long-standing collaboration between <em>Sonic </em>and the comic book company.</p><p>Late in the showcase, Sega’s chief brand &amp; business officer for the <em>Sonic</em> series Ivo Gerscovich revealed the collaboration will include a five-issue comic series that will roll out monthly starting in March 2025. The comics will be written by Ian Flynn, who leads the ongoing <em>Sonic </em>IDW comics and was also a writer on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-frontiers-review-open-world-breath-of-the-wild-1849764736&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-frontiers-review-open-world-breath-of-the-wild-1849764736"><em>Sonic Frontiers</em></a></span>, andwill show several <em>Sonic </em>characters portraying different DC superheroes. Gerscovich said Sonic, Shadow, and the rest of the cast will be teaming up with the Justice League while also dressing as them, so it doesn’t sound like Sonic and friends are taking the place of the DC heroes. Maybe each comic will show <em>Sonic </em>characters working alongside the superheroes and learning a thing or two. God knows Shadow and Batman could <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-shadow-maria-death-actor-1851227374&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-shadow-maria-death-actor-1851227374">bond over grief</a></span> and their attempts to make the world a better place to honor someone they’ve lost.</p><p>While Shadow as Batman was the first crossover teased, Gerscovich revealed several other characters who will be donning a superhero costume in the comics next year. Let’s go down the list.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="67bcbf9fbc340674f733ac0c0c0a0a9e" data-recommend-id="image://67bcbf9fbc340674f733ac0c0c0a0a9e" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tiffany Smith presents Shadow as Batman." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tiffany Smith presents Shadow as Batman." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega / DC Comics / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="67bcbf9fbc340674f733ac0c0c0a0a9e" data-recommend-id="image://67bcbf9fbc340674f733ac0c0c0a0a9e" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tiffany Smith presents Shadow as Batman." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Looking at the list, a few of these collaborations are natural fits. Putting Shadow, the dark, brooding hedgehog as Batman is one of those crossovers that just makes sense. One notable part of Shadow’s Batman design is that his red stripes have been recolored to a gray similar to the hero’s costume. He still has his iconic, rocket-powered jet shoes on top of the cape and utility belt, but they have also been recolored to give him a uniform, night-appropriate look.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0dcc37d69d95a52d662f49c41e18756d" data-recommend-id="image://0dcc37d69d95a52d662f49c41e18756d" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" Ivo Gerscovich presents Knuckles as Superman." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt=" Ivo Gerscovich presents Knuckles as Superman." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega / DC Comics / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0dcc37d69d95a52d662f49c41e18756d" data-recommend-id="image://0dcc37d69d95a52d662f49c41e18756d" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" Ivo Gerscovich presents Knuckles as Superman." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While you might expect Sonic to wear the Superman cape and tights as an optimistic juxtaposition for Shadow as Batman’s brooding nature, Knuckles as Superman makes a ton of sense. The echidna has been characterized by his strength over the years and can glide just like Superman flies. The design looks like a much more straightforward redesign than Shadow’s, mostly just putting Knuckles into the suit without a ton of notable changes. He does keep his sneakers, however, which are now a solid red, without the yellow mid-sections.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="eef33ebc42f67ffdecf71da2609a0aa4" data-recommend-id="image://eef33ebc42f67ffdecf71da2609a0aa4" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" Ivo Gerscovich presents Amy as Wonder Woman." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt=" Ivo Gerscovich presents Amy as Wonder Woman." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega / DC Comics / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="eef33ebc42f67ffdecf71da2609a0aa4" data-recommend-id="image://eef33ebc42f67ffdecf71da2609a0aa4" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" Ivo Gerscovich presents Amy as Wonder Woman." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Amy’s Wonder Woman design marries her silhouette with the hero’s maximalist iconography and palette. She keeps the dress she’s known for, albeit colored with the red, blue, and gold theme synonymous with the Amazonian hero. The skirt is adorned with stars and the “WW” logo is spread across the top. Her hammer also has the hero’s logo on it, which I’m glad to see is still here as opposed to replacing her iconic weapon with Wonder Woman’s Lasso of Truth. There’s already so much of Wonder Woman in this design, so it’s good to see part of Amy’s personality still shining through. In place of her own hairband, Amy now wears a gold one with a red star in the center much like Wonder Woman’s, and dons a red cape with a golden trim. It’s definitely one of the busier designs of the bunch, but Amy’s never been one to do something halfway.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c0779f60022c245b5c694f5b53b71d80" data-recommend-id="image://c0779f60022c245b5c694f5b53b71d80" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ivo Gerscovich presents Sonic as The Flash." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ivo Gerscovich presents Sonic as The Flash." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega / DC Comics / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c0779f60022c245b5c694f5b53b71d80" data-recommend-id="image://c0779f60022c245b5c694f5b53b71d80" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ivo Gerscovich presents Sonic as The Flash." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> Again, this is one of those that just makes sense when you hear it. The blue blur’s gotta go fast, so he’s naturally going to be cosplaying as DC Comics’ speedster. All things considered, Sonic’s Flash costume is pretty tame. If you didn’t know any better, you’d think he was just a fan’s red hedgehog OC. Every inch of his blue fur has been covered with a red costume with gold lightning bolts etched into the material. He also has little lightning bolts next to his ears to represent Flash’s “wings” seen on his mask in most modern depictions. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2f9dbb34139d1cd0903b7130fd3a7eba" data-recommend-id="image://2f9dbb34139d1cd0903b7130fd3a7eba" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tiffany Smith and Ivo Gerscovich present Silver as Green Lantern." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tiffany Smith and Ivo Gerscovich present Silver as Green Lantern." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega / DC Comics / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2f9dbb34139d1cd0903b7130fd3a7eba" data-recommend-id="image://2f9dbb34139d1cd0903b7130fd3a7eba" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tiffany Smith and Ivo Gerscovich present Silver as Green Lantern." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This combination also makes sense, but it is probably the least remarkable of the designs. Silver’s psychic powers are a hop and skip away from using a powerful ring to create anything you can imagine, so he’s a solid fit to wear a Power Ring and join the Green Lantern Corps. But yeah, he’s got the green torso piece with the logo on his chest and black spandex on his arms and legs, but there’s not much else to this. Glad to see Silver getting some love, though.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="10ba66d60f09f6d08694a1f280408be0" data-recommend-id="image://10ba66d60f09f6d08694a1f280408be0" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ivo Gerscovich presents Tails as Cyborg." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ivo Gerscovich presents Tails as Cyborg." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega / DC Comics / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="10ba66d60f09f6d08694a1f280408be0" data-recommend-id="image://10ba66d60f09f6d08694a1f280408be0" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ivo Gerscovich presents Tails as Cyborg." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Rounding out the cast is Tails as Cyborg. This one might seem out of left field at a glance, but it makes sense given that he’s the most technically knowledgeable of the group. He’s also already been an android in the <em>Sonic Prime</em> animated show, so fans are probably used to seeing him with a robotic body. He’s shown with most of his body having been replaced with mechanical parts with the exception of half of his face and his two tails. His left hand is a four-fingered claw, but Cyborg is able to transform parts of his body, so we’ll likely see Tails’ extremities take different forms in the comics.</p><hr><p>The <em>Sonic </em>X DC collaboration will also include merchandise (clothes, toys, collectibles, etc.) that will be released in the fall of 2025. While Gerscovich didn’t get into specifics, Sega and DC plan to continue the crossover into 2026, but it’s unclear if that means more comics, merchandise, or perhaps something not mentioned during the presentation. The animated teaser sends the mind wandering about a possible animated miniseries or something along those lines. But in the meantime, <em>Sonic </em>fans are already getting an animated miniseries in the form of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-dark-beginnings-anime-expo-1851580851&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-dark-beginnings-anime-expo-1851580851"><em>Sonic X Shadow Generations: Dark Beginnings</em></a></span>, which will follow Shadow the Hedgehog’s origin story. The first episode is set to go live today, September 25.<br></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Missing features, adding frustrating bugs, and lacking upgrades across certain platforms made it feel like a lackluster port of all-time classics.

The release for other platforms will follow at a later date. A big addition for <em>Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</em> on PC is the ability to finally customize the resolution in the settings menu. There are also new optional upscaling techniques that should improve the sharpness of the game at various points. The in-game movies can also be swapped to a clearer image or keep the original look. </p><p><em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em> is getting similar new settings options, including adjustable controller schemes and alternate keyboard layouts. The further upscaling techniques that can be applied seem to make a decent different, letting players take for advantage of their hardware to boost the visual crispness. The proof will be in the results players actually get once the updated version of the collection is installed. Hopefully it hasn’t broken anything else in the process.</p><p> “We’re also worried about how <em>Vol. 1</em> had a pretty rough launch,” Konami’s Noriaki Okamura recently said in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b86pccn_5SE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b86pccn_5SE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Metal Gear</em> Production Hotline</a></span> livestream. “We’re going to do everything we can to not repeat that [with Volume 2].” </p><p>Konami is also working on a <em>Master Collection Vol. 2</em>. Even though we don’t know what’s in it yet, it would likely include <em>Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</em>, the second-to-last <em>Metal Gear </em>game that director Hideo Kojima worked on, which has been trapped on the PlayStation 3 with no backwards compatibility options  for nearly two decades. The Japanese publisher also has a remake of <em>Snake Eater </em>called <em>Metal Gear Solid 3 Delta</em> that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-3-delta-remake-performance-mode-60fps-1851631819?_gl=1*5lsrse*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzI3MDM0NC45MS4xLjE3MjcyNzQ3MjguNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-3-delta-remake-performance-mode-60fps-1851631819?_gl=1*5lsrse*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzI3MDM0NC45MS4xLjE3MjcyNzQ3MjguNjAuMC4w">looks pretty and very faithful to the original</a></span>, but still doesn’t have a release date. </p><p>Either way, it’s nice to see that in addition to honoring the legacy of its back catalog, Konami is also willing to go back and fix its mistakes after launch. After all, <em>Master Collection Vol. 1</em> will likely be the main way people have to access these games for many years to come. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The PlayStation 5 Pro seems like a tough sell, especially to players who already own the original PS5. That's a sentiment I had going into a preview event for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-release-date-specs-price/1100-6523695/">PS5 Pro</a> and one I still have after spending a few hours with the new console.</p><p dir="ltr">If I didn't already have a PS5, then the PS5 Pro would be on my shortlist--the level of detail it brings to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-game/2900-5758/">Pro-enhanced games</a> like Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth and Horizon Forbidden West is incredible, catapulting the experience of playing a game so that it now gets performance mode-style frame rates with fidelity mode-style graphics. And, of course it does. The PS5 Pro's hardware is superior to the base PS5--it should make games look better. But nothing at the event convinced me I needed to go out and get a Pro the moment it launches. It's clear that, for now at least, the base PS5 is still perfectly serviceable when it comes to playing PlayStation's first-party titles. I'm more than content to save my $700. </p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> PS5 Pro Enhanced Games Trailer | State of Play</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">To better understand how the PS5 Pro is impacting how PlayStation's first-party studios will be developing their games going forward, I spoke with Sony Interactive Entertainment senior principal product manager Toshi Aoki. We also discussed the technical details and the development of PS5 Pro, such as the implementation of the console's cooling systems to ensure the Pro doesn't run hotter than the base PS5 despite the boosts to the GPU.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Does the PS5 Pro alleviate anything on PlayStation Studios? In terms of the work that they're doing with their games, does this console help them at all?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Toshi Aoki</strong>: Well, developers always want more. Whatever we give them, they actually use it up, which is a great thing because we are here to support the creators to create and realize their visions. The more range or options they have, the happier [they are]. And when the creators are happy, they create awesome games, which then makes the players happy. It creates that great flywheel, and we want to make sure that we keep that creative vision coming and flowing. I think that's a great direction that we're going with together with the developers.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>A lot of PlayStation games support both performance and fidelity modes. With the PS5 Pro, what happens with those modes? Is there still a noticeable difference choosing one over the other? Or do they now behave virtually the same?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">It will differ per game depending on what modes they already had and how [their respective developers] want to showcase [the game] to the players. So far, we've [mostly] seen [developers] mainly [realizing] that you don't have to make that choice [anymore]. That there is one mode that gives you both of the benefits. That's kind of the target the teams are going forward with.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4372400-14_ff7rebirth_0915_pv_fix_png_jpgcopy%281%29-e47dkrbja.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4372400" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4372400-14_ff7rebirth_0915_pv_fix_png_jpgcopy%281%29-e47dkrbja.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4372400"></a><figcaption>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth was the most impressive game I saw running on PS5 Pro.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4372400-14_ff7rebirth_0915_pv_fix_png_jpgcopy%281%29-e47dkrbja.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Just from the games that I've seen so far, it seems like there's a range of differences between games--Marvel's Spider-Man 2 only had a few differences, for example, whereas Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart had a more noticeable transformation between the standard PS5 on performance mode and the PS5 Pro. Is there one game in particular folks should check to see the greatest difference between what the PS5 and PS5 Pro can do?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">I honestly like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-looks-sharper-and-more-detailed-on-ps5-pro-report/1100-6526560/">That one probably has the biggest jump</a>, when you look at PS5 and PS5 Pro. Again, it'll differ per game of course, so it's difficult to say what's good and what's even better. I think Final Fantasy is a good showcase that you should try out.</p><p dir="ltr">[Rebirth] is a game where I think when we see the screenshots, it's always coming from the fidelity mode. But if you are the person who wants to switch to 60fps, the visuals do get downgraded to meet the hit. I think [performance mode] is the choice that the players are taking, and that's where we want to give players the best of both worlds.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>As someone who likes to position all of his consoles together next to the TV so they look pretty but has to make sure they all have enough air flow, how hot does the PS5 Pro get, especially since it's doing a lot more than the original PS5?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Our cooling system is all designed to make sure that it is at the same level as the PS5. You can see it later when you see the actual [console], it is slightly bigger and has more vents, so that we have more airflow.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4372402-4205224-spider3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4372402" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4372402-4205224-spider3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4372402"></a><figcaption>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 looked pretty much the same on PS5 and PS5 Pro but I could see far-off skyscrapers more clearly on the latter.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4372402-4205224-spider3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>I'm someone who bought the PS5 on day one, and I pretty much only play it for PlayStation first-party exclusives--is the PS5 Pro a console for folks like me?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Well, it is for the enthusiasts, the most engaged players. Which could be our initial early adopters who purchased the PS5. Also, people who have not come yet, maybe on other devices, but would want to play on the big-screen TVs. Have that capability on the console now that would shift over. We're not targeting just like the current PS5 owners, that's not it. It's more for the game enthusiasts who want to have that gameplay experience, which could be new users as well.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Given the higher specs of the PS5 Pro, is there now a higher benchmark for PlayStation studios to play with when designing games with performance and fidelity modes? </strong></p><p dir="ltr">Well, we can't speculate about the future. But, from history, when creators get more things to play with, they do [tend to] push the boundaries and go for more. Because I think from a creative perspective, they have so many ideas. They want to add so many details, so many gameplay details as well, the smoothness side as well.</p><p dir="ltr">The reality of 60 frames per second is that you have to write a lot of pixels or have AI upscalers do it for you. I think [studios] will still push the performance of the devices that they're on. I think that will continue. Right now, I think the PS5 Pro will be the new benchmark that they'll be targeting, and our hope is that the best game experience is going to be on the PS5 Pro.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4372407-alfabetajuega-horizon-zero-dawn-310717.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4372407" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4372407-alfabetajuega-horizon-zero-dawn-310717.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4372407"></a><figcaption>I'm eager to see how the new Horizon Zero Dawn remaster plays on PS5 Pro.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4372407-alfabetajuega-horizon-zero-dawn-310717.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>What's the thing that you're most excited about for players to see and experience when they get their hands on this new console when it comes out?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Well, definitely when they play a game, they just really get immersed in it. That's our target: having players play the game and then just love playing it without that trade-off that they might be making right now or [making a] selection they might be [forced] to make right now... That will really make me happy.</p>

            <p>Nexus mods user iArtorias has removed their handy mod that let players bypass PSN for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a> on PC.</p>
<p>God of War Ragnarök was hit by negative Steam reviews upon its release that took aim at Sony's controversial requirement for PC users to link to a PSN account. PC players being PC players, however, came up with a mod which could be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-mod-removes-sonys-controversial-psn-linking-requirement">used to negate Sony's controversial PSN linking requirement</a>. The mod did this by removing the PSN overlay.</p>
<p>However, its creator iArtorias has now removed the mod from Nexus, with no explanation given at the current time.</p>

<p>According to the Nexus Mods social media account, iArtorias removed the mod themselves, and the site had nothing to do with this decision.</p>
<p>"By the way: We've noticed that the popular PSN-bypass mod for God of War Ragnarök has been removed from our site by the author, and so we've reached out to find out why," the account shared on X.</p>

<p>When I looked through the mod's page earlier this week, there were requests from other users asking iArtorias to create a similar mod for the likes of the recently-released PC version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>. It seems uncertain now if iArtorias will consider this a viable option.</p>
<p>At time of writing, there is no indication on whether the mod's removal from Nexus Mods was to do with Sony, however Eurogamer has asked for comment.</p>

			<p>Yesterday,<a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-qa-netease-talks-about-the-heroes-hybrid-roles-opposed-to-hard-tank-dps-support/"> NetEase Games</a> and Marvel Games announced that Psylocke had joined the extensive roster for Marvel Rivals, the new Super Hero Team-Based PVP Shooter. This title is expected to be released on December 6, 2024, and already has an extensive roster offering a character for everyone. Psylocke will be joining the roster on the first day of launch, with all of the heroes being unlocked and free-to-play on the day of launch and continuing to remain that way throughout.</p>
<p><iframe title="Psylocke: Mutant Yokai Slayer | Character Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AzGcJm15XgI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Psylocke will have access to a massive range of psychic abilities, which will allow her to outsmart her enemies, especially since she is incredibly agile and can dash across short distances. In addition, she can cloak herself and become invisible before attacking, making her the perfect assassin in battle. Psylocke's ultimate will combine all of those elements and allow her to rush across the battlefield with her wings out and cut down any enemies that dare get in her way.</p>
<p>Psylocke, also known as Sai, Is a wandering ronin in feudal Japan who has dedicated her time and skills to killing ancient demons and monsters. Accompanying her is her wolf, Logan. Psylocke has dedicated herself to not resting until all of the Yokai have fallen. However, Sai was taken from her version of reality by the Timestream Entanglement and was then put on display by the Collector. With the help of her new allies, she was able to escape her cage. Instead of killing Yokai, her new quest is to gather up all of the heroes she can find, end the conflict, and find a way to return home.</p>
<p>The version of Psylocke that will be appearing in Marvel Rivals is inspired by the character design from the comic Demon Days: X-Men, written by award-winning comic book artist Peach Momoko, who has received multiple rewards for their work. To honor the work, Psylocke was created alongside Marvel Rival artists and Momoko, to make it as authentic as possible. Psylocke will be voiced by Alpha Takahashi, who has voiced characters in Cyberpunk 2077, Starfield, and Black Desert Online, for example.</p>
<p>At the moment, it's not stated what role she will fall into, as there are three distinct roles that players can choose from in Marvel Rivals. This includes Vanguard, Duelist, and Strategist.</p>
<p>Currently, those interested in the game can sign up for <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming beta tests</a> for a chance to experience Marvel Rivals before the game fully releases on December 6, 2024.</p>

The game follows Princess Zelda as she is given the chance to be the hero for once, after mysterious rifts appear across Hyrule and swallow up people (including Link) with no explanation. Zelda, with the aid of the new Tri Rod, sets out on her own journey to rescue the kingdom through a series of puzzle solving and combat. The core mechanic of <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> are the echoes: creatures and objects in the world you can summon at will to navigate obstacles.</p><p>At the time of writing, <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> has an 86 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Metacritic</a></span>.<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span>’s Tom Marks, praised the title as much more than a second-tier spinoff thanks to how it combines “the expertly crafted dungeons and item progression you’d expect from a 2D <em>Zelda </em>with the wild creativity provided by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-roundup-metacritic-1850427714&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-roundup-metacritic-1850427714"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a></span>.”</p><p>There are some recurring criticisms that pop up in a few reviews, namely a lack of puzzle variety as the game goes on. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Verge</em></a></span>’s Ash Parrish wrote, “There are basically only two kinds of challenges: something’s too high or something’s too far. And in nearly every instance, those challenges can be solved with the same handful of echoes.”</p><p>Still, overall the game seems to be a worthwhile entry in the legendary series, even if some of its better ideas aren’t fully realized. One thing critics agree on is that Zelda should get many more chances to be the hero.</p><p>Here’s a round up of what others are saying about <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>:</p><h2 id="h1151"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>IGN</strong></em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> is far greater than a gimmicky spinoff led by Zelda instead of Link. Its echo summoning is a clever concept used to combine the expertly crafted dungeons, puzzle rooms, and item progression you’d expect from a classic-style 2D <em>Zelda </em>with the borderline unhinged freedom provided by <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. This experiment doesn’t produce an entirely perfect result, with a little bit of clunky menu management and combat that simply isn’t quite as compelling, but it’s an impressively successful one all the same. <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> is also a glowing proof of concept for how a modern 3D Zelda could recapture some of what fans like me miss about the series before<em> Breath of the Wild</em> without sacrificing the intoxicating creativity it introduced. Creating echoes aside, if this is the future of <em>Zelda</em>, I can’t wait to see more.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h1152"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>VGC</strong></em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The potential for a special <em>Zelda </em>adventure is present in <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>’s ideas, but uneven execution means it’s neither as mechanically refreshing and satisfying as<em> A Link Between Worlds</em>, or memorable and well-crafted as <em>Link’s Awakening</em>. There’s plenty to like, and not enough to love, which for a series like <em>Zelda</em>, is less than we’ve come to expect.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h1153"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamer.com/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-beds-bokoblin-and-beyond/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-beds-bokoblin-and-beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>TheGamer</strong></em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> is a wonderful little game that puts experimentation at the centre, yet it also tries to be a traditional <em>Zelda </em>adventure with all the trimmings we’ve come to expect. It strikes an occasionally awkward balancing act between the two, coming out at the other end as a bold, accomplished outing that shines a spotlight on a Princess who has been waiting decades for her due. Yet despite how much joy I mined conquering its temples and delving into its many rifts, at times it doesn’t push its ambition far enough. That never stops <em>Echoes </em>from being a warm hug of a video game that enraptured me from start to finish, but it does leave me infinitely more curious about what the future holds. Now Zelda has helmed her first epic outing, it’s only a matter of time until she goes onto bigger and better things.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h1154"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Digital Trends</strong></em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>’s best parts are the ones that break away from what’s expected. My favorite moments largely happen in Still World rifts, where I need to carve my own path through twisted snippets of Hyrule’s world using echoes. I’m attuned with Zelda most when I find a large gap I can’t pass, but realize I can get to the other side by grabbing hold of a flying tile with my bind ability and following its path. In clever puzzle platform moments like that, I feel like I’m tapping into her third of the Triforce; I’m using her wisdom to meet any challenge that arises. And I’m doing that by drawing on her connection to all things within her kingdom and communicating her eternal royalty through tangible play. This only feels like the true first chapter of Zelda’s saga, but I expect we’ll really see her grow into her element in her next adventure. Legends aren’t built in one game.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h1155"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/review/455289/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/review/455289/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Polygon</strong></em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>As much as E<em>choes of Wisdom</em> brings a real “this ain’t about him” energy to the series, it’s still a story just as much about Link as it is about Zelda. The context gives a justification (take it or leave it) for Zelda’s more passive role. But does it work? Simply put: It does. It’s a fun as hell game. It’s challenging and satisfying. And it fits neatly in the established mythos as another incarnation of our beloved hero(es). There’s a real sense of accomplishment in conducting a herd of boomerang-wielding Bokoblins as they pepper every enemy with attacks and then conjuring a bridge made of beds to cross an unjumpable gap. Sure, you might not be swinging the sword, but <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> proves that the pen — or the bed, table, crate, or boulder — can be even mightier.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h1156"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-a-link-between-eras/1900-6418291/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-a-link-between-eras/1900-6418291/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>GameSpot</strong></em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>If Zelda’s debut in the spotlight is a one-off, at least it’s a memorable adventure. But hopefully this is the beginning of a new legend for the heroine. <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>’s brilliantly integrates echoes system links two eras, proving that the freeform mechanics of the new age can coexist with the franchise’s classic formula. Don’t mistake this for a spin-off or minor entry between big “mainline” games:<em> The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> is a major moment that shouldn’t be missed.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h1157"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-a-rebellious-remix-of-past-and-present&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-a-rebellious-remix-of-past-and-present" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Eurogamer</strong></em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Still, even through its missteps and occasional dead-ends, <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> is rarely content to just sit on its laurels. It forges its own path at almost every turn, challenging our understanding and expectations of how Hyrule’s flora and fauna can behave, while also unearthing new wrinkles that make its well-worn highways feel fresh and exciting again. For all Zelda’s apparent helplessness, the joy of discovering new Echoes and monster abilities never abates, drawing you deeper into its world instead of pushing you out of it. Ultimately, it’s a plucky and inventive spin on everything we know Zelda to be, reconciling the new and the old to create its own unique legacy, and a legend that befits a heroine who’s waited nearly four decades to own it - and all without becoming an unwilling puppet in someone else’s story (because let’s face it, Zelda’s no stranger to having her strings pulled at the eleventh hour). Far from being a case of chronic imposter syndrome, <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> rises to the occasion with a lively and majestic confidence. Here’s hoping we don’t have to wait another 40 years before Zelda gets another shot at saving her hero again.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h1158"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>The Verge</strong></em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>I think that the singular ability to use Link’s sword gets at the heart of what’s ultimately disappointing about <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>: all of Zelda’s wits don’t really amount to much. Sure I had dozens of echoes at my disposal, but halfway through the game, they only got in my way as I scrolled past them to get to the same five echoes I knew would get the job done. Combat was better, but whenever I wanted, I could thwart a difficult foe by simply stabbing it to death. That’s not to say <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> wasn’t fun. I wouldn’t have taken the time to clear every optional dungeon or most of the side quests if I hadn’t been enjoying myself. But after 35 years of lending her name to the iconic franchise, I wanted Zelda’s first game to be a little bit more worthy of her intelligence and strength.</p></blockquote><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-persona-6-atlus-fantasy-rpg-demo-1851553956&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-persona-6-atlus-fantasy-rpg-demo-1851553956">played it at Summer Game Fest</a></span> and had a great time with the combat. <em>Kotaku</em> staffer Kenneth Shephard <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-preview-persona-atlus-political-1851633394&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metaphor-refantazio-preview-persona-atlus-political-1851633394">played it in more in-depth more recently</a></span> and also came away with a positive impression. </p><p>One of the other big distinguishing factors for <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> is that it takes place in a fantasy setting rather than modern day urban Japan. As a result, the game seems to be trying to tackle more broad and complex themes about society and politics without actually coming out and saying it’s about those things. We’ll find out how well that works out next month. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

"We apologize to everyone in Japan who was looking forward to it, but all of our staff will do our best to deliver it to PS5 users as soon as possible, so we hope you will wait for a little longer," read the statement. "We look forward to your continued support of Palworld."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>It seems likely the delay has to do with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-and-the-pokmon-company-officially-suing-palworld-developer-over-multiple-patent-infringements">Nintendo and The Pokémon Company’s high-profile patent infringement lawsuit against Palworld developer Pocketpair</a>, which was filed in the Tokyo District Court last week. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-developer-pocketpair-responds-to-nintendo-pokmon-lawsuit-says-its-unaware-of-the-patents-its-accused-of-infringing"><u>Pocketpair issued a statement</u></a> in response claiming it had no idea which patents it’s accused of infringing, but experts have pointed to a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-vs-palworld-killer-patent-may-be-about-the-mechanic-of-catching-pokmon">“killer patent” that revolves around the mechanic of catching Pokémon itself</a>.</p><p>After Palworld’s huge launch earlier this year on PC and Xbox, comparisons were made between Palworld’s Pals and Pokémon, with some accusing Pocketpair of "ripping off" Pokémon designs. But rather than file a copyright infringement lawsuit, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have gone down the patent route.</p><p>It is worth noting that Palworld <em>does</em> include a mechanic that involves throwing a ball-like object (called a Pal Sphere) at monsters out in a field to capture them, similar to the mechanic seen in 2022 Nintendo Switch exclusive <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a>, and this may prove the key to the lawsuit.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Palworld vs. Pokémon Comparison</h3></div></output><p>For now, Palworld’s PS5 Japan release is up in the air. But the game remains playable on all the platforms it originally launched in, including PC via Steam and Xbox. It’s also still in Microsoft’s Game Pass subscription program.</p><p>Pocketpair, meanwhile, continues to update Palworld amid the lawsuit. It’s just released patch 0.3.8, which makes a number of bug fixes.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

                <p>Exactly 27 years after it debuted, Backyard Baseball '97 will be available again on October 10. Playground Productions has revealed the remaster of the original Backyard Sports game, which will cost $10 on Steam.</p><p dir="ltr">The re-release of Backyard Baseball '97 apparently wasn't easy. Playground notes the original source code was "lost in the years since the 1997 release." As such, the company teamed up with Mega Cat Studios to remaster the sports game, which teamed up with diehard Backyard Sports fans in "hacking the original CD-ROM and developing new game builds." The developer previously worked on titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wrestlequest-review-not-the-excellence-of-execution/1900-6418100/">WrestleQuest</a> and Five Nights at Freddy's: Into the Pit.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0HlEp-yq1E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r0HlEp-yq1E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"This was my favorite game growing up," said Playground founder and CEO Lindsay Barnett. "While we're already hard at work on the future of Backyard Sports, we first want to honor the past by restoring the games that started it all for me and so many others--beginning with Backyard Baseball '97."</p><p dir="ltr">Last month, Playground announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backyard-sports-is-back-but-were-not-sure-exactly-how-yet/1100-6525954/">Backyard Sports was back but didn't get into details</a>. Now, it's clear everything starts with Backyard Baseball '97. From there, the company plans to work with Mega Cat to expand the franchise on multiple platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">The Backyard Sports franchise originally began with Backyard Baseball in 1997 and then included games like Backyard Soccer, Backyard Basketball, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/taylor-swifts-boyfriend-and-his-brother-want-to-revive-backyard-football/1100-6520773/">Backyard Football--which the Kelce brothers wanted to revive</a>. The series seemingly ended in 2015 until Playground announced this new relaunch.</p><p dir="ltr">Backyard Baseball '97 is now available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3170540/Backyard_Baseball_97/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist on Steam</a>.</p>

			<p>Metro Awakening VR was showcased during Sony's State of Play on September 24. It is a highly anticipated VR game set within the <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-exodus-sold-10-million-units-in-5-years-next-mainline-installment-coming-in-202x/">Metro universe</a>. During the trailer, fans got a closer look at what to expect from the gameplay and storyline in Metro Awakening, where players explore the story of one of Metro's most pivotal characters.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metro Awakening | Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-y4s1AwVBco?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Much like the other games in the franchise, this title is also penned by Dmitry Glukhovsky, and this game serves as a standalone prequel to Metro 2033, where the game follows the story of Serdar, a doctor who is exploring the harrowing tunnels in search of his missing wife. On his journey, his sanity is pushed to breaking point, and he often finds himself seeing and hearing things that aren't there before awakening as Khan, a legendary mystic figure. Khan's wisdom and understanding of the tunnels' supernatural forces will then continue to echo throughout the years, with Khan becoming a spiritual guide and shaping the fate of those who explore the Metro tunnels.</p>
<p>Metro Awakening is currently <a href="https://metroawakening.com/ag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available for pre-order</a>, with the game being compatible on the PS VR2, Meta Quest and Steam VR. There are two versions that players can pre-order: The Standard Edition, which includes some Field Medic cosmetics and a 10% discount for the Deluxe Edition.</p>
<p>The Deluxe Edition gives those who purchase it a 48-hour Early Access to the full game, with the Early Access period being available only on the PS VR2 and Steam VR. The Deluxe Edition equally includes the Field Medic pack, as well as the Memories of Polyanka pack, which comes with Nosalis cosmetics. Finally, it will also include a digital VR Concept Art Gallery.</p>
<p>If you want to pre-order Metro Awakening, the Standard Edition will cost $39.99, and the Deluxe Edition will cost $44.99.</p>
<p>"The Metro franchise isn't just about survival; it's also about the powerful stories that emerge from its world. By collaborating with Dmitry, we've created something truly special—a deeply personal narrative that will resonate with both longtime fans and newcomers," says Martin de Ronde, Game and Creative Director at Vertigo Games.</p>
<p>This title is being developed and published by Vertigo Games in collaboration with Deep Silver. Vertigo Games is a VR-specific studio known for making games such as Arizona Sunshine and After the Fall. Deep Silver is, of course, known for Metro but has also created iconic franchises such as Dead Island and Saints Row titles.</p>
