            <p>Roguelikes! They’re all the rage lately, whether it’s a pure run-based game like Hades 2, a devilish combination with something like the settlement-management of Cult of the Lamb or the application of the genre’s live-die-live-again loop to add a new bit of spice to a familiar series like The Rogue Prince of Persia. Into that last category comes a new contender: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-4-best-class">Diablo 4</a>, which will soon introduce a new wave-based roguelike mode in its next season.</p>

<p><a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24111472/the-diablo-iv-season-5-ptr-what-you-need-to-know#Hordes">Infernal Hordes</a> is a mixture of roguelike progression - here you’ll be collecting the very Diablo-named resource of Burning Aether to buy new gear at the end of a run - and a classic horde mode, with gangs of enemies arriving in 90-second waves. If you survive a wave and mop up any last foes, you’ll get to pick between three Infernal Offers - temporary upgrades for that run that offer potential bonuses for additional challenge - before moving onto the next wave of baddies.</p>
<p>Pulping all the waves in each of the mode’s eight difficulty tiers will let you proceed to the Well of Hatred to battle three random members of the Fell Council (from five possible bosses), which will reward even more Burning Aether. Aether is obtained per player, so you won’t have to argue with friends about what to spend it on. At the end of a run, you’ll be able to cash in your collected Aether by buying Spoils of Hell, offering equipment, materials, gold and ‘greater equipment’ - an item with a guaranteed Greater Affix - for your efforts.</p>
<p>You can jump into the Infernal Hordes mode using the new Infernal Compass item, which will scale with your world tier and difficulty. The compass itself can be upgraded by collecting Abyssal Scrolls, granting access to higher Infernal Hordes tiers that increase the chance of earning legendary and unique drops, as well as Spoils of Greater Equipment.</p>
<p>The Infernal Hordes mode will debut in Diablo 4’s Season 5, which will be available to try for yourself from tomorrow, June 25th, for a week via the APRG’s Public Test Realm. After that, it’ll arrive in Season 5 proper with any necessary tweaks made in response to the test feedback.</p>
<p>Season 5 will debut a new post-campaign questline called The Eyes of the Enemy, which you’ll need to complete to gain the Infernal Compass needed to play the horde mode. Elsewhere in the update will be new legendaries, uniques and items, which can drop anywhere but will have a higher drop rate in the Infernal Hordes mode.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nosferatu-is-coming-to-make-vampires-scary-again.910047/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24184946/nosferatu-trailer-release-date-cast-remake<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="z5fuoW">There’s been no shortage of vampire movies and TV shows in the last couple of years. There was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23679108/renfield-review-nic-cage-nicholas-hoult"><em>Renfield</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24133463/abigail-review-horror-comedy-vampires-scream"><em>Abigail</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23439476/interview-vampire-lestat-de-lioncourt-tv-show"><em>Interview with a Vampire</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23792915/what-we-do-shadows-season-5-review"><em>What We Do in the Shadows</em></a>, and more, all exploring different genres (with varying degrees of success) through the lens of everyone’s favorite creatures of the night. But we haven’t had many truly scary vampires recently, and it seems like <em>Nosferatu </em>is here to correct that fact. </p>
<p id="8kGCtu">The latest remake of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22891878/nosferatu-100-years-vampire-movies">classic German horror movie</a> — itself an unlicensed adaptation of Dracula — comes from <em>The VVitch</em> and <em>The Lighthouse</em> director <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23020420/the-northman-review-robert-eggers-alexander-skarsgard">Robert Eggers</a>, who seems to be leaning into the oppressively dark and creepy atmosphere of the original film. </p>
<p id="0R6YiE">The movie follows Thomas Hutter (Nicholas Hoult, who was also in <em>Renfield</em>) and all the strange things that happen to him after he visits the castle of the mysterious and vampiric Count Orlak (Bill Skarsgård). In the original story, this includes (arguably) prompting the Count’s move to the city in pursuit of Hutter’s wife, who seems to have already been bewitched by the vampire. </p>
<p id="7qJwDJ">The first trailer for the movie, which went online Monday, is all about establishing a mood, full of dark rooms and pitch-black castles. We see glimpses of Orlak’s castle, but the majority of the trailer is focused on the folks back in London, who seem to be eagerly anticipating his dreadful arrival. Of course, we don’t really get to see much of Orlak, better known as Nosferatu — only his silhouette, giving us a fantastically scary ending to the trailer. </p>
<p id="PAjfps">The movie’s stacked cast also includes previous Eggers collaborators Willem Dafoe and Ralph Ineson, as well as Emma Corrin and Aaron Taylor-Johnson. </p>
<p id="J2iCWx">In the grand tradition of counter-programming that has included movies like <em>Wolf of Wall Street</em> and <em>Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em>, <em>Nosferatu </em>is set for release on Christmas Day. So you can take the whole family to meet the Count. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/deals/24185018/steam-deck-handheld-valve-deal-sale<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="lzQIVQ">Valve is kicking off its Steam Summer Sale with an awesome discount on the Steam Deck. Right now, you can pick up either the 64 GB or 512 GB model of the original LCD Steam Deck for their lowest price yet. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">64 GB model</a> is on sale for $296.65 (was $349), while the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">512 GB version</a> is just $381.65 (was $449). Valve is slowly phasing out its launch models of the Steam Deck equipped with LCD screens, so this deal will only be available while supplies last. Both models include a zip-up case for the Deck, but the 512 GB version is unique in that its screen is covered in anti-glare etched glass. </p>

<p id="FobHXr">While these slightly older models don’t include the larger battery or OLED display featured in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23950861/steam-deck-oled-review-valve-handheld-gaming">Steam Deck OLED</a>, the launch version of the Steam Deck remains a formidable alternative to other handheld options like the Nintendo Switch or ROG Ally.</p>
<p id="F3LitN">Valve’s list of Steam Deck verified titles has expanded exponentially since launch, and even includes games like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>, which is particularly handy if you recently picked up a copy of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180113/dlc-walkthroughs-guides"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a>. Of course, if you’re looking for even more reasons to adopt a Steam Deck, you can always check out <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22949326/steam-deck-review-pc-gaming-portable">our review</a>. </p>

However, on June 24, the still-not-confirmed crossover was accidentally leaked by <em>Eurogamer</em>, who published a post all about Lara Croft in <em>DBD </em>seemingly ahead of an official announcement from developer Behaviour Interactive. The article also alleges that Lara will be added to <em>DBD </em>on July 16.</p><figure id="" data-id="ffabbfbbabfb439a743c181cbf3f423c" data-recommend-id="image://ffabbfbbabfb439a743c181cbf3f423c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1328" data-height="747" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lara Croft as she will appear in Dead By Daylight.

While these games are generally remembered as great adventures, there was some controversy around many of the brutal death animations featured in them. Now you can kill her in more brutal ways, if that’s something you’ve been wanting to do...</p><p>“Lara Croft has survived expeditions few would dare attempt, locked eyes with death and lived to tell the tale... Now, she must face yet again a dark adventure shrouded in Fog,” explained Behaviour Interactive, according to <em>Eurogamer</em>. </p><p> “With her experiences and skill set, Lara Croft perfectly embodies the characteristics needed to survive in The Fog and is right at home in the world of <em>Dead by Daylight</em> alongside other iconic characters. Though she may be well-prepared for the Trials ahead, in the Entity’s twisted world, the future is never promised,” said Behaviour Interactive. </p><p>  <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dead-by-daylight-dungeons-and-dragons-castlevania-dlc-1851477094&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dead-by-daylight-dungeons-and-dragons-castlevania-dlc-1851477094"><em>Dead by Daylight</em>’s current season</a></span> is heavily inspired by <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, so it’s not like the game hasn’t been dabbling in non-horror crossovers already. </p><p>Still, I don’t think Lara Croft is a good fit for <em>Dead By Daylight</em>. Turning such a powerful and badass character famously known for surviving and fighting into a screaming victim who won’t just pull out a pistol and blast away the monster seems silly and out of character for any version of the Tomb Raider<em>.</em> But hey, gotta keep making the number go up and feed people more content. That’s the way things work in 2024.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Before the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion arrived for Elden Ring, director Hidetaka Miyazaki set some interesting expectations for the DLC's map. He basically said the new map would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-dlcs-map-is-as-big-or-bigger-than-limgrave/1100-6521275/" data-ref-id="1100-6521275">similar in size to the base game's starting area of Limgrave</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">That's definitely underselling the Realm of Shadows, the DLC's map, quite a bit.

It's pretty astonishing viewed this way and shows it's clearly bigger than Miyazaki initially teased.</p><p dir="ltr">Last week, Shadow of the Erdtree released to critical acclaim. In fact, The Witcher developer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-dev-says-its-an-honor-for-elden-rings-shadow-of-the-erdtree-expansion-to-break-its-record/1100-6524435/" data-ref-id="1100-6524435">CD Projekt Red congratulated the Elden Ring DLC for breaking the record for best-reviewed RPG expansion</a>, overtaking the throne from Blood and Wine.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're curious about Shadow of the Erdtree, GameSpot has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-things-to-know/2900-5484/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5484">14 things you should know before playing the Elden Ring DLC</a>.

If hunting down Scadutree Fragments isn't your thing, however, there's a mod that gets rid of the feature altogether.</p><p>By now, you're probably aware that you need to amass dozens of Scadutree Fragments to withstand the dangers lurking around the Land of Shadow. But if you prefer the methods of old, user Sereenaty over at Nexus Mods has the answer. The <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5255" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No More Scadutree Grind</a> mod removes the need to collect the fragments, as well as Revered Spirit Ashes, and instead makes it so damage dealt and taken are scaled in a similar way to the vanilla game.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree DLC Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Before you install the mod, there are a few notes worth keeping in mind. "The mod was only tested on a fresh character with zero Scadutree fragments collected," reads the description. "No idea how it affects saves that already collected some."</p><p>In addition, the creator mentions that the scaling is similar to endgame areas like Farum Azula. In short, playing Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree with this mod won't immediately become a walk in the park, but there'll be a noticeable difference--especially because you won't need to collect items across the map anymore.</p><p>If you still prefer to play Shadow of the Erdtree as is but you're having trouble finding Scadutree Fragments out in the wild, here are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-scadutree-fragments/2900-5485/" data-ref-id="2900-5485">all Scadutree Fragment locations</a> to help you locate the ones you're missing.</p>

Here are some of the more notable improvements:</p><ul><li>Traders give less dukes and have nerfed rewards that no longer break progression.</li><li>Trader inventories offer sales staged items for sale that are more appropriate for your character’s level.</li><li>The game is a little more crafting oriented than in the past, and legendary items are now craftable.</li><li>The end result is the game feels much more balanced and even in a coop team players will find themselves still engaged on day 70, single players even further.</li><li>Crafting  <ul><li>Quality 6 crafting is back</li></ul></li><li>Tools/Weapons/Armor  <ul><li>Requires new Legendary Parts</li></ul></li><li>Traders/Biome order  <ul><li>Rekt – Forest</li><li>Jen – Burnt</li><li>Bob – Desert</li><li>Hugh – Snow</li><li>Joel – Wasteland</li></ul></li><li>Quests  <ul><li>Quest Progression has been improved so you get higher Tier Quests offered with each trader and can roll back to lower tiers if you want to</li></ul></li><li>Armor  <ul><li>Quality determines perk level</li><li>Basic Example – Q1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 50%</li></ul></li></ul><h3><strong>Legendary Crafting</strong></h3><ul><li>We have added new Legendary Parts which can be acquired in high end loot chests, and higher Trader rewards</li><li>With these player can craft Legendary Q6 weapons, tools, and armor</li></ul><h3><strong>Dew Collector Overhaul</strong></h3><p>The Dew Collector has been reworked.

This change makes the Dew Collector available early in game, but it collects murky water without having the filter installed.</p><h3><strong>Enhanced Gore System</strong></h3><p>Along with the new Zombie variants comes the new and improved Dismemberment Gore System, ensuring consistent dismemberment across zombie types, and as a bonus, there are also brand-new blood splatter particles to complete the visceral experience of combat.</p><p>With Version 1.0, the entire zombie lineup has been upgraded with new gore pieces, including a complete overhaul of recently updated zombies from past Alphas. This ensures all zombies are consistent with the latest technology, enhancing the game’s visual impact and immersion.</p><h3><strong>Updated Road Decals</strong></h3><p>Say goodbye to one of our last remaining legacy assets, our original Road Decals.

The very outer layer is a no-go zone, preventing players from walking off the map. Just inside this is a no-build zone, ensuring players cannot build too close to the edge. As players approach the border, the area fogs up, providing a clear visual cue. This system allows more Points of Interest (POIs) to spawn near the map’s edges, increasing the playable area while communicating to the player you can’t go that way.</p><h3><strong>New Upgradeable Player Chests</strong></h3><p>Introducing player writeable storage boxes! Start with a basic wooden box, which can be upgraded to iron, and eventually to steel. Each upgrade increases the storage capacity, providing more space for your items. Additionally, these chests feature writeable areas that display custom text, allowing for easy organization and labeling of your stored goods. Up to three lines of copy can be added. Happy chest placing, survivors!</p><h3><strong>Environment Art Update</strong></h3><p>The environment team has been busy with many new art updates that will further immerse you for 1.0 experience including:</p><ul><li>New movie theater seats, new soda and drink vending machines, new TV studio camera, new mini beverage coolers, new food and candy posters, new retro electric and gas signs, new neon signs, new camping tents, new chemistry set, new modular iron wrought fence set with destructive states.

Including shader and texture optimizations, as well as mesh optimizations to improve game performance.</li></ul><h3><strong>Block Shape Updates</strong></h3><p>The environment Art team has been busy with many new block shapes to build with.</p><p>162 new shapes added to fill in missing shapes to roofs, railings, poles, stairs, and many more.</p><p>A few notable ones include:</p><ul><li>Wedge Stairs Railing Left, Right, Tip Left, and Tip Right</li><li>Wedge Stairs Railing Metal Left, Right, Tip Left, and Tip Right</li><li>6m and 8m long ramp sets</li><li>Wedge60 Windows set</li><li>Broken and Empty versions of all Bulletproof Windows (POI’s)</li><li>Also note the addition of a new Radial Menu option:  <ul><li>Copy Shape And Rotation</li></ul></li></ul><h3><strong>Enhanced Audio</strong></h3><p>Sharpen your ears, survivors!

New functionality includes:</p><ul><li>All traders now have their own unique voice</li><li>Traders have more than 200 lines each with story bits and strong hints to relations between traders</li><li>Subtitles will be translated to all supported languages</li></ul><h3><strong>Gamepad Improvements</strong></h3><p>A ton of work has gone into improving Gamepad Support to make it control better, more intuitive and have native console features including:</p><ul><li>New UI navigation system that removes the virtual cursor</li><li>Overhauled modern camera controls that are easier to use and can be extensively customized</li><li>New aim assist systems for gamepads to aid with quicker targeting when aiming a weapon or swinging a melee weapon, and slowing the camera when passing over small interactable objects</li><li>Greatly expanded gamepad settings in a new controller options menu including:  <ul><li>Joystick layout options</li><li>Separated X and Y camera sensitivity</li><li>Look acceleration</li><li>Deadzone adjustments</li><li>Rumble strength</li><li>Aim assist toggle</li></ul></li><li>Full gamepad remapping support for on foot and vehicle controls</li><li>New controls and shortcuts when using a gamepad, including:  <ul><li>Directly access items on your toolbelt via radial menu by holding either of the toolbelt selection buttons.</li><li>Instantly swap to your previously equipped item with the new quick swap button</li><li>Easier sprinting with tap or hold controls</li></ul></li><li>Expanded controller vibration support that responds to actions triggered by the player and what’s happening around them</li><li>Support for DualSense controller features including:  <ul><li>Track time of day, weather and blood moons on the light bar</li><li>Trigger effects when using certain items and weapons</li></ul></li></ul><h3><strong>Modding Notes</strong></h3><ul><li>Game updated to Unity 2022.3.29f1</li><li>Updated HarmonyX to 2.13.0</li><li>ModInfo: Now requires ModInfo in V2 format, also properties “Name” and “DisplayName” no longer optional as announced in Alpha 21</li><li>XML parsing now supports “conditional” blocks:  <ul><li>Allows switching between different XML blocks based on conditions like game version, whether a certain mod is loaded etc</li><li>Can be evaluated once by the host when loading the XMLs so host and every client will have the same resulting XML or by each game instance separately, so that host and every client can have different effects, e.g. when based on a GamePref</li><li>Also supported on the top level of patch XMLs: These are always applied during XML loading</li><li>Detailed documentation will be added to the game’s wiki</li></ul></li><li>XML patches now feature a new instruction “include” which allows including another XML in place, e.g. to split up large XMLs into smaller pieces or – combined with the usage of conditional blocks – include different XML based on other conditions</li><li>New XML “events.xml”: Allows defining date based events (like christmas, halloween etc) and use them with conditional XML blocks – have the pipe baton automatically use a candy cane shiv model during christmas season or pumpkins use a halloween based model during that time</li><li>Z-Selection box for POI or world building now shows the current selection size</li><li>Updated POI properties windows to reflect the current POI features</li><li>Debugging:  <ul><li>Debug views (F3) now remember the selected elements</li><li>CVar filter box can no longer have the input focus when the mouse cursor is not enabled – avoids accidentally overwriting your filter while running around</li><li>FPS graph and network monitor available in releases</li></ul></li><li>Game assembly gets fully publicized members for easier code modding – each member that has changed access level gets an attribute “PublicizedFrom” attached that will tell you the original accessibility level. Accessing originally not public stuff is still meant to be a last resort if other approaches fail.</li><li>New BlockCompositeTileEntity with respective TileEntityComposite  <ul><li>This is a generic TileEntity (TE) block which allows selecting which features it should have from XML (“compositing”)</li><li>Currently these features are supported:  <ul><li>Lockable: The TE can be locked</li><li>LockPickable: Players can pick the lock on the TE (only usable in combination with Lockable)</li><li>Signable: The TE can be written on. The prefab used for the TE will have to have properly set up TextMeshes – at least one but it supports as many as desired</li><li>Storage: The TE will have container features</li></ul></li><li>These TE properly support up/downgrading, so for example a block that has Signable can upgrade to a block that supports Storage and Signable and keep its text</li><li>Adding new features does not require enumeration modifications so should be easier going forward to add custom TE features from mods</li><li>Example usage of these features can be seen on the new player storage blocks “cntWoodWritableCrate” and similar</li></ul></li><li>File lookup prioritizes files in user data (e.g. LocalPrefabs) over mods</li><li>New game argument “-newprefabsmod=somemod” allows defining a mod in which new prefabs get stored instead of going to “LocalPrefabs”. Mod name is given by its internal name from its “ModInfo.xml”, not the folder name</li><li>XUi changes:  <ul><li>Generic “repeat_content” attribute support for all views. For non-grid views the attribute “repeat_count” specifies the number of clones</li><li>Repeated elements automatically get fed with additional template parameters that can be used with template bindings (“${…}”):  <ul><li>For every parent view: “repeat_count” giving the number of elements as specified by “repeat_count” attribute and “repeat_i” incrementing by one for each created element, starting at 0</li><li>Additionally for grid views only: “repeat_col” and “repeat_row” giving the column and row the element will be in the grid – assuming the grid dimensions do not change later on</li></ul></li><li>New attribute “disabled_tooltip_key” lets you define a tooltip that gets shown when hovering a disabled view</li><li>New attribute “force_hide” allows keeping a view invisible</li><li>New attributes for controller navigation:  <ul><li>“use_selection_box”: Should controller navigation show an outline around the selected view</li><li>“gamepad_selectable”: View can be selected with a controller</li><li>“nav_up”, “nav_down”, “nav_left”, “nav_right”: Manual override which view to select when pressing the respective direction on a controller</li></ul></li><li>Texture views now support: Color tinting (“color” attribute) and for keeping the texture’s aspect ratio (attribute “original_aspect_ratio”)</li></ul></li><li>XML “extends” now allow excluding specified subclasses (like “UpgradeBlock” in blocks) so that all its children are actually excluded</li><li>Changes to quests should no longer kill savegames’ character files – though the affected quests will lose their details in the quest log</li><li>Plants tick correctly when placed on the same position as another plant was growing before – before the timer would potentially not reset thus accumulating the old and new growth times</li><li>Perks can now have LevelRequirements for individual levels only instead of being required to be specified for all levels if done for at least one</li><li>“Inventory.PUBLIC_SLOTS” is changed to be targeted by mods, making it easier to implement custom toolbelt sizes. Also a new property “SHIFT_KEY_SLOT_OFFSET” has been added that allows specifying which slots are meant to be targeted when using Shift + slot hotkey</li><li>World Editor: Previews of POI now match the actual state when rotating them</li></ul><h3><strong>TFP News Screen</strong></h3><p>We have moved the old shared menu news screen into a new skippable in-game News screen that has graphics and link support for all formats. This will be used to inform players on new patch updates and other TFP news.</p><h3><strong>Server Administration</strong></h3><p>Changes to serverconfig.xml:</p><ul><li>Setting “SaveGameFolder” has been removed.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-global-may-never-launch-as-bandai-namco-online-goes-insolvent/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-debut-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first covered</a> Blue Protocol, the stylized online action RPG developed by Bandai Namco Online, nearly five years ago. Back then, there was no assurance the game would ever launch in Western countries.</p>
<p>That changed in December 2022, when Amazon Games took the stage at The Game Awards to <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-confirmed-for-2023-launch-on-pc-amazon-will-publish/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announce</a> a publishing deal with Bandai Namco Online to bring the game to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X outside of Japan.</p>
<p>Blue Protocol eventually got <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-to-launch-on-pc-first-in-japan-may-support-cross-play-additional-features-detailed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its debut</a> in the Land of the Rising Sun on June 14, 2023. The Western version was <a href="https://wccftech.com/blue-protocol-mmorpg-gets-delayed-to-2024-in-the-west/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed to 2024</a>, but we haven't really heard any more about it. In fact, Amazon Games continued to mention its publishing deal with NCSoft for Throne and Liberty (<a href="https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-f2p-mmorpg-launches-on-september-17-on-pc-and-consoles-with-cross-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now set to launch on September 17</a> in Western countries) in its press releases, whereas Blue Protocol wasn't mentioned any longer. The last blog post on the official global website is dated November 13, 2023.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that may be due to a dire financial situation. A few days ago, Bandai Namco Online (a subsidiary of Bandai Namco Entertainment) <a href="https://gamebiz.jp/news/388005" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declared</a> itself insolvent due to substantial losses. That doesn't necessarily mean work on the game is about to stop, but it doesn't incite faith in its future, either.</p>
<p>The developers held a live stream earlier this month, but it didn't provide any news on the global launch. They only talked about upcoming updates, such as the next chapter in the main story, a new region, an increased level cap to 80, and new passive abilities for each class available in Blue Protocol.</p>
<p>We'll keep an eye on the news from Japan, hoping for the best while preparing for the worst.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/2024/6/24/24183179/netflix-new-tv-bear-season-3-babylon-berlin-4-iwtv<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="yugZzI">The days are officially getting shorter, but there is no less TV to watch — just take it from this week’s new releases. We’re running the gamut from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24160862/dropout-make-some-noise-season-3-ben-schwartz">Dropout’s <em>Make Some Noise</em> season 3</a> to Netflix’s dynamic <em>Supacell</em>,<em> </em>all the way to the finales of <em>Dark Matter</em> season 1 and <em>Interview with the Vampire</em> season 2. Personally I’m most invested this week in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23852870/babylon-berlin-season-4-netflix-release-date-when-us">return of <em>Babylon Berlin</em></a><em>, </em>which has switched from Netflix to a new network (more on that below). Thank god you watched <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23947308"><em>House of the Dragon</em>’s latest episode</a> live last night, huh? </p>
<p id="LleI9C">Here’s all the new TV premieres and finales this week. </p>

<div id="M8hHYd"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Frmk94Etedo?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="OHuQK7"><strong>Genre: </strong>Superheroes (grounded)<br><strong>Release date: </strong>June 27, with all episodes<br><strong>Showrunner/creator: </strong>Rapman<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Tosin Cole, Adelayo Adedayo, Yasmin Monet Prince, and more</p>
<p id="IlizaR">There’s not a lot in this world that can beat “superhero fatigue,” but Rapman’s <em>Supacell</em> hopes to do so by embracing normal people getting superpowers, “not people that are martyrs, not people that are going to save the world, just people that try to save themselves and their families,” as <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/superhero-shows/netflix-supacell-misfits-heroes-exclusive/">he told SFX magazine</a>. </p>
<p id="HoNmjo">And indeed his premise is more complicated than it seems: five people in South London getting powers out of nowhere — and having nothing that seems to link them beyond being Black — with a nefarious organization lurking the background. </p>

<p>When Ubisoft officially unveiled the Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary Edition last week, many fans immediately brought up Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2. </p>



<p>The game was first announced in 2016, and has since been in development hell. It has seen multiple <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-studio-sees-major-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restarts and management changes</a> that has led many fans to just assume that it’s not coming. However, Ubisoft confirmed on Monday that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 is still on the way.</p>



<p>“Yes, Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 is still in development, and we cannot wait for you to discover more about Jade’s past in the 20th Anniversary Edition,” the studio said <a href="https://x.com/bgegame/status/1805269728262230467" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via the game’s official Twitter</a> account. </p>



<p>Obviously a simple post like that doesn’t answer any major questions about the state of the game. That said, it’s at least something to know that it hasn’t been abandoned after a decade in development. When fans will hear anything more about the prequel title remains to be seen.</p>



<p>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 20th Anniversary launches on June 25 for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PC, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <p>The developers of multiplayer aerial combat sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/war-thunder">War Thunder</a> have apologised after a picture of the real-life Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, which killed seven crew members when it exploded just 73 seconds after launch in 1986, was used in artwork promoting the game’s recent Seek &amp; Destroy update.</p>
<!--more-->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span> </p>
</div>
<p>Similarities between the unmistakable photo of the explosion, which was broadcast live in many American schools due to the presence of teacher Christa McAuliffe on board, and a section of the key art for War Thunder’s <a href="https://warthunder.com/en/news/8953-meet-major-update-seek-destroy-en">new Seek &amp; Destroy update</a> were spotted by a number of players, several of whom took to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/1dm9oao/challenger_disaster_and_seek_destroy_wallpaper/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">the game’s subreddit</a> and forums to criticise the poor taste of using imagery of the real-life disaster to promote a video game.</p>
<p>Gaijin Entertainment community manager magazine2 subsequently <a href="https://forum.warthunder.com/t/noticed-a-little-something/119652/26">posted a response</a> expressing “sincere apologies” on behalf of the devs for the “accidental” use of the imagery, saying that “the picture was part of an aerial explosion reference pack used by our artists and the context was lost”.</p>
<p>“We’ll be altering this artwork as soon as we can and will take measures to ensure that this doesn’t repeat again in the future,” they added.</p>
<p>“Things like this shouldn't happen and we'll make sure it doesn't repeat,” another community manager, Oxy, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/1dm7e77/comment/l9vr7e0/">posted on Reddit</a> while repeating the claim that the use was due to the accidental use of the explosion reference pack. They stated that that the artwork would be revised today, Monday June 24th. At the time of writing, the distinctive explosion can still be seen in a thumbnail for <a href="https://youtu.be/DIsdWN78JS4">the update’s rundown video</a> and a <a href="https://staticfiles.warthunder.com/upload/image/0_Wallpaper_Renders/Aircraft/1920x1080_seek_and_destroy_logo_eng_7d40f0ff1f7fc2ef0a2542ea5a3aba6b.jpg">downloadable wallpaper of the art</a>.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time that War Thunder has made headlines due to its controversial connections to real life, though usually it's a little more humourous than re-using imagery of a tragic disaster. Dedicated players have taken to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/war-thunder-player-posts-classified-document-to-prove-tank-is-inaccurate">posting classified documents to prove the inaccuracy of some of its vehicles</a> in the past, with the not-irregular leaking of secretive military intel on its forums to one-up rival players and argue about how closely it simulates actual hardware becoming somewhat of a running joke at this point.</p>

It’s a sentiment shared by many. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994292464/recommended/2778580/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994292464/recommended/2778580/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another reviewer</a></span> said that FromSoftware has “lost the essence of what made their games fun—fairness.” They are referring to the idea that most Soulslikes give players the skills to overcome challenges, but claim <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> lacks that balance in combat encounters. The review-bombing and overall discussion of <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s difficulty has revived a conversation around Soulslikes as old as the games themselves: Are these games too difficult, or are people just too used to handholding in modern games to appreciate a real challenge?</p><figure id="" data-id="6b4882f246c208bd40afe74c349ad38c" data-recommend-id="image://6b4882f246c208bd40afe74c349ad38c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="788" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A giant walking cauldron set ablaze walks through a field" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A giant walking cauldron set ablaze walks through a field" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6b4882f246c208bd40afe74c349ad38c" data-recommend-id="image://6b4882f246c208bd40afe74c349ad38c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="788" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A giant walking cauldron set ablaze walks through a field" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In opposition to the review bombers, and other players who are genuinely dissatisfied with the difficulty, some are saying that this is just how FromSoftware rolls. That is true, to an extent, as the studio has a track record of making DLC for its games that are harder than the base game. These expansions are meant as a higher challenge for those who have mastered what came before. This was also the case, for example, with <em>Bloodborne</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bloodbornes-the-old-hunters-dlc-will-kick-your-ass-1743851464&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bloodbornes-the-old-hunters-dlc-will-kick-your-ass-1743851464"><em>The Old Hunters</em></a></span> DLC (which, in my opinion, remains one of the most challenging experiences FromSoft has made). There is an element of “what did you expect?” from some, aimed at those complaining about the extreme difficulty.<br></p><p>However, the situation is a bit more complex than that. The discussion of FromSoftware difficulty has always had two sides to it. Many people often think of the “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-calls-for-an-end-to-git-gud-1847272679&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-calls-for-an-end-to-git-gud-1847272679">Git Gud</a></span>” crowd, who don’t want to have nuanced discussions and think players complaining just need to be better. But on the other side, there are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steelrising-spiders-soulslike-dark-souls-elden-ring-1849487023&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steelrising-spiders-soulslike-dark-souls-elden-ring-1849487023">valid criticisms</a></span> of FromSoftware’s difficulty, especially with respect to the lack of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/accessibility-difficulty-easy-mode-explained-1851261475&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/accessibility-difficulty-easy-mode-explained-1851261475">accessibility options</a></span>. This has continued to be a pain point, as it means these games are less available to all players. Furthermore, FromSoftware’s design ethos often demands a high level of perfection, while the games themselves are filled with imperfect designs (such as wonky camera controls) that cause unintended friction the player must also surmount.</p><p>There is yet another layer to the conversation around <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>. <em>Elden Ring</em> is arguably the most accessible (and therefore most played by newcomers) game FromSoft has designed to date. The open world is a big reason for that, as players who encounter a challenge they can’t defeat can just go somewhere else. That more accessible design and the popularity it gained created a community of players who have never played a Soulslike before, and are now excitedly diving into <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> only to discover FromSoft DLC is hard as hell.</p><figure id="" data-id="6a0e96caf44f401ae542dcbd8d36002d" data-recommend-id="image://6a0e96caf44f401ae542dcbd8d36002d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The tarnished rides torrent towards old ruins" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The tarnished rides torrent towards old ruins" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6a0e96caf44f401ae542dcbd8d36002d" data-recommend-id="image://6a0e96caf44f401ae542dcbd8d36002d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The tarnished rides torrent towards old ruins" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This difficulty shock is likely to cause an uproar in disappointment at the perception of an extremely unfair challenge. With so much discussion going on, even <em>Elden Ring</em> publisher Bandai Namco weighed in. “This is a suggestion to level up your Scadutree Blessing,” the company <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1804630213562962043&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1804630213562962043" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a></span> on X (formerly Twitter), to urge those complaining about the difficulty to use the expansion’s new <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-scadutree-fragments-1851556790&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-scadutree-fragments-1851556790">upgrade material</a></span>. This highlights another fact of FromSoftware: The developer (almost) always gives players a way to tackle new challenges.<br></p><p>So is <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> too hard? Well, it’s complicated. It is definitely harder than <em>Elden Ring</em>, but there are also ways to deal with the greater challenge. If you are having a hard time with any of the new bosses, take your time, take a break, and you really should collect as many Scadutree Fragments as you can.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Avowed, an upcoming open-world RPG game developed by Obsidian Entertainment, promises an immersive gaming experience. During the Xbox Game Showcase earlier this month, players were treated to a new gameplay trailer that showcased intense combat sequences, a vast and diverse map, and a rich fantasy world. Now, Avowed’s game directors have also informed us about the game length and it is ‘similar’ to their previous project, ‘The Outer Worlds’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fair-distance">Fair Distance</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/06/20/avoweds-creators-on-why-romance-was-considered-but-ultimately-not-included-and" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a>, Avowed gameplay directors Carrie Patel and Gabe Paramo shared intriguing details about the game. They discussed the third-person option, the game’s RPG systems, interactions with other characters, and more. When asked about the game’s length, the directors drew a reassuring comparison to Obsidian’s action RPG from 2019, The Outer Worlds, suggesting that Avowed will offer a similarly substantial experience.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Avowed Story Trailer - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ykgkdU1NJUU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Patel stated that the “best comparison for Avowed in terms of scope is The Outer Worlds”. She clarified that while Avowed will offer a similar level of depth and content, it will also provide a unique experience. </p>



<p>The game’s length may vary according to the difficulty players choose and the time they want to invest in exploration and side missions compared to the main storyline. According to How Long to Beat, The Outer Worlds’ main story takes around 13 and a half hours, main plus side missions take more than 27 and a half hours, and completionist runs take around 42 hours. This suggests that Avowed will offer substantial content for players to enjoy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other Avowed news, the developers recently hinted at the game’s release date, suggesting a possible window in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/avowed-release-date-accidentally-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 2024</a>. However, it’s important to note that this is a leaked date and has not been officially confirmed. For more information on whether Avowed is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-avowed-coming-to-ps5-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming to PlayStation 5</a>, click here. We’re curious to hear your thoughts on Avowed’s game length. Do you think it sounds sufficient, or would you prefer more or less content? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>One of the new resources that arrived with the Sakurajima DLC update in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/palworld/" data-ref-id="5000-532768">Palworld </a>is called "Crude Oil." This resource is essential in the production of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-how-to-make-and-use-plasteel/1100-6524418/" data-ref-id="1100-6524418">Plasteel</a>, which creates the best Sphere, armor, and weapons in Palworld. However, the primary way to acquire Crude Oil requires you to construct and use a Crude Oil Extractor, which comes with its own requirements. You can see the entire process of building a Crude Oil Extractor and getting Crude Oil in Palworld in the guide below.</p><h2>Building the Crude Oil Extractor in Palworld</h2><p>To unlock the Crude Oil Extractor in your base build menu, you need to use two Technology Points on the equipment. The Crude Oil Extractor is found at level 50 in the Technology Menu right next to the unlock for Plasteel.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322970-palworldscreenshot2024.06.17-16.15.38.96.png" data-ref-id="1300-4322970" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322970-palworldscreenshot2024.06.17-16.15.38.96.png" data-ref-id="1300-4322970"></a><figcaption>The Crude Oil Extractor in the Technology menu</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322970-palworldscreenshot2024.06.17-16.15.38.96.png"></figure><p>After you unlock the Crude Oil Extractor, you need the following resources to construct it in your base:</p><ul><li>250 Pal Metal Ingots</li><li>50 Circuit Boards</li></ul><p>Obviously, that's a huge haul of resources, so you might have to spend a few hours getting the right materials to build the extractor. Then, once you have the right number of materials, you can't even build the Crude Oil Extractor in just any location.</p><p>The Crude Oil Extractor <strong>can only be built and placed over an active oil field</strong>. Oil fields are primarily located on the new Sakurajima Island, so you'll likely have to establish a new base there if you want to produce Crude Oil. However, small oil mounds can be found all over the original map as well, but they aren't clearly marked. If you open your map and view Sakurajima Island, you'll see some black spots at various spots. These black spots indicate where oil fields are located, so you have to make your base near one of them.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322973-palworldscreenshot2024.06.20-19.49.27.67.png" data-ref-id="1300-4322973" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322973-palworldscreenshot2024.06.20-19.49.27.67.png" data-ref-id="1300-4322973"></a><figcaption>Oil fields are marked by dark spots on the Sakurajima map.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322973-palworldscreenshot2024.06.20-19.49.27.67.png"></figure><p>When you get to one of these dark spots on the map, build a Pal Management Box to establish a base. Then, find a lifted mound in the ground with dark sludge coming out of it. This dark sludge is oil, and it's where you need to place the Crude Oil Extractor. Using the materials you gathered earlier, go into your build menu, view the second page of the "Production" tab, and find the Crude Oil Extractor. Build the extractor right over the oil mound in the ground. Once that's done, you're ready to start harvesting some Crude Oil.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4323027-palworldscreenshot2024.06.21-00.51.19.90.png" data-ref-id="1300-4323027" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4323027-palworldscreenshot2024.06.21-00.51.19.90.png" data-ref-id="1300-4323027"></a><figcaption>Building the Crude Oil Extractor over the oil mound. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4323027-palworldscreenshot2024.06.21-00.51.19.90.png"></figure><h2>Producing Crude Oil in Palworld</h2><p>While you might think Crude Oil will just start pouring out of the extractor after you build it, Palworld has other plans. The Crude Oil Extractor requires a power source to operate, so you'll have to construct a Power Generator near the extractor in your new base. The Power Generator can be built from the "Infrastructure" tab of the build menu and costs the following resources:</p><ul><li>50 Ingots</li><li>20 Electric Organs</li></ul><p>Once the Power Generator is up and running, you need to head into your Pal Management Box and assign an Electric Pal to the generator. Using a Pal with level 3 or 4 Electricity Work Suitability is essential, as the Crude Oil Extractor requires a ton of power. A level 2 Electricity Pal won't be able to power the generator fully.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4323029-palworldscreenshot2024.06.21-01.03.16.73.png" data-ref-id="1300-4323029" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4323029-palworldscreenshot2024.06.21-01.03.16.73.png" data-ref-id="1300-4323029"></a><figcaption>Powering up the Crude Oil Extractor. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4323029-palworldscreenshot2024.06.21-01.03.16.73.png"></figure><p>Ensure your Electric Pal is assigned to the Power Generator, which is indicated by the Pal producing electricity near the generator. After that happens, the Power Generator will start storing power and the Crude Oil Extractor should turn on. You'll know if the extractor is working if you hear noises coming from it.</p><p>You can collect Crude Oil from the extractor by going up to it and pressing "Acquire" if one or more Crude Oils Are produced. It's recommended that you have a Transport Pal at your new base so they can take the Crude Oil from the extractor to a storage chest, so you don't have to do that yourself.</p><p>With your new Crude Oil, you can make Plasteel at an Electric Furnace or craft items such as Missile Ammo, Flamethrower Fuel, or other Technology menu unlocks.</p>

You shouldn't have too much trouble putting it together either, as it clocks in at just 350 pieces. The building kit is officially licensed by The Pokemon Company, meaning you're getting an authentic replica of the iconic Pokedex. What makes the kit even more exciting is the five included lenticular cards of Pikachu, Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle, and Eevee, allowing you to personalize your Pokedex's appearance.</span></p></div>                      </div><p>As if that weren't enough, you'll find a light brick that can be pressed to illuminate your Pokedex and gives it a cool interactive feature.</p><p>Depending on your location, you can pick up your Pokedex in-store today. Alternatively, you can have it set up for delivery or shipping. Most locations are selling out fast (my local store only has four left), and if the sold-out listing at Amazon is any indication, Target's inventory could be gone soon.</p><p>Whether you miss out on this Pokedex offer or want to build a well-rounded Pokemon Mega Bloks collection, there are a bunch of other great building kits to peruse.

            <p>The Terra Nil team has released its first major update, known as Vita Nova, across PC and Netflix. A Switch version is also on its way.</p>
<p>Today's update for the environmental strategy game is free, and includes a number of new levels, such as Polluted Bay and Scorched Caldera. </p>
<p>The Terra Nil team describe Polluted Bay as a "dead landscape carved in half by a badly polluted river". Scorched Caldera, on the other hand, is a "vast volcanic crater that you must terraform into a life-filled freshwater lake". </p>

<p>In addition to new levels, Vita Nova has brought improvements to the map, with the developer stating that along with being 3D, it can now be freely rotated.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the team said the overhauled wildlife system - which it describes as "dramatic" - will allow the transformed landscapes to "feel more alive than ever". This means animals such as the newly introduced jaguar will venture out more naturally, and have "a deeper set of needs to fulfil". </p>
<p>Nine new buildings have also been added to the game thanks to this update. You can check out a trailer for Vita Nova in the video above.</p>

<p>"Even where Terra Nil makes choices I don't always enjoy, I enjoy that it does make these novel, ambitious choices," Ruth Cassidy wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/terra-nil-review-an-intricate-ecosystem-of-puzzles">Eurogamer's Terra Nil review</a>.</p>
<p>"More than simply the gentle vibes it seems to suggest on the surface, Terra Nil offers engaging puzzles, a thorough commitment to what an environmental city builder could look like, and lingering moments of actual perfection."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/24/24184700/steelseries-arctis-nova-pro-wireless-gaming-headset-tapo-mini-smart-plugs-deal-sale<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve run through an alarming number of gaming headsets over the years from almost every brand you can think of — including Razer, Turtle Beach, HyperX, Logitech, and Corsair — but none impressed me more than SteelSeries’. Its latest high-end set is the <strong>Arctis Nova Pro Wireless</strong>, and while not cheap, you can get a refurbished model at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://computers.woot.com/offers/steelseries-arctis-nova-pro-wireless-headset">Woot</a> until the end of June with a 90-day warranty for $179.99 ($170 off the MSRP).</p><p>SteelSeries headsets are widely lauded for their comfort, well-balanced audio, great mic quality, and sleek design. You can get most of these benefits from the brand’s more affordable options since they typically use similar drivers and microphones, but the Nova Pro Wireless is ideal for multiplatform gamers. Its dual USB base allows you to connect it to both your PC and PlayStation 5 (another <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B0D1S99TD7?tag=theverge02-20">version specifically supports Xbox</a>, but there’s no equivalent sale right now), and it features Bluetooth support for the Nintendo Switch and various mobile devices. You can even use a USB source and Bluetooth simultaneously. </p><p>The base station has a monochromatic OLED display that makes it easy to see which mode you’re in, manage volume levels and chat mix, and fiddle with the EQ, all of which you can control from the headset if you don’t feel like getting up to use the knob. That’s also where you’ll charge the spare battery it comes with, which I personally think is the secondary killer feature. You can pop the removable battery out and swap in a fresh one from the base — no tethering required.</p><p><h5><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23132836/steelseries-nova-pro-wireless-review-gaming-bluetooth-anc">Read our SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless review</a>.</h5></p><div><p>The Nova Pro Wireless gaming headset supports active noise cancellation, swappable batteries, Bluetooth support, and compatibility with PC and most consoles — including Switch and PlayStation.

There’s a rich story and a ton to do outside of its engaging combat, too, whether you’re running up the scoreboards at arcades, singing a round of karaoke, or putting in extra hours on the fun jobs you can take. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24055072/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review-yakuza-sega">Read our review</a>.</li><li>A three-pack of <strong>TP-Link’s Matter-ready Tapo Mini Smart Wi-Fi Plugs </strong>is available for just $24.99 ($25 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BXMNJDW3?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> and directly from <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.store.tp-link.com%2Fproducts%2Ftp-link-tapo-matter-compatible-smart-plug-mini-15a-1800w-tapo-p125m%3Fvariant%3D44382110286047">TP-Link</a>, which matches its all-time low. Smart plugs are ideal if you’re starting a smart home makeover, as they allow you to remotely schedule and control the power on older devices plugged in to them. Their support for the newer Matter protocol also means they offer seamless control from your preferred smart home platform, whether that’s Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, or Samsung SmartThings. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23599437/tp-link-tapo-p125m-review-matter-apple-amazon-google-smartthings">Read our review</a>.</li><li>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/17/20868860/blue-yeti-x-usb-microphone-live-streamers-blend-led-metering"><strong>Blue Yeti X</strong></a> is down to $129.99 ($40 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QKQJL17?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmwWttm3MoQ">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FBlue-Yeti-X-Professional-USB-Condenser-Microphone-PC-Mac-Gaming-Recording-Streaming-Podcasting-Desktop-Mic-High-Res-Metering-LED-Lighting-VO-CE-Effec%2F286303156">Walmart</a>. Although there are more attractive options with more impressive acoustics, the Logitech-owned Blue microphones are solid for podcasting, music, and content creation. They can be a little sensitive, and you may find it a challenge to dial in the perfect gain, but it’s easier to find that sweet spot on the Yeti X thanks to a built-in LED gain meter. Its multifunction knob lets you adjust levels, mute the mic, and set your preferred polar pickup pattern. You can also engage other helpful features, such as a “blend” mode that helps you find an ideal balance between your voice and whichever audio source you’re speaking over.</li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

So, naturally, FIFA is looking to help plug that gap in the meantime by hosting a virtual World Cup in car-football game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rocket-league">Rocket League</a>.</p>

<p>The Rocket League World Cup will run later this year as part of FIFA’s wider ‘FIFAe’ effort to break into the world of esports, which their website tells me they’ve been attempting to do since a FIFA Interactive World Cup held in 2004. Nowadays that consists of online competitions played across EA Sports FC, Konami’s Pro Evolution Soccer successor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/efootball-2024">eFootball</a> and Rocket League, which already runs its Championship Series through the initiative.</p>
<p>The upcoming World Cup will see 16 nations face off in a global tournament, with each country able to put forward three players and one substitute as their representatives on the pitch. The participating nations will be selected through a combination of their player base - in other words, how many people play Rocket League - and based on the past performance of their fellow local players in Rocket League competitions. Those countries will also have the chance to run local-level tournaments to help find their nation’s top players.</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>“The FIFAe World Cup featuring Rocket League marks a new era for FIFAe, providing a groundbreaking platform for FIFA’s member associations to compete on one of the most relevant esports titles,” FIFA’s director of eFootball and gaming Christian Volk said in a statement that, despite their job title, really reads like someone who had never heard of Rocket League before someone burst into their office and pointed at a big number. Volk topped off that statement with one of the most teeth-grinding corporate taglines I’ve come across in a while: “This milestone partnership highlights our commitment to evolve our football esports ecosystem and continue to build the biggest stages for all communities to fame their game.”</p>
<p>Anyway, Rocket League remains a great game that’s almost as much fun to watch as it is to play, so I’m genuinely more interested in its esports tournaments than many games. If you reckon you’re good enough to represent your country in the upcoming World Cup, you can go sign up for qualification <a href="https://www.fifa.gg/register/player">over on the FIFAe site</a>.</p>

Rewild 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terra-nil">Terra Nil</a> has just received a free Vita Nova update, which introduces five new levels, nine buildings, a spinnable 3D world map, a new creature, the jaguar, and a more sophisticated wildlife system (that’ll be the “new life” in question, then). It endows the game’s hitherto rather decorative fauna with “deeper needs” and greater agency. Find a trailer peering through the reeds below this sentence like a jaguar slavering over an unsuspecting herd of boar. Yes, you’re the wild boar in this analogy. Run piggy, run!

If you missed Terra Nil, it’s about clearing desolate regions of detritus and pollutants and bringing back the vegetation by plonking down fancy rewilding gadgets, each of which requires biopower produced by the map tiles you restore. The new maps include Polluted Bay, in which you have to work around an utterly foul river, and Scorched Caldera, a volcano you must turn into a lake. “These, and all the new maps in the Vita Nova update, will put your reclamation skills to the test in interesting and unusual ways,” notes the press release. 
</p>
<p>
The accompanying wildlife system “adds a new dimension of strategy to the game”, with animals emerging “more naturally” in response to your restoration of the terrain. You can also nudge them about by constructing land bridges and even indirectly cultivate prey populations for predators. I’m not sure how “deep” it is in practice. It sounds like it’ll be enjoyable finding out.
</p>
<p>
But will it be enjoyable enough to offset the drawbacks identified by Hayden Hefford (RPS in peace) in their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/terra-nil-review">Terra Nil review</a> last year? “It certainly feels refreshing in the citybuilding genre, which is so often focused on creating infinite growth and bustling metropolises, nature be damned, but ultimately, it's still a game about chasing numbers, and filling meters that allow you to progress,” Hayden wrote. “That alone could be comforting, some much needed calm in a busy world as you create a lush landscape, but I found its repetitive nature was more frustrating than relaxing.”
</p>
<p>
I’ve only ever played a pre-release version of Terra Nil, but I’ve interviewed developers Free Lives and they seem like a kind bunch. One thing we talked about in that interview was whether the developers might introduce human beings to the setting, living alongside the nonhuman creatures and involving themselves in the restoration process, rather than having everything hinge on the usage of shiny SimGadgets. Terra Nil is a charming game and a pleasant reprieve from climate crisis angst, but I've always found the absence of humans from its setting a bit hopeless. There's an unintended, but unfortunate parallel with <a href="https://anthrocology.wordpress.com/2024/02/28/unearthing-the-colonial-roots-of-rewilding/">how real-life rewilding projects may exclude indigenous people from their ancestral lands</a>.

<p id="L8sEsi"><strong>Description:</strong> “Enhances spontaneous guard in mixed physick.”</p>
<p id="NdnB90"><strong>Location:</strong> The Deflecting Hardtear can be acquired from a Furnace Golem in <strong>Gravesite Plain</strong>, likely the first Furnace Golem that you’ll encounter when you step into the DLC.</p>
<p id="K8YUlY"><strong>Effect:</strong> With Deflecting Hardtear in your Wondrous Physick, “damage negation and guard poise will be heightened in the moment immediately after assuming a guarding stance. Successfully executing a spontaneous guard will also strengthen guard counters.” In other words, if you perfectly time your blocks (à la <em>Sekiro: Shadow Die Twice</em>’s deflection mechanic), you’ll be able to react better in battle.</p>

In it, Breslau told Klimentov that his extended break from the internet in 2022 was due in part to the Dr Disrespect ban and his tweet about it. “i cannot continue my professional career until i release a story about doc,” Breslau told Klimentov in a private message at the time. </p><p>It’s not the first time the allegations have been made publicly, either. Following Conners’ viral post, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DramaAlert/status/1804341576291754016&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DramaAlert/status/1804341576291754016" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a clip resurfaced</a></span> of TinyChat cofounder Dan Saltman suggesting a similar alleged reason for the ban on a podcast with streamer Steven “Destiny” Bonnell (who is also permanently banned from Twitch) and esports commentator Richard Lewis in April. It was part of broader discussion on Twitch’s opaque guidelines. </p><p>Fans of Beahm, meanwhile, dug up three of Conners’ old tweets showing him using alleged knowledge of the ban to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1805031501601677771&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1805031501601677771" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">try to fill seats for his bands’ tour dates</a></span>. Many have also raised questions about why, if Conners had this alleged information for years, he didn’t disclose it previously. The former Twitch employee addressed both things in a follow-up <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/evoli/status/1805090423943410060&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/evoli/status/1805090423943410060" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter-thread on June 23</a></span>. </p><p>“Those three tweets warrant admonishment,” he wrote. “Maybe more than three—the stans trying to dig stuff up have been so underwhelming that I presume they missed something. I apologize for it all because it’s worth apologize for.  The subtext of the bit, again shame worthy, is that you’re the last person to not know.”</p><p> Conners continued:<br></p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The information had been so normalized, declawed in the circles that I ran in that could be reduced to allusion and entendre. For everyone who has since said “that’s fucked”—I agreed with you on Friday night before you wrote it. I should have agreed with you sooner.  I cannot take it back but I can stop it.   I never said I’m a perfect person. I just hope this class grades on a curve.<br></p><p> That said, I’m the least sued I’ve ever been. Guys, lawyers work weekends. I don’t think they had a few things they just needed to get to before they circled back to this.  I’m also a little irked at Jake who is very clearly trying to split the difference with what he thinks is half of his potential audience but also I deserve to feel bad about the things he’s flagged. I just do. </p><p>But I also know Jake is racing to verify that screenshot from the world’s leader in multiplayer entertainment’s is legit—Enforcement ID: 7278926—and things are dragging on. Knowing who I was racing I would probably put out some content too.<br></p></blockquote><p>The last part of his message alluded to what may be the alleged screenshots of Twitch’s investigation that led to Beahm getting banned in the first place. Whether they are real or will ever become public is the question that’s been facing this entire saga from the start. Beahm returned to YouTube on Monday for his first livestream of <em>Elden Ring</em>’s massively popular <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC.<br></p><p>“For those that are looking for me to expand on this weekend, not gonna,” he said <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ethangach/status/1805280171483701682&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1805280171483701682" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">during the opening of the playthrough</a></span>. “I already said what I needed to say. I don’t give a fuck about this guy. That’s it.” From there Beahm thanked his fans for their donations and messages of support, before pivoting into playing his Wordle match for the day. “We got you all day, baby,” viewers wrote in the chat. </p><p>Twitch, Beahm, and Conners did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Breslau declined to comment. <br></p><p><em>Correction 1:46 p.m. ET 6/24/2024: Klimentov posted on Patreon, not Substack. </em></p><p><em>Update 2:10 p.m. ET 6/24/2024: Added responses from Bowling, a mention of the podcast clip from Dan Saltman making similar allegations moths ago, and a note that Breslau broke the news of the ban being permanent. </em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
