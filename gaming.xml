However, shortly after 11:30AM ET, it appears people started to be able to complete orders, including one <em>Verge</em> staffer.</p><p>Right as the clock rolled over to 11AM, many of us at <em>The Verge</em> experienced issues with the website. At first, GameStop’s website showed me a mostly-blank page – the only text on it was “Oops…Something went wrong” [sic] and a refresh button. Soon after, myself and other <em>Verge</em> staffers often saw Cloudflare notices on GameStop’s website instead, including error notices that said the “web server is down” or that the site is experiencing a “bad gateway.”</p><p>Occasionally, the online listing for the Switch 2 and <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle has loaded for me, but the preorder button would be grayed out. One colleague also got the console-only option listing to load, but with a “not available” button in place of a preorder one.</p><p>GameStop’s mobile app has also been showing error messages for me, including one that vaguely says “activity paused,” when I try to open it.</p><p>At 11:34AM ET, deals-hunter Wario64 posted that GameStop’s Switch 2 preorders <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1915429174073774270">were actually live</a>. A few <em>Verge</em> staffers were able to get a console in their cart, and one was actually able to make a purchase. Another, however, thought they had the console in their cart, but when their cart actually loaded, GameStop said it was out of stock.</p><p><em>Developing…</em></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The standard model has a 30 degree tiled angle with contoured design for a natural resting position, rubberized side grips, an extended thumb rest, and a free-spinning tiltable scroll wheel for horizontal scrolling. The Vertical Edition goes for a more handshake-like grip with a 71.7 degree angle, big cutout to grip with your thumb, and an extended base that slightly elevates the wrist to reduce strain.</p><p>The new V2 versions replace the original <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fmena-en%2Fproductivity%2Frazer-pro-click" rel="sponsored">Pro Click</a> that Razer designed with ergonomic office furniture company Humanscale.

            <p>Wombo Games - that is to say, the new studio from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> co-founder and ex-<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> chief creative officer Janos Flösser - has unveiled its first title.</p>
<p>It's a "pulse pounding" top-down roguelite called Raiders of Blackveil, with a focus on "mastering champions, combining synergistic perks and acquiring powerful loot".</p>
<p>It's all set in a dystopian industrial fantasy world full of oppressed animals. Who is oppressing these poor beasts? Well, humans, of course. They have formed a mega corporation known as, you guessed it, Blackveil.</p>
<p>"You will join the animal rebellion as they aim to thwart Blackveil’s attempt at enslaving nature and enforcing a mindless consumer society," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3352240/Raiders_of_Blackveil/">reads the game's Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>Raiders of Blackveil includes a range of MOBA-inspired champions, "each with unique abilities, playstyles, and personalities". Roles, meanwhile, include Tank, Damage Dealer, or Support.</p>
<p>Those working on Raiders of Blackveil include veteran developers whose previous works includes the likes of Tomb Raider, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a>, Just Cause and, of course, Hitman.</p>
<p>"Wombo Games has been developing Raiders of Blackveil for nearly two years so it's surreal to finally be able to announce it, and Wombo Games, to the world," said Flösser of the game's reveal.</p>
<p>"Raiders of Blackveil is our first title so it's very special to us. It is a blueprint of our studio because every person at Wombo has contributed directly to its development. At Wombo, we make decisions by consensus, and plan to continue that with feedback from our players once we launch in early access later this year."</p>
<p>If you are interested, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3352240/Raiders_of_Blackveil/">add Raiders of Blackveil to your Steam wishlist now</a>.</p>

<p>As for Flösser's former studio, it is currently working on a new James Bond title. IO first announced its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-io-reveals-fresh-project">James Bond game back in 2021</a>. Very little has been shared on it since, although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-studio-io-opens-up-a-little-about-its-james-bond-007-game">our Bertie managed to tease a few extra 00-details out of the team back in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>More recently, IO said it hopes its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-says-james-bond-game-will-hopefully-be-the-start-of-a-trilogy">upcoming James Bond origin story will be the start of a trilogy</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You can ride dragons, get inside giant mechs, and explore a medieval-infused map with your trusty shield saw. It looks like an impressive evolution of the series coming off of the mixed reaction to <em>Doom Eternal</em>. </p><p><em>Wolfenstein I</em> and <em>II</em> are also very decent. I think the first has a better overall shooter campaign but the second features much bigger, better, and more interesting cinematic moments. The bundle will be on sale through early May and proceeds go to the nonprofit humanitarian organization Direct Relief. While you can pay as little as $28 to snag everything, the recommended contribution is $33. And don’t forget, you can toggle the split to give over 80 percent of your payment directly to the charity. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That listing was sold and shipped by Amazon, which makes it even more frustrating. Normally, Amazon adds its listing alongside the third-party offers, but this time, the Booster Bundle is quietly tucked away under a separate product page. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You have to dig to find the ETBs sold by Amazon ($81.79), but in my opinion, if you're buying Journey Together packs right now, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKOLR3?object_uuid=b9cc7bee-1d27-44d0-9704-f24c20c00e6a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">booster bundle</a> is the right move.

I've gathered them all right here so trainers can cherry pick what they need.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I opened 49 packs across all our preview products for my <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-preview">IGN Journey Together preview</a>, and pulled 18 rare cards. Compared to sets like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-review">Prismatic Evolutions</a>, feels downright generous. But it’s not just about quantity. The art and theme choices in Journey Together are incredible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ve got illustration rares with full-scene designs that feel like storybook pages, Secret Rares with actual competitive value, and Supporters that do more than just draw cards and pass the turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of my favorites include the Spiky Energy Hyper Rare, which adds reactive damage every time your Pokémon gets hit, and Iono’s Bellibolt ex, a Lightning-type engine that fuels itself with unlimited Energy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also pulled N’s Reshiram and Articuno in gorgeous Illustration Rare formats — two cards that not only look great but bring real utility. Salamence ex is a heavy hitter with 300-damage potential, and Lillie’s Clefairy ex quietly punishes Dragon decks by giving them a surprise Psychic weakness. It’s not every day a booster pack feels like a mini narrative, but this set pulls it off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

<p>US preorders for the Nintendo Switch 2 console went live at Best Buy, Target, and Walmart at midnight Eastern time last night (though the rush of orders caused problems and delays across all three retailers' websites). The console listings came with a wave of other retail listings for games and accessories, and those listings either fill small gaps in our knowledge about Switch 2 game packaging and pricing or confirm facts that were previously implied.</p>
<p>First, $80 Switch 2 games like <em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>will not cost $90 as physical releases. This is worth repeating over and over again because of <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/no-switch-2-games-arent-90-the-internet-is-just-broken-beyond-belief/">how pernicious the rumors about $90 physical releases have been</a>; as recently as this morning, typing "Switch 2 $90" into Google would show you videos, Reddit threads, news posts, and even <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/googles-ai-overview-can-give-false-misleading-and-dangerous-answers/">Google's own AI summaries</a> all confidently and incorrectly proclaiming that physical Switch 2 releases will cost $90 when they actually won't.</p>

<p>While physical game releases in the EU <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1jpqsd6/the_physical_version_of_mario_kart_world_will_be/">sometimes cost more than their digital counterparts</a>, there was actually no indication that US releases of physical games would cost $90. The <em>Mario Kart World</em> website listed an $80 MSRP from the start, as did early retail listings that were published before preorders actually began, and this price didn't change when Nintendo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-raises-planned-switch-2-accessory-prices-amid-tariff-uncertainty/">increased accessory pricing</a> in response to import tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.</p>
<p>But now that actual order confirmation emails are going out, we can (even more) confidently say that Switch 2 physical releases cost the same amount as digital releases, just like original Switch games and most physical releases for other consoles. For example, the physical release for the upcoming <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is $70, also the same as the digital version.</p>
<p>Third-party releases run a wider pricing gamut, from as little as $40 (Square Enix's&nbsp;<em>Bravely Default</em> remaster) to as much as $100 (a special edition release of&nbsp;<em>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion</em>, also available at $70 for the standard release).</p>
<h2>Lots of third-party games are getting Game-Key card releases</h2>

<p>When preorders opened in Japan yesterday, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gematsu.com/post/3lniuq7ix4k25">all physical releases of third-party games</a> had Nintendo's Game-Key card disclaimer printed on them. And it looks like a whole lot of physical third-party Switch 2 game releases in the US will also be Game-Key cards, based on the box art accompanying the listings.</p>
<p>These have been controversial among physical media holdouts because they're not physical game releases in the traditional sense—they don't have any actual game data stored on them. When you insert them into a Switch 2, they allow you to download the game content from Nintendo's online store, but unlike a pure digital release, you'll still need to have the Game-Key card inserted every time you want to play the game.</p>

The company also released a new trailer for the expansion, showing off some of the new gameplay, enemies that RoboCop will encounter, and what appears to be a ghost from his past, back when he was still made from easily damaged flesh and bone.</p><p>First revealed earlier this year during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/robocop-expansion-styx-sequel-and-cthulhu-co-op-horror-everything-revealed-at-nacon-2025/2900-6303/" data-ref-id="2900-6303">Nacon 2025 showcase</a>, Unfinished Business revolves around the high-tech OmniTower being taken over by an army of mercenaries. The organization is after the power source at the heart of this building, and when combined with stolen modules from the Metro West precinct, they'll be able to take control of any OCP technology, including RoboCop.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bep-j3cEmQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_bep-j3cEmQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Naturally, Old Detroit's best cop isn't going to wait for this to happen, and he heads to the OmniTower to put a stop to these nefarious plans.</p><p>RoboCop will have his work cut out for him, as in addition to the heavily armed mercenaries roaming the halls, he'll also have to deal with soldiers equipped with jetpacks, traps, and other hazards on his ascent to the top. Interestingly, the game will also include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/robocop-rogue-city-expansion-will-let-you-play-as-the-fleshy-version-of-the-ultimate-cop/1100-6529938/">flashback sequences where you can play as Murphy before his tragic transformation</a> into RoboCop, so that you can discover the shared history between him and the mysterious leader waiting at the top.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/robocop-rogue-city-review-id-buy-that-for-a-dollar/1900-6418149/" data-ref-id="1900-6418149">RoboCop: Rogue City review</a>, reviewer Richard Wakeling called the game a solid action game for RoboCop fans. "If you're a fan of RoboCop, then you'll find a lot to love in Rogue City. It's chock full of Easter eggs and manages to capture the look and feel of the first two RoboCop movies with excellent attention to detail, even getting Peter Weller to reprise his role as the eponymous hero."</p>

The next set of cards coming to hit smartphone app <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> will be based around the Nintendo 3DS games Pokémon Sun and Moon. 
</p>
<p>
Celestial Guardians digital booster packs will launch in-game next week, on Wednesday 30th April, and feature the Hawaiian-inspired Alolan region's main Legendary Pokémon: Solgaleo and Lunala. 
</p>
<p>
Other cards in the set will include the region's trio of starter Pokémon: grass owl Rowlet, fire kitty Litten and goofy water seal Popplio. No one likes Popplio.

<p>
Finally, fresh promo cards will also arrive next week, in  the shape of a couple of Rayquaza ex cards obtainable via missions.

<p>
It's been a month since Pokémon TCG Pocket's previous themed booster pack launched: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-next-booster-pack-adds-shiny-pokemon">Shining Revelry, which introduced Shiny Pokémon to the game</a>. Have you collected 'em all yet?

			<p>Over 20 games are being removed from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-extra-lost-48-of-player-count-in-july-2024/">PlayStation Plus Extra</a> and Premium games catalog, including some first-party PlayStation games that can only be played on PS5 through the PS Plus Classic's catalog.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/several-playstation-exclusives-are-leaving-ps-plus-on-playstation-5-soon/">VGC</a>, games like Resistance: Fall of Man and Resistance 2, which are only playable on PS5 through the PS Plus Premium Classic catalog, will be exiting the service. Infamous Second Son is the other first-party title that will also be exiting the service.</p>
<p>The rest of the list includes big titles like Grand Theft Auto V and Batman: Arkham Knight, along with indie hits like Ghostrunner and Enter the Gungeon. The full list is below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>
<li>MotoGP 24</li>
<li>The Sims 4 Island Living</li>
<li>Resistance Fall of Man</li>
<li>Resistance 2</li>
<li>Walkabout Mini Golf</li>
<li>Synth Riders</li>
<li>Ghostbusters: Rise of the Ghost Lord - Frozen Empire</li>
<li>Before Your Eyes</li>
<li>The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners</li>
<li>The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners - Retribution</li>
<li>LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2</li>
<li>Stranded: Alien Dawn</li>
<li>The LEGO Movie 2 Video Game</li>
<li>Ghostrunner</li>
<li>Payday 2: Crimewave Edition</li>
<li>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</li>
<li>Journey to the Savage Planet</li>
<li>Portal Knights</li>
<li>Enter the Gungeon</li>
<li>Batman Arkham Knight</li>
<li>Infamous Second Son</li>
</ul>
<p>Games are added and removed from subscription services like PS Plus all the time, but these removals especially sting as they recently follow the news of a price hike for all three tiers of PlayStation Plus in <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-price-increase-ps-plus-canada-mexico-ps5-tariffs-1851776655">over 20 countries</a> around the world, including Canada, Australia, Mexico, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, Colombia, and Chile, to name a few.</p>
<p>Removing games like the Resistance titles also feels especially egregious. The Resistance series is beloved by veteran PlayStation fans, many of whom feel like we should have had remasters of the whole series long ago. Short of having a working PS3 with copies of the games, once those games are removed from the service, there will be no legal way to play two games from a series that was once as important to PlayStation as Horizon or God of War is to them today.</p>
<p>If players can't access a full lineup of first-party games in these services, it won't be surprising when more players start to consider what they're actually paying for. Especially regarding the top level of PlayStation Plus's tiered service, since the classics library is what really separates PlayStation Plus Premium from the rest.</p>

        <p>Discover an emotional tale of self-discovery, adventure through captivating regions each as unique as their people. Join Trey as he navigates his way through a land full of mystical creatures to reveal the mystery behind his lost memories.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>Long ago, in the golden era of Talea, the Emperor kept the lands peaceful, and the people prospered. After passing away without naming a successor between his twin sons, a civil war raged between the North, Logos and the South, Mythos – fighting for who would take control of the throne. The townsfolk lived in fear from the atrocities being carried out in the conflict. In a bid to stop the destruction, a part of the empire’s military became Talea’s dedicated protectors.</p><p>From the everlasting darkness of war, these people were the beacon of light that brought people hope. The Lumen were born, and as guardians in their provinces, they ensure the safety of the residents of Talea, both the people and the Animon.</p><p>Since ancient times, people have long studied the Animon. Not much is known of their nature to this day. They’re made of Anivis, an energy that flows through the whole world, and they possess the ability to affect emotions and interact with the very soul of every living being. Catch the Animon and become inseparable partners as you harness their elemental powers and battle alongside each other with your Holoken.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Catching Animon</strong> – Test your skills with the Holoken and catch Animon in the field to recruit them to your party or initiate an incredible and exciting battle against them to prove your mettle! Every Animon can perform their own abilities and skills, and victory is achieved through using the best strategy with your team. There are around 140 known species with 13 elemental types, which are categorized with attributes depending on the emotion they’re able to evoke in people.</li><li><strong>Battles</strong> – Engage in thrilling 1v1 duels or team up for epic four-versus-four showdowns with your party in battle. Level up your Animons and outsmart your opponents by using the best strategy to win. Each Animon has strengths and weaknesses for you to uncover, so use them to your advantage.</li><li><strong>Trading</strong> – With up to three different ways to trade your Animon, you can effortlessly complete your collection and build the perfect battle team. Connect to the Animon Trade Station to seek the Animon you need, trade directly with friends, or the community.</li><li><strong>Cook and Craft</strong> – While on your adventure, be sure to take a rest at the Fountain, where you’ll be able to craft useful items and cook delicious food! If you’re feeling adventurous, you’ll be able to experiment with ingredients to help nurture your Animon.</li><li><strong>The Anispace</strong> – The Anispace is a place that exists and doesn’t exist at the same time. A space detached from the world as we know it. Here is where you’ll find your Animon after you capture them and where you’ll be able to train your Animon for battle. Customize their space when they’re not in your battle party and create stronger bonds with them!</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Publisher Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="LumenTale: Memories of Trey | Partnership Announcement | Team17 &amp; Beehive Studios" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tBAjoWwYOh4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Bethesda Game Studios has congratulated Kepler Interactive and Sandfall Interactive on the launch of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 by way of a custom art piece showing a bunch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastereds-adoring-fan-explained/1100-6531032/" data-ref-id="1100-6531032">"adoring fans"</a> from The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion having a fun time booting up Expedition 33.</p><p>The context here is that Oblivion Remastered surprise-launched on April 22, just days before Expedition 33 arrived on April 24. Given that both Oblivion Remastered and Expedition 33 were day-one launch titles on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Game Pass</a>, some wondered if Expedition 33 might be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-couldnt-come-at-a-worse-time-for-some-games/1100-6531025/" data-ref-id="1100-6531025">overshadowed by Oblivion Remastered. </a></p><p>It remains to be seen what impact, if any, both games releasing on Game Pass so closely to each other might have. The Expedition 33 developers have also <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1915377120332677134" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reacted positively to Oblivion Remastered</a> and have noted how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2025s-best-reviewed-game-can-exist-alongside-oblivion-remastered-clair-obscur-star-says/1100-6531070/" data-ref-id="1100-6531070">both games can successfully co-exist (of course)</a>.</p><p>Oblivion Remastered (Virtuos) and Expedition 33 (Sandfall Interactive) were developed by French studios, so the teams have that in common as well. </p><p>Expedition 33 is a turn-based RPG featuring characters played by people like The Lord of the Rings actor Andy Serkis, Daredevil's Charlie Cox, and Final Fantasy actor Ben Starr.

                <p dir="ltr">Blurry eyes and copious amounts of coffee are defining this Thursday morning for many Nintendo fans, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">preorders for the highly anticipated Nintendo Switch 2 console</a> went live last night at 12 AM ET at three major big box retailers--Best Buy*, Target, and Walmart. Almost instantly, social media feeds buzzed with jubilant success and bitter defeat, as Switch 2 listings changed from "coming soon" to "sold out."</p><p dir="ltr">Target and Walmart both opened their digital doors right at the announced 12 AM start time, and within seconds Target showed "sold out" warnings on listings for both the Switch 2 console itself and the Mario Kart World bundle. However, this turned out to be a false alarm, and while a few customers reported payment issues at the Target cart page, the big red retail chain emerged as the place most people were having early success--with the Target smartphone app proving particularly effective for some.</p><p dir="ltr">Some users had to effectively mash the "place order" button over and over again for Target's system to finally put the sale through, while others saw their payment methods and addresses disappear at the purchase screen. In a few extreme case, the attempt to purchase a preorder resulted in a fraud alert to their account, and a cancellation of the preorder.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4469805-street-fighter-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469805" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4469805-street-fighter-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469805"></a><figcaption>Street Fighter 6</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4469805-street-fighter-6.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Walmart's plan was to create a virtual queue for hopeful customers to file into, which at first seemed like the most efficient route. However, the virtual queue didn't assign anyone a number--at least not one they could <em>see</em>--and the experience turned into a "hurry up and wait" situation. The lines did eventually clear, with many saying that holding the line was bearing fruit, but the uncertainty proved stressful for most whether they succeeded or not.</p><p dir="ltr">Others, meanwhile, were unsuccessful in getting through the queue, and they had to open another tab to start the 10-minute purchase window. At that point, some found they were staring at the timer counting down as the system repeatedly failed to load to their cart. Some were left in the queue even after if had seemingly been disabled, while others were able to purchase a preorder while "skipping" the line. The Walmart listing still has a "preorder" button showing, but it does not indicate that it's sold out yet.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally there was Best Buy, which you may have noticed was marked with an asterisk above. This is because preorders here didn't begin at 12 AM as advertised; instead, they ended up going live nearly a half-hour later. Best Buy also used a virtual queue system, and it also did not designate a number to each customer's spot in line, so there was no way of knowing how close you were to checking out.</p><p dir="ltr">Best Buy is where I locked in for my preorder, and after the half-hour delay, I found myself in two different virtual queues; one on my browser, and one on my phone via the Best Buy app. After a full 50 minutes of waiting, the browser queue booted me back to an empty cart. Needless to say, I was not happy, but I still had the phone queue going… and going… and going.</p><p dir="ltr">I'd finally given up and was set to leave the line, when I noticed something: In the app, the Switch 2 listing I'd queued for said that "stock was unavailable for shipping" and "stock was unavailable for pickup," but I knew this wasn't true. So, at great risk of missing out on a preorder, I left the original queue, refreshed the page to ensure I could select my home store, and then reentered the queue.</p><p dir="ltr">Two minutes later--and that's not hyperbole, two literal minutes after reentry--I was verifying my account, and a preorder for the Switch 2 bundled with Mario Kart World was mine. One hour and 40 minutes from the advertised start time, victory was mine. Others who took the same approach weren't as fortunate, however.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4469767-mario-kart-world.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469767" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4469767-mario-kart-world.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469767"></a><figcaption>Mario Kart World</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4469767-mario-kart-world.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you weren't so lucky in last night's preorder chaos, more Switch 2 preorders will be available at GameStop beginning at 8 AM PT or whenever you local store opens for business. Those interested can also sign up at the official Nintendo website for a chance to preorder the console directly from Nintendo, with invitations scheduled to begin on May 8. If you were able to land a preorder and are looking for some accessories, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-first-party-accessories-will-be-more-expensive-than-originally-announced/1100-6530965/" data-ref-id="1100-6530965">those can still be preordered</a> without much trouble.</p><p dir="ltr">The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5. Launch titles for Nintendo's latest console include Mario Kart World, enhanced versions of The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild and Tears Of The Kingdom, Street Fighter 6, and Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
