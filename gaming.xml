            <p>Destiny 2 will go offline for 25 hours ahead of the launch of its final expansion, The Final Shape.</p>
<p>The downtime – which is scheduled to kick off at 5pm UK time on 3rd June (that's 9am PT, 12pm ET) and end at 7pm on 4th June – is required to prep for the new expansion, which is estimated to take up at least 129GB of free space on every platform, and almost 300GB on Steam.</p>

<p>As detailed in the latest <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twid-05-30-24">This Week in Destiny update</a>, players can pre-download update 8.0.0.2 from 6pm UK time (10am PT, 1pm ET) on 1st June on PS3, while PC and Xbox players have to wait until the same time on 3rd June.</p>
<p>The storage requirements are brutal, though. For a PS5, you'll need 144GB free, and 130GB on PS4. Xbox Series X/S players need a hefty 165GB free, whilst Xbox One players 139GB.</p>
<p>It's PC players that really take the brunt of the huge download sizes, though; the Microsoft Store's version requires 156GB, whilst Epic Games Store and Steam require you to have 280GB and 300GB of free space, respectively – or more, depending upon what language you have installed.</p>
<figure>

<p>Thankfully, the install size will shrink down once everything's installed (the Steam and EGS install size will take up a more modest 155GB and 144GB respectively), but it remains a significant portion of your console's HDD, especially if you play on last-gen systems or the 500GB Xbox Series S, as Destiny 2 will take up a full third of your HDD.</p>
<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/huge-destiny-2-the-final-shape-spoilers-leak-online-as-players-get-accidental-early-access">The Final Shape DLC has leaked online after the expansion was temporarily available</a> on PS5 yesterday. Developer Bungie "killed" the servers, but this was not before spoilers about the story, raid, trophies, loot, and more – much, <em>much</em> more – swamped social media.</p>
<p>Bungie later acknowledged spoilers were shared online, and that a "small group of players" were able to access the campaign, Collections, Echoes, and "other reward info". It advised players who don't want the experience spoiled to "be very careful" on social media in the lead up to The Final Shape's release next week, and asked those who have seen the spoilers to "please be considerate of others".</p>

            <p>The highly-anticipated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> is set to release next year across <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-will-release-on-xbox-series-xs-and-playstation-5-in-2025">PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S</a>. However, Rockstar is yet to say anything at all regarding a PC release.</p>
<p>Now,  publisher Take-Two has given further comment on the lack of Grand Theft Auto 6-related PC news, stating Rockstar would "make more announcements in due time".</p>
<p>During an <a href="https://wsw.com/webcast/cowen162/ttwo/2064582">interview</a> at a TD Cowen conference (as transcribed by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/take-two-discusses-decision-not-to-announce-grand-theft-auto-6-for-pc/">VGC</a>), Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said "the lack of an announcement is not something that could be set in stone as near as I could tell, because the only thing that happens after the lack of an announcement is an announcement, I suppose, or a continuing lack of an announcement, I guess that could happen too. It doesn't seem to me that either would be set in stone". </p>

</figure>
<p>Zelnick continued to state developer Rockstar has "an approach to platforms which we've seen before, and they will make more announcements in due time". The Take-Two head believes the right approach for the business is to "be where the consumer is", adding: "Historically what this company has done is address consumers anywhere they are, on any platform that makes sense, over time."</p>
<p>While surely disappointing for many PC owners out there, Rockstar has previously released its games on console first, so this current lack of news is perhaps not surprising. After all, GTA 6's predecessor - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-sales-have-topped-a-staggering-200m">seemingly evergreen Grand Theft Auto 5</a> - initially released on PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2013, before eventually being made available on Windows in 2015.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, fellow Rockstar stalwart Red Dead Redemption is still to arrive on PC, even 14 years down the line. This particular title initially launched for PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2010, and for a long time the only way to play it on a modern console was via Xbox backward compatibility. That changed recently when Rockstar <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-coming-to-ps4-and-nintendo-switch-later-this-month">ported the game over to Switch and PlayStation</a>, but a PC release still remains noticeably absent.</p>
<p>As for GTA 6's console debut, Take-Two recently stated it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-publisher-highly-confident-of-autumn-2025-release-window">"highly confident" it will make that autumn 2025 release window</a>. While Zelnick said there is often "slippage" in the industry, and Take-Two is not immune from delays, he does not see this happening with GTA 6.</p>
<p>"We narrowed the timing because we are highly confident in that timing," Zelnick said earlier this month.</p>

<p>You might have seen the recent announcement from PlayStation State of Play regarding the PC launch of God of War Ragnarok. We all knew it was coming. Following the immense success of the previous title on Steam, it was only a matter of time before Sony got wise. But there’s a caveat. Does God of War Ragnarok require a PSN account?</p>



<h2 id="h-do-you-need-psn-to-play-god-of-war-ragnarok-on-pc">Do You Need PSN to Play God of War Ragnarok on PC?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, to play God of War Ragnarok on PC, you need a PSN account and login. This is extremely unfortunate, considering there are only approximately <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/which-countries-have-psn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">70 countries with PSN support</a>. There are significantly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/countries-that-dont-have-psn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more without PSN support</a>, well over 120, that simply won’t be able to purchase or play the game on Steam. </p>



<p>Sony is shunning its countless fans across the world, preventing them from enjoying what is often considered one of the most cinematic action adventures in gaming today. We’re hoping they turn this decision around, but it’s unlikely. Many countries still can’t buy or play Helldivers 2, even despite<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-positive-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the massive turnout by the community</a>.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-god-of-war-ragnarok-multiplayer-or-single-player">Is God of War Ragnarok Multiplayer or Single-Player?</h2>



<p>Despite the always-online requirements and PSN, God of War Ragnarok isn’t a multiplayer game. It doesn’t have a cooperative game mode, leaderboards, or competitive PvP in any way, shape, or form. It’s a totally single-player adventure.</p>



<p>Sony continues to push its PSN requirements on PC players primarily because it wants to bring everyone into its ecosystem. In God of War Ragnarok, PSN is “necessary” because of trophies and PlayStation Overlay.</p>



<hr>



<p>We’re certainly not thrilled about the PSN requirements in the action-adventure, but there are plenty more upcoming games to see this summer. Don’t miss a single one by signing up for the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Newsletter</a>!</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/LittleNights/status/1796512039768097038" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X, the official Little Nightmares 3 account confirmed the game is now delayed to 2025.</p>



<p>The message to fans is a little vague about the cause for delay. But it does explain that “quality is a top priority for us,” and that the devs want to “give the game the care and love it deserves.”</p>



<p>The team did not confirm if the game would be moved to early or late 2025. However, they do reassure fans that more news about Little Nightmares 3 is coming “later this summer.”</p>

<p>Supermassive Games announced its anticipated horror sequel Little Nightmares 3 last year at Gamescom. The devs originally planned to release it in 2024 before it was delayed today. </p>



<p>If it aimed to release around Halloween, that might imply the 2025 launch could be earlier than later, but that’s only speculation. The two previous games both released earlier in their launch year, in April 2017 and February 2021.</p>



<p>Supermassive Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/supermassive-games-to-lay-off-up-to-30-of-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also faced layoffs</a> last February that affected up to 30% of its staff. It’s unclear if this in particular delayed Little Nightmares 3.</p>



<p>Supermassive previously developed Until Dawn, which released in 2015. It just appeared during Sony’s latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-may-2024-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Play showcase</a> this week. A remaster of Until Dawn is officially coming to PC and PlayStation 5 in fall 2024. It now has a new gameplay trailer showcasing its updated visuals.</p>

        <p>A focus on live games is likely to set the tone for other events over the next weeks – while a lack of major announcements for 2025 could leave a rare open goal for Xbox</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The start of June in the games business feels increasingly like one of those archaeological sites where nothing remains of the original structure, but researchers can piece its shape together from the gaps it has left behind.</p>
<p>E3 is gone, but we are left with all the various events and showcases that grew up around the show through its various incarnations and endless identity crises – and so, for the next two weeks, we'll be treated to a trade show's worth of announcements and updates on upcoming games, just without the trade show that was once sat in the middle of it all.</p>
<p>Even without E3 itself, it remains arguably the best time of year to take the industry's temperature and to gain an understanding of where we're headed in the next 12 months.</p>
<p>This year, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/astro-bot-and-concord-bookend-playstations-state-of-play-showcase">Sony kicked off the Not-E3 season with a State of Play presentation</a> showcasing upcoming PS5, PSVR2, and PC games on the company's slate. It's fitting that Sony should go first, establishing the bar that others need to try to exceed; this year has cemented the PS5's market leadership in a big way, after all.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean Sony had nothing to prove, though. There's a sense of disquiet evident in a lot of the conversations and commentary around PlayStation this year.</p>
<p>After turning out a reliable stream of major hits for years, 2023 is a strangely fallow period for the company's release schedule, and while the unexpected breakout success of Helldivers 2 has given it a reprieve from accusations of an empty year, it hasn't helped alleviate suspicions that Sony's new fascination with live-service games has been to the detriment of its ability to focus on the high-quality single-player titles upon which it built its first-party reputation.</p>
<p>If you're in the camp that fears that Sony is outright pivoting to live service, the State of Play presentation this week will have done nothing to allay your concerns. Almost a third of the running time of the event was given over to Concord, a live-service PVP hero shooter developed by Firewalk Studios, a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playstation-to-acquire-aaa-multiplayer-developer-firewalk-studios">new team founded by Bungie veterans which Sony acquired last year</a>.</p>
<p>The game looks fine – it may well be extremely good, and there's probably a place in the market right now for a competently-run and lightly-monetised game in the mould of Overwatch – but as the primary focus for a presentation in which Sony laid out its stall for the rest of this year and well into 2025, this will set alarm bells ringing for a lot of core consumers.</p>
<blockquote><p>The thing to really watch out for is publishers announcing live-service sequels or spin-offs to formerly single-player series</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such concerns over Sony's focus in the coming years will not be allayed very much by three more live service type games being included in the presentation – Marvel Rivals (another hero shooter), Infinity Nikki (seemingly a gacha MMO title), and Ballad of Antara (clearly inspired by Elden Ring, but set to be an F2P title of some kind).</p>
<p>Whether you think such concerns are valid, of course, is entirely subjective; it is undeniable that the industry has ended up backed into an economic corner to some extent due to rising development costs and a stubbornly non-growing audience, with successful live service games being one of the seemingly few paths out of this dead end. The counterpoint is that "successful" is doing a lot of heavy lifting in that sentence, with the past couple of years seeing many high-profile live service titles collapsing soon after launch.</p>
<p>Even attaching expensively licensed IP doesn't guarantee any sort of return, as Square Enix and Warner Bros' misadventures with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/crystal-dynamics-to-end-support-on-marvels-avengers">Marvel's Avengers</a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/wbs-push-for-predictable-returns-carries-real-risk-this-week-in-business">DC's Suicide Squad</a> respectively have painfully demonstrated.</p>
<p>The immense risks attached to launching live service games, though, don't change the fact that the economics of big-budget single-player titles have never been worse – and few developers have been able to thread the needle of creating lower-budget titles that consumers still find appealing.</p>
<p>Sony's strong focus on live-service games is, therefore, likely to be replicated quite extensively in the various publisher and platform holder showcases we're due to see in the next fortnight. This trend isn't going to slow down despite recent failures in the space. Until someone comes up with a better solution to this economic conundrum, everyone is going to keep chasing those Fortnite dollars.</p>
<p>The thing to really watch out for is not so much attempts to introduce new live-service IP like Concord, but publishers announcing live-service sequels or spin-offs to formerly single-player (or traditional multiplayer) series.</p>
<p>That's where fur and feathers will really start to fly – in Sony's case, at least, there's a background understanding that while the company may be pivoting to live service in some regards, its major studios like Naughty Dog, Guerrilla, Insomniac, and Sucker Punch are all simply caught on the hop this year, with their undoubtedly immense AAA projects simply not quite ready to be shown in public.</p>
<p>Other publishers, however, are likely to go further than Sony, moving existing franchises and studios entirely over into live service, with all the attendant brand risks that entails.</p>
<p>Live service games were not, however, the only trend visible in Sony's State of Play. One interesting thing to note is that the company is continuing to work on building out partnerships with developers and publishers around Asia (outside Japan), with several of the games chosen for this showcase coming from Chinese developers in particular.</p>
<p>This is a strategy that has worked out quite well for Sony thus far – it gave the PlayStation console exclusivity for the Chinese-developed Genshin Impact, which is one of the most successful and profitable games of the past decade, and more recently saw Sony publishing Korean-developed Stellar Blade, which has done very well and (along with Helldivers 2) helped to rescue an otherwise quiet first half of the year for the PS5.</p>
<p>Broadening and deepening partnerships with companies in China and South Korea – which are not traditionally major regions for console development, but which have tons of talent and experience in mobile and PC gaming – is clearly a priority for Sony, and may give it an edge over competitors even at a time when its own internal first-party pipeline is stuttering a bit.</p>
<blockquote><p>[Helldivers 2's success] hasn't helped alleviate suspicions that Sony's new fascination with live gamess has been to the detriment of its focus on the single-player titles upon which it built its first-party reputation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By contrast, Microsoft – whose Xbox showcase will come in a little over a week's time – has now absorbed the lion's share of $100bn worth of game studios and publishers, and will presumably be hoping to find its own competitive edge in the enormous studio system it now owns.</p>
<p>This has been repeated <em>ad nauseum</em>, but it remains true: Microsoft has a lot more to prove in its summer showcase events than its rival, not only due to lagging in console sales but also due to the very negative press generated by its recent studio closures and layoffs.</p>
<p>It needs to regain momentum, and to show that it is doing exciting things with the massive library of IP and network of studios it has acquired. While Sony's State of Play wasn't bad, per se, it didn't exactly set out a strong manifesto for PlayStation in the coming year – scanning responses online suggests that I'm far from alone in finding the utterly charming Astro Bot to be by far the most exciting thing in the presentation, but I don't think anyone is expecting that to be the next God of War or Spider-Man in mass-market appeal terms.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Astro-Bot.jpeg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>While Astro Bot's charm and appeal are undeniable, it's unlikely to be the next God of War or Spider-Man in terms of mass-market appeal</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Microsoft could do a great deal to reset its recent negative narratives simply by showing a solid sequence of trailers for major franchises (or new IPs from major studios) with 2025 or even 2026 projected dates, giving Xbox an edge over PlayStation in consumer perception of the game pipeline for the first time in many years.</p>
<p>Overall, however, the relatively muted tone that Sony has set for the start of this odd, E3-less announcement season is likely to be more the rule than the exception. Just as high-profile live service failures have not deterred Sony, expect other publishers to charge ahead in this sector, some even more aggressively; and just as Sony's software pipeline appears to have hit some road bumps, expect to see other publishers also coming up a little empty in their announcements for 2025 and beyond.</p>
<p>You can't lay off as many people as the industry has in the past 18 months, coming off the back of the immense disruption of the pandemic era, and expect to keep pumping out high-budget hits. The events of the next couple of weeks may well be our first real glimpse at how much this loss of development capacity is going to inflict commercial pain in the next couple of years.</p>

		<p> Another Friday rolls around, and it’s been a week that’s once again full of gaming goodness. I’ve continued to dabble in Overwatch 2, though I’ve seemingly got worse at it this week. I’ve also been playing Hellblade 2, EA F1 24, and the lovely fantastical city builder Fabledom. My son thinks I like it because it has my name in it. That’s not entirely true, but it might help.</p>

<p>It is the second week in a row that we’re announcing TSA nuptials, and this time we’re wishing all the best to our Editor in Chief, Teflon, as he’s all set to get married tomorrow! It’s a wedding bonanza around here!</p>
<p>Gamoc has played Diablo IV Season 4, Fallout 4, Stranded: Alien Dawn, and Fallout New Vegas, saying, “The latter is a challenge, every fight has me dipping into my inventory.”</p>
<p>Following his own wedding last week, Aran hasn’t played any games as he’s currently on a little honeymoon in Cornwall. I am sending him a review code for BLUD though, so I expect he’ll be playing that when he gets back!</p>

<p>Jason has been playing Wuthering Waves, which apparently has some potential as a slightly more combat-intensive open-world gacha game. He’s also been playing lots of D&amp;D, “the one true way to be a fool with friends.” </p>

<p>TC has been playing Destiny 2 in prep for The Final Shape. He also has more SixthAxis wedding action to announce as we offer congratulations to Andy and Steph from the TSA Destiny Clan who also got married last weekend! We love the amount of love in the (chat)room!</p>
<p>Jim takes things in a different direction by playing Death Stranding. He told us, “While somewhat soothing, I’m now wanting to forge ahead with the story instead of building every road and delivering every nugget of cargo I can see. In typical Kojima fashion, the story isn’t making any sense, though I’m quite happy for it to wash over me instead of feverishly flicking through the Death Stranding wiki for answers.”</p>
<p>That’s not the only thing from our Senior Editor, as he continues, “I’ve also played a few matches of XDefiant, Ubisoft’s Call of Duty rival that features a cast of crossover factions. It’s fast, fun, and has a good amount of depth thanks to the Overwatch-like ultimate abilities, weapon loadouts, and player progression. The lack of skill-based matchmaking has also been a nice novelty after years of back-to-back Call of Duty games where I’ve been seemingly thrown to the wolves straight out of the gate.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Steve has played the heck out of Hellblade 2: Senua’s Saga, saying, “I’ve really enjoyed the audio-visual spectacle and the harrowing narrative but the gameplay hasn’t really evolved since the first one. I then moved on to the average but fun Immortals of Aveum, the failure of which is a shame as it sets up an interesting fantasy FPS world that will probably never be used again. Alongside these I got all the achievements in the cute as hell Little Kitty, Big City and have been playing the fantastic Lorelei and the Laser Eyes for review – this has taken a bit longer as my kids (12 and 17) are playing it with me.”</p>
<p>Finally, Ade has been playing Astor: Blade of the Monolith for review. You can read his words about it <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/30/astor-blade-of-the-monolith-review/">right freak’n now</a>!</p>
<p>And what about you? Played anything good this week?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-nightmares-3-delayed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco and developer Supermassive Games have announced that horror platformer sequel&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares 3&nbsp;</em>has been delayed beyond 2024.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/LittleNights/status/1796512039768097038/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X</a> (formerly known as Twitter), the two studios say that&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares 3&nbsp;</em>will now launch at some point in 2025, although a more specific release window hasn't been revealed.</p>

<p>The reason for the delay is the usual story; more time is needed to give the game the "care and love it deserves", and since "quality is a top priority" for Bandai Namco and Supermassive, the release window has been moved.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/little-nightmares-3-delayed-sandstorm.jpg?itok=4WUS3jRH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/little-nightmares-3-delayed-sandstorm.jpg?itok=60CZZabf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Little Nightmares 3&nbsp;</em>won't emerge from the sandstorm until next year.</figcaption></figure><p>All is not lost, though; Bandai Namco and Supermassive say that they'll share more information about&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares 3&nbsp;</em>"later this summer", so we may well get a new release window - or, at the very least, a new trailer - soon.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares 3</em>, it is, believe it or not, the third mainline game in the&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>series of cinematic platformer-style horror adventures.</p>

<p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-nightmares-iii-revealed-at-future-games-show">during Gamescom Opening Night Live last year</a>,&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares 3&nbsp;</em>will be the first game in the series not to be developed by Swedish studio Tarsier, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-thq-nordic-has-bought-little-nightmares-developer">purchased by Embracer Group in 2019</a>.</p>

<p>The game will place an emphasis on co-operative gameplay; you'll either be able to tackle it with a friend in co-op or solo with an AI partner.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/little-nightmares-3-delayed-furnace.jpg?itok=TwgbK3is 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/little-nightmares-3-delayed-furnace.jpg?itok=sLUm1f9q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Little Nightmares 3&nbsp;</em>will emphasize co-operative gameplay, but you'll be able to play it solo.</figcaption></figure><p>Lost in a place known only as the Nowhere, main characters Low and Alone will need to use all of the tools at their disposal if they're to outwit the horrors that await them within the disturbing Spiral.</p>

            <p>Between this, my supporter post later, and the fact I decided to watch Office Space again this week, I’d like to make it clear to any colleagues or management reading that I value and love them all dearly, and am 110% committed to the eternal grind machine of covering videogames online. Workday malaise is universal, however, whether or not you’re lucky enough to enjoy your job as much as I do. Enter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/office-fight">Office Fight</a>, a stylish physics <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a> where you, a ghost, posess office equipment to cause as much physics-based chaos as possible. The PR did some Office Space jokes in the email, so I pretty much had to cover it. At least once I realised what they were doing, after initially just thinking they were being a massive donkey.</p>

<p>After customising your own dead-eyed employee, you’ll start your new job and be bombarded by emails, one of which is you getting fired. You drop dead at your desk, and the next thing you know, you’re chatting to a friendly ghost who welcomes you to undeath. Now, you can posses various objects in the office to cause chaos, like flinging desk chairs at people. Unrelated but does anyone remember those Casper The Friendly Ghost ice lollies? They were S-tier, and I must assume they haven’t existed for decades, although I haven’t gone looking. Casper-heads, feel free to chime in with pertinent info.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Anyway, you get a certain amount of possessions to cause as much chaos as possible. Maybe, if you fling that tower unit just right, you’ll cause a riot and the remaining employees will beat each other up! Maybe you could send a monitor flying into that vending machine? Who knows what might happen then? I bet it’ll be good though. Individual stages look to have lots of little tailor-made interactions that result in fun violence, like a Rube Goldberg machine where the ‘Goldberg’ is actually professional wrestler Goldberg. I’m not 100% sure I’d stick around for a whole game of this, but the free <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2747060/Office_Fight/">Steam demo</a> is definitely worth a spin. You can keep up with all our Steam Next Fest coverage <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/steam-next-fest-2024">here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[F1 24 Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-24-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/f1-24-review.886167/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/f1-24-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The 21st Century has seen the longest stretches of team domination in the history of Formula 1. The last 14 years has seen drivers from just two teams win the whole shebang. That’s year after year, for nearly a decade and a half. Yes, Formula 1 is foremost an engineering series, and the recipe for winning a World Drivers' Championship essentially begins with “have the quickest car” and ends with “be faster than your teammate.” Yes, there’s a glimmer of promise <em>this</em> year with four different winners in just eight Grands Prix.</p><p>However, broadly speaking, the predictability of F1 <em>is</em> getting a little old hat. Unfortunately, Codemasters’ F1 series is suffering a parallel predictability problem in F1 24, in that it’s a terrific racing game but, despite its well-executed new career mode and flattering handling model, it’s mostly an extremely familiar experience.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>F1 24’s new hook is the ability to “be one of the 20,” as Codemasters puts it. This means we can now take one of F1’s superstar drivers and play as them in a complete, multi-season career mode experience called Driver Career. It’s essentially an adjacent mode to My Team, the team owner-driver mode added in F1 2020 – which still exists, unchanged, in F1 24. Driver Career isn’t actually limited to the 20 current top F1 drivers – you can also select an F2 driver, create a custom driver, choose from a selection of past F1 legends, or race as Pastor Maldonado.</p><p>Driver Career is mostly distinct for what it prunes out: things like team finances, sponsorships, and second driver signing. That helps it focus strictly on the experience of a single driver rather than someone who also needs to sign all the invoices as team boss.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The battle to build your driver’s reputation within the sport and emerge ahead in key rivalries against peers is a compelling one.</p></div><p>So that’s actually a very welcome change, and all these Driver Career features are also available in the two-player career mode. The big picture view of My Team was engaging for a spell, but given that it’s been the same thing annually for several years now, streamlining it to focus a bit more makes sense. Driver Career is a different juggle, and the battle to build your driver’s reputation within the sport and emerge ahead in key rivalries against peers is a compelling one. Pumping up your driver’s various ratings is a satisfying slow burn. Adding new achievements to a real driver’s existing career stats is cute. And yeah, the ability to put Mark Webber back into an F1 car and personally take him to victory is the best dad catnip since Tom Cruise put himself back into an F-14.</p><p>Unfortunately, like Tom Cruise in that F-14 with no nosewheel, it just doesn’t all quite land impeccably.</p><h2>Secret Equation</h2><p>Most disappointing are the new mid-race objectives. In theory, they’re a brilliant idea to spice up the racing on track. Something to add some urgency or tension to certain phases of a race, a mini-mission could be a smart way to keep us motivated in the midst of the wider contest. But to pull that off they’d need some kind of situational awareness of the race we’re driving in, and as it is they’re generally just too arbitrary and random. Yes, if you’re driving a little sloppy, there’s merit in the race engineer encouraging you to stick to the track limits for a specified number of laps, and then rewarding you for doing so. But in practice, too often your objectives just seem to be pulled from a bucket like we’re playing F1 bingo. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>10 Terrific F1 Games Throughout the Ages</h3></div></output><p>It’s a little daft, for instance, for your race engineer to be wringing his hands about your fuel burn rate and asking you to back off and drive more efficiently when the HUD clearly indicates you have more than enough to complete the race and then pour the remainder over your manager like Gatorade to celebrate. And F1 24 seems to know its objectives are dumb because there was never any punishment for failing; I would just give it the finger and continue to push as hard as possible, the objective would be flunked, the race engineer would shrug it off, and I… would still finish the race with fuel to spare, <em>like I told you</em>. Overall, mid-race objectives just aren’t as tailored to what’s actually going on as they need to be in order to matter or make things more interesting.</p><p>Secret meetings are a bit wonky, also. I appreciate they’re designed to emulate the behind-closed-doors nature of surprise driver moves, but it’s a little confusing that turning down so-called secret offers from rival teams made my existing team at McLaren pleased – like Zak Brown was hiding behind the curtains all along.</p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>The Codemasters and EA F1 Series</h3><p>Since acquiring Codemasters in 2021, EA is once again in the business of publishing F1 games. Here are all the F1 games EA and Codemasters have brought us over the years.</p></div><p>One of the things I like is the voice bites from the real drivers (which are samples from real F1 radio chatter from past races) but their lines are a lot more limited than I’d hoped. So far, all I’ve really heard is short grabs after crossing the finish line, and dismay at some terminal crashes (which aren’t always looking great this year, with loose wheels consistently clipping through cars while flapping around on their tethers, or behaving in other weird ways). Each driver has a handful, and it’s neat to hear Daniel Ricciardo repeat his iconic "I never left" ultimatum from Monza 2021, or the moments of joy that have been repurposed for drivers like Logan Sargeant or Pierre Gasly. However, drivers are otherwise silent throughout races – they don't gripe, react, or acknowledge the radio at all – so it’s a little vanilla.</p><p>The one-size-fits-all commentary segments continue to be rather basic, also. It’d just be nice for the library of commentary to have some lines prepared for juicy championship scenarios. For instance, I entered the final race in my first season with Oscar Piastri a single point ahead of Max Verstappen: It was winner take all. All F1 24 had in the can for the occasion were some boilerplate remarks about how drivers who’d had a dud season can approach the last GP before the winter break. I understand Codemasters and their EA corporate overlords can’t be expected to be prepared for every single scenario that our actions will create throughout our F1 24 careers, especially if I decide to get weird with it, but a championship going down to the last race is pretty low-hanging fruit, surely?</p><p>F1 World <em>is</em> back from F1 23, but I’m no more enamoured by it. I just don’t care about clothes and cosmetics, and I’m not really motivated by game modes that feel more like jobs. F1 World is admittedly harmless if, like me, all you’ll ever do is dip in for quick custom solo races and leave, but there’s nothing about grinding away for car upgrades and Battle Pass tat that appeals to me over the conventional but authentic solo career modes. Multiplayer seems akin to F1 23, and public lobbies will invariably still be like trying to host an egg and spoon race in the middle of a rugby match. Leagues remain a private alternative for civilised groups of like-minded players to compete.</p><p>By the way, I should also add I was definitely lulled into a false sense of optimism by F1 24’s fabulous reveal trailer. There’s no rock here in F1 24 itself; just a spray of electronic music from an avalanche of artists I’ve never heard of.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Smooth Operator</h2><p>So let’s get down to where the rubber meets the road. F1 23’s handling was a lot more stable than F1 22, and to its credit F1 24 is even more so. In the lead-up to F1 24’s release, Codemasters discussed a raft of changes that had been made to the handling model. On paper there were a lot, but the upshot of these changes are sticky, compliant cars that are surprisingly simple to tame and get great drive out of corners. I anticipate there’ll be resistance from some who argue that a less-punishing handling model is less realistic, but what I won’t do is pretend I have any meaningful insight into what an F1 car feels like at maximum attack. Yes, they hold the road like glue in F1 24. Considering that, at high speed, F1 cars essentially have the weight of half-a-dozen pianos pressing them down onto the asphalt, who am I to say that feeling of immense grip is not credible? At any rate, I like the handling in this video game. I feel quick and confident and can drive extremely aggressively. I feel like an F1 driver who knows what he’s doing, at least, and that is the entire point of this quote-unquote-simulation. Like F1 23, it’s especially impressive on a gamepad, even relative to a wheel, where it is a bit twitchier by default.</p><p>Also like previous F1 instalments, the AI speed remains highly tuneable. It shouldn’t be glossed over how important it is to the atmosphere of F1 racing to ensure the margin between you and the AI is super tight, regardless of your skill level, and it’s a great feeling once you do find that perfect spot on the difficulty slider. If all racing games could be finessed this way, the genre would be a lot better off.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Whether this refreshed handling and the new Driver Career mode is enough to justify upgrading from F1 23, 22, 2021, and so on, however, is your call. There are other items of note that might tip the scale: There’s a spin-off of the new Driver Career called Challenge Career, which is a curated, episodic version with a pre-determined driver (Verstappen, for now). It’s played solo, but you’ll compete with others asynchronously for leaderboard placement. It’s currently only just started, but I doubt I’ll want to play both this and my existing Driver Career. I’d rather begin a second save as a driver I actually want to race as.</p><p>To finish on a high note, F1 24 <em>is</em> the best-looking F1 game to date and, unlike EA Sports WRC, it remains on Codemasters’ proprietary engine where performance is totally reliable. Year over year there have been noticeable improvements to the driver likenesses. Bottas’ luxurious mullet and moustache combo is lovingly rendered, solidifying the fan-favourite Finn as the most Australian-adjacent F1 driver amongst a grid that features 10% actual Australians. Coming in after that, Spa, Silverstone, Jeddah, and Lusail have received updates to bring them up to snuff with the current real-life circuits (though Circuit Paul Ricard hasn’t made the final cut, so F1 24 has 25 tracks to F1 23’s 26).</p><p>And no, there’s no Braking Point story mode this year. As a reminder, that’s only been appearing in every other F1 game since 2021, so the next chapter of that isn’t part of F1 24.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
The next Epic Games Store freebie as part of the company's ongoing Mega Sale promotion will be Marvel's Midnight Suns. 
</p>
<p>
That's according to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/epic-games-store-voici-lultime-jeu-mystere-aaa-bientot-offert-sur-pc-51882">Dealabs</a>' always-reliable billbil-kun, who notes the game will be available to download next week from Thursday 6th until Thursday 13th June.
</p>
<p>
If you're yet to give it a go, Marvel's Midnight Suns is a brilliant character-centric role-player with Firaxis' trademark turn-based combat. Actions are made by cards, yes, but don't worry too much about that. It's fun, it's well-written, and being able to build up a secret base full of interesting Marvel superheroes is a blast.

However, launched right at the tail end of 2022 to lacklustre marketing, Marvel's Midnight Suns failed to find an audience - and any plans for a follow-up quickly evaporated.

            <p>If you cast your minds back to March, you may recall the story about some missing Playdate consoles. During a talk at GDC, company co-founder Cabel Sasser revealed pallets containing $400k worth of Panic's palm-sized, crank-operated console had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/400k-worth-of-playdate-game-consoles-have-gone-missing-in-vegas">gone AWOL in Las Vegas</a>.</p>
<p>At this time, Sasser called the whole situation "a bit of a true crime drama".</p>
<p>However, fast forward a couple of months, and the consoles have now been returned to their rightful owner, although the circumstances still seem rather bizarre.</p>

<p>Sharing an update on social media platform X, Playdate said its hardware "got hastily dumped at a random restaurant this morning".</p>
<p>In a subsequent post, the Playdate team said it will share more details about the whole ordeal further down the line. It noted having the consoles returned was the "best possible outcome", adding this resolution was the result of "lots of time and detective work" - something the team enjoyed.</p>

<p>"Attached to my memories of Mad magazine are inevitably a bunch of memories of early home computers - the C64 and Amstrad in my case - and there's a lot of that DNA here too," he mused in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playdate-is-weird-and-kind-of-ace">Eurogamer's Playdate review</a>.</p>
<p>"Games straight from someone's attic workspace or the desk in the bedroom. Games straight from their weird head and their weird perspective and their weird take on what games should be. At its best Playdate gives you this - along with the nicely handled Zeldas and the Breakouts and the things it seems to feel it should give you to be well-rounded.</p>
<p>"Now I've seen it, I want more of it."</p>

            <p>Riot games have committed to a series of new measures to curtail harassment and hate-speech in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/valorant">Valorant</a> community. In a <a href="https://x.com/VALORANT/status/1796240162185224240">video entitled</a> ‘Keeping Our Community Healthy // Dev Updates,” studio head Anna Donlon took to Xitter to outline the new measures for the competitive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a>. Below is a graphic detailing the changes, which include new penalties such as hardware bans for offenders, and an expanded role for the game's Voice Evaluation tech, which monitors chat for bad behaviour. “If you want to make evil statements under the guise of '[naughty word SEO doesn't like being in the first paragraph] talk', you aren't welcome here,” writes the official Valorant account.</p>

<p>“Player behaviour is a complex problem-space,” Donlon said. Sometimes solutions have to be “painfully manual. Sometimes tech - that has the potential to be a gamechanger - takes longer than you want”. She reiterated that offending community members are in the minority, but added that “unfortunately, there are still people in this world that want to take their insecurity, or their bad day, or their hate, or their whatever, on some stranger through their computer screen.”</p>
<p>“In almost all cases, someone gets hurt in the process of making these systems better,” continued Donlon. Earlier this month, streamer Taylor Morgan went viral with the below post</p>
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>

<p>In the attached video, Morgan shared footage from a stream in which she was subject to sexual harassment and verbal abuse from another player. “I know you hear us,” Morgan wrote. “I know you see us. If this goes unpunished I am taking this as an active act from you that you do not give a single fuck about any of the women and minorities that play your game, and I will rally to boycott.”</p>
<p>It would seem that Riot were paying attention. “When you to tell someone to ‘just mute comms’ to avoid harassment, you are essentially putting the harassed person in a position to not communicate,” said Donlon. “To compromise how they want to play the game to accommodate you.”</p>
<p>“Competitive games need to have room for banter. We believe this, and I do understand the fear that we will sanitise gaming by ‘over-addressing’ these issues,” Donlon continued. “We have no interest in doing that. But we do believe that a person should not have to be in a position to ‘grow a thicker skin’ or whatever other unhelpful suggestions have been thrown out there just to avoid threats of violence or literal hate-speech.” Talk is cheap, of course, but it’s heartening to see a studio so quickly react to something that’s making Valorant a worse place for so many. Riot themselves were the subject of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-games-to-pay-100-million-in-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-settlement">allegations and lawsuits related to an abusive workplace culture</a> a few years ago, and have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-games-outline-five-year-strategy-including-plans-for-more-tv-movies-and-music">careful to position themselves as having learned from the experience.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-new-patch-dlss-3-frame-generation/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Dragon's Dogma 2 patch is now live on PC and consoles, introducing NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation support, and several gameplay tweaks and fixes.</p>
<p>The May 31st patch finally brings DLSS 3 Frame Generation support for improved performance on NVIDIA RTX 4000 series graphics cards. The game received unofficial support with <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-dlss-3-mod-released-for-free-by-puredark-native-implementation-is-there-just-hidden/">a mod</a> shortly after release, but the official implementation should be better, addressing some of the issues seen in the modded implementation, including stability issues.</p>
<p>The new Dragon's Dogma 2 patch also fixes a visual issue that prevented terrain from being displayed correctly on certain graphics cards, increases item storage space from 1000 to 3000, and fixes some other issues regarding Pawns' cosmetics and dialogues. The full patch notes can be found <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2054970/view/4174353069101968796" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 is definitely a step forward from its predecessor when it comes to world design and visuals, but it leaves something to be desired regarding a lot of other elements, such as narrative, AI, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-performance-issues-lod-range/">performance</a>. Still, it is most definitely a game worth playing for all fans of the series, as highlighted by Alessio in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>This review may read quite negatively, but it's only because of the lofty expectations that surrounded Dragon's Dogma 2. The original game was an amazing foundation to build upon, and yet CAPCOM seemed content with keeping the same strengths without improving much on the weaknesses. Twelve years later, though, the effect cannot be the same. Still, make no mistake: Dragon's Dogma 2 is a highly enjoyable fantasy action/adventure with RPG elements that will provide you with about 40 hours of pure fun. Its peerless sense of exploration, meaty combat system, and stunning visuals will motivate you throughout the entire playthrough. Just don't expect to find a fantasy world simulator or, indeed, a narrative worth remembering.</em></p>
<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 is now out on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater may not release this year as <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-2024-hype-trailer-metal-gear-solid-delta-silent-hill-2-confirmed/">previously revealed</a>, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>The remake of the third entry in the series by Konami, according to <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-sortira-t-il-vraiment-en-2024-51984">reliable leaker billbil-kun</a>, may slip into 2025. A 2025 release window was referenced by a global distribution giant, the leaker said, with a December 31st 2025 placeholder release date. The leaker, however, wasn't able to corroborate the information, so there's still the chance the game will launch before the end of the year.</p>
<p>No matter when Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is launching, an announcement regarding the game will be made very soon, within the next 10 days or so. Pre-orders will open after this announcement, so a release date will surely be announced soon, whether in 2024 or 2025. A Collector's Edition will also be released for the game, but its contents are yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a remake of the third entry in the series, rebuilt in Unreal Engine 5. Not a whole lot is known about the game, but judging from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-unreal-engine-5-in-game-footage/">short footage available</a>, it will attempt to faithfully recreate the original while improving visuals and enhancing the immersive stealth action gameplay that makes the original one of the best entries in the series, if not the very best.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cod-cheat-provider-threatens-to-release-free-software-in-court-case-backlash.886131/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/engineowning-cod-cheat-provider/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Earlier this week, EngineOwning was slammed with a $15 million payment order from a California court in a landmark cheating case against Activision Blizzard. For the longest time, EngineOwning has been one of the most popular cheat providers in the gaming market, specialising most commonly in the Call of Duty space.</p>



<p>However, following the judgement, EngineOwning’s leadership team swore to appeal the settlement order, making some rather out-there threats against Activision Blizzard that included releasing cheating software free of charge.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-making-it-worse">Making it Worse</h2>



<p>Activision Blizzard saw success in the Californian court when a judge ruled that EngineOwning’s unlawful conduct had made the firm liable to pay AB a whopping $15 million (including legal fees). Not only that but the court demanded that EngineOwning surrender its domain identity to Activision. This warranted immediate backlash from EngineOwning, who went on record saying:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We hope and think that our domain registrar will not defer to this bogus claim, that would not have been approved by any clear headed judge with even basic democratic values in a proper jurisdiction.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>By way of an inflammatory response, EngineOwning vowed to create new software to further circumvent Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone’s anti-cheat systems. The company also pledged to offer a free-to-use cheat system if AB continues down this path. In a report published by IGN, it was suggested that the owners of EngineOwning have prepared to keep the business flowing by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-cheat-maker-defiant-in-aftermath-of-court-ruling-vows-to-continue-releasing-modern-warfare-3-and-warzone-cheats">setting up a series of backup domains</a>.</p>



<p>Call of Duty has had a problem with cheaters for years – and it’s getting worse. As the anti-cheating systems become more intelligent, so too does the software that cheat providers are designing. </p>

<p>A new rumour suggests that Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater Remake is set to be released in 2025.</p>



<p>The news comes from reliable dataminer and leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-sortira-t-il-vraiment-en-2024-51984" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">bilbill-kun</a>, who often obtains the majority of information via datamining the backend of websites. As he points out, the findings suggest that the announcement is likely to come soon, and he theorizes it could be within the next 10 days.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, that timing puts it firmly in line with the events surrounding Summer Game Fest, which kicks off on June 7, however bilbill-kun does state that the reveal could be prior to the show and take place on June 6th.</p>



<p>It’s said that the release date of the game is placeholder at 12/31/2025, which would suggest a 2025 release date, rather than the 2024 release window that PlayStation previously gave.</p>



<p>Also outlined by the leaker is the prices of the upcoming editions, which are:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<em><strong>Standard</strong></em>&nbsp;<em>Edition</em>&nbsp;(PS5 / Xbox Series X):&nbsp;<em>US$69.99</em></li>



<li><strong>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</strong>&nbsp;–&nbsp;<strong>Collector’s</strong>&nbsp;<em>Edition</em>&nbsp;(PS5 / Xbox Series X):&nbsp;<em>US$199.99</em></li>
</ul>



<p>According to Konami, the Metal Gear series has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-series-60m-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassed over 60 million unit sales</a> since its first game released in 1987. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid 3 Remake</a> is set to launch in 2025 on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC. </p>

            <p>Capcom's upcoming entry in the lizard pants-making sim, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, got a new trailer at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-concord-and-more-everything-pc-relevant-announced-at-playstation-state-of-play-may-2024">last night's State Of Play</a>. It showed off more of how its lovely desert environments morph to fit the weather and how its inhabitants largely don't get on. We also got a look at some cursed lions, an armoured frog with an unsettling tongue and a rideable Chocobo-esque mount that lets you ping arrows on the fly. Let me break it down for you readers, as someone who is increasingly excited at the prospect of more colourful pants.</p>

<p>First off, I've plonked the trailer above. Watch it if you'd like, it's nice. And we certainly get a lot more of the gameplay goodness than we did from last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-looks-heckin-great-and-is-coming-in-2025">Geoff Fest unveiling</a>.</p>
<p>The real details lie in PlayStation's <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/30/monster-hunter-wilds-new-gameplay-details-from-todays-state-of-play/">blog post</a>, which expands on everything shown. First thing to note: we're shown one area in the trailer called the Windward Plains, that's made up of "sandy deserts, swaying grasslands, and twisting rock formations". And it's "just one such region that awaits you", which suggests there's another place with equally disgruntled dinosaurs.</p>
<p>The cursed lion shown off? Yeah that's a "Doshaguma", who sometimes hunt in packs and have a "wide habitat range". What this means is that you'll likely bump into these bastards a lot, then. Oh and the armoured frog? Yeah that's a "Chatacabra" whose *checks notes* saliva attaches ore and other "substances" to its forelegs to strengthen itself. Wish I could, like, spit some metal pellets onto my shins to make my legs a bit stronger as opposed to go to the gym. </p>
<p>Your new mount is Seikret, who lets you do lots of things while on the move. Like use your slinger or sharpen your weapon or gather materials: all very helpful to reduce tedium. They can even take you to spots automatically and switch to a secondary weapon without returning to base. Birds are great.</p>
<p>Fourteen weapons are returning! I won't list them all, but know that they are the same bunch found in a bazillion other Mon Hunts. The trailer shows off a couple of new actions for the Greatsword and the Heavy Bowgun, a parry follow-up and a bazooka respectively.</p>
<p>Focus Mode is a new thing, too. There's not too many specifics on how it <em>works</em>, but Capcom say it'll let you "have more precise control" over how you guard, aim, and attack monster weaknesses. And it makes it "easier to adjust your distance to the monster", which suggests it works a bit like a toggle to make the game a touch easier for new players.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, there's a new version of the slinger that lets you collect items off the back of your bird and more, although they're coy about what "more" is. </p>
<p>I'm not the world's biggest Monster Hunter fan but I'm excited to give it a shot when it launches sometime in 2025, mainly because it looks really nice and is perhaps a touch more approachable to folks who aren't as familiar with the series as the longtime pants makers. One thing, though, they better have updated the bloody menus. God, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-rise-and-its-mountain-of-tutorial-boxes-are-giving-me-brain-freeze">Monster Hunter menus suck</a>.</p>

            <p>
This piece is being written on a train as I trundle towards our very first staff meeting with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ign-entertainment-acquires-eurogamer-gi-vg247-rock-paper-shotgun-and-more">Rock Paper Shotgun's new overlords</a>. The morning is cloudy but bright and calm, the north London suburbs are a blissful checkerboard of red roofs and flourishing lawns, hope glistens faintly in the gutters and ditches beside the tube. How unlike the innards of Centum, a point-and-click <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2625550/Centum/">Steam page here</a>) that begins with a dreary retro desktop interface on which there are curious text files, curioser decryption tools and most curious of all, an .exe of some kind that drops you into a simulation consisting of a stone prison chamber. Hang on, I'm changing trains...
</p><!--more-->
<p>
...I have now changed trains. Stuff and tarnation, there's nowhere to sit in this one and the carriage is full of excited children with musical voices and untarnished souls. How unlike the stone prison chamber of Centum, in which you are alone save for the occupant of a rathole - possibly a rat, though a talking one with unnecessarily large teeth - and a monstrous, multiple-headed jailor called the Judge, who appears each in-game morning to ask questions such as "What was the promise you made?" and then accuses you of lying, regardless (I think) of your answer.
</p>
<p>
Not all that alone, then. This is quite a populous prison cell, actually. There's a boy made of darkness, too, who wants to know if you're his friend, and I guess those disembodied eyes in the shadows count as cellmates? 
</p>
<p>
There's also a window which - once you've found an object you can use to clean it - looks out over a city of tombstone-shaped blocks and towers. "The sky is dead," reads some accompanying text. "The gods are dead. The gods are merciful. All the city can do is weep."  Still, it's easier on the eyes and ears than Finchley Road. Turn back to the table in the middle of the cell and you will find a nice cup of what could be tea and a wailing cosmic cube, a bit like Hellraiser's puzzlebox but a touch more Macintosh. Who you are is a matter of guesswork, but if you spill your "tea" you'll see the face of an old man in the puddle, an old man "with the eyes of a child". 
</p>
<p>
The game's branching dialogue choices make mention of old wars and bloodshed. Perhaps you are an imprisoned dictator of some kind. Not a feelgood game, in short. Also not a game you might enjoy if you dislike unfiltered literary thought experiments. "What's in a name?" asks the rat thing. "What good are names in your deranged and coal-gray limerick, where all is bound to die in flames?" 
</p>
<p>
I've now found a place to sit on the train, but still, Centum is a difficult game to write about on the tube. People keep looking over my shoulder and seeing the wailing cosmic cube and moving to the other side of the carriage. We pass through Kings Cross. Yet more children get on. Six squalling teenagers surround me, kicking my bag and jostling my elbows with scant regard for my expression of vast concentration. Three of them try to sit on the same chair, stacking themselves like Goombas. 
</p>
<p>
They're speaking French. Probably they're on an exchange visit? Do they read English? Are they reading these very words as I type them? Où est la clé de la prison? A hush settles upon the Gallic throng as they catch sight of the above screenshot of the talking rat-thing. I flip hurriedly through my folder in search of one that doesn't contain any images of rodents or other unpleasantries that might irreversibly damage the flower of French youth. Here you go, how about this shot of a smiling chatbot. Pretty sure that's PG-13 or below. Centum seems to hinge on repeated trips between the jail simulation and the opening desktop interface - clues found in the cell can be fed into various software so as to expose possibilities in the simulated world.
</p>

<p>
To reword the quote above: "The sky is dead. The gods are dead. Les enfants m'ennuient. Oh hell, I've missed my stop". Centum is an extremely gloomy point-and-clicker with disgustingly rich pixelart that doesn't feel worlds away from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pony-island">Pony Island</a>, though it's more verbose and less (obviously) comedical. I suspect the high-handed writing will turn a few people off, but I'm looking forward to playing the full thing. At home.

        <p>Microsoft is now legally bound to take a neutral approach to the unionisation of employees at ZeniMax</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>ZeniMax Studios workers are now covered by Microsoft's labour neutrality agreement with the Communications Workers of America.</p>
<p>The CWA  announced yesterday that, as a result, all ZeniMax staff can now make their choice about collective bargaining, with Microsoft legally bound to take a neutral approach to the unionisation of its staff.</p>
<p>ZeniMax Workers United-CWA member Page Branson commented: "Thousands of our ZeniMax co-workers now have a free and fair path to organise together for better working conditions. When we organised our union under a similar legal agreement the process was clear and management did not try to influence anyone’s decision and the company did not try to interfere with the voting process.</p>
<p>"There is strength in numbers, and as our numbers grow at ZeniMax, at Microsoft, and in the video game industry, we will gain the respect we deserve and raise the standards of working conditions for everyone across the video gaming industry. When we benefit, the consumer and the company will ultimately benefit with us and help keep this industry stable for current and future workers."</p>
<p>This news comes <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-reportedly-shutting-down-four-bethesda-studios">less than a month after Microsoft closed four ZeniMax-owned studios</a>, including US-based Arkane Austin.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-and-cwa-enter-labor-neutrality-agreement">Microsoft and CWA entered a labour neutrality agreement in July 2022</a> as the Activision Blizzard acquisition was pending. Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-reiterates-labour-neutrality-agreement-following-abk-acquisition">reiterated its commitment after the deal closed</a>, saying in October 2023 that it remained "steadfast in [its] support of current and future employees in whatever choice they make about their workplace and their representatives."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zenimax-qa-workers-form-union">Zenimax QA workers unionised in January 2023</a>, with a majority of 300 QA developers across Zenimax's US operations voting in favour of the creation of Zenimax Workers United.</p>

            <p>
Redfall's final ever update has been released, marking an end to Arkane Austin's work on the game - and indeed the now-shuttered studio's work in general.
</p>
<p>
Known as version 1.451.3.0 - a nod to video games' ongoing 0-4-5-1 easter egg, which dates back almost 30 years - this update adds features such as an offline mode and single player pausing, among others.
</p>
<p>
While these features have long been sought after - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/redfall-developer-working-to-u-turn-on-single-player-always-online-restriction">long promised</a>, it is a bittersweet moment. This marks the end of the game's development, roughly two years after it first released.

<p>
Redfall co-director <a href="https://x.com/Harvey1966/status/1796203861448983007">Harvey Smith</a> said this patch culminates months of work by the whole team, adding there had been a "Herculean effort by all involved" over recent weeks especially. "Have fun, always," the developer closed.
</p>
<p>
Resharing Smith's post, Arkane Lyon boss <a href="https://x.com/DBakaba/status/1796207388082471190">Dinga Bakaba</a> congratulated his former colleagues, acknowledging how much work had been put into the game. "Time to bite the fuck back!!!" Bakaba wrote. "I know how hard you all work on this and how much it matters to you all to let fans experience this version of the game, and as one of them, I can't wait to get my hands on it!!!"

The industry was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arkane-lyon-boss-leads-widespread-condemnation-of-bethesda-closures">quick to condemn Microsoft for its decision to shutter these Bethesda studios</a>, with Bakaba calling it a "a fucking gut stab".

            <p>
The New York Times, owner of Wordle, is suing a one-man geography-guessing alternative project named Worldle. 
</p>
<p>
Hit puzzle game Wordle was the work of British designer Josh Wardle, until it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-york-times-buys-puzzle-game-phenomenon-wordle-for-seven-figure-sum">bought by The New York Times in 2022 for a seven-figure sum</a>. It's now operated as part of The New York Times' growing games portfolio and is played by millions daily. 
</p>
<p>
The browser-based <a href="https://worldledaily.com/">Worldle</a>, meanwhile, was built and is still run by one man - Seattle-based Kory McDonald, and has around 100,000 players each month.

<p>
In a legal filing seen by the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cjrr5ee5zv8o">BBC</a>, The New York Times accuses McDonald of "creating confusion" and taking advantage of "the enormous goodwill" of Wordle for his own project. 
</p>
<p>
McDonald, speaking with the BBC, said in response that there was "a whole industry" of games with similar names.
</p>
<p>
"I'm just a one-man operation here, so I was kinda surprised," he said. "Worst-case scenario, we'll change the name, but I think we'll be okay."
</p>
<p>
Other games similar to Wordle include Flaggle for flags, Lewdle for rude words, Headle for music and Murdle for a mix of Wordle and hangman. But there are hundreds of others. 
</p>
<p>
In March, The New York Times issued a takedown notice to Reactle, a Wordle clone and code repository, which meant around 1900 other versions of the game were also taken down.
</p>
<p>
Last year, the newspaper <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-york-times-responds-to-only-connect-resemblance">shook off claims its Connections game bore a close resemblence to BBC Quiz show Only Connect</a>.

            <p>My PC has a big white case, and sometimes, I sit and think: “big white box good!” But other times, I glance over to my PS5 and think: “other big white box also good!” Then I start getting fanciful and imagine a lovely future where they can both combine into one. Keeping track of two big white boxes is hard! Luckily, I only have to write about one of those big white boxes for RPS the vast majority of the time. Today is one of the rare occasions I do have to cover both, so here’s everything announced at yesterday’s Playstation State Of Play that you, the discerning big white box owner, might find relevant:</p>

Sony have dropped a trailer and release date for Concord at their latest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-concord-and-more-everything-pc-relevant-announced-at-playstation-state-of-play-may-2024">State Of Play</a>, Concord being a new 5V5 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> in which you play a bunch of freegans carrying out heists on various loudly coloured alien planets. Sorry, not freegans - freegunners. Freeganism is a portmanteau of "free" and "vegan" referring to people who fish jars of near-spoiled hummus out of supermarket dumpsters according to an ideology of minimal resource consumption. Freegunners, meanwhile, are lairy Guardians Of The Galaxy-alike mercenaries with phat guns and playstyle-defining secondary abilities. They do not consume hummus as far as I know. The game is out 23rd August 2024, with a beta happening in July, and I've got an overview trailer for you below.

Concord was announced a year ago, and is the work of Washington-based Firewalk. They were originally part of ProbablyMonsters, and were already working on Concord before Sony acquired them fully. The game is very much trying to be one of those sociable moshpit affairs where a brace of different tactics and readily role-playable hero characterisations give rise to a rich spread of watercooler anecdotes. Even as I type these words, I realise that I have never offered or heard a watercooler anecdote. No watercoolers out here in darkest Watford. Our anecdotes are all whispered between the aisles of Budgens, with one eye peeled for CCTV cameras, or scrawled on leaves and tossed into the ditches beside the M1.
</p>
<p>You will, of course, need a PlayStation Network account to play, as you will if you're playing<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-heads-to-pc-with-dlss-ultrawide-support-and-a-psn-requirement-for-some-reason"> the just-announced Steam version of God Of War Ragnarök on PC</a>. Here's our former EIC Katharine's (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-stop-it-with-all-the-bland-new-multiplayer-shooters-that-will-die-in-six-months">announcement post about Concord and various other new shooters at last May's State Of Play showcase</a>. She was none too pleased with it, noting the overabundance of "bland new multiplayer shooters" and commenting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I was all ready to love this sci-fi whateveritis with its weird space burgers, detailed ship innards and enigmatic blinking lights. But oh no. The PlayStation Blog post for it revealed the sad truth. It tells us it's "a bringing together of peoples", that each log on will bring you "a new adventure" and every match "is an opportunity for a new story". 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Gosh, that Katharine certainly was a live one.
</p>
<p>
Preorders for Concord start on 6th June, unlocking beta access for you and four friends in July. There are 16 characters in total, encompassing a familiar spread of tanks and DPS and support. You've got chonky sentinels who can deploy force barricades, mystics who can glide and cast fire walls, and diving assault-types who can use infra to shoot through their own smokescreens. I'm not seeking anything as funky as a Tracer Blink combo or a rolling robo-hamsterball, but it looks like there's some variety, and the visuals and animations are snappy. We can expect weekly cinematic vignettes to introduce each character. Speaking of which, here's a story trailer to close us out.

            <p>Per last night’s Sony State of Play, PS5 darling and supposedly rather good <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a>-dad adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a> is coming to PC on September 19th 2024. The good news is that the port, co-developed by Jetpack Interactive and original makers Santa Monica Studio, will pack in all the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dlss-3-how-it-works-how-it-performs-and-when-you-should-use-it">DLSS 3</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amd-fsr-3-demystified-how-the-next-gen-upscaler-could-upgrade-performance-on-any-gpu">FSR 3</a>, and ultrawide what-have-yous that one might expect from a big, monied PC release. The bad, silly, clearly pointless news is that it will need a PlayStation Network (PSN) account, despite the complete lack of multiplayer.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That’s according to Ragnarök’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2322010/God_of_War_Ragnark/">Steam page</a>, which warns of the looming PSN demand (as does that of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2172010/Until_Dawn/">Until Dawn</a>, another incoming Windows port that’s being slapped with the added login requirement). Sony’s push to insert PSN into (upon?) their PC games became infamous when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> players revolted, ultimately forcing the publisher to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-drops-psn-account-linking-requirement-for-steam-players-after-widespread-backlash">abandon the requirement</a>. However, the more recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut">Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut</a> launched with PSN fully baked in, despite it making <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghost-of-tsushima-runs-well-on-steam-deck-making-its-psn-nonsense-all-the-more-annoying">co-op impossible to play on the Steam Deck</a>.</p>

<p>It’s worth repeating that PSN’s problems extend beyond the inconvenience of forcing yet another login process, or the compatibility of a single type of handheld device. Because the service itself is only available in a minority of countries, there are over 170 nations where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-no-longer-available-on-steam-in-almost-180-countries-due-to-psn-requirement">PSN-reliant games are struck off sale by Steam</a>, rendering them unplayable by legal means. That means the likes of Japan, the British and US Virgin Islands, Vietnam, Pakistan, and most of Africa are all locked out, and while Sony’s justification for Ghost of Tsushima amounted to PSN enabling PC/PlayStation crossplay, that doesn’t explain why it’s a requirement for purely solo games like God of War Ragnarök and Until Dawn.</p>
<p>The most likely reasoning, mind, isn’t hard to figure out. Any increase in PSN signups will simultaneously furnish Sony with valuable user data <em>and</em> make some number in a spreadsheet somewhere go higher, which in turn convinces a man in a suit that their service is excellent and beloved even as it does literally nothing to actually serve the person using it. Urgh.</p>
<p>Otherwise, God of War Ragnarök at least looks like a considered PC port, and will include its roguelike-flavoured Valhalla DLC as standard. You might note that this launch comes just under two years after the godkilling hackslasher’s original PS5 launch, suggesting that Sony are furthering tightening the period for which it leaves the console exclusives as console exclusives. Though if all their future ports are going to be leaden with PSN requirements, then that’s probably not as exciting a development.</p>

			<p>Where Winds Meet, the upcoming Wuxia-inspired RPG from Everstone Studio, is also coming to PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Sony and Everstone producer Beralt Lyu <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/30/where-winds-meet-brings-superhuman-open-world-martial-arts-adventure-to-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> the arrival on PS5 during Sony's PlayStation State of Play broadcast overnight. Initially <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-is-a-wuxia-open-world-sandbox-rpg-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> as a PC exclusive, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuxia-open-world-game-where-winds-meet-starts-first-closed-beta-test-in-two-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received a closed beta for US players recently</a>. The game is set during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period in imperial China from 907 to 979. The title is said to offer a vast and seamless open world with richly filled different regions. "Where Winds Meet has an oriental martial arts theme, and we attach great importance to the presentation of martial arts (Wuxia) elements in the game", producer Lyu explains. "Weapons are an important part of the player’s combat ability. We try to restore a variety of unique weapons in Wuxia martial arts in the game such as Spear, Sword, Fan, Dual Blades, Umbrella, and Glaive."</p>
<p>On PS5, the title will be optimized for the PS5 DualSense controller to further enhance immersion.</p>
<p>We've included the trailer that was shown during Sony's event below:</p>

<p>Shortly after the game's announcement in 2022, we interviewed the game's development team. This interview contains plenty of details about the upcoming title. Be sure to <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-qa-devs-reveal-tons-of-info-on-this-exciting-wuxia-sandbox-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read it in full here</a>. We've included a short part of the interview below:</p>
<p><em><strong>How big is the playable world in the game? How long does it take to get from one end to another of the map?</strong></em></p>
<p><em>We expect the first version to have more than 20 square kilometers (5K * 5K), but we are constantly adjusting this according to the content. As the world of this game has a 3D structure, there is an underground space and altitude. The game will continue to be updated and expanded in the future. The first version will feature a large city, Bianjing City, a large wild area, and small towns.</em></p>
<p>Where Winds Meet has yet to receive a release date on PS5 and PC. We'll update you as soon as more information comes in on this exciting new title.</p>

			<p>Bungie has announced a new Destiny 2 collaboration with Wizards of the Coast's Dungeons &amp; Dragons franchise. As a celebration for D&amp;D's 50th anniversary, starting on June 4 (release day of The Final Shape expansion), Destiny 2 players will find three&nbsp;Faerûn-inspired skins in the Eververse store: the Gold Dragon-themed Apex Draconic set for Titans, the Mind Flayers-themed Flayer’s Dominion set for Warlocks, and the Displacer Beast’s-themed Spectral Displacer set for Hunters.</p>
<p>You can check them out in the brief video embedded below.</p>
<p>Additional cosmetic items available for purchase include the Adventurer’s Pack Bundle, which comes with a Queen of Dragons ship, the Owlbear Chariot, and the Eye Tyrant Ghost Shell. There's also a Bigby’s Fist Finisher and a Natural 20 Emote, which will be randomly rolled each time it is used. Out of the game, the Bungie Store will also offer an Eye Tyrant Beholder Ghost Shell vinyl figure inspired by the infamous floating gaze monster from the D&amp;D universe.</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny 2: The Final Shape | Dungeons &amp; Dragons x Destiny" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hDdeAYUpG1o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is only the latest D&amp;D 50th anniversary cross-over, following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-by-daylight-d-and-d-castlevania-2v8-project-t-what-the-fog-spinoff-shadow-drop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dead by Daylight one</a> that goes live on June 3. Destiny 2 is also very used to cross-overs, having previously hosted <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-gets-the-witcher-themed-cosmetics-with-next-weeks-season-of-the-wish/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Witcher</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-destin-2-crossover-free-and-paid-cosmetics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mass Effect</a> in the past few months.</p>
<p>Of course, fans of the game are mostly focused on the imminent launch of the next expansion, which will finally bring the current storyline to an end.</p>
<p><em>Guardians will enter the Traveler in an epic showdown to stop the Witness from calcifying all reality into a nightmarish shape of its twisted design. Players will join the Vanguard and Cayde-6 to journey through The Pale Heart and take on the Witness’s army. Guardians will battle new enemies, traverse surreal landscapes, and use Prismatic powers that blend Light and Darkness.</em></p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-gets-launch-trailer-ahead-of-next-weeks-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch trailer</a> of The Final Shape from earlier this week, in case you missed it.</p>

The actor says that when developing 2005’s Shadow the Hedgehog, Sega was, at one point, shooting for a “Mature” rating with the ESRB and asked him to record different versions for many of Shadow’s lines. Griffith says that in these M-rated takes, “they had me say f*** in every single line.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"There’s a hard drive somewhere with hours of recordings of Shadow yelling f*** at Tails and Sonic and stuff."</p></div><p>"It was just every sentence, I would be yelling ‘Sonic, give me that f***ing Chaos Emerald!’ or something like that," Griffith added. "I had no idea what was going on but I just went with it, and I had fun. There’s a hard drive somewhere with hours of recordings of Shadow yelling f*** at Tails and Sonic and stuff."</p><p>Sega typically keeps curse words out of its anthropomorphic mascots’ mouths. Sonic is a series suited for children with one major exception: Shadow the Hedgehog. The spinoff game sees Sonic’s edgy other half using a variety of firearms as players navigate a choose-your-own-adventure-style campaign. It’s a darker take on the Sonic universe that even sees Shadow saying things like “damn” just before threatening to send Eggman to “hell.” It’s a lot, but apparently the ambivalent hedgehog almost used some other choice words, too.</p><p>Alas, Shadow the Hedgehog wound up with an E10+ rating when it eventually launched for Nintendo GameCube, PlayStation 2, and Xbox. This is the first we’re hearing of Shadow’s more colorful vocabulary, and it’s unclear if those recordings are truly out there somewhere or if they will ever see the light of day.</p><p>IGN has asked Sega for comment.</p><p>Shadow is having quite the moment, as Sega has gone as far as to dub 2024 the “year of Shadow.” The character, who first appeared in <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/sonic-adventure-2">Sonic Adventure 2</a> on the Dreamcast, is getting the spotlight in more ways than one. He’ll make his theatrical debut in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-release-date-cast-story-trailer-details"><u>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</u></a> (with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-voice-casting">voicework from Keanu Reeves</a>) when it premieres later this year. There’s also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-announced-for-this-fall-state-of-play-2024"><u>Sonic x Shadow Generations</u></a>, a remaster featuring extra red-and-black-hedgehog-themed content that is set to release this fall.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Meanwhile, we didn’t love Shadow’s standalone game when it first released in 2005. We called it “bad” in our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/11/18/shadow-the-hedgehog"><u>4.7 review</u></a>, saying that its speedy gameplay “doesn’t make up for the game's long list of shortcomings, from stupid level design, unrefined controls and useless gunplay to disappointingly outdated graphics.”</p><p><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

        <p>Spokesperson says council will continue, but will be made up of Twitch ambassadors</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Twitch is reportedly terminating all members of its Safety Advisory Council team.</p>
<p>According to an email seen by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/30/twitch-ends-contracts-for-its-safety-advisory-council-sac-trust-safety.html">CNBC</a>, staff were allegedly told their contracts would end today and that they would not receive payment for the second half of the year per an internal agreement.</p>
<p>A spokesperson told CNBC that the Safety Advisory Council will continue, but will be "primarily made up of individuals who serve as Twitch ambassadors" who will "offer fresh, diverse perspectives."</p>
<p><em>GamesIndustry.biz </em>has reached out to Twitch for further clarification.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/twitch-unveils-new-safety-advisory-council">Twitch's Safety Advisory Council formed in 2020</a>, and was originally made up of nine online safety experts and Twitch partners to consult on drafting new policies and updating current ones, in addition to creating new products and protecting marginalised groups.</p>
