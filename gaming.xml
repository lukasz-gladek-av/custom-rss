<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/22/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review/">Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail Review</a></h2>
<p>Now could be a good time to get into Final Fantasy XIV, as in our Dawntrail review, Miguel said, <em>“Although it admittedly doesn’t quite hit the heights of Shadowbringers, Dawntrail’s shift in narrative focus injects a vibrancy into Final Fantasy XIV with this more lighthearted romp, while still keeping track of a greater story. With an increase in challenge of the instances, a couple of excellent new Jobs, an introduction of new characters, and the development of existing ones, Dawntrail clearly shows there’s life after averting the end of the world and I – for one – wouldn’t change a damn thing.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/legend-of-vox-machina-season-3-review-darker-season-of-dd-twists<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Vox Machina has achieved a great victory with the death of Umbrasyl at the end of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8fba9665-9011-4fc8-bf7e-3873de998554" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/legend-of-vox-machina-season-2-review"><em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em> Season 2,</a> but just because they won the battle doesn't mean they've won the war. As Season 3 picks up we see Vox Machina go through some of their most troubling times as they continue to wage a war against dragons, as well as open themselves up to love and betrayal.</p>
<p>If you're interested in learning even more about <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a49b5305-f71e-4b04-a989-6db6823aa8cc" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/critical-role-and-legend-of-vox-machina-s3-cast-discuss-changing-story">The Legend of Vox Machina Season 3 be sure to check out our interview with the entire cast</a> where we discussed how they approached alterations to the plot, what it was like revisiting budding relationships in the recording booth, and a small update on The Mighty Nein.</p>
<p>Much like how Season 2 exploded into action so does Season 3, picking up in the middle of an action setpiece, our heroes attempting to make a hasty escape from a powerful foe before flashing back to the tense conversation we left off with from the end of Season 2.</p>
<h2>Vox Machina Vs The Chroma Conclave</h2>
<p>It's a quick and simple way to draw the viewers attention and get them excited for Vox Machina to swing into action, it also does an excellent job demonstrating just how out of their depths Vox Machina still is in the upward battle.</p>
<p>The main goals for this season are to obtain the rest of the Vestiges of Divergence, powerful artifacts that were created during the time of the Calamity. Obtaining as many of these objects is necessary to complete the larger goal, defeating the draconic cult known as The Chroma Conclave.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-thordak.jpg?itok=Ju25v9vI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-thordak.jpg?itok=02N2J26h 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>These adventures are played out as a number of split missions where we follow a few of the team at a time encountering a new challenge to overcome to obatin a vestige. These overlapping story beats do a fantastic job of continuously leading the viewer on and keeping them out of step from one another.</p>
<p>By the time one plot point has been resolved another has been set up and is nearing completion. This allows the pace to always remain consistently high keeping you actively engaged. In many ways the plot delivery structure remains faithful to a traditional Dungeons &amp; Dragons-style story, seeding information to players while they seek out other story avenues.</p>
<p>At all times <em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em> feels like it's speedrunning to the end of it's own story. While this is in part due to the 12 episode limit it also makes sense from a plot perspective as they're trying to condense what was 100+ hours worth of Actual Play content into four hours of concise and entertaining story. While I'll always wish there were more seasons, I can also understand why it feels so rapidly paced.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-vm-in-hell_0.jpg?itok=R6C3f1Q8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-vm-in-hell_0.jpg?itok=cHDi7jRa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Plot Variations</h2>
<p>Season 3 has also stepped even further off the well worn path as it continues to rearrange key plot points for narrative purposes or even create entirely new scenarios.</p>
<p>Of the major changes that I noticed I was happy with all of them, one even had me calling out to my TV in disbelief. There may be many who will view some of these changes with disdain or questioning as to why they didn't stick with the original idea, I think with what they know now and with a further 10 years of roleplaying completed (including 30 years of in-universe history being fleshed out) it's great to see the interweaving of these additional plots, seeding these ideas for future seasons, shows, and spin-offs.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-jaamon-saord.jpg?itok=Y-GXhjRF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-jaamon-saord.jpg?itok=fyq5IGyT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Tonal Shift</h2>
<p>Something that all viewers will notice about this season is just how much more mature the tone of the show is. Facing serious threats also comes with grave consequences as Vox Machina experiences grief and loss in a way that they only grazed against in previous seasons.</p>
<p>It's not just about the loud moments that the group can share, but the quiet and lonely moments that will sit with you long after the season has wrapped up.</p>
<p>The added seriousness isn't just from the dark moments though, as relationships among the party grow stronger we get to see two very earnest takes on companionship while the threat of impending doom looms on the horizon. For Vax and Keyleth, there is fear in what they could lose leading to hesitancy to get involved, while Percy and Vex are seeking out a relationship to experience it before they lose the chance to.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-vex-and-percy_0.jpg?itok=W17-JBSz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-vex-and-percy_0.jpg?itok=HQ5-Auql 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Just because there is a much more serious tone doesn't mean that there isn't a place for slapstick humor, crass jokes, or raunchy musical numbers. There is still a lot of those kinds of moments inbetween the epic set pieces and atmospheric battles.</p>
<p>If anything, how dark the rest of the season gets makes those moments of fun and laughter even more important.</p>
<h2>Critical Role Fan's Delight</h2>
<p>This season is jam-packed with a number of 'blink and you'll miss it' references to people and places in the world of Exandria that we might see in the future, and even an amazing musical interlude dedicated to Jester Lavorre's mother from a bard in the back of a bar.</p>
<p>For fans of Vox Machina and the extended Critical Role story every episode will have you smiling or leading forward doing the Leo Pointing Meme.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-matt-mercer-cameo_0.jpg?itok=ljj3Ljre 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vox-machina-season-3-matt-mercer-cameo_0.jpg?itok=Wk5vMpRl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Thankfully none of these references are ever pulling a viewer away from the story, and with so many it will take a few rewatches before you could confidently say you've seen everything that the show has to over.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em> Season 3 Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p><em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em> has had another successful season and with it they've been able to improve across the board. This season has managed to show character development across the board, not just as we previously new it but with added depth as each character's journey has had the chance for an additional writing take.</p>
<p>On top of character development the show has also managed to steer into a darker and more serious space without losing a lot of the charm of the original 'bumbling' adventures that we saw most predominantly through Season 1.</p>
<p><em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em>, Critical Role, and Titmouse have me excited for the continued adventures of Vox Machina, anticipating reliving the journeys of the Mighty Nein, and keep me hopeful to see other epic events from the annals of Exandria such as Calamity or Downfall animated.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-silent-hill-2-remake-music<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has released almost 100 minutes of&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake music to tide you over until the game's release on PC and PS5 next week.</p>
<p>In two YouTube videos uploaded earlier today, Konami provides a preview of the entire&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>soundtrack, which will be released on November 20th (once you've had a chance to get to grips with the game).</p>
<p>Additionally, the Extra Edition of the game's soundtrack, which features a number of extra compositions, has also been made available to listen to. It's not clear whether these videos will remain available indefinitely, but I'd assume not, so get listening while you can.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-konami-music-preview-toluca-lake.jpg?itok=3kHA9fS5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-konami-music-preview-toluca-lake.jpg?itok=Ofuq8fB0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake is imminent, and you can listen to its soundtrack ahead of its release.</figcaption></figure><p>Just like the original game's music, the remake's soundtrack was created by longtime&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>composer Akira Yamaoka, as were the additional tracks on the Extra Edition of the soundtrack.</p>
<p>As such, a lot of the new game's compositions will probably sound familiar to you if you're a&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>aficionado, although they've been given a more modern flavor by Yamaoka.</p>
<p>Here's the first soundtrack video, which features around 50 minutes of music.</p>

<p>Here's the Extra Edition soundtrack, which has a number of additional compositions for you to listen to. You can think of it as lo-fi horror beats to dissociate to.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake was first announced back in 2022 as part of that October's&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-and-more-all-but-confirmed">Transmission event</a>. It's being developed by&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/medium">The Medium</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Layers of Fear&nbsp;</em>studio Bloober Team.</p>
<p>While the remake will retain the same story elements and outline as the original, it'll shift the action to a third-person over-the-shoulder perspective of the kind favored by more recent&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>remakes.</p>
<p>You'll be able to grab&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124490/SILENT_HILL_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/silent-hill-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> when it launches on October 8th. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assetto-corsa-evo-early-access-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Kunos Simulazioni and publisher 505 Games have announced the&nbsp;<em>Assetto Corsa Evo&nbsp;</em>Early Access release date, and the hyper-realistic racing sim is landing on Steam Early Access in just a couple of months.</p>
<p>Per an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3058630/view/4677641107702845653" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official announcement on Steam</a>,&nbsp;<em>Assetto Corsa Evo&nbsp;</em>launches on January 16th, and in a press release, the two studios say that the game "represents a major leap forward" for the&nbsp;<em>Assetto Corsa&nbsp;</em>franchise.</p>
<p>The game was first mooted back in 2021, when it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodstained-2-and-assetto-corsa-2-confirmed">revealed to be in development</a> alongside a sequel to Koji Igarashi's Metroidvania&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</em>. Sadly, there's still no news on the latter front.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assetto-corsa-evo-release-date-lamborghini-steering-wheel.jpg?itok=Ieyjlrgs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assetto-corsa-evo-release-date-lamborghini-steering-wheel.jpg?itok=deCSkThc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Assetto Corsa Evo&nbsp;</em>is very much placing an emphasis on realism.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the aforementioned press release, Kunos Simulazioni has created a "new proprietary engine" for&nbsp;<em>Assetto Corsa Evo</em>, one that can reproduce real-world vehicles and simulate their "mechanical, electronic, and aerodynamic performance".</p>
<p>This, the developer says, will raise the bar of realism "even higher than&nbsp;<em>Assetto Corsa</em>", which it says is "arguably one of the most popular driving simulations of the last decade".</p>
<p>The new game will introduce several new features and gameplay modes, all of which are made possible by the new engine. It sounds like you'll be hearing from this engine again after the release of&nbsp;<em>Assetto Corsa Evo</em>.</p>
<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Evo&nbsp;</em>will support "a full 24-hour race cycle", as well as "cutting-edge lighting" and "dynamic weather and track conditions". Of course, you can also expect pin-sharp visuals to complement all of these features.</p>

<p>Kunos Simulazioni and 505 Games don't give any kind of indication regarding exactly how long they expect&nbsp;<em>Assetto Corsa Evo&nbsp;</em>to remain in Early Access, but Kunos co-founder Marco Massarutto says his studio believes in "taking the time to get things just right".</p>
<p><em>Assetto Corsa Evo&nbsp;</em>launches on PC via Steam Early Access on January 16th. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3058630/Assetto_Corsa_EVO/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wishlist the game here</a> ahead of its launch if you'd like.</p>

And it included a few interesting details about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24055773/death-stranding-2-ps5-trailer-2025">the weird-as-hell sequel</a>, which the developer has helpfully split up into a series of clips in lieu of a traditional trailer. They feature some of the new characters joining the cast, some dialogue that makes little sense out of context, as well as what looks like a completely ridiculous photo mode to play around with.</p><p>The first includes some returning faces played by Norman Reedus and Léa Leydoux, and also provides a proper introduction to one of the stranger elements of <em>DS2</em>: a physic medium who has been turned into a marionette, who is obviously known as Dollman:</p><p>Next up we have two of the characters director Hideo Kojima has been teasing for some time, with Rainy played by Shioli Kutsuna and Elle Fanning as Tomorrow. (If you’ve played <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20941606/death-stranding-review-ps4-hideo-kojima">the original <em>Death Stranding</em></a>, or really any Kojima games, those names are actually pretty normal.) It includes an unexpected sing-a-long:</p><p>Then there’s a short clip of Heartman doing some math and also collecting his own tears:</p><p>Those all provide a decent sense of the oddball world players will be exploring, even if it’s still pretty unclear what <em>Death Stranding 2</em> is actually about. But this next clip shows off how the photo mode works, and honestly it looks pretty fun, with the ability to snap pics with lots of characters doing lots of poses.

<p>Tony Hawk has continued to talk about the future of the Pro Skater franchise and games. </p>



<p>It was known that Hawk was talking to Activision about the series as it celebrated its 25th anniversary. Now, 25 years to the day that the first Tony Hawk Pro Skater game was released, Hawk has <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DAgXDa1PI8a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">taken to Instagram</a> to reminisce and, once again, tease what could be coming. </p>



<p>“My intention and expectation for the game was mostly for the enjoyment of skateboarders,” Hawk said in his post. “I had no idea it would transcend a niche market to become a massive success and – as some have argued – change the course of skateboarding’s popularity (and possibly even skate trick evolution). It definitely changed the course of my life…”</p>



<p>He then closed by saying, “I’m not supposed to tease anything else about the future of the series, but there will be a future.”</p>

</div></figure>



<p>What that future is remains to be seen. Will it be the Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 &amp; 4 Remake that was in development by Vicarious Visions but then cancelled when the studio was merged into Activision? Has it been quietly revived? Or, could it be a brand new Tony Hawk game altogether? </p>



<p>Earlier in September, Hawk <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tony-hawk-is-talking-to-activision-about-tony-hawk-pro-skater-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed that he was talking</a> to Activision again, but didn’t give much away.</p>



<p>“I wish I could tell you more,” Hawk said at the  time. “But I can tell you that I’ve been talking to Activision again which is insanely exciting. We’re working on something.”</p>



<p>Do you think there will be a new Tony Hawk Pro Skater game in the near future? Join the discussion in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/619/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

<p>"Due to some unforeseen circumstances, we cannot announce it today," he said. The developer did not elaborate as to what those circumstances might be.</p><p>Kojima is good friends with Geoff Keighley, who runs The Game Awards each December. Some had speculated that Kojima could reveal the game's release date there, but it seems that won't be the case, though of course plans can always change. The game was previously announced for a 2025 release.</p><p>Death Stranding 2 will be exclusive on console to PlayStation, as part of Kojima's partnership with the company. In addition to Death Stranding 2, Kojima productions is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-teases-death-stranding-movie-and-his-movie-ambitions/1100-6526782/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter/" data-ref-id="1100-6526782">working on a Death Stranding movie with A24</a>, along with multiple other games, including the Xbox-exclusive <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/od/" data-ref-id="5000-612205">OD</a> and the espionage game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/physint/" data-ref-id="5000-617596">Physint</a>.</p><p>The original Death Stranding came out in 2019 and was polarizing. It is a strange journey into extinction anchored by the performances of Hollywood stars such as Norman Reedus and Mads Mikkelsen, among others. The sequel, much like the first game, looks unique and odd. You can check out the newest gameplay footage in the video above.</p>

		<p>In October, you will need to jump to the left and then take a step to the right. Well many steps to the right and jumps in all directions, as FreakZone Games has announced The Rocky Horror Show Video Game, which is coming in the form on a retro platformer with the iconic songs from The Rocky Horror Picture Show redone as 8 bit chiptunes.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Rocky Horror Video Game Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nqwqOLSe_d8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Going by the trailer, you will play as Brad, Janet, and Dr Scott as the navigate through various trap filled levels as they try to escape from the castle of &nbsp;Dr. Frank N. Furter and his muscle man Rocky, hailing from the planet Transsexual in the galaxy of Transylvania.</p>
<p>This is not the first time The Rocky Horror Show has been adapted into videogame form, with the very first adaptation happening nearly 40 years ago in 1985. That version was developed by CRL Group for the Amstrad CPC, Apple II, Commodore 64, Commodore 128, and the ZX Spectrum. In that game, players took control of Brad and Janet to find pieces of the Medusa machine while trying to avoid the inhabitants of the castle. It was then remade for PC in 1999 as The Rocky Horror Interactive Show, becoming a point and click adventure.</p>

<p>The Rocky Horror Show Video Game is set to be released for PS5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC via Steam, and Switch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-delayed-rollback-netcode<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arc System Works has announced a&nbsp;<em>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact&nbsp;</em>delay, but it's not for the usual "adding extra polish" reasons; rather, it's for something about which the fighting game community will doubtless be pleased.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/ArcSystemWorksU/status/1840633550695231793" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Arc System Works says <i>Nen x Impact&nbsp;</i>has been delayed beyond 2024, and that it will now release sometime in 2025, with no more specific release date forthcoming right now.</p>
<p>The delay has been put into effect so that the publisher, as well as developer Eighting, can implement rollback netcode into the game. It's a feature that has appeared in other Arc System Works games, so its inclusion here makes sense as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-delayed-fight.jpg?itok=G5K3xq8f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-delayed-fight.jpg?itok=xUz3N5qd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact&nbsp;</em>may have been delayed, but it's for a good reason.</figcaption></figure><p>In case you're unfamiliar, rollback netcode is essentially a way by which developers minimize lag and bad connections in online fighting games.</p>
<p>I won't go into the technicalities here, but suffice it to say that fighting games with rollback netcode are generally better-appreciated by their communities than those without. There's a good reason the&nbsp;<em>Super Smash Bros&nbsp;</em>community <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/smash-ultimate-rollback-netcode-mod-in-development">wanted to work on a rollback mod</a> for the game.</p>
<p>Fighting games that have embraced rollback netcode include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-fighterz-rollback-netcode-and-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-versions-coming-very"><em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/guilty-gear-xrd-rev-2-rollback-netcode-confirmed"><em>Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blazblue-cross-tag-battle-rollback-netcode-coming-in-april"><em>BlazBlue: Cross Tag Battle</em></a>, all of which were developed or co-developed by Arc System Works itself.</p>
<p>Other rollback netcode converts that aren't Arc System Works games include&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/street-fighter-6-rollback-netcode-will-be-better-open-worlds-detailed">Street Fighter 6</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/will-tekken-8-have-crossplay-and-rollback-netcode-katsuhiro-harada-responds"><em>Tekken 8</em></a>. It's clear, then, that rollback netcode is a big deal for the fighting game community.</p>

<p><em>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact&nbsp;</em>is, according to Arc System Works, the first "full-fledged" fighting game to be based on the popular anime and manga&nbsp;<em>Hunter x Hunter</em>.</p>
<p>It's a three-on-three fighter in which iconic characters from&nbsp;<em>Hunter x Hunter&nbsp;</em>duke it out with one another, and it'll be available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456420/HUNTERxHUNTER_NENxIMPACT/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10007325" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and Nintendo Switch sometime next year.

<p>Epic Games has filed a lawsuit against Google and Samsung for enabling the Auto Blocker feature by default and has alleged coordinated efforts to block competition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Epic Games is adding a new court case to its battle with Google during its return to Android devices.&nbsp;For context, to download and play games from the Epic Games Store on Android devices, players need to install it as a third-party application. It seems Samsung’s Auto Blocker feature is interfering with this process.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today we filed a lawsuit against Google and Samsung alleging that they illegally colluded to block competition by turning the Auto Blocker feature *on by default* on Samsung devices. This undermines the progress made to open up Android devices to competition.…</p>— Epic Games Newsroom (@EpicNewsroom) <a href="https://twitter.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1840708943103795453?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 30, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>The <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/filing-suit-against-google-and-samsung-for-illegally-colluding-to-block-competition-in-app-distribution-and-undermining-the-epic-v-google-jury-verdict" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> states that Samsung’s Auto Blocker is turned on by default, requiring users to follow a 21-step process to install the Epic Games Store on Samsung devices. Epic Games requests the court to stop Samsung and Google from engaging in anti-competitive and unfair practices and “mandate that Samsung eliminate the Auto Blocker by default and enable competition.”</p>



<p>Samsung’s Auto Blocker is a security feature that prevents the installation of applications from unauthorized sources and blocks malicious activity. It was introduced as an opt-in feature in 2023 and enabled by default in July 2024. </p>



<p>Epic Games has claimed that the Auto Blocker feature “undermines the jury’s unanimous decision in Epic v. Google, specifically that Google entered into one or more agreements that unreasonably restrained trade in a relevant antitrust market,” including “agreements with OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] that sell mobile devices.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-games-launches-lawsuit-against-google-and-samsung-over-mobile-auto-blocker.996177/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-google-samsung-lawsuit-mobile-blocker<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>studio Epic is suing Google and Samsung over a mechanism built into the latter's mobile devices constitutes what it calls "anti-competitive and unfair conduct".</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/epic-suing-google-and-samsung-over-auto-blockers-barrier-to-other-app-stores" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a> (which cites Epic's legal filing with the Northern District of California), Epic wants the courts to prevent Samsung enabling by default a feature called Auto Blocker on its phones and tablets.</p>
<p>In essence, this feature automatically prevents the installation of any app that isn't from the Google Play Store or Samsung's own App Store on Samsung mobile devices, and given Epic's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-games-defeats-google-in-jury-trial-over-app-store-monopoly-case">fury</a> regarding Apple and Google's so-called&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apple-rejects-move-to-restore-fortnite-ios-on-app-store">mobile duopoly</a>, you can probably guess how the company feels about that feature.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-suing-google-samsung-fortnite.jpg?itok=uubrAsFY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-suing-google-samsung-fortnite.jpg?itok=W4eHDV9W 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fortnite</em>'s Epic Games is suing Google and Samsung.</figcaption></figure><p>According to GI.biz, Samsung originally introduced the Auto Blocker feature to its devices in October last year, but the company began switching on the feature as default in July this year.</p>
<p>Epic says that in order to bypass Auto Blocker and download its mobile store on Android devices, Samsung users must embark on "an exceptionally onerous 21-step process", since the Auto Blocker describes Epic's mobile store as coming from an "unknown" source.</p>
<p>The gaming giant's argument is that Samsung's description of its apps as coming from "unknown" places harms its reputation and leads to "identifiable instances of users abandoning the installation of Epic apps".</p>
<p>Furthermore, Epic argues that Samsung and Google (the latter of which owns the Android operating system) being in partnership is in contravention of an antitrust ruling in December, wherein a judge found Google did indeed have what <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23994174/epic-google-trial-jury-verdict-monopoly-google-play">The Verge calls an "illegal monopoly"</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/samsung-phone-epic-games.jpg?itok=tS01cop9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/samsung-phone-epic-games.jpg?itok=WLTwZg9X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Samsung's phones come with a feature Epic does not like.</figcaption></figure><p>As a reminder, Epic has a storied history when it comes to challenging Google and Apple on letting users install apps from sources other than the Play Store or the App Store.</p>
<p>The company's fight with the two mobile giants goes back to 2020, when a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-slashes-up-to-20-off-purchases-on-all-platforms">sale on <em>Fortnite</em>'s V-Bucks</a>, which Epic attempted to use its own direct payment system to facilitate,&nbsp;prompted both <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-sues-google-over-fortnites-removal-from-play-store">Google</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-apple-store-version-removed-for-violating-app-store-guidelines">Apple</a> to remove the game from their stores.</p>
<p>Since then, Epic has been embroiled in protracted battles with both app store makers, although December's antitrust ruling, as well as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apple-to-reinstate-epic-games-ios-developer-account-paving-way-for-fortnites-return-to">reinstatement</a> of Epic's Apple developer account back in March and the subsequent reappearance of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>on that platform, bode well for the studio.</p>
<p>Whether or not Epic wins this battle against Samsung and Google remains to be seen, but it's not likely that the&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>developer will back down. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

The performance improvements and latency reductions arrive around a month after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220250/amd-zen-5-cpu-reviews-ryzen-9-9950x">disappointing Zen 5 desktop CPU reviews</a> and appear alongside <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/28/24230321/microsoft-windows-11-update-ryzen-cpu-performance-improvement">updates to Windows 11</a> that include optimized AMD-specific branch prediction for both Zen 4 and Zen 5 chips.</p><p>CPU reviewers have been reporting a higher-than-expected core-to-core latency across the Ryzen 9000-series of desktop processors, and now AMD has addressed this with a new BIOS optimization.</p><p>The latest AMD updates for AM5 motherboards include AGESA PI 1.2.0.2 firmware, which <a href="https://community.amd.com/t5/gaming/bg-p/gaming-blogs">AMD says</a> will address some “corner cases” where it takes two transactions to read and write when information is shared across different parts of a Ryzen 9 9000 processor. “We’ve managed to cut the number of transactions in half for this use case, which helps reduce core-to-core latency in multi-CCD models,” says AMD.</p><div><figcaption><em>AMD is promising a 10 percent uplift on the 9700X with its new 105-watt mode.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: AMD</cite></p></div><p>This BIOS update also includes a new 105-watt cTDP option to push the thermal design power of the Ryzen 9600X and 9700X. “These processors have been validated at 105W since their release, so you won’t be pushing them beyond their design limits,” says AMD. “This boost is especially beneficial for multithreaded workloads, but you might see some gains in less-threaded apps too.”</p><p>You’ll need to make sure you have appropriate cooling to enable the 105-watt mode, but AMD says it should result in around 10 percent more performance on the Ryzen 9600X and 9700X. This new mode won’t void your warranty, either.</p><p>AMD is also launching its next round of AM5 motherboards this week, with the X870 and X870E boards both available at retailers. You don’t need these new boards for AMD’s latest Ryzen 9000-series CPUs, but they do come with USB 4.0 as standard, and they also include PCIe 5 Gen 5 on the graphics and NVMe sides that can be used simultaneously. There are rumors that the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/26/24255234/nvidia-rtx-5090-5080-specs-leak">upcoming RTX 5090</a> will be a PCIe Gen 5 card, and AMD teases it’s “more important than ever now that we are on the cusp of a new generation of graphics cards” to have full PCIe Gen 5 support.</p><p>The X870 and X870E boards also include support for higher-clocked memory. AMD has now enabled DDR5-8000 EXPO support on these new boards, which includes around 1 to 2ns of latency improvements over DDR5-6000.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>While I’m all for building dread through a lingering introduction, it’s always a treat to play a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game that wastes no time tearing the moorings of familiarity right out from underneath you, as is the case with 13th Street Studios’ <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/becrowned">Becrowned</a>. In fact, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2266890/BECROWNED/">game’s demo</a> managed to make me go “oooh” than “ah!” in three different ways before I’d even exited the starting elevator. It also made me go “ugh” once, because I opted against tank controls, despite the suggestion to use them with mouse and keyboard. I come to you as disembodied voice, trapped between the worlds of video game inputs, with a dire plea: don’t do that. Just use tank controls. I’d restart but I’m already in too deep.</p>

<p>What a beaut, eh? There’s something about capturing the actual ambition of PSX-era visuals, and not just wallowing in its limitations for grunginess, that I find really endearing. There’s still a fair amount of grunginess, granted, but with some added creative flair that makes Becrowned’s setting feel like its own place, despite obviously evoking some genre classics. Also, I’m glad to see the Silent Hill 2 tradition of having you play as a premiere wanker haunted by his own wankery adopted whole cloth:</p>
<blockquote><p>Richard Torrance is a man who will do anything to get what he wants. Не is a man of strong will and unbreakable character. He is rational and cold-blooded. Richard strives to shape the world to his liking. Despite his efforts, he has never achieved what he truly desires - happiness. What led him to a world of endless suffering? Uncover the mysteries of the protagonist's past to find out.</p></blockquote>

<p>I actually did restart and choose tank controls in the end. After the elevator shenanigans, I shuffled along a long corridor, found a knife on a corpse, then banged on a door until the person behind it got annoyed enough to send a scythe-limbed ghoul at me. Combat is incredibly awkward, and your dude swings the knife like a ping pong paddle. In other words, it’s everything I want from melee combat in a survival horror game with fixed camera angles and tank controls.</p>
<p>I won’t go into too much detail about the discoveries you’ll soon make, except to say that I get the feeling ol' Dicky Torrance has done some very bad things. I'm very much into the art and atmosphere here, and while we’re circling around the periphery of old school survival horror revival fatigue, Becrowned has enough going for it to be worth a look. Again, make sure you go with tank controls, unless you want to fully embrace the latent self-flagellation I’m sure is lurking somewhere close to the surface of the protagonist’s psyche.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>During the early '90s, Ken Kutaragi and Sony attempted to collaborate with Nintendo on an early version of PlayStation, which was intended as a CD drive for the SNES. When that partnership faltered, Kutaragi and Sony moved forward with the original PlayStation in 1994. Although that system ultimately changed the entire video game industry, Kutaragi still recalls the doubters both inside and outside of Sony 25 years later.</p><p>"We wanted to share the passion," said Kuturagi at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-tokyo-game-show-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5799/" data-ref-id="2900-5799">Tokyo Games Show</a> via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ken-kutaragi-claims-everyone-at-sony-thought-the-playstation-would-fail/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>. "We wanted to hear their expectations and what they did not expect, so we wanted to hear from them. So we visited dozens of companies if not hundreds, we visited a lot of game makers. It was a great memory. They were not interested. They just said, 'Don't do it. There were multiple companies and none of them were successful. You are going to fail.' That's what they told us."</p><p>It's understandable why not everyone shared Kuturagi's passion for the project. When PlayStation entered the market, Nintendo and Sega were the only two dominant console-makers. Sony may have had more powerful hardware than the Genesis, the SNES, or the 32X peripheral, but Sega's Saturn was launching at right around the same time. And if that system had caught on like Sony's PS, then the console wars may have turned out very differently.</p><p>Microsoft had a similar experience in 2001 when it had to follow Sega's Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 into the market. Sega soon exited the console scene, leaving Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft as the major players in the industry. Through four successive console generations, Sony remains one of the most dominant companies in video games. And it all started because Kutaragi and his team had a vision for the future of gaming.</p>

(Apologies, Adam West fans, but 1966's <em>Batman: The Movie </em>isn’t here. We won’t complain if it remains #1 in your own personal ranking, though.) As you read through this list, you’ll notice that some Batman movies have a huge quality gap. For example, it’s tough to pit the controversial 2017 <em>Justice League</em>—which was ultimately outshone by Zack Snyder’s four-hour director’s cut—against Christopher Nolan’s highly regarded <em>The Dark Knight Trilogy</em>. In other cases, Batman has nipples on his suit, but I tried not to let that influence my rankings.<br></p></div><div><p>I told you Batman’s nipple suit wouldn’t sway me! Though, I have to recognize that George Clooney wears it with considerable poise in this 1997 film, which otherwise suffers from a serious lack of substance. In his ultimately futile effort to find a cure for his cryogenically frozen wife’s incurable illness, Mr. Freeze (Arnold Schwarzenegger) plans to freeze all of Gotham (“and then…the world!”). But Mr. Freeze quickly learns that you can’t fight ice with ice — Poison Ivy (Uma Thurman) has her own agenda, and she defrosts Freeze’s wife and leaves her to die. </p><p>One-liners and one-dimensional character building ensue as Batman, Robin (Christopher O’Donnell) and Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl try to save the world with their latex out. But, though <em>Batman &amp; Robin</em> is widely thought of as <em>the</em> worst Batman movie in existence, it’s not completely without merit. It offers a very ‘90s take on the ‘60s <em>Batman</em> TV show’s holy, campy excess. For example: when I first watched <em>Batman &amp; Robin</em> as a middle schooler, I kept replaying the scene where Uma Thurman performs a sultry striptease out of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0txnukioagY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0txnukioagY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a gorilla costume</a></span>, and I wondered if I was bisexual or if I just liked the part where she’s a gorilla.<br></p></div><div><p>Oh, Ben Affleck Batman, if only you spoke in a normal vocal register for 2016's <em>Batman v. Superman</em>, maybe then J. Lo wouldn’t have divorced you. Or maybe not—Batman’s lawnmower voice isn’t the only issue with this Zack Snyder movie, which struggles for air under the constraints of its convoluted plot. </p><p>At first you’d think that <em>Batman v. Superman</em> would be a movie that explores the complexities of justice; Batman doesn’t like how Superman does things, and vice versa. That’s a natural assumption for a movie called <em>Batman v. Superman</em>, but then you realize that no one in it knows why they want what they do—and Batman would like to build a kryptonite grenade launcher. The movie’s showstopper fight is with the colossal Gila monster Doomsday and, though he is fearsome, Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman looks like she’s sleeping with her eyes open when she helps Batman and Superman take him on. It’s all over-the-top, and overly complicated. In all the excess, <em>Batman v. Superman</em> forgets to build out its characters, or pay accurate tribute to the grim Frank Miller comics it’s inspired by.<br></p></div><div><p><em>The Flash</em> was doomed from the start. Ezra Miller was first announced to star in the movie — which was ultimately released in 2023—back in 2014. From there, <em>The Flash</em> got passed around by writers and directors for nearly a decade before being delayed again by the covid pandemic. Then, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/ezra-miller-the-flash-timeline-arrests-controversies-abuse-1234765089/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/ezra-miller-the-flash-timeline-arrests-controversies-abuse-1234765089/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">beginning in 2020</a></span>, Miller became embroiled in a series of grave controversies, eventually leading them to release a statement <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2022/film/news/ezra-miller-apologizes-the-flash-mental-health-issues-1235341888/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2022/film/news/ezra-miller-apologizes-the-flash-mental-health-issues-1235341888/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in 2022</a></span>, which cites “complex mental health issues.” For all the pain and confusion it’s associated with, <em>The Flash </em>is regrettably mediocre. Bad acting and special effects abound in what might have never been meant to exist in the first place.<br></p></div><div><p>The biggest problem with <em>Batman: The Killing Joke </em>is that it’s unmemorable. The same cannot be said about Alan Moore’s 1988 graphic novel of the same name, which chilled me so viciously as a teen, I started reading Nietzsche.<br></p><p>Its plot, which is recreated in the second half of the 2016 animated movie, provides a popular origin story for the Joker: a failed comedian falls into an acid pit, which burns him into the white-faced Joker. In the present, Joker paralyzes Barbara Gordon by shooting her through the stomach, then he kidnaps her father, Commissioner Gordon, torturing and goading him into going insane.<br></p><p>But the first half of the 2016 movie is dedicated to what ultimately feels like an auxiliary story about Barbara, as Batgirl, being horny and violent, subject to her overwhelming emotions as a woman. Then, even with Mark Hamill’s legendary voice acting, the more faithful second half of the movie can’t capture the insidiousness that artist Brian Bolland manages to transmit with the stationary comic book page.<br></p></div><div><p>I know that Zack Snyder’s self-congratulatory, four-hour director’s cut of his 2017 <em>Justice League</em> has become a fan-favorite, but let’s acknowledge the tragedy of the original theatrical cut. Ben Affleck’s lawnmower Batman voice is back, as is Gal Gadot’s medicine acting, and Ezra Miller’s agitated Barry Allen. After raising Superman (Henry Cavill) from the dead by dousing him in amniotic fluid, the heroes try to take on the alien military general Steppenwolf with special effects excess. Its stakes feel low, and its premise unexciting.</p></div><div><p>Not only did 2004's <em>Catwoman</em> earn Oscar-winner Halle Berry <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-7s_yeQuDg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-7s_yeQuDg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Razzie</a></span> for Worst Actress, it also was named Worst Picture, Worst Director, and Worst Screenplay. All they forgot was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNlmRId2FVQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNlmRId2FVQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Worst Game of Pickup Basketball</a></span>. But, there are plenty of diamonds to find if you sift through <em>Catwoman</em>’s stiff dialogue, gloopy CGI, and contrived story (Catwoman works to uncover a murder plot at a cosmetics company—you know, woman stuff). In recent years especially, <em>Catwoman</em> has been reclaimed as a slutty <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/halleberry/status/1452831358951243777&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/halleberry/status/1452831358951243777" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cult classic</a></span>. When you watch it through this lens, you’ll see that it’s full of perfect outfits and throwaway lines, like when, amid the thrum of <em>Catwoman</em>’s near-constant, flirty R&amp;B, Catwoman orders “a White Russian, no ice. Hold the vodka, hold the Kahlúa.”</p><p>The bartender slides it over: “Cream, straight up,” </p></div><div><p><em>Joker</em> is complicated. Joaquin Phoenix (who famously lost 52 pounds to play the sallow, unsuccessful comedian Arthur Fleck) is convincing in Todd Phillips’ 2019 movie; as he’s constantly beaten and ridiculed throughout <em>Joker</em>, Phoenix takes on the ineffable fragility of a picked flower. Though the movie operates in exhausting black-and-white thinking, you still wish for Arthur’s preservation…until he starts killing everyone. Then, <em>Joker</em> becomes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/joker-starring-joaquin-phoenix-sparked-incel-controversy-because-it-s-ncna1062656&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/joker-starring-joaquin-phoenix-sparked-incel-controversy-because-it-s-ncna1062656" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an acrid power fantasy</a></span>, eliminating all of Arthur’s softness with a flamethrower. It does, at least, make an interesting argument for nihilism, and its impact <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://img.ifunny.co/images/0010f87f8f296ec4c41fd9fc782b231e41c2c8705878d22bb7319af69d7994fc_1.jpg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://img.ifunny.co/images/0010f87f8f296ec4c41fd9fc782b231e41c2c8705878d22bb7319af69d7994fc_1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on culture</a></span> has been significant, but it’s not as clever as it presents.<br></p></div><div><p>2020's <em>Birds of Prey</em> is everything <em>Joker </em>is not: tender, approachable, and cute—cloyingly so, at times. An affable Margot Robbie reprises her role as Harley Quinn, who just got dumped. She goes through stages of grief, chopping off her pigtails and adopting a hyena, until the whole world starts wanting her dead. With help from characters like Black Canary (Jurnee Smollet) and The Huntress (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), Harley Quinn takes on some bad boys and protects young Cassandra Cain (an effervescent Ella Jay Basco) from harm after she steals a precious diamond. In the process, she rediscovers who she is without a green-haired madman holding her hand. Like its antihero protagonist, <em>Birds of Prey</em> won’t save the world, but it is a lot of bubbly fun. </p></div><div><p>Joel Schumacher’s 1995 <em>Batman Forever</em> might be unpopular, but hear me out. Does the movie’s cheesy theatricality often get it criticized for being a giant <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7XO3fzTBtI&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7XO3fzTBtI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Batman Forever toy ad</a></span>? Yes, but it’s a very good ad. </p><p>Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones doing his best ham imitation) and the Riddler (an electric Jim Carrey) team up to torture Batman, taking his love interest (Nicole Kidman) and partner Robin (Chris O’Donnell) hostage. Batman triumphs, in the end, by combatting the Riddler with a bad riddle of his own—”I see without seeing…to me, darkness is as clear as daylight,” Val Kilmer says with gravel in his mouth.<br></p><p>Then, there are many impressive sounds of agony, and the Riddler’s brain gets sucked dry by ‘90s CGI. None of it is innovative or smart, but it is pleasant to watch with your mind powered off. And <em>Batman Forever</em> has one of the series’ most exciting romances, too. I’ve always wanted to see Nicole Kidman make kissing a guy in a polyurethane rubber mask look glamorous.<br></p></div><div><p>In its strong cast and (mostly) focused plot, <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> shares merits with the rest of Christopher Nolan’s revered <em>Dark Knight </em>trilogy. Christian Bale is as tortured as ever, and Tom Hardy, hissing through the claws of his facemask, continues to be an imposing and calculated villain. The 2012 movie is a solid end to Nolan’s series, and it excels in its anxiety-inducing scenes of Bane and other villains forcing their way into political power. But it fumbles near the finish line, where it tries to introduce an underwhelming plot twist. It doesn’t feel necessary — <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> is at its best when it’s being intuitive.<br></p></div><div><p>The best part of Tim Burton’s 1989 <em>Batman</em> is what it did for the franchise. In 1989, audiences were accustomed to the spiky POW! graphics and tiny underwear associated with the 1960s Batman TV series. It had (and still has) merit as an accurate representation of Batman’s Silver Age comics, and as proof that billionaire orphandom doesn’t need to make a guy any less charming.<br></p><p>But Tim Burton’s 1989 <em>Batman</em> destroys that feel-good image in compelling ways. What it lacks in fascinating plot (the lovely journalist Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) is kidnapped by Jack Nicholson’s frighteningly lucid Joker, and smitten Michael Keaton has to save her), it makes up for in psychology. It creeps into you. Everything is gray, bleak, foggy—except for the Joker’s catlike smile, which stretches into a red wound.<br></p><p>“Have you ever danced with the devil by the pale moonlight?” Joker asks a young Bruce Wayne after killing his parents.<br></p><p>That single line alone has attracted decades of fan analysis and discussion. And, single-handedly, <em>Batman</em> has made it captivatingly impossible for its hero to ever recover his Adam West sparkle.<br></p></div><div><p>In 2005, Nolan started his Batman trilogy with <em>Batman Begins</em>, delivering Bruce Wayne deeper into the dark Tim Burton conjured in the ‘90s. In Nolan’s hands, Batman is an even more serious creature, unlikely to ever tolerate the fact that the 1989 Joker wears a purple hat. Instead, he trains from childhood to become a weapon, though he ultimately rejects a recruitment opportunity from the League of Shadows when joining would require him to kill.<br></p><p>So <em>Batman Begins</em> is as much about Batman’s creation as it is about his conflicted morality, heightening encounters with Scarecrow (a genuinely frightening Cillian Murphy) and Ra’s al Ghul (Liam Neeson), who come with their own visions of paradise. Moral gray is the bulk of what makes <em>Batman Begins</em> interesting, though, for all its characters’ frowning, it does have some classic superhero fun—Liam Neeson, for example, plans to microwave Gotham’s water supply.<br></p></div><div><p>I don’t know if any crystal ball could have predicted that <em>The Lego Batman Movie</em> would become one of the most beloved Batman movies in history, but here we are.<br></p><p>The 2017 cartoon is a loving ode to Batman lore that’s all-ages funny, with charismatic voice acting and vibrant animation. Its screwball plot starts with Batman offending the Joker—who wants to be a meaningful part of Batman’s life—and ends with Batman acknowledging his intimacy issues. So, while it provides plenty of sloshing buckets of fun, <em>The Lego Batman Movie</em> is also full of warm and fuzzy tenderness. You’ll want to return to it with butter popcorn and a comfortable blanket in hand.<br></p></div><div><p>OK, let’s shift gears significantly from <em>The Lego Batman Movie</em> and talk about 2022's <em>The Batman</em>.<br></p><p>At its core, <em>The Batman</em> is a detective movie. That’s good news, considering Batman is meant to be the “World’s Greatest Detective.” After the Riddler (an insidious Paul Dano) murders the mayor on Halloween, Batman (moody Robert Pattinson) investigates the crime with police Lieutenant James Gordon (Jeffrey Wright). In downcast glances and trails of blood, Batman handles bombs and the mounting air of desolation that falls on Gotham. But, even in the pall, he finds hope.<br></p><p>Batman’s emotional journey here is captivating, and the villainy he’s up against is remarkably believable for a superhero caper. It’s easy to feel <em>The Batman</em>’s tension floating into your body. And <em>The Batman</em> is original. There are hardly any other Batman movies as devoted to noir as this one.<br></p></div><div><p>The 1993 animated film <em>Mask of the Phantasm</em> communicates what made <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em> so iconic. Like the TV series that spawned it, whose reruns defined my teenage years, <em>Mask of the Phantasm</em> treats animation like a serious medium for serious material—it doesn’t hesitate to show you Batman as both a romantic and broken man.<br></p><p>The movie, which features Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill’s perfect voice acting for Batman and the Joker, also loosely references Frank Miller’s <em>Batman: Year One</em> and Mike W. Barr’s <em>Year Two</em> comics. In it, Batman faces murder accusations and the reality that his ex-fiancée is a lying Grim Reaper, who might still love him. It’s all as emotionally complex and volatile as you’d think, making endless rewatches a necessity.<br></p></div><div><p>It’s hard to imagine another Batman movie dethroning <em>The Dark Knight</em>’s influence on culture. Nolan’s 2008 movie is thrilling and painful; the Joker (Heath Ledger) terrorizes Batman’s love interest Rachel (Maggie Gyllenhaal) and <em>her</em> love interest, the district attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), and then anyone else he can set on fire. As Alfred (Michael Caine) famously says in one scene, “some men just want to watch the world burn.”</p><p>And that’s what makes <em>The Dark Knight</em> incredible, how much Heath Ledger sells that idea. We’re almost two decades removed from his performance, and still no other Joker has been able to replicate the effortless depravity Ledger found in caked face paint and nervous energy. </p></div><div><p>I think I’ve seen Tim Burton’s 1992 <em>Batman Returns</em> more than the palm of my hand. It’s my favorite Christmas movie.<br></p><p>The Penguin (Danny DeVito, being perfectly strange) and Catwoman (an irresistible Michelle Pfeiffer, being perfectly strange) frame Batman for murder while the rest of Gotham tries to enjoy their festive Christmas tree lighting. But the Penguin—Oswald Cobblepot, abandoned as a deformed child and now rejected by society for his violence—still has further to fall. Catwoman, too, digs into vengefulness with her long razor nails.<br></p><p>Both characters serve as an interesting argument that humanity is a choice; both ultimately push down forgiveness and empathy in order to sink into their animal personas. Michael Keaton’s Batman isn’t immune to the dark call of the beady bat, either—he eventually uses a swarm of them to completely incapacitate the Penguin. So <em>Batman Returns </em>doesn’t bother with the tunnel vision morality of some lesser superhero movies. It exhumes the beast inside all these self-aggrandizing people in their disguises, and it does it with stunning clarity and magnetism. <br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
