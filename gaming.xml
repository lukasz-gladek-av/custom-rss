		<p>Focus Entertainment and developer Hutlihut Games have announced that their co-op space action game Void Crew is coming out for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on 4th September 2025.</p>
<p>New console players will join the existing PC-based community, which grew through early access and the full game’s launch back in November 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Console Release Date Trailer [Void Crew]" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hcwJCbd_PQs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Void Crew sneds you off into the depths of METEM space to fight back against the HOLLOW alien enemy that is invading. With crews of 1-6 players, you will take on specific roles within the ship as Pilot, Gunner, Engineer, and Scavenger, running around the 3D environment to man stations, perform tasks and generally work together to try and push back the enemy. There will be job like hopping onto cannons, of course, but also planning out your moves at a shared table, going on space walks to patch up the hull, making internal repairs, flipping internal controls, and more.</p>
<p>As you progress from objective to objective, you’ll expand your ship’s loadout, taking the opportunity to customise and upgrade your ship, hopefully improving your survivability for when you wind up in space battles with swarms of enemies and huge bosses. It’s a roguelite, though, so expect to fail a good few times and have to start all over from the beginning.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When Nintendo first announced the Switch 2’s slate of launch titles, people were very <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lcz0a4/why_is_the_switch_2_selling_so_well_it_seems/">quick to cry foul</a> about how few original, exclusive games the company had lined up for its latest console. There were ports from other systems and updated versions of original Switch games. But <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> was the Switch 2’s only major new exclusive title, which, for some, put a further damper on a launch that was already mired in confusion about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/650982/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-price-fair">pricing</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/644803/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-trade-borrow-resell">game key cards</a>.</p><p>While <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685142/nintendo-switch-2-3-5-million-sold">the Switch 2’s sales</a> disproved that pessimistic read, the system’s relatively thin selection of exclusives has <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-hype-pre-order-special-compared/">continued to be a talking point</a> in the ongoing discourse about <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/611518/one-month-analysis-hype">whether the overall launch was exciting enough</a>. But after a month of the Switch 2 being on the market, what do you know — there just so happens to be a new game for it out this week. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a>’s arrival isn’t at all a surprise because <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641537/donkey-kong-bananza-nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo told everyone exactly when it would be available</a>. Being made to wait a bit might have rubbed some folks the wrong way, but in a world where we <em>all</em> have a back catalog of games that we’ve yet to finish (or even start in some cases), a measured release schedule kind of feels like a good thing.</p><p>Back in April when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641985/nintendo-switch-2-every-game-announced-direct">Nintendo first announced all of the Switch 2 games</a> slated to come out through the end of 2025, you could see that the company was loosely following a monthly release schedule for its new exclusives. June would go to <em>Mario Kart World</em> and <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em>. And <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>would drop in July amid the releases of a couple Switch 2 editions of older games. At the time, Nintendo said that <em>Drag x Drive </em>would debut at some point in “the summer,” but it has since pegged the game to a firm August 14th release date.</p><p>Currently, there’s nothing on the docket for September, but the month could easily go to <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>, which is supposed to come out this year. And after <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>’s release in October, the “winter” will belong to <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> (and maybe <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640231/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-2-enhanced-edition-beyond"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a>, which is also due out sometime in 2025).</p><p>Looking at Nintendo’s roadmap for the rest of the year, it feels as if the company is trying to pace things in a way that gives people time to really sit with and enjoy its exclusives. For every hardcore gamer who prides themself on speeding through a title and being the first to uncover or unlock all of its surprises, there are far more casuals who prefer taking their time. Nintendo could have opted to flood the zone with more exclusives from the jump — a move that probably would have made the Switch 2’s launch seem like a splashier beat in <a href="https://kotaku.com/console-wars-are-over-ps5-xbox-forza-switch-2-sony-1851752956">the console wars’ twilight hours</a>. But by spacing things out, the company is guaranteeing that there will be a steady stream of new stuff for people to dig into, and giving people ample time to decide if they’re <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642143/nintendo-switch-2-games-price-expensive">willing to pay the games’ higher prices</a>.</p><p>The Switch 2 is Nintendo’s new flagship, which is to say it’s not going away anytime soon and there will be plenty more games for it in due time. Had <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/703468/donkey-kong-bananza-developer-interview-switch-2"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a> dropped alongside <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interview/678097/mario-kart-world-nintendo-switch-2-interview-kosuke-yabuki"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, neither game would have been able to take up so much space and command attention they way they could with some distance between them. Releasing new titles at a steady pace was a major part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/20/17478950/nintendo-switch-structure-success-shinya-takahashi-interview">Nintendo’s vision for the original Switch</a>, and that strategy paid off through the console’s life cycle. Now it looks like Nintendo’s sticking to its guns, and the Switch 2 will probably be better off for it.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/708909/nintendo-switch-2-donkey-kong-bananza-exclusive-release-schedule]]></content:encoded>

The easiest way to increase her bond level to this point is via regular, daily conversations, the occasional gift, choosing the correct hangouts, and consider bringing her along in your party. The passive points toward her bond level for fighting alongside her, healing her, etc, really do add up.</p><figure id="" data-id="486a5f69c3c831d65bbca9d5cad4fccf" data-recommend-id="image://486a5f69c3c831d65bbca9d5cad4fccf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The character card for Hina in Rune Factory: Guards of Azuma." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The character card for Hina in Rune Factory: Guards of Azuma." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvelous / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="486a5f69c3c831d65bbca9d5cad4fccf" data-recommend-id="image://486a5f69c3c831d65bbca9d5cad4fccf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The character card for Hina in Rune Factory: Guards of Azuma." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Once it’s time to marry Hina, you must reach bond level 10. Upon doing so, Woolby will bring up the topic of marriage, noting your budding relationship. He’ll provide you with a sapling for either a Red or White Plum Tree, along with the recipe for Divine Spirits. Plant the tree behind a village shrine—any of the game’s towns will suffice—and wait for it to sprout. Once it’s done, combine its branch with Rice and Wisteria to craft the Divine Spirits.</p><p>With the Divine Spirits and the heart of Hina, invite her to the Fateweaver Shrine.

            <p>Sucker Punch's upcoming PlayStation 5 exclusive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> is getting its own official popcorn bucket, but it's proven so popular it has already sold out online.</p>
<p>The bucket itself was available to pre-order from <a href="https://t.co/Kre862VVjF">AlamoMart</a>, and is shaped like a traditional Japanese rice basket. It was released for pre-order to coincide with Alamo Drafthouse's "curated" <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/way-samurai">Way of the Samurai</a> film programme, which will showcase five films that helped define the genre. This series of films will <a href="https://x.com/alamodrafthouse/status/1945892543234805970/photo/1">be hosted in August</a> at select Alamo Drafthouse theaters.</p>

<p>Anyway, the hand painted Ghost of Yōtei Popcorn Bucket, as it is known, itself retailed for $40. That's around £30 here in the UK, though not factoring in any shipping costs. It was designed by Sony's own artists, and has a 100oz capacity.</p>
<p>"Elevate your movie snack game with the limited-edition Ghost of Yōtei Popcorn Bucket," the description reads, with Alamo Drafthouse calling it "the perfect keepsake for any aspiring warrior".</p>
<p>A perfect keepsake it may well be, but even though the popcorn bucket was only revealed last night, it has already sold out online. Sorry for any of you who were looking forward to reaching into a Ghost of Yōtei-themed food vessel, but that chap just simply isn't available any more. I have popped my email address into the 'Notify Me When Available' tab, so will let you know if this changes.</p>

            <p>The next round of Everdark Sovereigns will be added to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> on 31st July, with four enhanced Nightlords available to beat.</p>
<p>In a nod towards live service updates, these <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-update-brings-new-challenges-and-a-welcome-live-service-twist">extra challenging Everdark Sovereigns were added to the game on a rotating basis last month</a>, with three added individually over three weeks. Then, last week, FromSoftware announced these would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-worry-nightfarers-youll-get-another-chance-to-beat-elden-ring-nightreigns-sovereign-super-bosses">rotate again before new additions arrived</a>.</p>
<p>Now we know the enhanced Tricephalos, Augur, Equilibrious Beast and Fissure in the Fog will arrive on 31st July - so that's immediately after the current rotation concludes.</p>

<p>While not confirmed, presumably these will be added to the game one at a time on a rotating basis over the course of four weeks. And after that? Perhaps they'll come round again.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sucker Punch Productions is one of the longest-standing PlayStation Studios teams, with a storied history and more than a few series and characters who've taken the PlayStation spotlight over the years. During the PlayStation 3 era, that series was Infamous, a series of games that spilled over into the PlayStation 4 era, but has been dormant since the release of a main game and a shorter DLC title that both arrived at the beginning of the PS4 generation. </p>



<p>Infamous was followed up with<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima-duty-heavier-than-a-mountain-death-lighter-than-a-feather/"> Ghost of Tsushima,</a> a decision that very few, if any, would question, considering how successful Ghost of Tsushima has been, both as a commercial product and as a game that is beloved by players and critics alike. But that hasn't stopped players who loved Infamous from wondering out loud if Sucker Punch would return to the series. </p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/07/17/ghost-of-yotei-directors-share-philosophy-on-balancing-freedom-with-story">GameInformer</a>, where creative directors Nate Fox and Jason Connell were talking all things Ghost of Yotei ahead of the game's October release, Fox was asked if he'd be open to going back to the Infamous games. </p>



<p>"<em>I would love to work on more Infamous</em>," Fox began. "<em>I would love to see a trilogy rerelease, but Sucker Punch is a one game at a time shop, and right now we are very focused on finishing Ghost of Yotei.</em>"</p>



<p>For as long as Sucker Punch has been making games for PlayStation consoles, the studio has focused on one series at a time. On the PlayStation 2, that series was Sly Cooper. It made three Sly Cooper games for PS2 before the series spilled over into the PS3 generation with another developer at the helm. Then it was Infamous with two games made for PS3, one for PS4, and one shorter, expansion-sized game, also for PS4.</p>



<p>Ghost of Tsushima was undoubtedly the studio's main game for the PS4 generation. The 'Ghost' series is only the second time in the studio's history that it has worked on games in a series that has straddled two console generations, but what Sucker Punch has never done so far is look back. As a fan of Infamous myself, I would love to see them return to the series, rerelease the trilogy and make a proper fourth installment, but I can't say that feels likely. </p>



<p>Who knows, though. Perhaps Fox, I, and many players around the world who still have a love for the Infamous games will get our wish.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy Entertainment has revealed what's coming next to multiplayer-focused shooter&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, and there's a major update incoming in September, plus more.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536607976683733002" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam, Remedy says its upcoming "cadence" for communication, as well as updates for&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>in general, will "slow down" as the studio focuses on work for a major update that's coming in September.</p>

<p>Remedy goes on to say that while it wants to tell players what's coming in the update, "the nature of game development is that things change frequently", and promising certain features only for them not to end up in the final update would "get [the studio] into trouble".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fbc-firebreak-whats-next-monster.jpg?itok=9a9Tg80V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fbc-firebreak-whats-next-monster.jpg?itok=Mto3x_dH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>is getting a big update in September.</figcaption></figure><p>With that said, Remedy does reveal some of the things it's working on for the update, including an improved "onboarding" experience that will include a narrative video setting up the game's story, as well as a playable tutorial level.</p>

<p>Gunplay is also being improved; Remedy says that while it doesn't want&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>to become a conventional shooter, it does recognize the need to improve the game's arsenal, so three new heavy guns will be added in September.</p>

<p>Generic upgrades for weapons will also be removed, and they'll be replaced by a mod system that will let you "tweak how you want your guns to work and the ways in which they become more powerful over time".</p>

<p>There's tons of other stuff coming to&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>in September as well, although as Remedy says, some of what's being worked on may not make it into this update, and you may well see other features that haven't been teased yet as well.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2272540/FBC_Firebreak/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10012303" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fbc-firebreak/9pdcn8z4hkrn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's available on PS Plus and Game Pass as well.

    <p><span>Escape the sizzling heat with seaside adventures.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 5.8 update for <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [125 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, dubbed “Sunspray Summer Resort,” will launch on July 30, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [200 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-979181"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>With salt in the air and waves frothing on the breezy shores, a new permanent summer adventure map—Easybreeze Holiday Resort—awakens in Natlan, bringing a variety of laid-back, colorful events. Meanwhile, Ineffa, the first Nod-Krai character, will introduce the new Lunar-Charged reactions and begin the prelude to the Nod-Krai storyline.</p><p>Starting with Version 5.8, Travelers will be invited to explore Easybreeze Holiday Resort—a vibrant new island region located off the west coast of Natlan, now open for its trial phase. Familiar faces will return for the adventure, including Bennett, Chasca, and Mualani. Even Venti makes an appearance, seemingly here to visit an old friend—more of which will unfold in the new Story Quest, “Sunspray Summer Resort.” Joining the fun is the resort’s cheerful mascot, “Asha,” who grants Travelers special exploration powers similar to those of the Saurians—making it easy to glide across water and hover briefly in midair across the layers of the resort. The Asha buddies are also master spray painters, and the color they scatter along the way can solve puzzles and unveil more secrets of the resort. Yet, beneath the cheerful resort lies the secrets of Mare Jivari, where Bakunawa, the ageless monster, awaits new challengers.</p><p>Hidden throughout the resort are a variety of seasonal events offering generous rewards. Whether by guiding Kau Kau and Akamai in “Travels Are Fuller With Friends,” aiming at opponents in “Strikers Through the Storm,” joining energetic music parties, or spray-painting objects as Asha, Travelers can earn Sunspray Spirit through these mini-games. Collect enough, and Travelers can unlock exciting rewards, including the event-exclusive 4-star Claymore “Flame-Forged Insight” and Bennett’s new outfit, “Adventures in Blazing Hue.”</p><p>The story of Nod-Krai is about to unfold in the new version series “Song of the Welkin Moon.” In the prelude chapter, “The Journey Home” in Version 5.8, Ineffa, Travelers will meet your very first companion from the region: Ineffa, an all-purpose household robot created by the Whiz-Kid Mechanic Aino of Nod-Krai. Together with Ineffa, Travelers will set off on a journey across Natlan to uncover the secrets of her origins—mysteries that appear to be closely linked to the ancient dragon civilization.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_979183"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Ineffa, a capable fighter when her combat module is activated, will join the playable roster as a 5-star Electro polearm user who introduces the all-new Lunar-Charged reaction. When she is in the team, any Electro-Charged reaction triggered by party members will instead become a Lunar-Charged reaction. Upon activation, a Thundercloud appears on the battlefield, continuously dealing Electro DMG to enemies simultaneously affected by both Electro and Hydro, even with the possibility of triggering CRIT Hits. In combat, Ineffa can deploy a shield and summon the Multipurpose Smart Assistance Unit “Birgitta.” Birgitta can periodically dash toward enemies to deal AoE Electro DMG, and will launch an additional attack if a Thundercloud created by Lunar-Charged reactions is present nearby.</p><p>In the first phase of the Version 5.8 event wishes, Ineffa will make her debut alongside a rerun of Citlali. In the latter half of the banners, Mualani and Chasca will return.</p><p>In addition, Yelan, our old friend from Liyue, embroiled in a tricky case in Fontaine, keeps a low profile by donning a new Fontaine-style outfit and equipping a special photography device to capture traces invisible to the naked eye. For a limited time, Travelers can also pick up Yelan’s fresh outfit, “Tranquil Banquet,” at a special discount.</p><p>This breezy summer update also comes with a range of streamlined system optimizations. New short, cloud-streamed tutorial videos are now available on Trial and Talent screens for newly released characters, making it easier for Travelers to learn how to use them effectively. Quest time management has been simplified too—just press “Navigate,” and the in-game clock will automatically adjust to the correct time. Additionally, improved material tracking now helps Travelers quickly identify which characters can detect local specialties in each region.</p></blockquote><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,922 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,543 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [28,171 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [23,692 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://ys-api-os.mihoyo.com/event/download_porter/link/ys_global/genshinimpactpc/default" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">client</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/genshin-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genshin-impact/id1517783697" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers below.

Whether you love socializing, adventuring, or simply enjoying a laid-back lifestyle, there’s warmth and happiness waiting for you here. This island embodies our vision of an ideal life, and we look forward to creating a unique dream world together with you.”</p><p>Seed Lab technical director Goltan Gao added, “We want to make sure players are the true stars of their <em>Starsand Island</em> story. We’re building a game where they will have the freedom to decide how their character looks, how they travel and explore the island’s beautifully tranquil landscapes, and whether they go on their exciting <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,406 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>s solo, with a pet, or with a friend. <a title="Genres > Crafting [38 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">Crafting</a> their dream island life is at the heart of every decision we’re making as we continue to create <em>Starsand Island</em>, and we’re excited to share more of the journey as BitSummit begins.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the vehicles and exploration, via Seed Lab:</p><blockquote><p>Players will be able to skate, ride, drive, and fly a range of vehicles, including skateboards, rollerblades, cars, scooters with (and without) sidecars, and even a paraglider, across the island’s lush pastures, green- and amber-hued woodlands, glistening sandy beaches, and the surrounding azure seas. Amphibious craft will also be available, enabling seamless land and water traversal, further expanding players’ horizons.</p><p>Exploring the island won’t have to be done solo: a number of vehicles have passenger seats, allowing NPC pals and pets – and even real-life friends via <em>Starsand Island</em>‘s <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [555 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer game</a>play – to go along for the ride, while the game’s photo mode will allow players to capture memories and moments from every part of their adventure.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Showcasing the game at this year’s BitSummit expo in Japan, Seed Lab is also unveiling more details on both the character and vehicle customization available in <em>Starsand Island</em>. The game’s vehicle modification system lets players fully customize their rides; for example, cars can be painted with new colors, and detailed with a range of decals, wheel rims, and interiors.</p><p><em>Starsand Island</em> also features extensive customization for the player’s character, including the ability to finely tune them with a range of facial features, skin tones, makeup, and hairstyles, while choosing from a vast wardrobe of outfits and accessories to complete a fresh, edgy vibe ready for island life. Further customizable options will be expanded post-launch, along with additional social and collaborative gameplay, while more information on the <em>Starsand Island</em>‘s multiplayer functionality will be released in the coming months.</p></blockquote><p><em>Starsand Island</em> is due out this winter for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,922 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,543 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [17,357 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,692 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966320/Starsand_Island/" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p><p>Watch the new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Vehicles and Exploration</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Starsand Island - Vehicles and Exploration" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hr0WwSqChr8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p><strong>Japanese</strong></p><p><iframe title="《Starsand Island》（#スターサンドアイランド）キャラ＆乗り物DIY機能登場！二人乗り＋ペット同伴で新しい島の冒険が始まる！ | GSE" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BqJdjZ4mHDQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/07/starsand-island-details-vehicles-exploration]]></content:encoded>

                <p>In 2012, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lollipop-chainsaw-review/1900-6383166/" data-ref-id="1900-6383166">Lollipop Chainsaw</a> introduced players to Juliet Starling, a zombie-hunting cheerleader who used a chainsaw and other over-the-top weapons to destroy the so-called walking dead. Aside from the modern remaster, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lollipop-chainsaw-remake-delayed-to-2024-officially-titled-lollipop-chainsaw-repop/1100-6516795/" data-ref-id="1100-6516795">Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP</a>, that was released in 2024, there hasn't been much happening with the franchise. Now, Lollipop Chainsaw is poised for a comeback with "new projects" thanks to a deal between Dragami Games and Nada Holdings.</p><p>The two companies jointly announced that they plan to "jointly launch multiple new projects" based on Lollipop Chainsaw. Neither Dragami nor Nada offered any details about what those projects might entail, but a new game or a potential film adaptation could be among the options explored.</p><p>Dragami Games president and CEO Shohei Sato thanked Lollipop Chainsaw fans for their support and praised Nada for giving the company a chance to revisit the franchise.</p><p>"The team at Nada Holdings shares a deep affection and enthusiasm for the title, along with a proven track record in IP investment and development," said Sato. "Through this partnership, we look forward to working together to create new projects that carry on the spirit and charm of the original while bringing fresh value to the franchise."</p><p>James Gunn--the co-CEO of DC Studios and the director of the recently released Superman reboot--co-wrote the story for Lollipop Chainsaw, which was co-directed by Goichi Suda aka Suda51. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suda51-and-james-gunn-wont-be-involved-in-the-lollipop-chainsaw-remake/1100-6505128/" data-ref-id="1100-6505128">neither Gunn nor Suda51 had any involvement with the 2024 remaster</a>. If another game moves forward, it's unclear if either Gunn or Suda51 will be willing or able to contribute to it.</p>

While Steam only counts for a portion of the game's audience--it's also available through the Epic Games Store, as well as on Xbox Series X|S and PS5--the numbers haven't been too encouraging lately. The game peaked with 1,992 players on launch day, and since then, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2272540/charts/#max" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">those numbers have fallen</a> to well under 100 concurrent players on average.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536607976683733002" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">In a blog post</a>, Remedy says that one of the issues it looks to address is the opening of the game, as that crucial first hour has become a point of criticism amongst the playerbase. "We've seen many players come into the game and leave within the first hour. And that's because our first hour can be frustrating; you feel ineffective and confused as to what to do. This needs to be improved," Remedy explained.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> FBC: Firebreak GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p>The company says that it plans to improve the narrative onboarding experience by placing an introductory video into the game and improving the tutorial section with better pop-up tips. In effect, this should help players figure out "where they are, who they are, and what they are trying to achieve" as members of Firebreak.</p><p>In terms of gameplay, Remedy explained that it wants to strike a fine balance between using old-fashioned first-person shooter gunplay and Crisis Kit tools to triumph, giving players more control over their growth. This will involve adding three new heavy guns, dropping all "generic" upgrades from equipment and replace it with a Mod System that lets players tweak how their weapons function.</p><p>Other changes on the horizon include tweaks to the Jobs system and a dynamic series of objectives to keep players on their toes. "We're bringing in a new handcrafted level, three Zones, a new status effect, two more enemies to deal with, and all the rest you've come to expect from a new Job," Remedy added.</p><p>The studio stressed that its plans aren't set in stone and could change over time, but overall, it expects the first Major Update to introduce a significant number of improvements to FBC: Firebreak. Remedy has been fairly candid <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remedy-is-bringing-major-changes-to-fbc-firebreak-after-launch-backlash/1100-6532591/" data-ref-id="1100-6532591">with the response</a> to its three-player cooperative shooter, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fbc-firebreak-launch-wasnt-what-studio-hoped-for-but-remedy-isnt-giving-up/1100-6532823/" data-ref-id="1100-6532823">and while it did hope for a better launch</a>, it says that it remains fully committed to improving and evolving the game.</p>

                <p>Netflix plans to "ramp up" its investment in gaming after the company previously <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-boss-explains-why-company-killed-the-aaa-multiplayer-game-from-halo-veteran/1100-6530293/" data-ref-id="1100-6530293">pulled back from its grand ambitions in the AAA space</a> and shut down a studio from Halo veteran Joe Staten.</p><p>As part of <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/Netflix-Inc-_Earnings-Call_Transcript.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Netflix's latest earnings briefing</a>, co-CEO, president, and director Greg Peters commented on Netflix's vision for gaming, saying Netflix's investment thus far has been relatively small in comparison to the money it puts into film, TV, and live sports programming. The opportunity to grow is significant, he said.</p><p>"We look at the near-term monetization opportunity with games very similar to how we've looked at other new content categories. You can think in scripted or film or on and on. And that's essentially, if we deliver more value to our offering, we get increased user acquisition, we get increased retention, we get increased willingness to pay," he said. "So it drives all of the sort of core fundamentals of our business."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4534463-games.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4534463" data-ratio="0.61573033707865" data-width="890" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4534463-games.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4534463"></a><figcaption>Netflix Games is growing.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4534463-games.jpg"></figure><p>Peters said Netflix has already observed "positive effects" of investing in gaming. However, he reminded people that Netflix's investment in gaming remains "small" relative to the company's overall business and that the number of people playing games on Netflix is small as well. In 2022, findings found that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/8/23296545/netflix-games-1-percent-subscribers" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">99% of Netflix users did not play Netflix's games</a>, though this was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-is-bringing-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-to-mobile-devices-next-month/1100-6519544/" data-ref-id="1100-6519544">before Grand Theft Auto came to Netflix. </a></p><p>Peters said Netflix is aiming to be "disciplined" with regards to its investment in gaming. The goal, he said, is to not invest too much before Netflix can demonstrate that it can create "value for our members."</p><p>"We've seen good progress, as you know, with licensed games like GTA. We've seen good progress with the games we developed like Squid Game: Unleashed. So you'll see more from us in both of those categories, as well as a whole new set of interactive experiences that we think that we're either in a unique or differential position to deliver," he said. "So we're super excited to roll those out over the next year."</p><p>Currently, Netflix's games are included with a subscription to the streaming service, and Netflix's games do not have ads or microtransactions. Some have theorized that Netflix might seek to monetize games in different ways in the future, but nothing is confirmed yet. Peters said Netflix is "open" to "evolving our monetization model" for games, but he said the company needs to "get to a lot more scale before that becomes a really materially relevant question. So we're going to do that work first."</p><p>Finally, Peters said people should remember that the TAM, or total addressable market, for gaming is "very, very large" and thus has significant potential upside in terms of growth and revenue. "We remain convicted about our strategic opportunity and excited to make more progress," Peters said.</p><p>Also during the briefing, Netflix management said the company continues to invest in "immersive, narrative games based on our IP." For Black Mirror Season 7, Netflix launched the game Thronglets, which was also featured in the "Plaything" episode. The Squid Game: Unleashed game, meanwhile, received new content themed around the recently released Season 3.</p><p>Netflix is now focused on four main areas for its upcoming games slate, including party games, kids games, narrative games, and "mainstream" games. These titles will be made for phones and to be beamed to TVs via Netflix's own streaming systems--and won't come to Xbox or PlayStation consoles.</p><p>For years already, Netflix has been <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/132197" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">testing streaming games directly to your TV or computer</a>, in addition to launching games for mobile.</p><p>"It's a little bit like a musician, we start copying a few things and then at one point we're going to find our voice," Netflix gaming boss Alain Tascan said. "I don't know how long it's going to take exactly, but I'm very bullish about us finding our voice."</p><p>As for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-boss-explains-why-company-killed-the-aaa-multiplayer-game-from-halo-veteran/1100-6530293/" data-ref-id="1100-6530293">why Netflix shuttered its AAA studio and canceled the new game from Staten</a>, Tascan said this wasn't a signal that Netflix doesn't want to make "big ambitious games." Instead, he said the genre of what the studio was building was not "matching the platform."</p><p>"This team was really good at what they were doing, but we wouldn't have been the best partner for them to express their skills and their expertise," he said.</p><p>In other Netflix news, it was just recently announced that Netflix had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflixs-assassins-creed-tv-series-moves-ahead-with-halo-sons-of-anarchy-veterans/1100-6533232/" data-ref-id="1100-6533232">greenlit a live-action Assassin's Creed TV series that has been in the works for a half-decade already.</a></p>

            <p>Valve boss Gabe Newell spends his days scuba diving and hanging out on a boat as well as working, but is effectively retired at this point.</p>
<p>Newell was interviewed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ZALKAR.SALIEV">YouTube channel Zalkar Saliev</a>, which is dedicated to "powerful interviews and lifestyle stories with successful men across the US", but with just a handful of videos so far - certainly an odd choice for Newell. Valve confirmed to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/gabe-newells-daily-routine-is-get-up-work-go-scuba-diving-says-hes-been-retired-for-a-long-time-but-works-7-days-a-week-the-things-i-get-to-do-every-day-are-super-awesome/">PC Gamer</a> the interview is real.</p>
<p>While the full interview is yet to be published, a couple of shorts have been released, including one where Newell discusses his daily routine.</p>

<p>"What is the daily routine for Mr Gabe?" he's asked.</p>
<p>Newell replied: "My daily routine: I get up, I work, I go scuba-diving, then work some more. Then either go on a second scuba dive or I go to the gym and work out. I live on a boat so I just hang out with everybody on the boat. Then I work."</p>
<p>He continued: "I work seven days a week: I'm working from my bedroom as you can tell." Indeed, the interview alternates between a view of Saliev's computer and the direct video call feed. Newell appears to be sat at the end of a bed.</p>
<p>Newell added: "I like working, it's fun, to me it doesn't feel like work. The kinds of things that I get to do every day are super-awesome."</p>
<p>He then admitted he's effectively retired at this point. "I've said it before but, when you retire, you want to stop doing your horrible job and go do what is most fun and entertaining," he said. "In that sense I've been retired for a long time."</p>
<p>So what exactly is he up to? He's working on "AI stuff" and "Steam stuff", but with one company he's working on an aerosol pathogen detection device. He added: "Brain-computer interfaces are incredibly cool and all of the associated neuroscience is incredibly cool."</p>
<p>Newell concluded: "I just work all the time, but it's not like 'oh my god I'm up late at night slaving away on stuff.' It's more like 'I can't go to sleep because I'm having fun', you know?" Lucky for some!</p>
<p>In <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/aCgxGfVM_d0?si=DsHRmA-WgwIlSLPD">another video</a>, Newell discusses his thoughts on using AI as a tool. He predicted: "I think we'll be in this funny situation where people who don't know how to programme could use AI to scaffold their programming capabilities [and] will become more effective developers of value than people who have been programming for a decade."</p>
<p>It's unknown when the full interview will be published, but expect more to come.</p>
<p>Over at Steam, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-introduces-vague-new-rules-banning-certain-kinds-of-adult-content-to-appease-credit-card-companies">Valve has introduced new guidelines around adult-only game content</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-boss-gabe-newell-reveals-daily-routine-in-bizarre-new-interview-i-get-up-i-work-i-go-scuba-diving-then-work-some-more]]></content:encoded>

Could a new <em>Dark Souls</em>, <em>Dark Souls III </em>remaster, or <em>Armored Core VI</em> spin-off be less than a year away?</p><p>That’s the speculation now, given that this unannounced project is multi-platform, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/duskbloods-switch-2-nintendo-fromsoftware-exclusive-1851774242&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/duskbloods-switch-2-nintendo-fromsoftware-exclusive-1851774242">unlike <em>The Duskbloods</em></a></span>, FromSoftware’s multiplayer exclusive coming to Switch 2 in 2026. <em>Mp1st</em> also suggests that the studio’s DLCs often reuse codenames, so it’s likely any big new expansions for <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> are separate from this as well. Given that multiplayer spin-off’s strong sales and room to grow, we’re likely to see meaningful ongoing support for it at least through the next year. </p><p>Coupled with the fact that FromSoftware director Hidetaka Miyazaki seems intent on never revisiting <em>Bloodborne</em>, fan speculation has turned to <em>Dark Souls III </em>and <em>Armored Core VI</em>. <em>Dark Souls II</em> is the least-loved entry in the series and already received a next-gen port for PS4/Xbox One. <em>Armored Core</em>, meanwhile, has a history of getting expansions spun-off into standalone games not long after release. If <em>Armored Core VI</em> didn’t get something along those lines, it would be the first game in the mech fighting series not to see a direct follow-up within a couple years of release. </p><p>What we can confidently say FromSoftware isn’t working on is <em>Elden Ring 2.</em> “We’re not really considering developments such as an <em>Elden Ring 2</em>,” Miyazaki <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gateway/nintendo-switch-online-playtest-program-secret-mmo-1851786542&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gateway/nintendo-switch-online-playtest-program-secret-mmo-1851786542">said at the PlayStation Partner Awards last year</a></span>. He said the studio is instead exploring new types of genres, which is clearly reflected in both<em> Nightreign</em> (online PVE) and <em>The Duskbloods </em>(online PVP). But the studio hasn’t abandoned single-player games either. </p><p>“As previously mentioned, [<em>The Duskbloods</em>] is an online multiplayer title at its core, but this doesn’t mean that we as a company have decided to shift to a more multiplayer-focused direction with titles going forward,” Miyazaki <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-duskbloods-elden-ring-hidetaka-miyazaki-switch-2-1851774753&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-duskbloods-elden-ring-hidetaka-miyazaki-switch-2-1851774753">said earlier this year</a></span>. “We still intend to actively develop single-player focused games such as this that embrace our more traditional style.”</p><p>My money’s on this reportedly new, nearly complete project being <em>Armored Core</em>-related, but we’ll have to wait and see. Given the hot streak FromSoftware is on, I trust them to deliver on whatever they’re making. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dark-souls-3-remaster-armored-core-6-fromsoftware-1851786550]]></content:encoded>

This coincides with Microsoft also closing the curtain on its longrunning operating system, with Square Enix adding that players will still be able to "likely" play the game after this date.</p><p>"We have found that continuing support for this operating system is a difficult proposition," <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/news/detail/e260c504b32d4dfd8be14d582f54b14664e9d8d0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Square Enix said in a statement</a>. "You will likely be able to play Final Fantasy 14 on Windows 10 systems even after the end of support. However, after we discontinue support, we will, as a general rule, no longer be able to provide support for problems arising as a result of the operating system."</p><p>The publisher says that it may still respond to requests for technical support, but on a case-by-case basis. Final Fantasy 14 first launched for PC in 2013--PS3--back in 2013, which was when Microsoft's Windows 8 operating system was still in its infancy. Due to its long shelf life, it has naturally been updated for multiple Windows OS versions since then, and its recent Dawntrail expansion provided the game with a graphical update.</p><p>Regarded as one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-mmorpgs/2900-5436/" data-ref-id="2900-5436">best MMORPGs of all time</a>, the game was ported to Xbox Series X|S last year.

            <p>FromSoftware is reportedly in advanced development on a project it's yet to announce, which could be out as early as next year.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/fromsoftware-i-development-unannounced-project-codenamed-fmc">mp1st</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/fromsoftware-reportedly-has-another-unannounced-game-that-could-release-next-year/">VGC</a>), which has information suggesting the Japanese studio has a multiplatform game with the codename FMC in development.</p>
<p>Due to "the nature of the source these details come from", mp1st believes this project is in an advanced stage and should be out next year. The fact it's a multiplatform game confirms FMC is not the codename for the already announced The Duskbloods, which will be exclusive to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>.</p>

<p>So what could this game be? That's where things get speculative.</p>
<p>Mp1st has noted that previous Dark Souls games - and 2023's Armored Core 6 - had codenames with abbreviations beginning with F.</p>
<p>For instance, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a> was FDP, Dark Souls Remastered was FHD, and Armored Core 6 was FNR. By contrast, Sekiro was NTCG/NTC, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> was GR (short for Great Rune).</p>
<p>The suggestion, then, is that FMC could be related to either the Dark Souls or Armored Core series.</p>
<p>Nick "Shpeshal Nick" Baker, co-host of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Mmo392kpNoA">XboxEra Podcast</a>, reported last year Dark Souls 3 Remastered was in development. Series creator <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hidetaka-miyazaki">Hidetaka Miyazaki</a> previously told <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dark-souls-3-interview-it-wouldnt-be-right-to-cont/1100-6432425/">Gamespot</a> he considered Dark Souls 3 to be "the big closure on the series". But would this rule out a remaster?</p>
<p>Armored Core 6, meanwhile, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/armored-core-6-fires-of-rubicon-review">a successful revival of the series for FromSoftware</a>, selling 3m units in under a year. It seems likely the studio would want to build on that success.</p>
<p>All we officially know for sure is that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-is-bloodborne-meets-sekiro-meets-dark-souls-with-jetpacks-and-dinos-thrown-in">The Duskbloods will be heading to Switch 2</a> and will combine vampires with jetpacks and dinosaurs. Miyazaki has also stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-focus-hasnt-shifted-to-multiplayer-miyazaki-says-despite-elden-ring-nightreign-and-the-duskbloods">FromSoftware's focus hasn't shifted to multiplayer</a>, despite this year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> and The Duskbloods.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-reportedly-in-advanced-development-on-an-unannounced-project-alongside-the-duskbloods]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
British video game composer and sound designer Peter Connelly, known for his work on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-games-order">Tomb Raider series</a> alongside the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/watch-dogs">Watch Dogs</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-island-2">Dead Island 2</a>, has been jailed for 16 months after being found guilty of fraudulently claiming a second Covid loan.
</p>
<p>
The news was <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/tomb-raider-video-game-composer-jailed-for-covid-loan-fraud">announced on the UK government's website</a> by its Insolvency Service agency, which appears to have embarked on a flashy series of press releases in recent months featuring dramatic ink-stamp graphics with words like "JAILED", "LOAN FRAUD", and "BANNED".
</p>
<p>
According to the agency's announcement, Connelly overstated his company's turnover to obtain a second Bounce Back Loan of £37,500 in 2020. Bounce Back Loans were provided to businesses who might otherwise have struggled to access finance during the Covid pandemic, but companies were only entitled to one. Connelly is said to have secured his first loan, for £22,000, at a different bank just a month earlier.
</p>
<p>
"Peter Connelly blatantly disregarded the rules of the Bounce Back Loan Scheme, designed to support small and medium-sized businesses during the pandemic," the Insolvency Service's chief investigator David Snasdell said in a statement accompanying the news.
</p>
<p>
In interviews with the Insolvency Service, Connelly told investigators he had been given the potentially lucrative opportunity to re-imagine the music for the Tomb Raider soundtrack, and had taken out personal loans and sold his car to complete the project. Things then "stalled" at the start of the pandemic, and Connelly's company, Peter Connelly Limited, went into liquidation in August 2021 without repaying either loan.
</p>
<p>
Connelly, who previously signed an Individual Voluntary Arrangement agreeing to repay his debts, was found guilty of fraud and was jailed for 16 months by Durham Crown Court on Thursday, 17th July. The 52-year-old is also banned from being a company director for six years.
</p>
<p>
Connelly composed soundtracks for a number of Tomb Raider games while the series was under <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/core-design">Core Design</a>'s stewardship in the 1990s and early 2000s, including The Last Revelation, Chronicles, and The Angel of Darkness. He's also provided sound design work for the likes of Watch Dogs, The Crew, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole">South Park: The Fractured but Whole</a>, and 2023's Dead Island 2.

No, this isn't a wind-up, and he can do what he wants. He created the series. Jeez.</p>
<p>Now, as revealed in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jul/16/top-bananza-donkey-kongs-long-awaited-return-is-a-literal-smash-hit">The Guardian</a>'s interview with Bananza's producer, Kenta Motokura, (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/donkey-kong/nintendo-icon-shigeru-miyamoto-spent-his-time-testing-donkey-kong-bananza-smashing-and-digging-in-one-spot-which-tracks-following-his-hour-long-breath-of-the-wild-playtesting-stint-just-climbing-trees/">GamesRadar</a>), it seems "Shiggy" has an equally unique and stylish way of playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, which involved simply smashing and digging instead of doing anything that would further the campaign along whilst playing a pre-release version of the game.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4onqyph&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Motokura let slip (thanks) that whilst the team had the legendary creator check the unfinished adventure occasionally:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Instead of progressing through the game, he just stuck to one point, smashing and digging around a lot. It was a good thing to see him playing that way … it proved that there are a lot of things that players could potentially be curious about in the game.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmmm. We're gonna be honest, this is how we play, too. Not quite sure what the issue is.</p>
<p>Of course, by having the man transfixed like this on one spot, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> team was able to ascertain that they <em>were</em> onto something good with the basic mechanics at the very least, which, with something as freeform as Bananza and all the voxel-based destruction presented therein, could be a challenge to keep track of.</p>
<p>As Kazuya Takahashi, the game's director, explained in the same interview:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For this sort of game, where you can destroy anything, there was no precedent...So in that sense, we did struggle with various things. Developing the levels was quite challenging. For each stage, we wanted to make sure that the level would be fun even without that destruction element.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even when he's just messing around, it seems, Miyamoto can't help but be useful.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>FromSoftware, the development studio behind the Souls series and the wildly successful Elden Ring, is deep into the development of an unannounced project that could launch in 2026.</p>



<p>According to a new report posted on <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/fromsoftware-i-development-unannounced-project-codenamed-fmc">MP1st</a>, the Japanese development studio is working on multiple projects at this time, including updates for Elden Ring Nightreign, the Nintendo Switch 2 game <a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-announced-exclusively-for-nintendo-switch-2/">The Duskbloods</a> and a third, unannounced multiplatform project codenamed <em>"FMC"</em>. This project is expected to be in an advanced state of development, and should release no later than next year, if there are no delays. Sadly, the codename doesn't tell us much about the project, but as the report noted, projects belonging to the Dark Souls and Armored Core series traditionally have codenames starting with F, so the new project could be related to either series.</p>



<p>If the unannounced project being developed by FromSoftware is indeed related to the Dark Souls series, it will be very interesting to see what it will be. In the past, series creator and studio's president Hidetaka Miyazaki said that the series was done, so it could be either a spin-off or a remaster. In the latter case, it would probably be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dark-souls-3-remaster/">rumored remaster</a> of the third entry in the series, as both the first and the second entries in the series have already been remastered.</p>



<p>The aforementioned Elden Ring Nightreign is the latest game released by FromSoftware, a co-op game which masterfully combines the mechanics of Elden Ring and the Souls series with some roguelite elements. You can learn more about the game now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">review.</a></p>

These days, it's hard to figure out what it represents, beyond reckless spending, endless layoffs, and countless pivots to trying to figure out the future of games.</em></p><p><em>Today, Rob and Patrick chat about how Xbox did (or didn't) enter their lives when the console first launched in 2002, and the different ways seminal games like Halo signaled a sea change in the relationship between consoles and PCs.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>There were two formative first-person-shooter moments in my friend group: <em>GoldenEye</em> and <em>Halo</em>. These were games that we played often enough with the exact same groups of people that the modifiers in the video games themselves to change how matches played out was never enough; we’d come up with our own house rules that defined how we wanted to play.</p><p>With <em>GoldenEye</em>, I remember that we’d call out one another if someone else was overly relying on determining where someone was based on looking at their section of the split screen on the TV. We also banned people from playing as Oddjob, unless someone was a dick and decided to pick Oddjob anyway. At that point, the group would gang up on Oddjob and make sure they lost.</p><p>It was also a race before someone screamed “GOLDEN GUN,” because the mode where you could one-shot someone was deliriously fun. There was no faster way to make someone upset.</p><p>It was six years in-between <em>GoldenEye</em> and <em>Halo</em>, and while my friends and I still regularly played video games with one another, it wasn’t until <em>Halo</em> arrived that it became an appointment all over again. Hangout sessions after school were determined by “Where are we playing Halo?”</p><p>Because unlike the Nintendo 64 era, where fewer of my friends owned video game consoles and it was largely people using all the ones I’d been amassing in my room, a lotta folks had an Xbox. They played other video games on it, but for young teenagers it was really a Halo box.</p><p>The difference between 1995 and 2001 was also that we were a little older and a little meaner than before. <em>Halo</em> produced legitimate arguments where friends would storm out in protest, especially during moments where it felt like everyone was secretly ganging up to kill one person over another. Most of the time, they were right to be angry, because we <em>were</em> secretly plotting.</p><p>Xbox felt, I don’t know, <em>edgy</em>?&nbsp;</p><p>I was 16 years old, too young to articulate what I found appealing about a new game console other than “hey, it’s new,” because I was legitimately hoovering up everything I could get my hands on in those days. But dude, that launch era up for Xbox was killer in retrospect, and so when I say “edgy” I probably mean “different.” <em>Dead or Alive 3</em> was probably the last time I spent significant time memorizing fighting game moves. <em>Oddworld: Munch’s Odyssey </em>was just plain weird.<em> Project Gotham Racing</em>. <em>Jet Set Radio Future</em>. (I will defend that game!). <em>Gunvalkyrie</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Scrolling through a list of Xbox games produces a reaction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Xbox_games?ref=remapradio.com"><u>“oh, <em>that</em> game.”</u></a></p><p>There was a sweaty desperation from Xbox that I found appealing. You knew they had something to prove, they didn’t exactly have an identity, and it felt like it wasn’t playing it safe.</p><p>I think you were mostly playing on PC during this era, but what did Xbox mean to you then?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@jawfox_photography?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Alexander Jawfox</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>I have a hard time figuring out what I felt about the Xbox era versus the 360 era. There was always a mix of trepidation, resentment, and excitement. You have to remember, <em>Halo </em>was going to be a PC game. There had already been major previews for it, it was something I was excited about. The realization that it was going to exclusive to this new console, the pitch for which felt like it was staking out a position between PC gaming and traditional consoles, made me wonder what it meant for the PC. If a home computer developer like Bungie could turn its back on the PC to promote a console, did that mean the PC was going to start losing a lot of games and genres to the Xbox? By the middle of the 360 era, that worry had been compounded by a glut of third-rate PC ports, the abysmal Games for Windows experiment (man, Microsoft not really knowing what to do with all this is nothing new, is it?), and the outright hostility a lot of publishers had to the PC as a platform. The Xbox may have been aimed at Sony and to a lesser extent Nintendo, but its success had brought forth a really troubled, frustrating era for PC gamers like myself.</p><p>On the other hand, it did that partially by being really good at translating PC games to a console format. It felt like a <em>miracle </em>the first time I saw <em>Halo </em>running on the Xbox. How could a game that incredible-looking run so seamlessly on a box that cost half what a mid-range PC build would run you? I resented the shit out of that console because outside of strategy games, it was clearly the easiest and best way to play most shooters and increasingly even RPGs now. Sports games existed solely on the consoles, largely thanks to EA’s exclusivity and (temporary) near-abandonment of the PC. When the 360 came out and suddenly it basically had solved all the friction of online play? You didn’t need to be whispering IRC channels and Vent servers to people over multiplayers servers? Meanwhile everything on the PC was a huge pain in the ass and actually getting more so because so many games were lousy ports burdened with terrible bloatware.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Julian LeFay - who oversaw multiple Elder Scrolls games as chief engineer at Bethesda, and is often referred to as the 'father' of the series - is stepping back from game development to spend his "remaining time with his family and loved ones" following his cancer diagnosis.
</p>
<p>
LeFay joined Bethesda shortly after its founding in 1987, and worked on the likes of The Elder Scrolls: Arena in 1994 and its 1996 sequel Daggerfall, before departing the company in 1998. LeFay briefly returned for The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind, and pursued various other ventures before setting up independent studio OnceLost Games with fellow Elder Scrolls alumni Ted Peterson and Vijay Lakshman in 2019. Since then, the studio has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-wayward-realms-is-a-grand-rpg-by-former-elder-scrolls-devs">working on The Wayward Realms</a>, an open-world RPG announced in 2021.
</p>
<p>
News of LeFay's departure from the project, and from game development as a whole, was announced in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwMyPR8Li6k">emotional video addressed to The Wayward Realms community</a> on YouTube. "Our technical producer Julian LeFay, who I'm sure needs no introduction, has been fighting a battle with cancer for the last several years," creative producer Victor Villarreal explained. "He's fought bravely and strongly but it seems he doesn't have very much time left. He has stepped away from the project to spend that remaining time with his family and loved ones."

<p>
Villarreal also invited fans to "share any words, thoughts, or memories you might have of Julian, as well as any well-wishes you might have for his family." He noted the studio would discuss how the news impacts The Wayward Realms at a later date, adding: "It is something we've been preparing for. Julian has made his vision of the game very clear to the team and we will work tirelessly to bring that vision to life."
</p>
<p>
A separate, lengthier statement from LeFay's long-time friend and colleague Ted Peterson was shared alongside the video. "I could talk stories about our friendship and how we've worked together recently with our team on Wayward Realms as creative and technical directors," Peterson wrote, "but I need to come to the point of this. Julian has been courageously battling cancer. His doctors have informed us that his time with us is limited, and we are preparing to say goodbye to a true legend of the industry."
</p>
<p>
"Obviously, the team has already had a chance to say goodbye and give their individual messages, and I sat by his hospital bed, reading them to him," Peterson continued. "In that case, I was reading them out loud and Julian was giving me dictation to reply back, which is rather hard to do through my tears... To me, this is deeply personal, and I regret every second I didn't spend with one of the most charming, smart, funny, and interesting people I've ever met. It's also a spur to action for me: I will not let down his legacy."
</p>
<p>
"That said," Peterson concluded, "a final quote from the eminently quotable Julian LeFay. He said this at our last team meeting, and I believe it represents him and his beliefs well. 'It is personal. And if it's not personal, then you're just doing work for hire and you'll never have the motivation to accomplish a significant goal.'"
</p>
<p>
OnceLost also <a href="https://x.com/OnceLostGames/status/1945983192617652588">shared a follow-up message</a> from LeFay's daughter Shae on its social media page. "The best any of us can hope for is to leave this life and know that we have made a positive impact," she wrote. "That is my dad's greatest motivation to this very day. We are truly grateful for the outpouring of love and support since the announcement was made."
</p>
<p>
"It has reinvigorated both myself and my father and given us a sense of peace in stressful times, knowing of the impact he has made on all of you. Thank you, from the bottom of our hearts, everyone. We will continue to read the comments to keep our sprits up in the days ahead."

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/mini-review-waterfield-designs-cityslicker-for-switch-2-a-classic-design-lives-on</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-waterfield-designs-cityslicker-for-switch-2-a-classic-design-lives-on.1247082/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="WaterField Designs CitySlicker - front" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b014b30eaf852/waterfield-designs-cityslicker-front.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Sasha Stowe</em></figcaption></figure><p>The WaterField Designs CitySlicker is a design that has been around for at least 10 years, and it has barely aged a day. From its full-grain leather front flap to its pleasingly voluminous rear mesh pouch, it’s a case that oozes quality and style, which is just as well given the $129 price tag.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is not a cheap case, we should nip that in the bud right away. But it’s unfair to judge a case on that alone, and when you consider that this is a product that has been handmade in San Francisco with seriously high-quality materials, you’ll realise that although the price is steep, you <em>absolutely</em> get what you pay for.</p>
<p>Its slim profile means it’ll slip into practically any bag that would’ve fit the console in the first place, and the internal padding not only keeps the console in place, but also provides some handy little bonus pockets should you wish to use them, although I wouldn’t recommend putting anything bulky or awkwardly shaped in them, as you could put undue pressure on your console.</p>

<p>What’s more, the padding for the screen is a red microfibre pad, meaning every time you put your console in or take it out, the screen is getting a little polish to take off the worst of your grubby fingerprints. Now <em>that’s</em> service!</p>
<p>You’ve also got five little leather pockets to store some game cards at the front, and although they’re a little stiff at first, the nature of the material means that the more you use them, the easier they’ll be to use. The magnetic clasps on the flap mean everything you put in absolutely will be staying in its place, and that peace of mind is worth its weight in precious materials.</p>
<p>We do have one minor gripe, however, and that’s the rigidity of the case. When your console isn’t inside, it’s surprisingly bendy, and doesn’t offer much in the way of support for itself, no doubt due to the extended length of the case and our old friend <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square%E2%80%93cube_law">the square-cube law</a>. We’re sure it’s not going to cause any issues, but it’s something to consider should you wish to pick one of these up.</p>
<p>And honestly, if you have the cash, you should. That, or perhaps their magnetic version if simplicity is more your bag (read: case).</p>



<p><em>Waterfield's CitySlicker for Switch 2 is priced at $129 and produced in batches that <a href="https://www.sfbags.com/products/nintendo-switch-cityslicker-case">you can pre-order from their website</a>. The sample used in this review was provided by the manufacturer.</em></p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> developers Arrowhead have made clear that they're still very much all-in on the game right now, with adding more stuff to the good shootery thing they've got going being the main focus. That said, the studio's bigwigs have provided a couple of hints at what the future might hold for them, with the latest being that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> 3 is "hopefully many years away".</p>
<p>Also, they aren't fans of players <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-players-are-pushing-to-rename-one-of-super-earths-cities-gun">voting to rename a city on Super Earth 'Gun'</a>, which is a thing that's been going on in Helldiverland lately.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This rare mention of the next Helldivers game is from Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani, who hopped on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1395509386113450106">the game's Discord last night</a>, and was asked to paint a picture of what the next two years of Helldivers could look like.</p>
<p>"I'm very bought into the vision that Micke, Felix, Niklas and Marre (our game directors) and Johan have for the game," he responded, "It's great to be part of the ride. We honestly are focusing on the here and now. HD3 is hopefully many years away." This is one of very few times, as someone who's been covering Helldivers pretty closely over the past year, I can recall Jorjani ever mentioning Helldivers 3 by name.</p>
<p>When he talked about the studio's future on the same Discord server <a href="https://www.vg247.com/helldivers-2-ceo-still-main-focus-next-game-start-slowly-this-year">back in May</a>, he referred to whatever Arrowhead's next project is as "Game 6", which is an altogether more mysterious way to refer to something he said a "very, very small team" would start working on later this year. Meanwhile, Jorjani's predecessor and Helldivers 2 director Johan Pilestedt has very much said Helldivers 3, but only when <a href="https://www.vg247.com/helldivers-2-growing-into-helldivers-3-says-arrowhead-cco-pilestedt-taking-design-suggestions-miniguns">suggesting on Twitter</a> that Arrowhead would transform Helldivers 2 into that next game by continuing to update what they've already got on the go.</p>
<p>Nothing in what Jorjani said here contradicts any of that, but assuming the grow-one-game-into-another plan is still on the cards, it's noteworthy that he mentions HD3 by name, rather than just telling folks Helldivers 2's the thing to watch.</p>
<p>Anyway, beyond that, this spot of Discord chatter also saw Jorjani tell another player that the devs have discussed adding support for DLSS and FSR frame generation, but "other more fundamental problems that impact performance" will need sorting first.</p>
<p>Also, he voted for Everlasting Memory in Arrowhead's ongoing poll to pick a new name for the Super Earth city of Remembrance, which players recently helped rebuild via their in-game exploits, and are hellbent on renaming 'Gun' Jorjani joked about Arrowhead possibly naming the city what the studio likes anyway, adding: "I really don't like the name <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gun">GUN</a> personally. but not my decision".</p>
<p>Shooting from the hip there, Mr video game fellow.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-3-is-hopefully-many-years-away-says-arrowheads-ceo-who-did-not-vote-for-gun]]></content:encoded>
