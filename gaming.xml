			<p>Right, let’s get this out of the way early, Mighty Morphin’ Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind sadly isn’t very good. I know, I know, I’m as disappointed as you are as this felt like it would be the second coming of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/29/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tmnt-shredders-revenge-review/">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</a> just with Power Rangers – who are probably, maybe, just as awesome as our friendly neighbourhood heroes in a half-shell. A 2D side-scrolling beat ‘em up with retro arcade visuals and shoot ‘em up sections, I mean, what could go wrong? As it turns out, quite a lot.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers: Rita's Rewind | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgm1RkQgp5E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First off though, in terms of what it <em>does</em> get right, Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind absolutely nails the aesthetic. The opening theme-music drips nostalgia and superbly sets the tone, giving you all of the retro feels. For people of a certain age, this is your childhood, but in 2024. Even better, the game itself has the sheen of a coin-up arcade screen overlaying the visuals, really cementing the sense of playing this game in your local arcade – you know, the one that no longer exists.</p>


<p>The chunky pixellated characters have a lot of charm, the Rangers themselves ninja flipping smoothly across the levels, whilst the never-ending horde of Putties you face are decent, if rather bland, punching bags. Thankfully, the look of the bosses is much more like it, correctly channelling the Saturday-morning TV shoddiness of the original much-loved Power Rangers series.</p>
<p>Smartly, the game is subdivided into a TV episode structure. Your team of Rangers face reams of goons, before battling a boss who, of course, runs off. You give chase in your Dinozord, blasting away in shooting sections that honour the almost-3D sequences of Sega’s classic game Afterburner. Then the boss gets biggified and your Dinozords combine to build the mech-like Megazord, resulting in a ginormous scrap.</p>


<p>Sadly, once you get to actually playing Power Rangers: Rita’s Revenge, things fall apart pretty quickly. Beat ‘em up sections are dull and pedestrian, with lacklustre collision detection proving a constant irritation. Think you’re lined up on the correct parallel plain to punch a Putty? Well, the game is pretty sure you are wrong, every time. Resulting in your Ranger unleashing a devastating flurry of fist-based pain on some innocent thin air.</p>
<p>Next to nothing of interesting or note happens across a level either; you pummel the same small selection of goons again and again and there are no weapons to pick-up or vehicles to control. Even local co-op fails to elevate proceedings, due to the Rangers themselves playing exactly the same. Sure, their disappointingly limited range of attacks look a bit different, but they have identical form and function. Unlike, TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge you won’t find any levelling up or new attacks to unlock here, just the same paltry selection of attack combos, jumps and throws.</p>
<p>Even the ultimate attacks are basically just colour-pallet swaps; the lack of imagination here, considering the rich and varied source-material, is truly disheartening. Indeed, the only interesting occurrence as you walk from left to right is when a Putty comes out with a green time crystal that rewinds time – admittedly accompanied by neat VHS effects – until you destroy it. Though this one good idea is itself rewound and reused so many times that it is soon rendered dull.</p>

<p>Whilst the beat ‘em up section are serviceable but uninspired, the shoot ‘em-up sections are a mess. Visually incoherent with a smorgasbord of explosions and effects, it’s almost impossible to tell where your Dinozord is as it runs towards the horizon, let alone navigate all the obstacles and enemies heading your way. Unlike Afterburner, Outrun or other arcade titles from the era, these shoot ‘em up section fail to recreate any sense of depth, resulting in even more confusion as everything is given a flat appearance. Good luck trying to tell to how close a runaway truck is, as it supposedly careens its way into your path. Irritating and pointless, the shoot ‘em up levels of this game should have been made skippable.</p>
<p>Which just leaves the Megazord smackdowns, which, frankly, suck. Played from a first-person perspective, the players pass the controller and take it in turn to battle the villain of the week. Dodging attacks, finding an opening, punching the big baddy and charging up your sword is the format. It’s kind of interesting in your first encounter with Goldar, but the same boss-fight structure with a different character model is repeated ad-nauseum.</p>

<p>Controls here are loose and inexact, and the whole thing is frustrating and poorly conceived, with little sense of satisfaction if you emerge triumphant as your victory was likely more down to luck than any skill or intention. You know when players are choosing to skip their go, that this part of the game is a dud.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/itchio-offline-funko-phishing-brandshield<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie storefront Itch.io was taken offline for several hours earlier today owing to what the site's owner describes as a "bogus phishing report" for a fanmade page based on the Funko toy property.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/itchio/status/1866017758040993829" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message on social media platform X</a>, Itch.io says its site was "taken down by Funko" due to "trash 'AI Powered' brand protection software called BrandShield", which flagged a page on the site as fraud, leading to domain registrar IWantMyName to "ignore" Itch.io's response, "just disabl[ing] the domain".</p>

<p>Over on YCombinator's <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42364033" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hacker News portal</a>, Itch.io owner Leaf Corcoran provides some additional context. He says that someone "made a fan page" for Funko video game&nbsp;<em>Funko Fusion</em>, and that page contained "links to the official site and screenshots of the game".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/itch.io-offline-funko-phishing-funko-fusion.jpg?itok=6hgGTbKA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/itch.io-offline-funko-phishing-funko-fusion.jpg?itok=MFg27tw3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A fan-made&nbsp;<em>Funko Fusion&nbsp;</em>Itch.io page is apparently what led to the site being shut down for several hours.</figcaption></figure><p>Corcoran speculates that the aforementioned BrandShield software is "probably instructed to eradicate all 'unauthorized' use of [Funko's] trademark", and so the software sent phishing and fraud reports to Itch.io's domain registrar.</p>

<p>He goes on to say that he first received reports of the alerts from IWantMyName and host Linode "about 5 or 6 days ago", and that he had removed the offending page and disabled the associated account. The matter was settled with Linode fairly swiftly, while IWantMyName "never responded" to Corcoran's actions.</p>

<p>The Itch.io site owner says he's "assuming no-one on [IWantMyName's] end 'closed' the ticket, so it went into an automatic system to disable the domain after some number of days".</p>

<p>The whole debacle rather sounds like a series of automated systems being set off for circumstances they should probably never even have raised an eyebrow at, but at any rate, Itch.io is now back up, so there's that, at least.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/brandshield-itch.io-down-phishing-claim-funko.jpg?itok=nAKf0auw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/brandshield-itch.io-down-phishing-claim-funko.jpg?itok=wwMs9_5I 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Itch.io owner Leaf Corcoran lays the blame for the site's outage squarely at "brand protection" suite BrandShield's door.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, several developers and industry figures have <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/djlink.bsky.social/post/3lcuf4dlf2s2w" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">responded</a> to Itch.io's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alienmelon.bsky.social/post/3lcuiisohfs2e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">outage</a> with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brandon.insertcredit.com/post/3lcuf5bqfwc2m" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">disappointment</a> at Funko and BrandShield, which isn't hard to understand given that the outage meant many indie devs couldn't sell their products for a number of hours.</p>

<p>Given that Itch.io routinely raises quite a lot of money <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/itchio-ukraine-bundle-raises-63-million" rel="nofollow">for charity</a> -&nbsp; as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/itchio-black-friday-sale-gives-creators-all-revenue" rel="nofollow">developers themselves</a> - with its bundles and fundraising efforts, it's probably in Funko and BrandShield's best interests to make sure this doesn't happen again, assuming they are the ones at fault.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/09/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-launch-day-update-adds-full-ray-tracing-on-pc/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The first update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is now available alongside today’s full launch of the game. It’s a big one for PC gamers, with the addition of path tracing (AKA full ray tracing) for NVidia GPUs, but there’s also bug fixes across the game.</p>
<p>Path tracing completely replaces the game’s lighting and reflections using the ray tracing tech built into Nvidia GPUs, where the fallback mode is a hybrid that includes ray traced global illumination and more traditional techniques for light, reflections, shadows and the like. It will be equivalent to the path tracing option that was patched in for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>… and it’s similarly expensive on the GPU, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/04/indiana-jones-and-the-giant-circle-minimum-specs-recommended-ultra-pc-requirements-4k-ray-tracing/">MachineGames recommending GeForce RTX 40 Series cards</a> and requiring the use of upscaling.</p>


<p>Speaking of which, the only upscaling techniques are currently Nvidia’s DLSS and a generic TAAU, but AMD FSR will be added in a future update. Oh, and a pesky dynamic resolution bug that affected us when playing with an AMD GPU has also been fixed by this update.</p>
<p>Out now across PC, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and via certain tiers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a>, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is a great adaptation that defies the expectations of gun-heavy Uncharted-alike in favour of something more considered and true to the films. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review/">our review</a> I said, “Indiana Jones and the Great Circle forges its own, distinctive path as an archeological adventure, excellently capturing the feel of the films with its visuals and performances.

			<p>Bloodborne's emulation on PC is continuing to get improved almost daily, thanks to new updates to the ShadPS4 emulator and mods that improve the game's visuals to provide a truly remastered experience.</p>
<p>The latest work-in-progress build of the ShadPS4 emulator, version 0.4.1, addresses some of the issues that have been causing frequent crashing while playing the PlayStation 4 exclusive on PC, such as RAM usage spikes, and excessive VRAM usage, as reported in a new video shared by tabeneru on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@tabeneru" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a>. The new version of the emulator seems to reduce VRAM usage considerably, so the game should now run better on a variety of system configurations.</p>
<p><iframe title="ShadPS4 0.4.1 WIP - Bloodborne PC Huge Improvement (RAM SPIKE FIX &amp; VRAM USAGE REDUCED)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FYN56lE-Fi0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Besides general emulation improvements that are also benefiting the game, Bloodborne is getting improved by the hard work of modders. Today, a new version of the Enable Dynamic Shadow mod was released on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/160?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, further improving the dynamic shadows the mod introduces. While <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-visual-improvements-video/">fromsoftserve's remastering project</a> also does the same, this mod is being manually tuned for the best results. You can check out how much dynamic shadows improve the game's visuals in the screenshots below.</p>

<p>Bloodborne is only one of the games that the ShadPS4 emulator can run reasonably well on PC.

            <p>The big question a Tekken player always wants to know is: which DLC character is coming next? Well, you'll know by the end of the week, as the studio is planning to reveal this at Geoff Keighley's winter festival of expensive advertising, the Game Awards. However, there may already be some clues in a trailer they've just released, which suggests some sisterful slapping is overdue. The trailer also promises new moves for all characters in a Season 2 update next spring, along with some minor presents in a winter update due sooner than that. But yes, come see for yourself.

<p>You see the helicopter chasing Nina Williams at 2:12? It has a lipsticky kiss mark on the missile, a nod to scrappy sister Anna Williams, the red roughhouser to Nina's purple pugilist. That puts Anna a good bet for the reveal, but who knows? It could all be a scarlet red herring. The developers are planning to reveal all on Thursday evening (that's the wee hours of Friday morning for us in the UK).</p>
<p>More concretely, the trailer promises new moves for every chracter, in case the hundred attacks of the average character aren't enough for you (I see my favourite coffee baroness Azucena performing a freshly brewed sweepy kick). There's also going to be a "major balance update", which for Tekken often means a lot of changes to frame data for various attacks across all characters. Finally, the trailer pumps up the Tekken World Tour - the annual fraternal fisticuffs that is often interesting but I most fondly remember for 	<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-tekken-player-in-the-world-is-a-panda">crowning a Panda as the globe's best bare-knuckle brawler</a>.</p><p>But that's all Season 2 stuff. Players will get the winter update before all that, and it is slightly less dramatic. It'll offer the gift of extra photo mode features, for example. This will let you add "wetness" and "grime" to fighters' faces (it's just what I always wanted!). You'll also soon be able to search for other players online by username. Extra slots for customised characters will get added early next year too, say the devs.</p>
<p>The latest entry in the Iron Fist Tournament is pretty slick, as I judged in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tekken-8-review">Tekken 8 review</a>. But it's also missing the characters I love most (Lei, Miguel, Josie), which is ultimately why <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken-7">Tekken 7</a> is the bruiser that got onto our list of the best games, aka <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rps-100-2024">the RPS 100</a>. Anna, she's cool and all. But can she pretend to be drunk and roll around on the ground to freak out her opponent? No. </p>

<p>The Australian Classification Board has refused to classify Hunter X Hunter Nen X Impact.</p>



<p>If you head to the Australian Classification Board <a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/hunterhunter-nenimpact" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>, you will see that Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact has been classified as ‘RC’ or ‘Refused Classification’. The website has not provided a reason for refusing classification and has asked fans to contact them for further clarification on their decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Australian Classification Board provided a statement to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/489089/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-refused-classification-australia-ban-rating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a> regarding the classification of Hunter x Hunter Nen X Impact, explaining that the game was refused classification due to “a visual depiction of implied sexual violence, where an adult male exposes himself to persons under the age of 18 years.”&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The Australian Classification Board added:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The Board noted in its report that the implied sexual violence is implicitly condoned as appropriate due to a lack of resolution of the act through the game’s narrative and that it is not justified by context. Implied sexual violence that is visually depicted, interactive, not justified by context, or related to incentives or rewards is not permitted.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Currently, Hunter X Hunter Nen X Impact does not have a concrete release date, but it is scheduled to arrive at some point in 2025 for PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC.&nbsp;</p>

Others, however, believe the bottom left 'finger' is simply flesh falling off the little finger above it, although there are irregularities with the present boxes and ribbons in the bottom right, too. Generative AI often struggles with hands, adding extra fingers where they shouldn't be.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/09/share-20241206-1244480-1-1733745842140.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Black Ops 6's 'Necroclaus' loading screen.

Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked Activision for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The release of the Zombie Santa image sparked a closer look at other images in Black Ops 6, which some in the Call of Duty community have now called into question. Redditor Shaun_LaDee highlighted three images included in paid bundles that have irregularities that could suggest the use of generative AI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are now calling on Activision to disclose the use of generative AI for art that is included in bundles that are sold. And as others have pointed out, Steam operator Valve now has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3862463747997849618" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI disclosure rules</a> that call on publishers and developers to describe how they use AI in the development and execution of their games. As part of this, Valve has told developers it will include their disclosures on the Steam store page of their game, “so customers can also understand how the game uses AI.” Currently, Call of Duty’s Steam page has no such disclosure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In July, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wired</a> reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-reportedly-sold-an-ai-generated-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-cosmetic">Activision sold an “AI-generated cosmetic” for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 last year</a>. The cosmetic in question was not named, but was linked to the Yokai’s Wrath bundle released in December 2023. The store did not disclose any use of generative AI for this bundle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This bundle cost 1,500 COD Points, the premium virtual currency sold for real-world money that generates hundreds of millions of dollars for Activision each year. 1,500 COD Points is approximately valued at $15.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wired pointed out that Microsoft, which owns Activision Blizzard after its $69 billion acquisition of the company last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce"><u>cut 1,900 staff from its gaming business</u></a> just months after Activision sold this skin. The report alleged that 2D artists’ jobs were being replaced by AI at the company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A lot of 2D artists were laid off,” one anonymous Activision artist told the site. “Remaining concept artists were then forced to use AI to aid in their work.” Activision employees were allegedly “made” to sign up for AI training, with its use promoted throughout the business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Generative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. Generative AI thus far has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-made-purely-with-ai-failed-because-tech-was-unable-to-replace-talent"><u>The game failed</u></a>, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Bandai Namco's shuttered MMORPG Blue Protocol project has been extended a new lifeline courtesy of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>-funded developer Bokura.</p>
<p>At the end of August, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namco-and-amazon-games-published-mmorpg-blue-protocol-has-worldwide-release-cancelled">Bandai Namco announced plans to shut down the servers of its anime MMORPG Blue Protocol</a> in Japan and cancelled its release in the West altogether, saying "it will not be possible to provide a service that satisfies all of you".</p>

<p>Now, however, Blue Protocol has been reincarnated as Star Resonance, with some of its original development team joining the new one at Bokura. Although set in the same world as Blue Protocol, Regnas, the team said Star Resonance players can expect a reworked gameplay and storyline.</p>
<p>And it seems Bokura has hit the ground running, too. A <a href="https://bpm.bkrgame.com/web202412/news-detail.html?newsid=18543902">closed beta test</a> is already planned for players on Android devices and PC, although sadly, that's only open to Chinese players for now.</p>
<p>As yet, there's no firm release date either in China, Japan, or beyond. Blue Protocol's servers are due to go dark on 18th January 2025 (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/bandai-namcos-unsuccessful-mmorpg-blue-protocol-to-be-reincarnated-as-star-resonance-by-chinese-studio/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>Ed went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blue-protocol-is-amazons-next-punt-on-east-meets-west">hands-on with Blue Protocol last year</a>, which was set to follow the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lost-ark">Lost Ark</a> and New World as Amazon Games' next big MMO. However, he had concerns of whether the game could differentiate itself from its key competitors.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle looks stunning with <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-enables-path-tracing-on-nvidia-rtx-gpus-amd-fsr-to-be-added-later/">path tracing</a>, but even the most powerful GPUs currently on the market cannot run the game at native 4K resolution and max setting at anything above 30 FPS.</p>
<p>Making some compromises in terms of settings and resolution, however, definitely looks worth it, as path tracing makes the game developed by MachineGames outright stunning, as highlighted in a comparison video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TyrianYT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tyrian</a> on YouTube. The video also clearly shows how an RTX 4080 has trouble hitting 60 FPS during the introduction sequence at 4K resolution and with NVIDIA DLSS at the Balanced setting.</p>

<p>Much like the other games supporting path tracing like Cyberpunk 2077 and Alan Wake 2, Indiana Jones and The Great Circle makes it pretty clear that it will be some time until it will be possible to run games with full path tracing at high native resolutions, as even an RTX 4090 cannot push past the 30 FPS mark at native 4K resolution and max settings, as shown in the test shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Mostly_Positive_Reviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mostly Positive Reviews</a>. The most powerful GPU on the market struggles at native 1440p resolution as well, barely hitting the 50 FPS range in the most demanding of the two testing scenarios.</p>

<p>Leaks about upcoming playable Marvel Rivals characters have surfaced online, revealing new details about Ultron and The Thing.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-the-thing-leak">Marvel Rivals The Thing Leak</h2>



<p>The Thing is set to be <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1865513703044485624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">another Tank</a> for Marvel Rivals. The character’s passive ability is Solid as a Rock, which makes him immune to enemy knockback and displacement effects. The character’s primary attack is Combination Punch, which releases quick and continuous punches. Their secondary attack is Thunderbolt Punch, which releases a devastating blow at the enemy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Thing’s E ability in Marvel Rivals is Battlefield Support, which will make him jump towards teammates and reduce damage for allies and himself. His L Shift move is Furious Charge, which triggers a Continuous Forward charge that pummels enemies in your way and leaves a seismic zone behind you. Lastly, The Thing’s ultimate is called Slam Moment, and it knocks all enemies in front of you in the air.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-ultron-leak-nbsp">Marvel Rivals Ultron Leak&nbsp;</h2>



<p>As per <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1864338925164093603" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">RivalLeaks</a> on X (formerly Twitter), Ultron will be a supporting character in Marvel Rivals. His primary attack will be the Encephalo-Ray, an energy beam, and his secondary move is Dynamic Flight, which allows him to quickly fly in the direction of movement and then enter a free-flight mode. Ultron’s E ability is Imperative: Firewall, which provides health to allies within range with the help of drones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultron’s L Shift ability in Marvel Rivals is Imperative: Patch, which releases a giant drone that follows an ally, healing them and others within range. Ultron’s passive ability, called Algorithm Correction, allows him to jump and fall slowly. His ultimate is Rage of Ultron, which releases Ultron Drones that Encephalo-Rays at enemies or heal allies. RivalLeaks added in another post that Ultron might be released <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1865940057988935760" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sooner than we think</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players should know that Marvel Rivals has not officially announced The Thing or Ultron as upcoming playable characters.</p>



<p>In other news, Marvel Rivals has hit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-10-million-players-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million players in just three days</a>. Also, here’s how to get the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-free-iron-man-armor-model-42-costume-in-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Iron Man Armor Model 42 Costume</a> in the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/tired-of-waiting-for-gta-6-news-fans-begin-making-the-games-map-themselves<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
A year has now passed since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-the-things-we-noticed-in-the-gta-6-trailer-you-may-have-missed">Rockstar's record-breaking first Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer</a> landed, and there's been no real news on the game since.
</p>
<p>
While some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-fans-think-rockstars-hidden-yet-another-clue-in-the-moon">fans look to GTA 6's moon for word on when we'll hear more</a>, others are taking matters into their own hands - by going back to last December's trailer and using it to build bits of the game for themselves. 
</p>
<p>
There are several shots in the video below by YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FyfT3zs3mQ">Dark Space</a> that, at a glance, could be mistaken for the real thing. The video shows a street from Vice Beach and some of the  downtown Stockyard area recreated using custom assets and the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> engine.
</p>

<p>
Later, Dark Space mocks up a rumoured cutscene, where players will apparently hook a chain to a safe to rip it out of a pawn shop using a truck. As they say, it'll be interesting to see how close to the final game all of this looks - whenever the time comes.
</p><p>
There's also a section where we see the estimated size of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>'s map from above, as a plane flies over both it and the GTA 5 map at the same speed. The inferrance here is that GTA 6's map will be bigger than its predecessor's - though this was to be expected, and exact measurements are likely best saved for the final game.

Rockstar publisher Take-Two has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-doubles-down-on-gta-6-release-date-after-delay-rumours">GTA 6 set to launch in late 2025</a>. Next year is a big one for the company, with Borderlands 4 and Mafia: The Old Country both also set to arrive between April 2025 and the end of March 2026.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-reveal-trailer-brilliantly-recreated-in-real-life">GTA 6 reveal trailer has been recreated</a>. Earlier this year, fans remade the video using real-life footage and actors.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> has released a new job trailer for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> Mobile, showing its touchscreen battles for the first time.</p>
<p>The UI for Final Fantasy 14 - as with many MMORPGs - is particularly complex, with each job (or class) having multiple abilities mapped out on a player's hotbar. With the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-mobile-officially-revealed">announcement of Final Fantasy 14 Mobile</a>, many players wondered how this would transition to a mobile touchscreen.</p>
<p>Well now we know. The trailer - <a href="https://weibo.com/tv/show/1034:5108677439324201">shared on Chinese social media site Weibo</a> - includes battle animations for all of the nine starting jobs, with their various job actions located in the bottom right of the screen around a large central primary attack used for continuous combos.</p>

<p>Players can then cycle through abilities, with cooldowns clearly displayed, while health and MP are located at the bottom of the screen as always.</p>
<p>It's tidy but, personally, looks far too small. When some jobs have up to 11 abilities to choose from, those ability icons look impossible to accurately select, while the fonts are tiny.</p>
<p>The trailer also does not include any character movement during battle, perhaps suggesting a simplified battle system without positionals (attacks where position around an enemy is vital for dealing damage). This also means there's no dodging of AoE attacks in this trailer, though perhaps that's indicative of a lazy player relying too much on their healer (we all know this from bitter experience).</p><p>Speaking of healing, the Scholar and White Mage jobs are the only characters in the trailer to switch targets (all others face a single enemy). It's still unclear how switching between friend and foe will work, though appears to be a quick direct tap of the screen - something else that could get fiddly in the heat of battle.</p>
<p>Still, it's impressive to see running and appears faithful to the original experience. Fans appear particularly impressed by the Monk and Summoner animations.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 14 Mobile will be free-to-play without gacha, and will follow the base game A Realm Reborn.</p> <div>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>'s fourth season starts tomorrow, marking the beginning of the end for Rocksteady's current roadmap.</p>
<p>From 10th December, players will be met with DC supervillain Deathstroke. The developer shared news of his debut with an image on social media platform X, although further details on the upcoming season for now remain pretty thin for now.</p>
<p>Rocksteady has thus far only committed to four seasons of content for Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. It shared its <a href="https://x.com/suicidesquadRS/status/1749494429768146999/photo/1">2024 roadmap back in January</a>, promising new weapons, environments, gear and more. Things kicked off with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squads-first-post-launch-season-includes-playable-elseworlds-joker">arrival of The Joker in March</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squads-second-season-adds-frozone-esque-mrs-freeze">Mrs. Freeze joined in the summer</a>.</p>

<p>More recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-season-three-debuts-to-less-than-300-steam-players">Zoe Lawton joined for Kill the Justice League's third season</a>. However, her debut didn't particularly spark much enthusiasm among players. Perhaps Deathstroke will have better luck.</p>
<p>Then, after season four comes to an end, who knows what is going to happen with Suicide Sqaud: Kill the Justice League. It is fair to say the game failed to take off the way Rocksteady and publisher Warner Bros. had hoped.</p>

<p>Back in February of this year, Warner Bros. Discovery's chief financial officer Gunnar Wiedenfels said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">Rocksteady's release had "fallen short" of its expectations</a>. Warner Bros. went on to attribute a $200m revenue loss to Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.</p>
<p>A report then followed in July, which stated a culture of perfectionism, an ill-suited genre pivot, and a constantly shifting vision were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flopped-due-to-perfectionism-and-ill-suited-genre-pivot-report">key reasons for the live-service game's failure</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sega has announced a sequel to its official Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba game, based on the popular manga and anime series.</p>
<p>Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles 2 will arrive next year across PC via Steam, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and the "Nintendo Switch family of systems".</p>
<p>Like the first game, this will be an arena fighter with a story mode continuing where the original left off. It follows teenage protagonist Tanjiro Kamado and promises fans will be able to "relive many of the exciting moments from 'Entertainment District Arc', 'Swordsmith Village Arc', and 'Hashira Training Arc'".</p>

<p>Over in VS mode, the game will have a huge roster of 40 characters, including a return of all characters in the original game, its free post-launch updates, and paid DLC.</p>
<p>The nine Hashira (the highest rank of the Demon Slayer Corps) will also join in the sequel, including Muichiro Tokito and Mitsuri Kanroji.</p>
<p>Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles has sold over 4m units worldwide following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-demon-slayer-game-heads-west-in-october">release in 2021</a>, so there's certainly an appetite for this sequel.</p>
<p>The games are developed by CyberConnect2, the Japanese studio known for other anime and manga adaptations like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-ball-z-kakarot">Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/naruto-ultimate-ninja">Naruto: Ultimate Ninja</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/steam-path-of-exile-2-and-marvel-rivals-all-broke-records-this-weekend/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been another weekend of records on Valve's Steam. Yesterday at 14:00 UTC, Steam itself broke a new concurrency record of 39.2 million users, over 12 million of whom were playing a game.&nbsp; Valve's platform continues to grow at an astonishing rate. In January, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-sets-new-top-concurrent-player-number-record-nearing-34-million-connected-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> 33.6 million users; the 34 million threshold was <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-sets-new-record-with-over-34-million-concurrent-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broken</a> in early March and quickly surpassed by two new records (35 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-sets-another-record-with-36-million-concurrent-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">36 million</a>). The 37 million milestone was <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-achieves-37-2-million-concurrent-players-breaking-all-previous-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> in August, while the following Steam <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-hits-all-time-record-38-3-million-pc-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> 38 million concurrent online users. Of course, these new peaks usually happen whenever big games are released, driving users to engage with the platform. That was the case this past weekend with Grinding Gear's Path of Exile 2 and NetEase's Marvel Rivals.</p>
<p>The action RPG sequel launched into early access this past Friday and it's doing amazing numbers for a premium game (this early access phase is paid, while the full launch will be free to play) with a Steam player peak <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2694490/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registered</a> at 578K around fourteen hours ago. So far, user reviews are also quite positive (82%), aligning with <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-hands-on-the-arpg-that-could-rule-them-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Francesco De Meo's early access preview on Wccftech</a>:</p>
<p><em> The Early Access version made it clear how Grinding Gear Games has a very strong idea of how to evolve the formula of its predecessor to deliver an experience that is, undoubtedly, very fun at all skill levels. Considering how the game manages to be both extremely welcoming and extremely deep at the same time, I have no doubt that Path of Exile 2 will only get better from here on out, having the potential to become one of the best action role-playing games ever released.</em></p>
<p>The game is performing well on all platforms,&nbsp;<span><a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-redemptions-top-1-million-queues-over-the-weekend-are-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassing</a></span>&nbsp;a million users in total. In fact, the developers were forced to enable temporary server queues.</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals also had a strong launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-launches-with-a-bang-thanks-to-444k-concurrent-users-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registering</a> a peak of 444K concurrent users on Steam during the week and then <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breaking</a> it with 480K users fourteen hours ago. However, the game has even more success on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X - <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1865909229070016851" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to NetEase</a>, the team-based PvP superhero shooter has registered over 10 million players in the first three days. Of course, it has the advantage of being already free-to-play.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-development-issues/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a rare interview, Michel Ancel said that problems between management caused Beyond Good and Evil 2’s development issues.</p>



<p>The new interview came from French outlet <a href="https://www.superpouvoir.com/entretien-avec-michel-ancel-le-createur-de-rayman-et-beyond-good-evil-se-confie-sur-sa-nouvelle-vie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Superpouvoir</a>, where Ancel answered elaberated on the development issues of Beyond Good and Evil 2 and where he believes some of the accusations of toxic management, of which he denies, originates.</p>



<p>“On&nbsp;BGE2, for example, there were too many problems between managers. The artistic director wanted to redo everything constantly, <span>and the&nbsp;game director&nbsp;wanted to make a game of generated dungeo</span>ns. I dreamed of a space adventure. We could not agree and the&nbsp;game director&nbsp;took the project in other directions,” he said. </p>



<p>Ancel continued, “In this type of situation, teams find themselves tossed around and don’t even know who’s in charge and making decisions. The producer is supposed to sort things out, but that didn’t happen.&nbsp;Yves Guillemot&nbsp;even had to go down to Montpellier to get things back on track, but that wasn’t enough and the&nbsp;<em>game director</em>&nbsp;continued in his stubbornness. When I read in Libé that I was the one directing the game and asking for changes, I thought I was going to choke.&nbsp;<em>BGE2</em>&nbsp;is the game on which I don’t think I’ve ever questioned a decision.”</p>



<p>Michal Ancel left Ubisoft in 2020 to spend time in a wildlife sanctuary following burnout while working on games. One week later, though, accusations of toxic leadership by Ancel began to circulate, which Ancel firmly denied and continues to do so.</p>



<p>As of the time of writing, Ubisoft’s Beyond Good and Evil 2 is still in development. After nearly two years of development, it finally found its footing in early 2017. Speaking with sources, the game is still a couple of years out, though. We’ll share some exclusive details on the game later this week.</p>



<p>What do you think of the issues surrounding Beyond Good and Evil 2? Do you think it will ever be released? &nbsp;Let us know how it’s going on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Per a recent report, Apple and Sony are collaborating to bring third-party controller support for the Vision Pro.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-12-08/apple-sony-talk-playstation-vr-ps-vr2-hand-controller-support-for-vision-pro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Apple approached Sony at the beginning of 2024 to bring support for PlayStation VR 2 controllers for the Vision Pro. Moreover, Apple has also had conversations with other third-party developers about featuring third-party controller support for their games on the VR platform. The controllers will not only be a valuable addition for gaming on the Vision Pro but also provide more control over the entire operating system.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report adds that Apple and Sony had planned to announce PlayStation VR 2 controller support for the Vision Pro “weeks ago”; however, the announcement was postponed due to an undisclosed reason. Also, Sony has another hurdle to cross: selling their VR controllers as standalone accessories, as right now, they can only be acquired by purchasing the PlayStation VR 2 console. When the announcement does come, players will seemingly be able to grab the PS VR 2 controllers from Apple’s retail and online stores.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2's troubled development was due to "passionate managers" not getting along, the series' creator Michel Ancel has said.</p>
<p>The sequel to the cult classic adventure has been in development for almost 20 years (the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-overtakes-guinness-record-holder-duke-nukem-forever-as-game-longest-in-development">longest in history</a>), and has continued despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rayman-creator-michel-ancel-quits-video-games-industry-to-work-on-wildlife-sanctuary">Ancel leaving Ubisoft back in 2020 due to retirement</a>. His departure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-report-says-michel-ancel-left-ubisoft-amid-investigation-into-his-toxic-behaviour">followed an investigation into allegations of toxic leadership</a> by French newspaper Libération.</p>
<p>Ancel has not spoken publicly about the game's development since, but in a new interview with French outlet <a href="https://www.superpouvoir.com/entretien-avec-michel-ancel-le-createur-de-rayman-et-beyond-good-evil-se-confie-sur-sa-nouvelle-vie/">SuperPouvoir</a> he has now discussed some of the tensions and accusations made against him.</p>

<p>Passion is a "fabulous energy", said Ancel, but can also lead to clashes. For BG&amp;E2, he stated how the game's art director had wanted to redo everything over and over, that the game's director had wanted a game of generated dungeons, while he "dreamed of a space adventure".</p><p>The trio were unable to agree on a direction, with the development team left not knowing who was ultimately in charge. Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot even visited the Montpellier studio, Ancel said, but it wasn't enough and "the game director continued in his stubbornness", said Ancel.</p>
<p>"When I read in Libé that I was the one who was directing the game and asking for changes, I thought I was choking," Ancel said. "BG&amp;E2 is the game on which I think I have never questioned a decision.</p>
<p>"In the end, it is all a matter of passionate managers who have not gotten along. I believe that for some time now, these people have been let go and the project has found a certain balance with new leaders."</p>
<p>Ancel added there's a "huge difference" between developing BG&amp;E2 with new technology, and a project with established technology. This complexity "exceeded many people at Ubisoft".</p>
<p>He surmised there was no "single big villain" but multiple concerns left unresolved with managers. "I have my share of responsibility and I should have defended the project better, been more present and more conciliatory with the employees," he concluded.</p>
<p>According to the Libération report into Ancel's toxic leadership, his management of the project resulted in constant changes and fluctuations in scope, leading to "an unusual amount of [staff] exhaustion, depression, and burnout".</p>
<p>Ancel also discussed the end of WiLD, the project from his Wild Sheep studio originally announced in 2014 that was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-exclusive-prehistoric-open-world-adventure-wild-has-reportedly-been-cancelled">reported as having been cancelled in 2021</a>.</p>
<p>Though a playable version had been established in 2018, Ancel said the studio chose to upgrade the game from PS4 to PS5. However, despite Sony offering double Ubisoft's budgets to take on the game as publisher, it was turned down and remained with Ubisoft.</p><p>This was during Ancel's burnout and subsequent departure from the industry. Without him there to defend the game, he said, it was "crushed" by Ubisoft due to changes made "without really playing the game", which Ancel described as "a real scandal". The game was later abandoned in 2020 due to no longer matching the original vision.</p>
<p>He added the "editorial department was in full explosion" at this time due to Ubisoft's internal <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-exec-tommy-francois-leaves-company">investigation into former editorial vice president Tommy François</a> who had overseen development of WiLD, who was reportedly then fired.</p>
<p>Ancel joked 2018 was therefore "the beginning of the end" for both WiLD and BG&amp;E2, in his eyes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beyond-good-evil-2-still-in-development-now-with-new-creative-director">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 remains in development</a>, it was confirmed again in October this year, with a new creative director once again at the helm.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In their latest update, Palworld developers have changed the behaviour of Pal Spheres while battling Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pal Spheres work like Pokeballs and capture and summon Pals in Palworld. However, after <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1623730/view/4477236636060484669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">version v0.3.11 </a>(spotted by <a href="https://nichegamer.com/palworld-removes-pal-sphere-summons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NicheGamer</a>), the Pal Spheres will have a different activation. Now, whenever a player uses a Pal Sphere, their Pal will be summoned near the player without them needing to throw the sphere. Also, the new update will display a reticle while aiming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-lawsuit-palworld-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">latest developments</a> on Nintendo’s lawsuit against Palworld, the former has alleged that the latter has infringed three different patents and is seeking damages of 10 million Yen (approximately USD 66,000). Pocket Pair replied, stating they “will continue to assert our position in this case through future legal proceedings” in the lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Palxworld is getting its biggest island yet in December, which is about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-december-dlc-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">six times bigger than Sakurajima</a>. Also, Palworld has finally launched for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-finally-launches-for-ps5-in-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 consoles in Japan</a>. What are your thoughts on Palworld changing how Pal Spheres work in the game?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-a-smash-hit-with-10-million-players-in-just-3-days<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> just hit an impressive milestone: 10 million players in three days.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NetEase’s free-to-play superhero team-based PvP shooter launched on December 6 across PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S. While Sony and Microsoft do not make PlayStation or Xbox player numbers public, Steam makes Valve stats available, and it’s there that Marvel Rivals is enjoying a particularly massive launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals peaked over its launch weekend with 480,990 concurrent players, which was enough to put it in Steam’s top five most-played games. It’s the 20th highest concurrent player number ever seen on Steam, ahead of the likes of Helldivers 2, Grand Theft Auto 5, and Destiny 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Steam, Marvel Rivals has a ‘mostly positive’ user review rating, with 76% of the 35,000 reviews tagged as positive. Check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-review"><u>Marvel Rivals Review in Progress</u></a> to find out what we think.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Marvel Rivals - Character Skins Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For NetEase, it will be hoping not only to keep Marvel Rivals’ player count as high as possible for as long as possible (something that’s proved particularly tricky for live service games of late), but to make enough money from players to meet the company’s internal revenue projections. To that end, Marvel Rivals sells a battle pass and premium skins, but are they convincing players to open their wallets? Early signs suggest they are — Marvel Rivals is the second top-selling game on Steam by revenue, behind only Grinding Gear Games’ action RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals launched alongside Season 0, dubbed Dooms’ Rise. This month-long kick-off season starts with a total of 33 heroes, all available to play for free, eight maps for Quick Match and Competitive modes, a Conquest map, and a Practice Range. Dooms' Rise serves as the opening chapter “for the chaos caused by each of Doctor Dooms’ time experiments colliding and unleashing the Timestream Entanglement,” NetEase said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a Twitch Drops event for Season 0, as you’d expect from a live service game of this type, an 'Entangled Moments' seasonal event to unlock spray rewards, gallery card rewards, and stories for completing tasks, and a global launch gift: a special code for a free Iron Man costume.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.
