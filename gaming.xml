Then, especially since 2018, doing so with a deeper interest in games as an art form, particularly through an interest in folk games and, later on, metagaming.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you come up with the concept for </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> came about when me and my friends (which we would later call "plunderludics working group") were meeting weekly to develop and explore our ideas of "plunderludics"—games (or anything else) made from preexisting games.

I was trying to create a digital version of a theater game/score I am really fascinated with. I think it's called Lane Work, from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/viewpointsbookpr0000boga">The Viewpoints Book</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where actors are restricted to only moving back and forth in their own lanes, at different speeds (and then allowed a single action and a single phrase). The couple of times I played or watched it had been really powerful, and so I thought that could be an interesting direction to make something out of preexisting games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eventually, instead of having multiple games showing at the same time and inspired by this Increpare game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.increpare.com/2017/08/running_memories/">Running Memories</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I started playing around with crossfading them at different intervals. I was also very interested in modular synthesizers, so at this point I was changing the character’s moving speed (the controller analog input) based on knobs, as well as the rate the crossfading happened. The effect was really mesmerizing, and at this point I realized that I could try making the fade actually have something related to the actual movement rather than it being a thing that happened in time.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/inside-indika-s-powerful-bleak-exploration-of-religion" target="_self" data-discover="true">Inside Indika's powerful, bleak exploration of religion</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So, I spent a good amount of time figuring out good ways to make this happen, and instead of having the position of the characters in the games themselves dictate the crossfading, I made an invisible map where an invisible character would walk around, and in doing so would crossfade the games that were being displayed. From there, it was mostly technical issues and finding "samples" and placing them in the map.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">(This is what it looks like on the inside. You are that square walking around a big map. The three closest games to you get crossfaded)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What development tools were used to build your game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The main tools I used for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> were the multi console emulator </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://tasvideos.org/Bizhawk">BizHawk</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for playing, "sampling," and playing back video games from many sources (and which has a great API to do a lot of what we do). I also used Unity for compositing the games' visual output and the logic in which that happens.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The latest version makes use of our awesome toolset </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/plunderludics/unity-hawk/tree/main">UnityHawk</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which allows us to very seamlessly integrate BizHawk within Unity. UnityHawk is extremely handy and replaced my early-on convoluted patchwork stack of Python scripts sending and receiving OSC messages from Unity and BizHawk. I also used the modular synthesizer emulator </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://vcvrack.com/">VCV rack</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in the prototyping phase.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> weaves together many games from PSX and N64 into its exploration of memory, nostalgia, and movement in digital spaces. What challenges do you face in weaving these experiences from different consoles together into a single playable experience? How do you bring multiple games together, let alone ones from different systems?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think the previous question answers this, but I can go into a bit more detail. Earlier on, I was using Unity to composite images from the BizHawk emulator using this library: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/hecomi/uWindowCapture">uWindowCapture</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. This allowed me to capture different emulator windows running in the background into textures in Unity. Then, there was a Python script bridging Unity and BizHawk through this protocol called OSC. With that, I could send messages to and from Unity and to and from BizHawk’s LUA scripting toolset.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That was a huge mess, and starting it up was also very unstable. Gurn Group and our friend Dan over the next year put a lot of effort into simplifying all of this by creating UnityHawk, which allows us to basically communicate directly to BizHawk from Unity and not have all those extra layers of indirection.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The multiple systems issue is solved by BizHawk, which is a godsend for us, allowing us to very seamlessly run games from a lot of different consoles. One friction point was that sometimes some games didn't take analog input, or the d-pad would affect the game differently, so I had to make sure each game had a correct input mapping so they all ran smoothly (if you look closely, you can see that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mega Man</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, for some reason, only turns right. I never got that one).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Has mixing these games together resulted in any interesting unintended results? Created something useful that may have taken you by surprise?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I am always really excited to see moments where players move beyond the places that I preselected for them. Sometimes this happened because I didn't know it was possible to get there without jumping, but most times it’s because they either die or hit a condition in which the game is expecting input other than moving (a cutscene or a dialogue). I think a lot of these moments create an exciting variation on the general infinite going forward of the game. I particularly love this one moment where you can get to a dialogue in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Majora's Mask</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> saying that you have a stupid horse while in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Croc</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> you are stuck on a moving platform.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How does it feel to repurpose and reshape the works of others in such a way that they pull from their existing meanings while also creating whole new ones? What interests you about creating things in this way?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For me, the most exciting thing about "plundering," as we call it, is having a whole new view on playing any game. I notice how the characters move in all of them, how long it takes for the game to boot and actually get into gameplay, how long it takes to be free from a tutorial interrupting you, how the swimming animation looks, how there seem to be bridges pretty early on in every game, how some 3D games have animations when pushing against walls and some don't, the different colors of the grass, places in which you can't jump if your character is stuck (I call these jump prisons), and many many more.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I hope that making playable things in this way will also make people imagine their own possibilities, and also make an intuitive understanding that games are what we make out of the tools we are given. Playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tomb Raider</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> because you want a snapshot of all the tigers is in the same level of playing it to get to see the entire story.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I also appreciate the historical aspects of it. While I can't deny the nostalgia factor of this project, I think it's important to be able to look at old games and think of them as "good for their time," rather than simply good on their own. Video game development is not a linearly progressing form, and many, many interesting things have been lost for the sake of streamlining and maximizing engagement. A lot of these early games are really bad, but a lot of them also surprise me immensely (the semi tank movement in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Croc</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, for example, feels like something lost to the modern 3D platformer).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally, I think it's also interesting in new games, as in new rules and objectives, rather than new content. We, as game developers, love mashing our loved references together to create new work anyway—Metroidvanias, Soulslikes, roguelikes etc.. We recreate these ideas from scratch over and over, without much examination on what that process is actually giving us.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">(Oops, I wrote a manifesto).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What appealed to you about creating an experience by connecting several other games together? Cross-fading them over one another and connecting them? How did crafting </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> in this way help enhance its themes?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I was interested in the different ways it felt to move in the different 3D games, in the ways in which sometimes it feels like you were moving in one game but in a different game's scenery, and also in the dream-like narrative that arises out of the crossfading. The crossfading being driven by the movement of the player allowed me to make the feeling of actually moving between games—of it feeling like certain laces led to other laces.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I personally didn't have particular themes in mind as I was making it. I pretty much trusted the process and let the games guide some internal meaning that could arise out of the piece. I think </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> works pretty much as a conceptual plunderludics work—something to spark the possibility space of making games out of other games: "here's a very simple structure to combine together multiple games, in any amount. Now, imagine the possibilities of making it more intentional—of highly crafting the transitions."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I remember once talking to Bennett Foddy about the dream of making a narrative/single player version of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Multibowl</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a video game with its own arc/story that is made completely out of premade pieces from other games. I don't think </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> achieves this, but I hope it makes people imagine it as well, and maybe even live tiny, uncurated narrative moments for themselves while roaming around. I'm hoping to bring a new version of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to GDC that will have an ever grander set of games, and an even more intentional placement of things in the map.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Why did you include the games that you choose for </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>? Why these specific titles?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is a funny question. There's, again, not a lot of intention behind it, I wanted to have as many games as possible for the initial show where I was gonna display it, but I also didn't want to simply play games until the very first playable moment and then switch to the next game. This was, in a way, also a research project in 3D game movement. So, I was pretty much going down a list of games that sounded interesting, playing them for a bit, and "sampling" them in the meantime until I felt like moving on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The sampling aspect itself is more interesting and curated. I had some samples beforehand that I was using for testing and stayed on the final project, like Link on top of a tree which I was using for this </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://plunderludics.github.io/works/linked%20jumps.html">earlier experiment</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. However, once I decided to not have the jump button in the games, I started looking for jump prisons, and created my own little game out of searching for save states (I like calling them samples): finding locations in which, if the character can't jump, you are stuck in a particular area. There's not many of those, but I am always excited when I find something like that. I particularly love the one in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Croc</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> where you walk on the moving platform. That’s probably my favorite sample.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally, I also started sampling moments where characters were in similar states, like being on a bridge, or being in a green place, or swimming; things like that. I didn't end up using a lot of these since I didn't want the same game to repeat too much, but I hope to expand on the project with more things like this.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Oh, and I have also been fascinated with Any Austin's youtube series Unremarkable and odd Places, and the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk10mVrUQvk">sample from </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk10mVrUQvk">Spyro</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was taken straight from that.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What interested you about exploring movement and the possibilities in 3D space? What ideas went into crafting a play space that would get the player to think on it</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is a great final question for me to segue into shamelessly using this moment to promote my own, more commercially viable, work. While </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>tapeçaria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a work within my plunderludics practice, it is also a research project for me—looking at a variety of 3D platformers and seeing what works and what doesn't, what might've been forgotten in the past, and how we got to the kind of games we have today. Myself and my friends are working on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2888670/pondlife_discone_a_videogame/">pondlife: discone (a videogame)</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (Wishlist pls) which is the best 3D platformer game of all time (As in, it's already the best. We are simply still working on it to make it even better). Since we are developing a lot of our movement system from the ground up and reinventing the wheel in many ways, it’s great to be able to travel back to the time when the wheel was being invented and see what people were doing back then!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I am very interested in movement in games—the general embodying you can achieve with different controls, as well as the feeling of mastery and weirdness of exploring a new body. I also like playing games in ways they are not intended to be played (mostly trying to climb things that were not made to be climbed), so I also like playing these games in search of such structures—unintentionally designed challenges that work regardless, or in fact, work because of, the way these games work. It’s fascinating to me.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I love seeing people take these challenges even further, like the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpk2tdsPh0A">Mario 64</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpk2tdsPh0A"> half A press challenge</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, trying to beat </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIA4KYiHHlU">Dark Souls 3</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIA4KYiHHlU"> without walking</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To3d6XKsMcQ">playing 4 instances of </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To3d6XKsMcQ">Mega Man</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To3d6XKsMcQ"> at the same time</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJyg1nzbZPg">randomized </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJyg1nzbZPg">Zelda</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfTDu9lzgtFHVirg_tSbRsSG6g0zKSdz6">many more</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

It also comes with three swappable bands featuring retro graphic designs, although Atari says they will only be available for a limited time.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
I like a good puzzle game, but to be honest I don't play them all that often. Not because I'm bad at them, thanks for assuming I'm a numpty, it's more just that I prefer games with a really good hook to them - think <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/portal">Portal</a> as the prime example of such a game. Clean, knows exactly what it is, and uses its concept in increasingly interesting ways without overstaying its welcome. I have no idea if Chromatic Conundrum will manage that or not, but I've never seen a game use light as part of its puzzles in quite the same way before.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
You can take a look at a snippet of gameplay below, but here's the lowdown: you need to move around boxes that emit different coloured lights to line-up with on sensors to open doors (think of Portal again and having to put boxes on buttons). Overlapping these boxes can create new colours, which you might need for certain sensors. Sometimes, you'll need to cast shadows so that certain sensors are left in the dark. It's one of those kinds of games that are so simple in concept, but it's the execution that really sells it to you.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
I'm a really big fan of how simple it all looks. There really is no denying Portal's influence on this game, add a few more textures in there and it could be an Aperture Science test chamber. The stark black and white really makes the colours pop though, really shows you how clean, simple design is sometimes the best way to go.
</p>
<p>
Of course, immediately it feels like this could be a problem for colour blind people, and there's no mention anywhere of any kind of accessibility features, but it still looks to be early enough days for the puzzle game, so hopefully that's something that gets added in.
</p>
<p>
Those of you as enamoured as I am by Chromatic Conundrum can wishlist the game on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3081690/Chromatic_Conundrum/">right here</a>.

But I just hope, in the best of worlds, that you take less of these stupid decisions and focus on what you truly, truly want. And those are the games.”</p><p>“Because when you have a great game—we’re seeing it with [<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-success-metacritic-90-steam-players-ea-1851768495&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-success-metacritic-90-steam-players-ea-1851768495"><em>Split Fiction</em></a></span>], a game done only from passion, a game where you literally don’t have to buy two copies, a game that doesn’t have any microtransactions. And you see the success it does. I mean, it’s even a financial success, obviously, because people want to pay for something that feels great. So I just hope it inspires other publishers to do that.”</p><p>Fares also told the outlet that EA doesn’t interfere with Hazelight as the studio develops its games, letting it experiment and create whatever it wants. And while he admits EA isn’t perfect, saying that every publisher “fucks up now and then,” it seems at least EA is learning from its mistakes and supporting the creation of games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-final-level-mio-zoe-rader-ending-1851768868&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-final-level-mio-zoe-rader-ending-1851768868"><em>Split Fiction</em></a></span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-releases-new-driver-confirms-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-for-the-last-of-us-part-ii-and-darktide/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA has released a new GeForce Game Ready driver (version 572.83), which is optimized for a series of games that have just launched or are about to launch. The first is, of course, the Half-Life 2 RTX demo, which features the full extent of the NVIDIA RTX suite as analyzed <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-half-life-2-rtx-demo-is-an-excellent-showcase-of-rtx-remixs-possibilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. But it's also optimized for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-arch-2025-update-ultra-ray-tracing-dlss-3-7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent Control update</a> that enhanced Remedy's game with a new Ultra Ray Tracing preset featuring an increased number of rays per pixel, updated DLSS (to version 3.7, which can be overridden to DLSS 4's new transformer model through the NVIDIA app), texture quality improvements, faster texture streaming, support for a wider range of ultra-wide monitor aspect ratios up to 48:9, the addition of a Field of View slider, and High Dynamic Range (HDR) support.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the new driver is optimized for Assassin's Creed Shadows (which, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-pc-report-a-ray-traced-leap-forward-for-ubisoft-anvil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned in our article</a>, supports DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation via NVIDIA app override) and Warhammer 40,000: Darktide. While not a new game, the cooperative first-person action title by Fatshark will be updated to natively support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation with an update scheduled to go live next week.</p>
<p>The driver should&nbsp;<span>also be installed for gamers looking to play inZOI. The life simulation title will debut in early access on Friday, March 28, featuring DLSS Super Resolution and NVIDIA ACE technology powering their '<a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ace-to-power-dynamic-ai-characters-companions-and-bosses-in-pubg-naraka-bladepoint-inzoi-and-mir5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smart Zoi</a>' NPCs. The technology is based on a .5B billion parameter Mistral NeMo Minitron small language model, providing high-quality</span>&nbsp;outputs at low latency in a very compact footprint. The feature is only available on GeForce RTX GPUs.</p>
<p>Lastly, NVIDIA has also shared that The Last of Us Part II Remastered, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-is-out-on-april-3-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">due to launch on PC on April 3</a>, will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation within the game. Of course, DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Reflex are also individually supported.</p>
<p>The Game Ready driver's release notes also reveal the following bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>[GeForce RTX 5080/5090] Graphics cards may not run at full speeds on system reboot when overclocked [5088034]</li>
<li>[GeForce RTX 50 series] GeForce RTX 50 series GPUs crashes with black screen [5120886]</li>
<li>Some NVIDIA Control Panel / NVIDIA App settings changes immediately get reset or give error [5160516]</li>
<li>PC may bugcheck IRQL NOT LESS OR EQUAL 0xa during gameplay with HDR enabled [5091576]</li>
<li>[VRED 2026] Optix compile error with R570 branch drivers [5122360]</li>
<li>[Derivative TouchDesigner ] Application stability issues [4606316]</li>
</ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-portal-pinball-table-may-be-the-closest-we%E2%80%99re-gonna-get-to-portal-3.1138353/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/were-getting-a-full-size-portal-pinball-table-before-portal-3/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<h2>A bargain at twice the price</h2>
<p>The extensive <em>Portal</em> theming on the table seems to extend to the gameplay as well. As you might expect, launching a ball into a lit portal on one side of the playfield can lead to it (or a ball that looks a lot like it) immediately launching from another portal elsewhere. The speed of the ball as it enters one portal and exits the other seems like it might matter to the gameplay, too: A <a href="https://www.multimorphic.com/portal/">description</a> for an "aerial portal" table feature warns that players should "make sure to build enough momentum or else your ball will land in the pit!"</p>


<p>The table is full of other little nods to the <em>Portal</em> games, from a physical Weighted Companion Cube that can travel through a portal to lock balls in place for eventual multiball to an Aerial Faith Plate that physically flings the ball up to a higher level. There's also a turret-themed multiball, which GLaDOS reminds you is based around "the pale spherical things that are full of bullets. Oh wait, that's you in five seconds."</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.multimorphic.com/store/p3-pinball-machine/p3-machine-with-the-portal-standard-game-kit/">purchase a full <em>Portal</em> pinball table</a> starting at $11,620 (plus shipping), which isn't unreasonable as far as brand-new pinball tables are concerned <a href="https://sternpinball.com/2024/10/16/stern-pinball-revisits-a-timeless-classic-with-metallica-remastered-available-now/">these days</a>. But if you already own <a href="https://www.multimorphic.com/p3-pinball-platform/">the base table for Multimorphic's P3 Pinball Platform</a>, you can purchase a "Game Kit" upgrade—with the requisite game software and physical playfield pieces to install on your table—starting at just $3,900.</p>
<p>Even players that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/05/one-week-with-the-valve-index-a-vr-game-changer-with-a-few-question-marks/">invested $1,000 or more in an Index VR headset</a> just to play <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/half-life-alyx-review-the-greatest-vr-adventure-game-yet-and-then-some/"><em>Half-Life Alyx</em></a> might balk at those kinds of prices for the closest thing we've got to a new, "official" <em>Portal</em> game. For true Valve obsessives, though, it might be a small price to pay for the ultimate company collector's item and conversation piece.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/18/monaco-2-pilfers-an-april-release-date-for-pc-ps5-and-xbox/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Pocketwatch Games and publisher Humble Games have announced that their cooperative heisting sequel <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monaco-2">Monaco 2</a> will release on 10th April for PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monaco 2- Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rXsfJzrKRIc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Monaco 2 invites you to play with heisting teams of up to four players – you can, of course, tackle missions solo as well – and picking from eight playable characters. You can switch mid-run if the obstacles before you don’t meet your character’s skill set, but you can preview a mission’s layout with the Blueprint Mode before you set foor in a stage.</p>
<p>Where the original Monaco was a linear adventure, in which you assembled a crew of misfits to pull off an audacious series of heists and capers, the sequel is taking a different tack. While there is a structured campaign, this is going down the path of a more freeform heist simulator, testing you and your co-op buddies through procedurally generated levels that have been cooked up by an AI mastermind.</p>
<p>After the minimalist top-down shenanigans of the original, Monaco 2 is much more fleshed out visually with an isometric view into 3D worlds and a painterly art style. It looks rather lovely.</p>

<p>A demo of Monaco 2 was released back in February for Steam Next Fest. The demo features around 2 hours of missions that present their own unique challenges, picking from the line up of five of the thieves from the full game. The demo also featured a mode called “Unreliable Narrator”, which scrambles up the missions in interesting ways.</p>

		<p>One month on from the last major update, GSC Game Worlds has dropped <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stalker-2">STALKER 2</a> Patch 1.3, another huge update with over 1,200 fixes.</p>
<p>Patch 1.3 for STALKER 2 brings changes and fixes across the AI and A-Life system, game balance, story progression, game performance, locations, audio and more.</p>


<p>On a high level, Patch 1.3 has polished animations and behaviours for mutants in combat, rebalanced some arch-artifacts and damage from anomalies for different armours and suits. If combat does go a bit awry, there’s some new death screens that vary upon death.</p>
<p>It’s also brought fixes for dozens of mission and open world bugs, and there’s fixes for over 100 instances that trigger ‘EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION’ errors.</p>
<p>Looking back on our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/21/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/">STALKER 2 review</a>, Miguel said, “STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is an immersive experience like no other. It’s a tense shooter, a gripping survival experience, an immersive explorable sandbox, and a stunning piece of art come to life despite the harrowing circumstances of the team behind it all.”</p>

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-saw-more-players-this-year-than-its-release-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incredible (and continued) success of Baldur's Gate 3</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-4-playable-state/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Larian's surprising decision not to pursue a sequel</a>, fans have been left wondering what will happen to the franchise next. According to Hasbro Senior Vice President of Digital Games Dan Ayoub, though, it may not be long before some sort of news is shared. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/well-hear-more-about-baldurs-gates-future-in-pretty-short-order-hasbro-svp-of-games-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to IGN</a> at GDC 2025, Ayoub said:</p>
<p><em>A lot of people are very interested in Baldur's Gate. We're kind of working out our plans for the future and what we're going to be doing with that. And actually, in pretty short order, we're going to have some stuff to talk about around that.</em></p>
<p><em>It's somewhat of an unenviable position. I mean, we're not in a hurry. Right? That's the thing, we're going to take a very measured approach... We've got a lot of plans, a lot of different ways to go about it. We're starting to think about, okay, yeah, we're ready to start dipping toes a little bit and talking about a few things. And I think, in really short order, like I said, again, not to over-tease that point, we're going to have some other things to talk about around that.</em></p>
<p>That doesn't necessarily mean this announcement would be related to a new mainline installment in the franchise. From Ayoub's statement, it sounds like that is further away from even being agreed upon. However, there could be other ways to keep the interest in Baldur's Gate high.</p>
<p>Eventually, though, what fans really want is a continuation of Baldur's Gate 3, especially with the incredibly interesting characters introduced in that game. In that regard, Hasbro's Dan Ayoub doesn't back down from the noticeable challenge of rising to that level of anticipation:</p>
<p><em>I'm never one to shy down from a challenge. I think anything that forces us to raise our creative bar - and developers love to have a high bar to go after, and I think we've actually seen the team push some really interesting ideas that they're like, 'Okay, we need to raise our bar. We need to go bigger on this.' And things like that. So, I think that's our hope, right? We would keep raising the bar and everyone just tries to go a little higher.</em></p>
<p>What would you like to see next in the revered fantasy RPG series?</p>

            <p>
There are two shooters that I imagine will never die, because they just seem to hang on despite being incredibly old and plenty of other games coming out in the mean-time: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike">Counter-Strike</a> (both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/valve">Valve</a> games, funnily enough - they've clearly got the Source (sorry)). <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>, which came out back in 2023, is the most played shooter of all time on Steam in fact, but even now the original game is still pretty popular. There's literally more than 16,000 people playing it right now. And though it might not be official, a group of modders have come together to remake the 1.6 version of the game.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Titled CS: Legacy, the team behind it want you to know that this isn't just a fancy mod of the classic shooter, but a "from the ground up" remaking made with completely custom code and original assets. It should still have that same Valve feel to it, though, as the entire thing is being made in the developer's official 2013 Source Engine SDK, albeit with some tinkering with its renderer, shaders, and a few other systems.

<p>
According to the trailer (which you can have a gander at above), it'll be coming to Steam in early access some time this year. It being a standalone thing certainly might suggest that it has the all-clear from Valve, which wouldn't be that surprising given how chill the studio is with this kind of thing - I'll remind you of that OG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a> remake <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-mesa">Black Mesa</a> that came out… <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-mesa-is-fully-launched-for-real">half a decade ago apparently</a>!
</p>
<p>
I'm not much of a shooty person, nor have I ever even played Counter-Strike, but I do love a good fan project like this, and judging from the comments on the trailer, fans of the original shooter seem pretty pumped about this one.

<p>EA Sports is set to pay players who appear in EA Sports College Football 26 a bit more money. According to an email sent out to NCAA Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) players (via <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6213494/2025/03/18/ea-sports-college-football-26-nil-payments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Athletic</a>), the company is increasing payment to $1,500 per player for their inclusion in the game.</p>



<p>That’s up from the $600 individual players received for College Football 25. </p>



<p>Players will also get a Deluxe Edition of the game, which is similar to what players from last year’s game received. Select athletes who are brand ambassadors for the game will get additional compensation.</p>



<p>The increase in player payments comes after College Football 25 became the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-remains-2024s-best-selling-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">best-selling sports game</a> in US history, surpassing NBA 2K21. According to an EA representative, again via The Athletic, the increase was done as a way to “make sure athletes feel recognized for the success of the game.”</p>



<p>EA is expected to spend over $16 million on NIL rights for players to appear in the game before accounting for any extra payments for brand ambassadors as well as the cost of the game itself. </p>



<p>College Football 26 is expected to launch in July. After not being a part of last year’s game, it’s anticipated that real coaches will be added to the game this year after a <a href="https://x.com/bmarcello/status/1900019548520075267?s=46&amp;t=iGRZfb8A0Ak5amUsoqdLIQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leaked cover</a> from a recent EA photoshoot made its way online. No other details about the game are currently known.</p>



<p>What do you think of EA increasing its payments to players who appear in College Football 26? Let us know down below and join more discussions in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

                <p>After paying college athletes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-offering-college-athletes-600-to-appear-in-new-football-game/1100-6521289/" data-ref-id="1100-6521289">$600 to appear in College Football 25</a>, EA will pay players more than double that for this year's CFB 26. EA Sports confirmed to FBS players in an email today, obtained by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6213494/2025/03/18/ea-sports-college-football-26-nil-payments/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Athletic</a>, stating that players will get $1,500 if they opt in to appear in this year's game. This is no surprise, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-college-football-26-could-offer-bigger-payouts-to-players/1100-6529500/" data-ref-id="1100-6529500">this information leaked earlier this year</a>.</p><p>Additionally, players will receive a Deluxe Edition copy of the game--this was also offered in 2025. EA will pay some athletes more for appearing as brand ambassadors, just like last year.</p><p>A spokesperson for EA said, "College sports are growing and changing, and our focus at EA Sports is on continuing to put athletes first as we bring them in the game in College Football 26 and beyond."</p><p>More than 11,000 student-athletes appeared in CFB 25 through Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals, with EA spending more than $6 million to cover that. A spokesperson told The Athletic that EA will double its payment to players to more than $16.5 million to help them feel recognized for the success of CFB 25. Of note, the $16.5 million figure reportedly does not include any further payments to certain players who have ambassador deals or for further payments to cover athletes. </p><p>That game was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5106">No. 2 best-selling game of 2024 overall in the US</a>, only surpassed by Black Ops 6. CFB 25 was the <a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Articles/2024/12/18/Unpacks/ea-sports-college-football-25-best-selling-sports-video-game-all-time/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">best-selling sports video game in US history based on dollar sales.</a></p><p><a href="https://x.com/FOS/status/1902076294780624967" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According to Front Office Sports</a>, EA is also potentially going to negotiate royalty-based payments for certain players on top of the $1,500 appearance fee.</p><p>CFB 26 is in the works now and is expected to launch in July. EA Sports executive Daryl Holt told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6161718/2025/02/27/ea-sports-college-football-26-video-game-sales/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Athletic</a> that the team knew it was never going to be able to get everything it wanted to in 2024's game. "So there's a lot of meat left on the bone," he said.</p><p>Holt declined to get into specifics regarding new features for CFB 26, but teased, "We've got a lot of things still to come."</p><p>He added: "We release a game, we understand what's important to players and what they play and what they would like changed, improved or added. This is a game for fans built by college fans ourselves, and we want it to be that type of relationship to understand what's important to them."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hold-up-gachiakuta%E2%80%99s-magic-system-is-actually-fire.1138287/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/gachiakuta-magic-system-anime<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ll let y’all in on a little secret: I do not watch every seasonal anime. As someone who was once tasked with writing up <a href="https://kotaku.com/fall-anime-guide-2023-crunchyroll-netflix-hidive-hulu-1850871611" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long-ass slideshows</a> breaking down each anime, I no longer have time to watch every new show that crops up on the scene. I’m gonna die one day, so unless I come across a show that catches my eye or gets enough word-of-mouth recommendations from folks whose taste I trust, I’m not tuning in. This feeling is doubly true for new-age shonen anime.&nbsp;</p><p>Having served my time watching <em>One Piece</em>, <em>Bleach</em>, and <em>Naruto </em>when they were concurrently airing, I’ve no big desire to jump on new-age shonen like <em>Fire Force</em> and <em>Black Clover</em>, much less engage in sweaty online conversations about which shows will be the next <a href="https://otaku.fandom.com/wiki/Big_Three" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shonen big three</a>. While I’m of the mind that there will <a href="https://gizmodo.com/shonen-jump-big-three-future-2000501015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">never be another shonen big three</a>, I’ve tapped on the enclosure of anime fans ramping up their debates over which series to christen as the forerunner of the <a href="https://aftermath.site/dandadan-anime-science-saru-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">industry’s best and brightest</a> as heavy hitters like <a href="https://aftermath.site/jujutsu-kaisen-magneto-xavier-gojo-geto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em></a>,<em> My Hero Academia</em>, and <em>Demon Slayer</em> near their end.&nbsp;</p><p>Like Babe Ruth signaling a home run, Crunchyroll has given full-throated confidence points that <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gachiakuta-anime-trailer-crunchyroll-release-date-2000575939" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Gachiakuta</em></a> will be that series when it premieres in July. Having peeked at the manga before the release of its official trailer on multiple recommendations from friends, I think it will live up to that lofty claim of the merit of its magic system alone.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Gachiakuta | OFFICIAL TRAILER" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3UkmWacjR7Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Before I recount <em>Gachiakuta</em>’s logline, I wanna give an anecdote that’ll tie into its unique magic system and why I think it’s got the juice to be shonen anime’s next big thing. Most of the cool-looking furniture in my apartment came from spontaneous dumpster dives and pawn shop finds. Key among my finds is a perfectly good <a href="https://business.walmart.com/ip/Kings-Brand-Furniture-Kitchen-Island-Storage-Cabinet-with-Marble-Finish-Top-White/3927260608" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kitchen island with a marble top</a>, a <a href="https://www.homedepot.com/p/BICIK-63-7-in-Black-Dimmable-Column-Floor-Lamp-with-Display-Shelves-Remote-Control-1-USB-and-1-Type-C-Ports-1-Power-Outlet-H-CJD04-US-MB/330426954?source=shoppingads&amp;locale=en-US&amp;srsltid=AfmBOoqQ4vtFw0bLM_fmfCIGM-2X3ak4DLvkqAyCILzuUbxmwSYbQZvhkqA&amp;gQT=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">column paper lantern floor lamp with built-in outlets and USB ports</a>, and a <a href="https://www.lg.com/us/support/product/lg-42LD520.AUS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">42” Logitech TV</a> that I found in the alley behind my current apartment with a sticky note saying it still worked. Whether they were thrown away during a move that couldn’t consolidate space or no longer matched their previous owners' ethos, they’ve come into my possession as pretty nifty mainstays in my apartment.&nbsp;</p><p>So imagine my surprise when my partner told me we should get rid of the dingy TV we swapped out of our bedroom for the better back alley Logitech one we’ve got. Sure, she’s got a point that owning three TVs is a bit much. Plus, since swapping it out in the bedroom, it's been politely sitting by our recycling bin as a reminder that it's overstayed its welcome. But I couldn’t get myself to part with it. Despite that shitty RCA TV having a considerable blue pixel blemish in its lower third, it's been with me longer than any other object in my house. That TV has been with me since my first year of college. It also gave me comfort during hard times when I was fighting off homelessness, living in the basement of a friend of a friend as I used FYE paychecks to slowly pay my way from Cheyenne, Wyoming, back home to Chicago. It was the only TV I ever needed in my first studio apartment when I got into games journalism. If anything, the blue blemish in its lower third was a battle scar, noting how far it has come in its country-wide journey from City National Pawn for the low price of $105.&nbsp;</p><p>To make a long story short, I didn’t get rid of the TV. It's found a new home atop a bookshelf (which I also dumpster-dived for) in my home office with my “work PS5” (which my partner’s rich coworker just gave away because they didn’t want it anymore). Finding a new purpose for my old TV made my heart grow three sizes on some real sentimental shit.&nbsp;</p><p>That feeling is quite literally at the heart of <em>Gachiakuta</em>.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Gachiakuta</em>, created by Kei Urana, is a dystopian action manga. Its hero, Rudo, is a social outcast who spends his days repairing and finding new purposes for trash discarded by rich people. His life is as good as it could be living off the garbage of the rich until he's framed for the murder of his uncle and thrown from a luxurious floating city into the bottomless abyss of a landfill called The Pitt. His ultimate goal is to return to the floating city and exact revenge on the people who threw him away like trash. The only obstacles in his path are Pitt's toxic air, wasteland raiders, and giant kaiju constructed from living piles of junk. While the manga is poised to depict a generational crashout with Rudo, its magic system has me believing <em>Gachiakuta</em> might actually be the next big shonen series.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The power of friendship with inanimate objects. </figcaption></figure><p><em>Gachiakuta</em>‘s power system allows its heroes to transform sentimental objects into all-powerful weapons. These "vital instruments" can range from construction gloves to a walking cane to a dingy umbrella. While its cast of supporting characters only has one vital object, Rudo — being the main character — can turn any discarded object into a vital instrument. From the 20 chapters I've indulged in the manga ahead of its anime premiere, I've seen this ability used with the utmost emotional climax, repurposing childhood trinkets and weapons from his fallen allies. It's a simple concept, sure, but it's more intriguing than watching characters charge up and arbitrarily get stronger. Put that in the mix with the series’ worldbuilding of the rich dumping trash on the poor à la <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/1/18207027/alita-battle-angel-review-rosa-salazar-robert-rodriguez-christoph-waltz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Battle Angel Alita</em></a>, and you’ve got pretty interesting new-age shonen on your hands.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Gachiakuta </em>tapped into a part of my brain that few new-age shonen manga have since <em>Chainsaw Man</em> hit the scene with its demons powered by the fear of concepts like death and falling. It also doesn’t hurt that the series is being adapted by <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2024-10-02/studio-bones-spins-off-production-department-as-new-company-bones-film/.216251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bones Film</a>, the spin-off production company behind hit anime like <em>My Hero Academia,</em> <em>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</em>, and <em>Mob Psycho 100. </em>I’ll be watching to see if the series lives up to the hype on my RCA TV.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-australia-dead-inside-do-not-enter"><h3>Kotaku.com.au Would Have Been Better Off Dead</h3></a><p>A 404 would have been preferable to whatever this is</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kotick-kotaku-gizmodo"><h3>Report: Bobby Kotick Files Defamation Suit Against Gizmodo And Kotaku</h3></a><p>The suit is over details in a pair of articles about Kotick's rumored interest in buying TikTok</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-big-is-the-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-map-answered.1138269/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/how-big-assassins-creed-shadows-map/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the latest supersized title from Ubisoft in the flagship franchise. It’s enormous, like previous games, but just how big is the central map for this all-new title? Like the games that have been released since 2017, Assassin’s Creed Shadows boasts an enormous open-world environment for players to explore, and it can get pretty daunting.</p>



<p>Let’s dive in and determine how big the map is in Assassin’s Creed Shadows.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-map-size">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Map Size</h2>



<p>The map in Assassin’s Creed Shadows is massive and split up into nine core regions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Wakasa</li>



<li>Omi</li>



<li>Tamba</li>



<li>Yamashiro</li>



<li>Iga</li>



<li>Harima</li>



<li>Settsu</li>



<li>Yamato</li>



<li>Kii</li>
</ul>



<p>It’s one of the biggest maps released in the series thus far, and traversing it is often a chore because of mountainous terrain that can’t be overcome on foot. While you have a horse, Assassin’s Creed Shadows doesn’t have a ‘path follow’ mechanic, which means you’re forced to make manual journeys quite often.</p>



<p>Additionally, the team at Ubisoft has advised that players use an immersive mode that removes map indicators and marked pathways, which means you’re relying on instincts and discovery to locate your objectives in this vast open world.</p>



<p>I’d say that Assassin’s Creed Shadows is just as big as – if not slightly bigger than – the core map in 2020’s Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-navigate-in-assassin-s-creed-shadows">How to Navigate in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>



<p>The best way to navigate the massive map in Assassin’s Creed Shadows is simply to explore. By using synchronisation viewpoints, you can get your bearings relatively easily, and you can use map markers to keep track of key locations you want to visit.</p>



<p>If you’re really stuck for navigation, you can employ Scouts that go out and determine the specific location of objectives for you. Alternatively, you can just use the guided mode to have map markers revealed in full, which makes the game a walk in the park.</p>



<p>It’s advised to stay out of the dense forests and mountainous regions of the Assassin’s Creed Shadows map, as moving through them can be laborious and, at times, impossible. You can’t climb every surface in this game as you could in previous titles.</p>



<p>It’s guaranteed to take you a <strong>very long time </strong>to uncover everything the Assassin’s Creed Shadows map has to offer, and there’s plenty of side content up for grabs. Be prepared to spend many hours exploring the beautiful environments found in this game.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[EA Sources Confident of NFL License Agreement]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sources-confident-of-nfl-license-agreement/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-sources-confident-of-nfl-license-agreement.1138266/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ea-sources-confident-of-nfl-license-agreement/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>EA is “confident” that an extension of the licensing agreement between the company and the NFL will be reached and the partnership for Madden NFL will continue “for years to come”. That, according to multiple sources with knowledge of the situation.</p>



<p>For months now, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-nfl-negotiating-license-extension-for-madden/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">negotiations between the league</a> and publisher regarding the exclusive NFL license that EA has held for 20 years have continued. The current deal is scheduled to end after the 2026 NFL season.</p>



<p>A reason behind the confidence of the partnership continuing are the current plans in development for the Madden NFL franchise.</p>



<p>“We have things in the works that are two, three, four years away,” one source said. “There’s a lot in the pipeline that has been heavily planned with designing well underway. Putting those resources into something that might be ending just wouldn’t make financial sense.”</p>



<h6 id="h-subscribe-insider-gaming-on-youtube">SUBSCRIBE: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@insider_gaming?sub_confirmation=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming on YouTube</a></h6>



<p>When pressed on what that “pipeline” includes, sources wouldn’t go into much detail aside from saying there are features coming “brand new to the game”. They couldn’t confirm whether any will be ready for Madden 26 or not.</p>



<p>One NFL source said that the league is “so closely aligned with the development with the key beats and moments throughout the season” and that “over the years, that relationship has only gotten stronger.”</p>



<p>When asked about the possibility of EA retaining the license but in a non-exclusive matter, it wasn’t ruled out. However no one who spoke under the condition on anonymity think it’s likely unless the NFL is “blown away” by an offer to open it up.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that, as of publishing, nothing sources have said indicate that a deal has been signed. That said, there’s always the possibility that something has already been agreed up and limited people know about it. On the other side, until i’s are dotted and t’s are crossed, there’s always the chance things turn south.</p>



<p>When looking for official comment on the status of talks with EA regarding the license, the NFL chose to “hold off&nbsp;on providing any official commentary”.</p>



<p><em>NOTE: This is an expanded story of an exclusive that first appeared in the Insider Gaming newsletter.</em></p>

<p>In September 2024, Nicholas Prosper gunned down his mother and sister and stabbed his younger brother to death at their home in Luton in the United Kingdom. Today, the 19-year-old appeared in Luton Crown Court for sentencing, admitting in front of the room that he had planned the killings for several months and desired to extend his heinous goal by slaughtering schoolchildren.</p>



<p>In details obtained by the BBC, Prosper revealed a disturbing obsession with Clementine, a young female character from The Walking Dead games pieced together by Telltale. He insisted that his goal was to ‘join her in death’ and that he had been ‘chosen’ by her for this ‘mission’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-friday-the-13th">Friday the 13th</h2>



<p>Nicholas Prosper brutally murdered his family at their home in the United Kingdom, and if he weren’t apprehended by police two hours later, a reprehensible scene could have played out.</p>



<p>Prosper’s full plan was to venture into his old primary (elementary) school on Friday the 13th while dressed in a ‘distinctive outfit’ and wielding a shotgun he’d obtained illegally. Reportedly, he wanted to ‘execute’ as many as 30 children and had researched past massacres online.</p>



<p>In his defence, his barrister had stressed that Prosper was perhaps tainted by an internet ‘wormhole’ that caused something ‘very wrong’ to happen with the teenager’s psyche.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/cn8ld834398t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The BBC</a> published exclusive details about the case, explaining how Prosper revealed to a prison nurse that he intended to kill himself after the shooting and that his ultimate desire was to ‘go to Clementine and join her’.</p>



<p>He was referring to a major character in Telltale’s The Walking Dead games, who appeared in the first title in 2012 as a young child before evolving into a hardened survivor.</p>



<p>Prosper posted a video online after murdering his family, in which he explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I am the chosen one; chosen by Clementine. I am guided as Christians are guided by Jesus Christ.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also uploaded videos ahead of the crime, revealing his ‘distinctive’ outfit and wielding a plank of wood in place of the shotgun he’d eventually use.</p>



<p>The judge presiding over the case will pass sentencing on Wednesday.</p>

		<p>Sony has formed a brand new first party studio to develop new PlayStation games, with this new studio called Dark Outlaw Games. The studio is being headed by Jason Blundell, who spent much of his career at Activision working on Call of Duty games from Call of Duty 3 to Black Ops 4 moving up to game director in the process. Blundell left Treyarch in 2020, formed Deviation Games in 2021, left Deviation Games in 2022, with the studio shuttering in 2024.</p>
<p>In an interview with Jeff Gertsmann, Jason said,<em> “It’s such a privilege to be able to do it with Sony as a new first-party studio. Sony doesn’t set up first-party studios all the time. To have that privilege is humbling, it’s really nice. I’m really excited.”</em></p>


<p>Dark Outlaw Games has been working on a new project, but no details have been released about what that game is going to be. With Jason Blundell’s vast experience with Call of Duty, it would not be surprising if this would be a first person shooter or some kind of action game. We will have to see what the game is when Sony and Dark Outlaw Games are ready to reveal details. There is no release window that we can even begin to guess for when this game will be coming out.</p>

Tarkir: Dragonstorm returns to Magic’s own plane of Tarkir, and we’ve got an exclusive first look at a five cards that I expect we’ll be seeing a lot of at the draft table next month. (The expansion is <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGGk3W?object_uuid=b7479dde-baec-43cd-99b5-321a9dfc140a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">available to preorder</a> now on Amazon).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Flip through the gallery below to see all five cards</strong>, and read on for a word from Wizards of the Coast about their design and the set as a whole.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Magic: The Gathering - 5 New Cards from Tarkir: Dragonstorm</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These five cards are what’s referred to as a “cycle,” with all of them sharing some common design ground spread across each of Magic’s colors. In this case, all five are cheap, common-rarity creatures with an ability tied to one of Tarkir’s three-color clans, and another that allows you to turn mana into a color from that clan. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Three-color limited environments need quite a bit of mana fixing, at all rarities” explains Wizards of the Coast Senior Game Designer Adam Prosak. “We wanted lots of decks to be able to access mana fixing, so we created quite a few designs dedicated to helping solve mana issues. In particular, these creatures allow you to play to the board while developing your mana at the same time - many other designs (such as tapped lands) only make mana and you tend to fall behind in order to fix your mana.”</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Preorder MTG Tarkir: Dragonstorm Cards</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Senior Worldbuilding Designer Lauren Bond says that while that mechanical side came first with this particular cycle, the team often relies on common cards as a place to showcase the world of a set - in this case, how these clans are different from the last time players saw them. “The passionate action-oriented monks of the Jeskai, the Whispers using Temur magic, Nagas in the Sultai as protectors (and avengers) of the jungle, Mardu military prowess including supporting roles (and that dragons can come in many shapes and sizes!), and Abzan clerics regrowing the lost kin trees.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One criticism of some recent Magic sets has been an overreliance on tropes or thematic gimmicks, even while revisiting previous planes, which makes Dragonstorm standout in its comparatively straightforward return to Tarkir. Senior Worldbuilding Art Director Forrest Schehl says that feedback like that is important to WOTC, but that “top-level pitch for Tarkir was established well before the release of Murders at Karlov Manor” and the sets that followed, and didn’t change after them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We wanted to combine Dragons and Clans in a way that hadn’t been seen on Tarkir in the same set and the Dragonstorms that were a defining feature of the plane were going to play a big role in shaping how we approached this ‘return-to’. The pressure to get it right was something Lauren and I felt from day one, we always wanted to build the next chapter of this beloved plane with authenticity and substance.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-tarkir-dragonstorm-where-to-buy"><u>Tarkir: Dragonstorm is up for preorder now</u></a>, with the set scheduled for release in both paper and digitally on April 11 and in-store prerelease events kicking off on April 4. Read on for the full interview with Wizards of the Coast’s Adam Prosak, Lauren Bond, and Forrest Schehl:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/18/tarkir-3-1742273567820.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: This card cycle seems laser targeted at being much-needed glue for Limited - what were the goals these cards needed to achieve?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Adam Prosak, Senior Game Designer: </strong>Three-color limited environments need quite a bit of mana fixing, at all rarities. We wanted lots of decks to be able to access mana fixing, so we created quite a few designs dedicated to helping solve mana issues. In particular, these creatures allow you to play to the board while developing your mana at the same time - many other designs (such as tapped lands) only make mana and you tend to fall behind in order to fix your mana.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>They also strike me as “lore glue,” if you will, with each providing some insight into their clans. Was that an explicit part of their role in the set?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Lauren Bond, Senior Worldbuilding Designer: </strong>While the mechanics of these cards came first, as worldbuilders we often look to common cards (especially cycles) as a place to showcase key elements of setting as players will see them frequently in drafts. This cycle being anchored in the “returning color” of each clan was an opportunity to show how that color manifests in the new version of the clan. The passionate action-oriented monks of the Jeskai, the Whispers using Temur magic, Nagas in the Sultai as protectors (and avengers) of the jungle, Mardu military prowess including supporting roles (and that dragons can come in many shapes and sizes!), and Abzan clerics regrowing the lost kin trees. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Three-color sets aren’t made very often, can you talk about some of the challenges of doing them and how you tried to address those in Dragonstorm?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>AP:</strong> By their nature, three-color cards go into fewer decks than their monocolor (or two color) counterparts. They are often exciting, as long as they aren’t overdone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Building a sealed/draft environment is the biggest challenge – most constructed formats easily allow for three colors, so it’s not too challenging for three color cards to find a home. On the other hand, we have to provide enough mana fixing to allow players to play their three color cards, without making it so plentiful that there every deck can play all five colors easily.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/18/tarkir-1-1742273567820.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>This will be the first time since 2023's Lost Caverns of Ixalan that a Standard set has returned to an existing plane without some sort of thematic twist like Aetherdrift or Murders at Karlov Manor, and the rest of 2025’s line-up means it will be the last time a set does so for roughly another year after that at least. With that in mind, is there an added pressure here to do justice to what fans are expecting of both Tarkir and a “classic” Magic setting in general? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Forrest Schehl, Senior Worldbuilding Art Director: </strong>Fan feedback is super important to us and is something we take into consideration during early development of every new set we make. That being said, the top-level pitch for Tarkir was established well before the release of Murders at Karlov Manor and remained the same throughout development. We wanted to combine Dragons and Clans in a way that hadn’t been seen on Tarkir in the same set and the Dragonstorms that were a defining feature of the plane were going to play a big role in shaping how we approached this “return-to”. The pressure to get it right was something Lauren and I felt from day one, we always wanted to build the next chapter of this beloved plane with authenticity and substance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Lastly, while it’s one that was previously revealed, I have to ask about </strong><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdm/123/stormscale-scion" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>Stormscale Scion</strong></u></a><strong> - a card that is mocking the </strong><a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/making-magic/storm-scale-throne-of-eldraine-through-strixhaven-part-1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>Storm Scale</strong></u></a><strong> itself! People have had a lot of fun talking about this card and the unexpected return of Storm to Standard, was that a hard decision to make? Is there a bit of an enticing challenge to returning to “risky” mechanics like that, Affinity, or Phyrexian Mana in recent years? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>AP:</strong> I find that making new cards for existing mechanics is often easier than making new mechanics. With existing mechanics, we are able to learn some lessons about what worked well and what pitfalls to avoid. With the Stormscale Scion, we found that the card is fun and powerful even with a few copies, so we leaned into that rather than some of the other storm cards that win you the game, but only if you’ve cast lots of spells.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em></em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tomrmarks.bsky.social" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Executive Reviews Editor.
