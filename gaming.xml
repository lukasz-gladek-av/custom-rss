In order to redeem the free Burnoff skin, all players have to do is log in to Fortnite on mobile, whether that's on Android or iPhone.</p><p>The new skin is a red and black motorbike outfit with flame motifs called Burnoff, which looks to be a reskin of the all-white Whiteout skin. To redeem the freebie, players will have to log in on Fortnite Mobile on either Android or iOS--though once the skin is acquired it can be used in all versions of Fortnite.

			<p>The Monster Hunter Wilds development team is continuing to identify stability issues and make improvements to the game where possible, including some PC-specific improvements.</p>
<p>In a new message shared on the game's official website, director Yuya Tokuda provided an update on the ongoing game stability improvements the team is researching and implementing, confirming that enhanced texture streaming is planned for future game updates. Texture streaming is among the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gpu-streaming-issues-barely-60-fps-rtx-5080/">probable causes</a> of the game's unstable performance on PC, so the team looking to improve the problem is definitely good news.</p>
<p>In the new message, the Monster Hunter Wilds director also revealed additional details on the Street Fighter 6 special collaboration, which will effectively add Akuma as a playable character via a full armor set and layered armor, tempered (8★) Gore Magala, Rey Dau, Uth Duna, Nu Udra, and Jin Dahaad, balance adjustments, quality of life improvements, a layered weapons system and more coming with tomorrow's 1.011 update and other changes coming with Title Update 2, such as improved Seikret usability and more. You can find all the details <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/topics/director-letter-2505/">here.</a></p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. You can learn more about one of the finest entries in the series by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review</a>.</p>

            <p>Last week's Warhammer Skulls brought announcements for a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-leagues-of-votann-are-coming-to-warhammer-40000-mechanicus-2">new Mechanicus 2 ally faction</a>, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> remaster in the form of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/relic-reveal-warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition-with-full-dlc-and-mod-support">first Dawn Of War and all expansions</a>, and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-boltgun-2-is-coming-2026-but-theres-a-typing-of-the-dead-esque-spinoff-you-can-play-for-free-right-now">free Boltgun typing game</a> in which you tap out phrases like 'emperor' and 'thin your paints' to chainsword cultists. Nestled away in the recesses of that skull, like a coiled snake on a tattoo with the name of someone's pug on it, was a teaser for the next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a> DLC. Here's that teaser.</p>

<p>The hooded zap lad is Sayl the Faithless, a Norscan sorcerer famous for interrupting rituals and turning the attendant spellcasters into chaos spawn. It was fairly slight and esoteric as far as trailers go, but Creative Assembly followed it up with one of those <a href="https://youtu.be/-wN0zM9gp-s">casual sofa talks</a> full of highly curated information and soundbites about how unbeatable their benefits package and workplace satisfaction is.</p>
<p>There was some good stuff in there, in terms of detail. We already knew about Slaanesh's appearance in the DLC, and now it's double-confirmed Norsca will be joining. Sayl's campaign is focused on manipulation, there'll be more monster hunts for Throgg and Seafang raiding from Wulfric, and both are getting new voicelines.</p>
<p>Not mentioned was the DLC's third faction but, as chronicled in a swathe of Reddit posts and <a href="https://youtu.be/BkfUHF2n9jQ">content creator videos</a>, the community seems more or less certain on what that faction is: the high elves, specifically elf naval commander <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Aislinn">Aislinn</a>. He likes tides, 'tides' is in the name, the missing High Elf units from the game include naval-themed centerpieces like the Merwyrm and the Skycutter, there's thematic connections there with Slaanesh, people like elves, and so on. Norsca like to raid on boats, Slaanesh likes to lick boats (canon), elves like to ride boats. It all lines up. I also get the impression Creative Assembly like including at least one good guy or neutral faction in these packs too, just for balance. Things get a bit monochrome and grim if it's all chaos, all the time.</p>
<p>There was another notable in that video, too: all the developers interviewed were from CA Sofia, the sister studio previously responsible for games like Pharaoh and Troy, who seem largely to have been moved on to Twarhammer DLC duty since the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sega-sells-company-of-heroes-developer-relic-and-lays-off-more-staff-at-creative-assembly-and-hardlight">big shake ups at CA last year</a> following the cancellation of Hyenas. This could mean that there's multiple expansions in the works, requiring the attention of director Rich Aldridge and the UK team. Or, it could mean that Alridge and his team are already busy on other, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/future-creative-assembly-games-may-require-blood-thematically-which-sure-sounds-like-a-total-war-warhammer-40000-teaser">more power-armoured Games Workshop adaptations</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Dragon Quest 1 + 2 HD-2D Remake follows the release last year of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake, which went on to be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-exceeded-square-enix-expectations-but-game-sales-drop-overall">huge sales success for Square Enix</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-already-best-selling-game-in-japan-for-2024-after-just-one-week">particularly in Japan</a>.</p>
<p>The company began with the third game in the series as it's chronologically the first, with a post-credits scene confirming the release of the first two games.</p>
<p>The Dragon Quest HD-2D Erdrick Trilogy Collection will be digital-only and include all three games in one collection. It will launch across all platforms on the same day, 30th October.</p>
<p>"Some excellent enhancements make this the ultimate version of Dragon Quest 3, but it could still do more to make it wholly welcoming to newcomers," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review">Eurogamer review of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake</a>.</p>
<p>As for new Dragon Quest games, series creator <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-dragon-quest-12-is-still-in-development-says-series-creator">Yuji Horii confirmed in February that Dragon Quest 12 is still in development</a>. It was first announced in 2021 but little has been seen since.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Square Enix has announced that Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake will launch on 30th October, coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, and PC.</p>
<p>Unlike the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> last year, this is a combined release that will feature both Dragon Quest I and Dragon Quest II. This one release will round out the Erdrick Trilogy, with DQ3 having been a prequel story to the original game – this is why Square Enix chose to remake and release DQ3 first.</p>
<p><iframe title="DRAGON QUEST&nbsp;I&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;II HD-2D&nbsp;Remake  | Teaser&nbsp;Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CDtWQZNL5MA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Dragon Quest I and II both cast the player as a descendant of the legendary hero Erdrick (themselves a heroic descendant), facing off against evil forces that plague the land, be they Dragonlord, evil wizards or whatever else.</p>
<p>While the structure of the turn-based JRPG will remain, these two games are being remade in the HD-2D art style. The battle system is also being refined with quality of life updates throughout and some story additions – details about this new content will come at a later date.</p>

<p>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake will launch both digitally and physically, but there’s a few options here. As well as the standard editions, a digital-only Erdrick Trilogy release will bundle together Dragon Quest I &amp; II with Dragon Quest III. Owning the full Erdrick Trilogy (whether bought together or separately) can unlock a Dog Sui for DQ1 and a Cat Suit for DQ2.</p>
<p>There is also a collector’s edition physical release that will include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>DRAGON QUEST I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em> Standard Edition physical game</li>
<li><em>DRAGON QUEST I &amp; II</em> Character &amp; Monster Blocks Complete Set
<ul>
<li>Including six characters, a dog, two boss monsters and logo</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Outstanding Outfit Kit (<em>DRAGON QUEST I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em> in-game items)
<ul>
<li>Ring of Strength x1</li>
<li>Slime Earrings x1</li>
<li>Mad Cap x1</li>
<li>Arriviste’s Vest x1</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Exclusive digital wallpapers x2</li>
<li>Pre-order bonus</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve just been hands on with Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake, with Nic coming away suitably impressed. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/27/dragon-quest-i-i%E2%80%A6ing-jrpg-trilogy/">Read out preview here.</a></p>
<p>We also <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/13/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review/">reviewed Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> last year, calling it “a lovingly-crafted celebration of gaming’s most iconic franchises. Rather than reinvent that wheel and change the game for modern audiences, Square Enix has highlighted and elevated the elements that made this such an iconic game all those decades ago, while slipping in a treasure trove of quality-of-life features that make it an even smoother experience to either dive into for the first time ever or return to yet again.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-rumored-for-nintendo-switch-2-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/NWeedle/status/1926682916760793582?ref_src" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spanish insider Nash Weedle</a>, Neowiz's highly successful Soulslike game <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-sold-over-1-million-units-in-less-than-a-month-despite-being-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lies of P</a> is headed to the Nintendo Switch 2. Here's what they wrote on X:</p>
<p><em>I can confirm that a port of Lies of P for SWITCH 2 is in the works. Its announcement could be made in June, but it depends on “some factors” of the port's development, as they want to show it with a release date. Following the latest information about the Lies of P DLC, I started to pull the thread and was able to confirm with a contact that the port is in development for Switch 2. According to Digital Foundry, Double A-studios had not received the development kit, but this is not true.</em></p>
<p>Honestly, it would not be surprising at all if Neowiz were indeed porting the game. Third-party developers and publishers are <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-cyberpunk-2077-hades-2-and-more-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flocking to the new Nintendo console</a>, and it's not like it's very heavy in terms of performance requirements, anyway - on PC, it can <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-pc-requirements-rx6700-rtx2060/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run</a> on far weaker hardware than what's in the Switch 2:</p>
<p><em>Processor: AMD Ryzen 3 1200／Intel Core i5-7500</em></p>
<p><em>Memory: 8 GB RAM</em></p>
<p><em>Graphics: AMD Radeon RX 560 4GB / NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 4GB</em></p>
<p>Now the question is rather whether the port will launch alongside the Lies of P DLC, Overture, which still has no release date but should be available relatively soon. Our Kai Tatsumoto recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-overture-hands-on-preview-krats-winter-wonderland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previewed</a> Overture at a press event:</p>
<p><em>Three hours were not enough to do more than scratch the surface of Lies of P: Overture, and I’m already considering how my NG+3 playthrough will go in preparation for tackling the DLC. There’s initially a bigger focus early on with using large two-handed weapons in Overture, so I’m looking forward to picking up that gunblade once more and exploding my way to glory. There isn’t a firm release date beyond Summer 2025, but alongside the Overture DLC, there will also be a sizable patch with quality of life fixes for all players, including two new difficulty levels geared towards a more story-focused experience for those that might want to explore Krat but not have to fully engage with parrying and the other more difficult nuances to Lies of P’s combat. Lastly, Lies of P Overture will launch as a $29.99 premium DLC for the base game.</em></p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The dirt-speckled WRC <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racing games</a> that were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-arent-making-any-more-rally-games-but-there-are-alternatives">dumped by Electronic Arts</a> a few weeks ago have already found a new partner in Nacon. The French publishers are promising a "complete reboot" of the rally game series, and have exclusive rights on the grubby wheelspinners until at least 2032. This isn't the first time the publisher have had stewardship of the WRC either, so it all kinda makes sense.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Nacon is pleased to announce the signing of a new agreement with WRC Promoter for the publishing of games based on the FIA World Rally Championship," they said in <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/05/26/3088220/0/en/PRESS-RELEASE-NACON-ANNOUNCES-AGREEMENT-WITH-WRC-PROMOTER-FOR-THE-PUBLISHING-OF-THE-OFFICIAL-GAMES-OF-THE-FIA-WORLD-RALLY-CHAMPIONSHIP-FROM-2027-TO-2032.html">a press release</a>. "The agreement covers the development and publishing of the official WRC games and eSports competitions, granting Nacon exclusive rights for PC and consoles for six seasons, from 2027 through 2032.</p>
<p>"The games will feature the official rallies, vehicles, teams, drivers, and sponsors among the many anticipated content elements. This project represents a complete reboot of the franchise, based on an entirely fresh vision, and marks an ambitious new chapter in the brand’s development." </p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>They don't yet say which studio, in-house or otherwise, will actually develop the vroomy vrooms. But Nacon are the owners of Kylotonn, as <a "="" a-month-after-electronic-arts-mashed-the-brakes-wrc-rally-racing-games-are-coming-back-with-a-complete-reboot-under-a-new-publisher="" games="" href-"https:="" racing="" www.pcgamer.com="">PC Gamer point out</a>. Aka, the developers who previously made WRC games for a long time, including WRC 10 in 2021 and WRC Generations in 2022. So the most likely outcome is that the games will be handed back to them. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the governing body of the rally championship, the FIA (Federation Internationale de l'Automobile), seem happy enough to bounce back to old partners.</p>
<p>"After a comprehensive evaluation, we are delighted to have reached an agreement with Nacon," said a marketing chief. "Their vision for the franchise stands out, and their expertise in delivering great rally games is unquestioned."</p>
<p>Well, it is a <em>little</em> questioned. Their most recent game, Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown was badly received, with players complaining about dead servers, crashes, grind, and a lack of an offline single player mode. It's sitting at a "mostly negative" average on Steam. Their last rally game, WRC Generations, has a "mixed" review average. Perhaps now is the time to check out all those other cool little indie rally games, like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/drive-rally-blends-wrc-seriousness-with-arcade-cheer">#Drive Rally</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/parking-garage-rally-circuit">Parking Garage Rally Circuit</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/550320/art_of_rally/">Art Of Rally</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake was a massive success for Square Enix, earning the praise of fans and critics alike. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In Wccftech's review</a>, the game was rated 8.6 out of 10 by Kai Tatsumoto:</p>
<p><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake has been given a complete graphical overhaul, instead giving the iconic RPG a makeover in the same vein as Square-Enix’s Octopath Traveler and other similar titles. The entire world is brightly colored and blooming with light. Even if you’re intimately familiar with every step retracing Ortega’s journey, the complete reimagining of the adventure makes this feel like a brand new adventure rather than just another release of Seeds of Salvation. All I can say now is that I can’t wait to go through the other Remakes next year.</em></p>

            <p>The Last of Us season two finale, which aired early on Monday morning here in the UK, welcomed 3.7 million cross-platform viewers in the US.</p>
<p>This figure is significantly lower than the season's opening episode, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-debut-viewing-figures-beat-season-one-premiere">which premiered with 5.3 million same-day US cross-platform viewers</a>. To compare further, The Last of Us' first season finale set an audience record of 8.2 million viewers on its debut.</p>
<p>However in a <a href="https://press.wbd.com/us/media-release/hbo-0/last-us/influx-viewers-raises-global-audience-over-90-million-last-us">press release</a>, HBO said it expects to see the second season finale's audience "grow significantly" following the Memorial Day holiday weekend, which contributed to lower viewer numbers.</p>

<p>Additionally, the network states the second season of The Last of Us is now averaging close to 37 million global viewers per episode, with that number "growing".</p>
<p>To give more context, following its debut in 2023, HBO said the first season of The Last of Us was averaging nearly 32 million cross-platform viewers per episode in the States. At this time, the company added <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-averaging-32m-viewers-per-episode-in-us-most-watched-hbo-max-show-in-europe">The Last of Us was the most-watched show in the history of HBO Max in both Europe and Latin America</a>.</p>
<p>Viewer numbers have continued to rise since season one's release, and the show's global audience now sits at more than 90 million.</p>
<p>The second season of The Last of Us picks up five years after the events of the season one finale, with Ellie and Joel - played by Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal - now living in Jackson. New cast members this season include Kaitlyn Dever as Abby, Isabela Merced as Dina, Young Mazino as Jesse and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-who-catherine-ohara-will-play-in-the-last-of-us-marking-a-significant-change-from-the-games">Catherine O'Hara as a new character for the show, Gail</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to its season two premiere, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-show-renewed-for-season-three-and-the-second-hasnt-even-aired-yet">The Last of Us was renewed for a third season</a>. At this time, showrunner Craig Mazin said: "We approached season two with the goal of creating something we could be proud of. The end results have exceeded even our most ambitious goals, thanks to our continued collaboration with HBO and the impeccable work of our unparalleled cast and crew."</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the showrunner confirmed The Last of Us TV team is working on a four season plan, stating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-confirms-four-season-plan-says-no-way-to-wrap-things-up-in-three">there's "no way" the show's narrative can be wrapped up in only three seasons</a>.

		<p>Dragon Quest sits in a strange part of gamers’ collective experience. Either you’re Japanese and you’ve played it, or you’re not and you’ve played something inspired by it.</p>
<p>OK, sure, this is a gross oversimplification, but there is an element of truth to it. The 1986 RPG Dragon Quest is still huge in Japan. It’s so ubiquitous there that you can see it everywhere from T-shirts to convenience stores, with aisles decked out with the latest tie in. Dragon Warrior, as it was called in the US when it was released 3 years later, but it wasn’t until Dragon Quest VIII in 2004 that the series really had any traction outside Japan, but then pivoted away to DS ports and an MMORPG. Even so,&nbsp;almost any serious gamer will recognise the series mascot, the Slime.</p>
<p>Yet, without Dragon Quest we wouldn’t have had Final Fantasy — series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi said he drew inspiration from Dragon Quest. And how many games have been inspired in turn by Final Fantasy? Without Akira, we wouldn’t have The Matrix. Without Dragon Quest, the mind boggles as to what we would be missing out on.</p>
<p><iframe title="DRAGON QUEST I &amp; II HD-2D Remake – Teaser Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CC1iBil7DR0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>So, with its lofty position in video game history in mind, how many of us have actually played the Erdrick Trilogy? Why does one even quest for dragons?</p>

<p>Fortunately, on October 30 this year, we’re all going to get the opportunity to put that right, with the Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake.</p>
<p>We got a hands on session earlier this month, playing around 20 minutes of each of the two games. And so far, we’re very impressed. In short, the first game follows the descendent of the legendary hero Erdrick, on a quest to defeat the Dragonlord. In Dragon Quest II, which jumps forward in time a little, follows future descendants of Erdrick on their quest to solve the problem of the day (spoilers etc).</p>
<p>The weird thing is that Dragon Quest 1 isn’t the first one in the series chronology. Dragon Quest 3 is actually the prequel, and an excellent one at that, following the adventures of Erdrick himself. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/13/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review/">We gave Dragon Quest 3 a solid 9/10</a> when we reviewed it last November.</p>

<p>In many ways, the upcoming remakes of 1 and 2 follow in the footsteps of number 3. The skeleton of these games is much the same, but with some modern tweaks to make things a lot easier in 2025. The HD-2D art style harks back to the original pixellated visuals and are incredibly nostalgic for those of us who grew up with turn-based RPGs, but lends the game a modernity that looks fantastic when expanded to fill a modern TV screen.</p>
<p>But then there’s the gameplay updates like variable difficulty, tweaks to improve combat, and ability to set different combat speeds to help you get through the game quicker. It sounds like a minor thing, but once you realise you can blitz through combat, it’s hard to go back. On top of this, we’ve been promised never-before-seen story content, which is something that all fans should be excited by.</p>

<p>If you want to make a start on the story and prefer physical media, you can already pick up and play Dragon Quest 3 and games 1 and 2 on release. However, if you want to wait and don’t mind digital-only games, you can wait to pick up the Dragon Quest HD-2D Erdrick Trilogy Collection, which packages all three games into a single definitive set.</p>
<p><i>Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake is released October 30 2025 on Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2,&nbsp; PlayStation 5, Xbox X/S and PC.</i></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/davy-x-jones-is-an-intriguing-fps-from-the-makers-of-blacktail/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Polish developer PARASIGHT, maker of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/blacktail-intriguing-slavic-witchcraft/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BLACKTAIL</a>, has announced a new and intriguing first-person shooter game titled DAVY x JONES.</p>
<p>As you might easily guess from the title, the protagonist is the infamous pirate of legend. In this game, though, he's been betrayed, robbed, and even beheaded. But that's not the end for him, who falls into The Locker, a surreal pirate hell, and allies with his own skull - a guide and a source of endless jokes - to get revenge on the one who wronged him, none other than Blackbeard.</p>
<p>Bartosz Kaproń, CEO and Creative Director of PARASIGHT, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We're beyond excited to finally unleash DAVY x JONES upon the world. At PARASIGHT, we believe great stories should hit as hard as the action—and in DAVY x JONES, they literally do. We split our protagonist in two—his skull and his body—and threw them into the pirate underworld to fight their way back to legend. It’s our wildest journey yet, packed with surreal adventure, larger-than-life characters, and just enough surprise to keep things fun. If you've ever dreamed of swashbuckling through the afterlife with your own severed head cracking wise beside you—this is your game.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Davy x Jones: Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QFXyTRgrRi0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Locker is split into nine islands drifting across an endless sea of clouds. In these unique environments, players will face twisted fiends, cursed souls, and legendary behemoths like the Kraken — guardians of the underworld’s darkest secrets.</p>
<p>However, another behemoth, the whale-ship hybrid Abby, befriends the protagonist and becomes his mobile base. Players can even recruit legendary officers to crew her and unleash her cannons in combat. Fights will mix swordfighting, gun action, and a grappling hook to get close.</p>
<p>Moreover, enemy drops provide an element of risk versus reward. Each defeated enemy drops Underworld Essence, and when Essences converge, they merge into a treasure chest containing powerful loot. However, each chest also unleashes an unpredictable fiend, so it's up to the player to decide whether to take that risk.</p>
<p>There's no release window yet, but DAVY x JONES will be launched for PC (there's already a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2611170/DAVY_x_JONES/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam page)</a> and consoles.</p>

            <p>It looks like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii">Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2</a> will be getting a physical release across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40602/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii/">ESRB</a> posted about a release for Ninja Theory's sequel across Xbox Series and Playstation 5. This time, though, Microsoft was not listed as the game's publisher, but Limited Run Games was instead.</p>

<p>Limited Run Games is known for publishing physical editions of games which may otherwise remain only available to purchase digitally. So, while an official announcement hasn't been made, this rating all but confirms the physical editions' existence.</p>
<p>In addition to the above releases for Hellblade 2 on PS5 and Xbox Series X, a new Switch listing for the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hellblade">Hellblade</a> game has also been added to <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40601/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice/">ESRB</a>, again with Limited Run Games listed as publisher. This suggests Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice will also be getting a physical Switch version. The first Hellblade game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2019-hellblade-switch-tech-analysis">originally arrived on Nintendo's platform digitally back in 2019</a>. </p>

<p>Earlier this month, Ninja Theory announced Hellblade 2 was set for a PS5 release this summer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-coming-to-ps5-in-enhanced-edition">in a package known as Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 Enhanced Edition</a>. This release will include new features and haptic feedback, and also be optimised for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>. A free update will be coming to the PC and Xbox versions of the game.</p>
<p>Unlike its predecessor, Hellblade 2 did not initially release on PlayStation, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-buys-ninja-theory-playground-games-more">Ninja Theory was acquired by Xbox maker Microsoft in 2018</a>.</p>
<p>"We have such incredible fans of Ninja Theory on PlayStation going all the way back to the days of Heavenly Sword," studio head Dom Matthews said at the time of the game's PS5 announcement. "And we're so pleased that we can welcome PlayStation fans back to Senua's story."</p>

<p>We were rather taken with Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 on its debut last year, with Johnny Chiodini calling it a "triumphant return to a challenging story" in their review. "Hellblade 2 continues Senua's story with grace, confidence, surprising brutality and thundering conviction," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-review">Eurogamer's five star Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 review</a>.</p>
<p>The Hellblade sequel went on to become the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-receives-most-nominations-at-this-years-bafta-games-awards">most-nominated game at this year's BAFTA Game Awards</a>, ultimately winning the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-is-this-years-big-winner-at-the-bafta-game-awards">award for Technical Achievement</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Last of Us Part 2 isn't short on death and misery. Seattle is carnage, with warring factions the WLF (Wolves) and the Seraphites (Scars) taking no mercy on each other, and that's before you add Ellie or any of the Jackson community into the mix.</p>
<p>The TV series has remained faithful to most of the game's key deaths. As in Part 2, The Last of Us' second season sees Joel, Nora, Mel, Owen and Jesse murdered, the latter three all in the series finale. One character, however, makes it out alive despite being killed in the game: Alice.</p>
<p>Alice is one of the WLF's canine companions in The Last of Us Part 2, and while she may only be an animation, at the end of the day her death was one that actually hit me hardest when I played the game for the first time. When Ellie makes her way into the aquarium during her search for Abby, Alice is alerted by the noise and attacks her. Ellie then fatally stabs Alice with her switchblade. However, this doesn't happen in the show.</p>
<p>Why? There are two reasons. The first is that The Last of Us showrunner Craig Mazin, who also penned Chernobyl, felt he couldn't do another pet killing scene. Chernobyl is a historical miniseries which revolves around the Chernobyl disaster of 1986, and one moment sees pets culled in a bid to stem the spread of radiation.</p>
<p>"I think you get like one dog murdering episode a lifetime," Mazin said when the topic of The Last of Us' Alice came up during a recent press event (thanks, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/601536/last-of-us-season-2-ending-changes-breakdown">Polygon</a>). "There are two cardinal rules in Hollywood. One: don't spend your own money. Two: don't kill a dog."</p>
<p>The showrunner added that "because it's live action, the nature of violence becomes much more, well, graphic. It's more graphic because... it's not like there's an animation between you and it, [and] it's very disturbing".</p>
<p>So, that's Mazin's reason for not including Alice's death in the show's second season, but what was <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s Neil Druckman's? Well, essentially, the finale had too much death already, with Ellie herself nearly dying at the hands of the Seraphites, before she proceeds to kill Owen and Mel (and by extension Mel's unborn baby) pretty soon after. Then, before the episode wraps for good, Jesse is shot in the face by Abby, and dies immediately from his wound. It is all quite harrowing as it is, let alone if we then had to also see a dog get murdered in the name of revenge.</p>
<p>"And in our conversation, we're like this [is] probably one too many," Druckmann concluded.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-first-impressions-classic-dq-has-never-looked-so-good<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Anecdotally, it’s been said that in its native Japan, Dragon Quest is more popular than Final Fantasy, which is more popular abroad. This is most obvious for any fans of fantasy anime who will find Dragon Quest’s undeniable influence over the genre, from monster designs like Slimes to other fantasy tropes pioneered by the early Dragon Quest games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As someone who grew up primarily in the United States, I’m in the camp of gamers more familiar with the Final Fantasy series, with only a passing familiarity with Dragon Quest. Plus, while newer entries like Dragon Quest 11 have been rapturously received by fans, it’s the older Dragon Quest games that hold that certain air of history and mystique for someone like me who’s more interested in the legacy of the series.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake: Preview Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Which also means it’s been a pretty good couple of years for me as Square Enix is finally remaking these older, beloved, Dragon Quest games for modern systems – and with a fresh new look. Rather than a full, polygonal upgrade, Square Enix is utilizing the retro-modern fusion they call HD-2D from its Octopath series to revive games like Dragon Quest 3 for modern audiences. And that continues with its next remake, Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake, coming later this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being released before Dragon Quest 3, Dragon Quest 1 and Dragon Quest 2 are actually sequels, so playing Dragon Quest 3, 1, and 2 in that order is chronologically correct within the game’s universe. I got a chance to play those next two recently on PlayStation 5, and I came away even more excited to finally discover these early Dragon Quest titles.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>The Best Way to Play the Original Dragon Quest Games</strong></h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The first three Dragon Quest games comprise the “Erdrick Trilogy” – named after the hero of Dragon Quest 3. It’s no spoiler to say that in Dragon Quest 3, Erdrick is successful in his mission to save the kingdom from evil. You will then play as Erdrick’s descendents in Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2. Thus, Square Enix is actually releasing these games in chronological order, which is nice of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Up until these remakes, these have only been released as ports on mobile and certain game consoles, but there’s no need to bother with those now, unless you want a truly classic experience.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>How Square Enix is Modernizing Dragon Quest</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Given the legendary status of these games, Square Enix has to walk a bit of a tightrope trying to maintain parts of them that fans already love while modernizing some of the more dated bits. These changes, aside from the art style, are typically related to gameplay and storytelling, I’m told. In Dragon Quest 1 for example, there was no party system in the series yet, so the whole campaign is played using a single character who fights one enemy at a time. This has been changed so that now the player, while still solo, faces multiple enemies at once.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The two games are also “shorter” compared to modern RPGs, with How Long to Beat clocking <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/2833" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragon Quest 1 at around 10 hours,</a> while <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/2837" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dragon Quest 2 dials it up to 16 hours</a> of playtime. Square Enix says they’ve beefed up some of the content and cutscenes to try and push those numbers up a bit, but don’t expect to be suddenly playing a 100-hour RPG.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Even Better Looking Than Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/24/dq2-field-pc-1748045668905.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Dragon Quest 2 HD-2D Remake. Credit: Square Enix</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The main draw of the remakes, certainly, is the visual style. Square Enix has championed this HD-2D art style – wherein pixelated 2D player character models exist in a vibrant, 3D world. Despite already playing games like Octopath Traveler 2 and Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D in this art style, it somehow looks even better in the upcoming collection.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The textures are even sharper, making the contrast between the 2D pixels and the 3D world starker, but more striking as a result. The 2D pixels have also received an upgrade, though you might not realize it at first. I compared some of the screenshots Square Enix sent over with my copy of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D running on the Switch, and they’re quite different, with the pixelwork in Dragon 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D looking much more detailed and sophisticated than the pixels in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-review">Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The character models are a little larger, and much more detailed with their armor and weapons looking particularly sophisticated in the new remakes. I found the art style, combined with the gorgeous music, drawing me into the world of Dragon Quest quite completely. Square Enix put out some chips during my preview event and I found myself munching away while fully engrossed in the story of the hero’s party discovering the wreckage of a fallen kingdom. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a way, Dragon Quest’s, let’s say “classic” storyline and trope-ish setting is easier to appreciate today than maybe a decade ago. Nowadays, with graphics as advanced as they are and storylines trying to compete with the biggest movies and TV shows, Dragon Quest is a reminder that some stories are timeless for a reason. I’m looking forward to playing both of these HD-2D remakes  when they’re released on October 30, 2025 for all major systems – including the Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Mario Kart World will be available, but among the other few original titles is a game called <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/survival-kids">Survival Kids</a>. You'd be forgiven for not knowing it is actually part of a larger series. The first game in the series released in 1999 for the Game Boy Color and shared the name of the upcoming Swtich 2 sequel, Survival Kids. It received a Game Boy sequel and then the series continued on DS and Wii where it had a different name, Lost in Blue.</p><p>A few days ago, Survival Kids was added to the Nintendo Online Game Boy library alongside Gradius The Interstellar Assault, Kirby's Star Stacker, and The Sword of Hope.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BRmpwGGTXOo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BRmpwGGTXOo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Survival Kids, the original game, is a well-liked, innovative title that borrowed ideas from titles like Zelda and Pokémon to create a survival game on a small scale years before the genre became a popular standard. Game Informer scored it a 7.5/10 when it released.</p><p>Physical copies of the game are also quite rare. According to <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/gameboy-color/survival-kids">pricecharting.com</a>, boxed copies of game typically sell for about $430. It's nice to see Nintendo and publisher Konami recognizing potential upcoming interest in the series and making the original game available on Switch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/9-kings-pc-roguelike-deckbuilder-impressions-pc-steam<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>9 Kings</em> is a new game out in Early Access that describes itself as a "fast-paced roguelike kingdom builder", but which I'm going to describe as "a deckbuilder where everything dies, all the time".</p><p>Choosing to play as one of a roster of unlockable kings, each the leader of a distinct faction, you start the game with a 3x3 grid where you can draw cards--and these can be either units, buildings or effects--and play them on one of those tiles, building or engaging whatever it is you lay down. At the end of every turn some bad guys attack (it's an auto-battler, with your direct control limited to setting off some special attacks), then you get to draw another card and do it all again. Like this:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="9 Kings - Launch Trailer | Roguelike Deckbuilder" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k_lsnczriWc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>While <em>9 Kings </em>looks like it's part-city-builder, part-tower defence and might even have some real-time strategy stuff going on, it's really just a card game, where most of your interest will lie in balancing whatever card you draw each turn with what you think you need (or have space for) in your town.</p><p>Space to build--and thus play a card--is extremely limited, so you have to be careful! You might think you need a big army, but loads of troops without supporting buildings (like defensive turrets) can be chewed through in seconds. Conversely, setting down too many fancy buildings can leave you short on manpower when a bigger enemy army comes hurtling at your castle gates.</p><p>The beauty here comes from the fact each of the nine available factions are <em>wildly </em>different, and that every time you defeat an attacking force, the cards you have available to you can feature its units and upgrades instead of your own. Throw in the fact that you'll only be fighting a few of the available roster at any one time, and you can see how each new run can end up completely different to the last, based not only on who you're playing as but how well the cards of your opponents suit that deck and its abilities.</p><figure><figcaption>You're at war with a number of rival Kings at any one time, but in a nice touch every run you also get to declare peace with one of them, usually the one whose cards make the least sense alongside your own deck</figcaption></figure><p>You start the game with just a single character unlocked, the aptly-named generalist, the King Of Nothing. The more runs you make and the more stuff you do in the game (upgrading grids, building units, etc), the more of the other characters you'll gain access to, ranging from the vampire and demon-themed King Of Blood to a guy whose units and buildings are based on cash (the King of Greed) to my favourite, the King Of Progress, who decides "fuck it" and instead of relying on fantasy tropes just brings machine guns and gatling towers to the fight.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2784470/9_Kings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Because <em>9 Kings</em> has launched into Early Access</a> there's still some stuff missing, like promised challenge and ranked modes, but even just what's there--a basic series of increasingly-difficult waves of enemies, culminating in a "victory" that then triggers something of a post-game endless mode--is fantastic. The creativity at your fingertips, the seemingly-endless possibilities for each run given the possible combinations, the extremely cool pixel art on the cards–<em>9 Kings</em> is <em>great</em>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/doom-bathroom-renovation-something-awful-for-sale"><h3>Please Know That The House With The Doom Bathroom Is For Sale</h3></a><p>Calling it a 'uniquely remodeled home' seems like an understatement</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/geoguessr-blackout-esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia"><h3>GeoGuessr Map Makers Make Most Popular Maps Unplayable In Protest Of Saudi-Backed Esports World Cup [Update]</h3></a><p>"The GeoGuessr community is diverse and includes many members of groups that would be harshly persecuted were they to live in Saudi Arabia"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/midea-u-shape-ac-gone"><h3>The Most Popular Window Air Conditioner Has Disappeared From Store Shelves</h3></a><p>The Midea U-Shaped air conditioner is universally beloved.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nacon-is-once-again-publishing-wrc-games-new-wrc-series-in-development/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The FIA World Rally Championship has <a href="https://www.wrc.com/en/news/nacon-confirmed-as-wrc-games-publisher-from-2027-">announced</a> that Nacon will once again be in charge of publishing WRC video games with the official FIA World Rally Championship license after it had previously gone to Codemasters and EA. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/codemasters-wrc-license">Codemasters purchased</a> the licensing rights to make its own series of WRC games in 2020, which began with <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-wrc-roadmap-officially-revealed/">EA Sports WRC 2023</a>, launched on November 3, 2023.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/codemasters-ceo-ea-is-like-our-cinderella-shoe-a-perfect-fit-they-listen-but-dont-force-us/">EA acquired Codemasters</a>, EA was supposed to have the rights to make WRC games from 2023 to 2027, but for whatever reason, either EA or the WRC decided to end the partnership after just one game. Prior to Codemasters' purchasing the WRC licensing rights, Nacon had published the previous seven WRC games, all of which were developed by French developer Kylotonn, which Nacon acquired in 2018.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/codemasters-shows-off-f1-25-gameplay-confirms-wrc-games-are-on-pause/">Codemasters confirmed</a> it would be "<em>pausing development plans on future rally titles.</em>" With today's announcement that the WRC license is back in Nacon's hands, we know why.</p>
<p>"<em>We are thrilled to renew our collaboration with WRC Promoter,</em>" Nacon chief executive officer Alain Falc said in a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/05/26/3088220/0/en/PRESS-RELEASE-NACON-ANNOUNCES-AGREEMENT-WITH-WRC-PROMOTER-FOR-THE-PUBLISHING-OF-THE-OFFICIAL-GAMES-OF-THE-FIA-WORLD-RALLY-CHAMPIONSHIP-FROM-2027-TO-2032.html">press release</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>This iconic license provides an exceptional playground to build a highly refined driving experience that lives up to the expectations of rally fans. Between 2015 and 2023, we had the opportunity to work closely with the championship's official teams and many drivers, allowing us to gain solid and unique expertise in translating rallying into a video game experience. This new venture marks a major milestone: a fully reimagined project driven by a passionate and specialized team, with a clear ambition to elevate rally games to new heights</em>."</p>
<p>The new deal between the FIA World Rally Championship and Nacon gives Nacon the rights to make WRC games for the 2027 to 2032 seasons, which means that Nacon will likely take the next two years to develop the new WRC series announced with this news. According to the press release, this new series is "<em>aiming to deliver an immersive experience that faithfully reflects the reality of the championship and meets the expectations of both rally enthusiasts and new players</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>After a comprehensive evaluation, we are delighted to have reached an agreement with Nacon</em>," said FIA World Rally Championship chief marketing officer Arne Dirks. "<em>Their vision for the franchise stands out, and their expertise in delivering great rally games is unquestioned. We look forward to breaking new ground together in this collaboration, to truly turn the WRC games into epic adventures and offer gaming experiences beyond rally as we know it today</em>."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nacon-regains-the-wrc-license-to-make-rally-racing-games-from-2027.1198992/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/26/nacon-regains-the-wrc-license-to-make-rally-racing-games-from-2027/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>WRC has announced a new licensing partnership with Nacon, granting them exclusive rights to develop and publish the official WRC games and run esports competitions for six seasons, from 2027 through 2032.</p>
<p>The news comes not long after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/30/ea-sports-wrc-will-get-no-more-content-future-rally-game-development-paused/">EA announced that they were giving up on the WRC license</a> after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/02/ea-sports-wrc-review/">one game</a> (albeit with a year of additional content added) and halting the development of rally games in general. While no studio has been confirmed, it’s likely that Nacon will entrust the license to KT Racing once more, the studio having previously made the official WRC game series from 2015 <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/18/wrc-generations-will-be-nacons-last-rally-racer-with-the-license/">through 2022</a>.</p>


<p>This is described as being “an all-new WRC game series” that is “a complete reboot of the franchise, based on an entirely fresh vision, and marks an ambitious new chapter in the brand’s development.”</p>
<p>That’s not entirely surprising given how long it will have been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/08/wrc-generations-review/">since WRC Generations</a>. Launched in 2022, the game was a greatest hits of sorts for KT Racing’s WRC series, launching across generations and with the then incoming Rally1 hybrid cars as the headline act. A few years on an WRC has ditched hybrid engines from Rally1, and there would be further changes by 2027.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to renew our collaboration with WRC Promoter. This iconic license provides an exceptional playground to build a highly refined driving experience that lives up to the expectations of rally fans,” said Alain Falc, CEO of NACON. “Between 2015 and 2023, we had the opportunity to work closely with the championship’s official teams and many drivers, allowing us to gain solid and unique expertise in translating rallying into a video game experience. This new venture marks a major milestone: a fully reimagined project driven by a passionate and specialized team, with a clear ambition to elevate rally games to new heights.”</p>

<p>“After a comprehensive evaluation, we are delighted to have reached an agreement with NACON,” expressed FIA World Rally Championship’s Chief Marketing Officer Arne Dirks. “Their vision for the franchise stands out, and their expertise in delivering great rally games is unquestioned. We look forward to breaking new ground together in this collaboration, to truly turn the WRC games into epic adventures and offer gaming experiences beyond rally as we know it today.”</p>
<p>It’s great to see WRC and rally gaming continue, after a few years that could be seen as lost to fans of the racing sub-genre. Codemasters’ game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/02/ea-sports-wrc-review/">EA Sports WRC</a>, was a good effort, though it brought new technical challenges as the studio adapted to Unreal Engine 4, and clearly didn’t sell enough copies to keep EA invested in the license or genre of racing. It certainly feels like Codemasters might have pushed to acquire the license to make themselves more attractive as an acquisition target, eventually being folded into EA Sports.</p>
<p>In the meantime, KT Racing had the difficult final stretch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/13/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-review/">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a> development and a fraught release, and has Endurance Motorsport Series in development, expected for later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-vr-mod-released-by-luke-ross/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Virtual reality modder Luke Ross has <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/were-eternally-129851027?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_fan&amp;utm_content=web_share" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a new R.E.A.L. VR mod to bring DOOM The Dark Ages to VR devices. To have access to it, you'll need an active subscription to his Patreon at the VR Friend tier, which costs $10 monthly. Of course, this would also provide you with access to all of Luke Ross's prior VR mods, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-vr-mod-coming-thanks-to-modder-luke-ross/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elden Ring</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-vr-mod-by-luke-ross-is-now-available-to-patreon-subscribers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marvel's Spider-Man</a>, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Dark Souls, Death Stranding, and more. The modder had previously released VR ports of Take-Two's Mafia: Definitive Edition, Grand Theft Auto V, and Red Dead Redemption 2, but a DMCA takedown notice from the publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/vr-modder-luke-ross-gets-dmca-notice-for-his-rdr2-gta-and-mafia-vr-mods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forced him to take those down</a>, to the great disappointment of the VR community.</p>
<p>As usual with his mods, VR gaming YouTuber Bearded Banjo was able to check out the new DOOM The Dark Ages Mod beforehand and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0AaIs90I3gY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published an enthusiastic video report of himself playing</a>. Bearded Banjo described the experience as 'fast, frantic, and sometimes overwhelming'. The mod supports head tracking and head-based aiming, but motion controls are unavailable, so you'll have to stick with using the gamepad. Banjo said the gameplay was captured on a PC equipped with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 while using a Quest 3 connected via wired link.</p>
<p>The experience was smooth overall, even though he couldn't get NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution to work with the mod for the time being. This could be fixed in a future update by Luke Ross. As a side note, the VR modder <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/score-one-for-129841705" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> the results of his experiments with <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-how-you-can-run-amd-fsr-4-on-basically-any-title/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Optiscaler</a>, which is a great boost to those wishing to play his VR mods on an AMD GPU:</p>
<p><em>Thanks to that mod, in almost every game that supports DLSS upscaling, you can substitute AMD's FSR implementation and have it run effortlessly on AMD hardware. But from the game's point of view, the video buffers will still be produced in DLSS format, and that means that my R.E.A.L. VR mod can intercept them and fix the disocclusions by translating the calls to work in stereoscopic mode, thus getting rid of the shimmering around nearby objects and NPCs.</em></p>
<p>You can read our DOOM The Dark Ages review (non-VR) <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-the-dark-ages-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. The game has <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-reaches-3-million-players-7x-faster-than-eternal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reached</a> the 3 million player milestone much faster than DOOM Eternal. However, the jury is still out on whether it was financially more successful, as most of those are likely to have played the game on Game Pass. According to Ampere Analysis estimates, over two million players <a href="https://wccftech.com/more-than-2m-doom-the-dark-ages-launch-players-were-on-xbox-only-500k-playing-on-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">checked out the game on Xbox</a> while player numbers on PC and PlayStation 5 were around half a million, definitely lower than anticipated, at least on the PC platform.</p>
