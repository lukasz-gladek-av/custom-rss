					<p>It's rare that a game, one that hasn't had a groundswell of support for a sequel over the past decade - and one that isn't tied into a nostalgic trend, gets a sequel so long after the original. Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 is the 2024 sequel to the 2011 game, naturally made by a completely different developer under a completely different publisher due to the death of THQ. It's not that the original wasn't successful; it was one of THQ's few success stories during their final years, but with so much time passed, will this be the sequel that propels the game forward into the collective consciousness?</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>I must start by admitting my initial time with Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 was not good. Even just launching the game, there were more than a few crashes, and the early video wouldn't play once I got in. The footage was doing nothing but playing the audio in the background. When I got into the tutorial, following some significant loading, it was pretty jittery. I thought the worst might come as I progressed through the campaign, and while things improved, I can understand why the game was delayed and the beta was cancelled.</p>
<p>Now, I will say that things did improve. I'm unsure why the first half-hour felt like my rig suddenly reverted to an older system, but the gameplay was smooth afterwards. I can't say the same for cutscenes. The audio never matched the video, not once. The lips were always about two to three seconds away from the voices, making me feel like I was watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MigPWBhPzTQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kung Pow: Enter the Fist</a>. I must also point out that watching "loading resources" and the bar tick-up was interminably dull every time I launched the game. I've found the loading throughout far longer than I recall in most games. I've also had a few issues when loading textures took a little time.</p>
<p>I may as well stick with the negatives for now. There is no reason for me to be connected to your server or for you to boot me out if it drops. I have played the core missions with the AI controlling my two companions. There's no gain in kicking me out because I had to pause the game and leave the computer for a prolonged period. Take it for granted that when I click to play solo, I don't want to be connected to your damn server, and I don't need to be.</p>

<p>On a somewhat negative note, I found the combat of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 boring after a while. Now, this will be very subjective, and I can imagine other people will thoroughly enjoy the combat, but what started as reasonable enjoyment turned into tedium quite quickly. As expected from an Ultramarine, you are a god amongst men, able to take down thousands. You will mow through hordes of Tyranids; the little ones merely bounce off you while the larger enemies, towering above the fray, will pose a slight bit more of a challenge, but the combat system will make it so your godliness is absolute.</p>
<p>So far, so good. The problem comes with how the combat system balances health and armour. To recover armour specifically, you want to perform executions. You do this by causing enough damage to an enemy that they get stunned, and then you press the required button, and the execution happens. This execution naturally finishes the enemy but also restores some armour. If you don't perform them, you will eventually die, which means they become essential. It also means you will be running around, searching for the flashing red enemy, pressing the button to stay alive (by killing them).</p>
<p>What this essentially means is that you always want to be in melee range, which negates some of the close-range guns, which I found to be worthless for the most part. I don't think all ranged weapons are worthless, if only because you get some ranged enemies - and it's nice to thin the horde from afar, if only for it being cool. There are also a few flying enemies for which you need ranged weapons. You'll also get some grenades you carry in minimal numbers, which I didn't find incredibly useful.</p>
<p>This naturally leaves the melee, and while there are a few weapons, and each has combos, it does become quite the same after a short time. Heavy attack to stun the little buggers, get some executions in, a mix of attacks for the bigger things, when they flash red, execute. You'll also want to watch for some blue and red crosshairs; if it's blue, you can parry; if it's red, you need to dodge. Then it's back to execution city. If I were honest, by the end of the second campaign mission, I was hoping and praying something would change. The game does throw in a few things here and there to spice it up, but it never really evolves.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Which is a shame because the campaign is quite meaty. It takes place across six missions (not including the tutorial), which doesn't sound like a lot, but some are the equivalent of three or four of a regular game's mission; you'll also have six others for co-op play. These six separate levels tell the story of three other random characters you send off to perform a task while doing whatever you're doing in the main story.</p>
<p>If there's anything to say about the missions, they know exactly what they want to do and achieve it perfectly. The linear move from set-piece to set-piece works well in Space Marine 2. Oddly, it doesn't get boring like I would get bored in most games that do this, if only because the world and environments keep it interesting. Saber Interactive has undoubtedly improved their World War Z outing, learning and building on that, swapping the Zombies out for Tyranids (and more, as the game develops).</p>
<p>Of course, the co-op missions are where Saber hopes you'll keep coming back for more, but I can't honestly see myself doing that. There is some development in this, allowing you to unlock new weapons, but the elephant in the room will always be <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-darktide-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Darktide</a>. They are and feel like different games, but it's hard to ignore the pure 40k co-op action game when wanting to play 40k co-op action. Still, if you are interested in the story, playing a few challenging missions with friends, particularly if you're enjoying the combat, will be a draw, particularly with the promise of more to come.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>In all, while Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 isn't a bad game, not in any sense of the word - it's arguably good at what it does - I haven't enjoyed it that much. The repetitiveness of combat, particularly with the limitations directing you down the repetitive execution spam route, was the core reason for this. There's a good story with an awe-inspiring setting, narratively and visually, which will likely keep you going if you're like me. All in all, it's not a bad game at all and a worthy sequel.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/hcs-salt-lake-spacestation-win/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Halo Championship Series’ Salt Lake City Major has wrapped and Spacestation has another trophy for the cabinet. In a dominating grand final, the team fighting on home turf handed yet another second-place finish to OpTic Gaming, the third the squad landed this year.</p>



<p>However, it isn’t a win without its fair share of issues. Spacestation’s win has been branded ‘reset cheese’ owing to the number of restarts initiated by SSG – especially when they were losing a map. It’s a mixed bag in the debate, though – Spacestation’s resets also came when the team was <strong>winning maps.</strong></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-to-the-championship">To The Championship</h2>



<p>OpTic Gaming might have fallen short of winning the grand prize <strong>yet again</strong>, but now the team can look forward to the Halo World Championship, which is taking place in Seattle between October 4 – 6. Sadly, this is the <strong>fourth </strong>major second-place finish for the team in under a year, all of which have been handed down by either Spacestation or FaZe Clan.</p>



<p>OpTic Gaming steamed quite nicely through the bracket in Salt Lake City, with the squad looking as sharp as possible in front of the crowd. In back-to-back fixtures, the OpTic side defeated Spacestation, FaZe Clan, and Shopify Rebellion, but SSG going on a lower bracket run and bursting into the grand final proved to be too much to handle. </p>



<p>To face OpTic again, SSG effectively dealt with Cloud9, ITB, Complexity, FaZe Clan, and Rebellion. That’s what you call revenge with a vengeance.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the issue surrounding the resets proved to be a sticking point for both the fans and the competitors, with OpTic’s FormaL making comments:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The resets definitely sucked. Being in a grand final and being taken out of the moment over and over was unfortunate, and probably should have had some repercussions if it was a player’s equipment multiple times. The fans were definitely being very disrespectful but I’ve also seen OpTic fans do the same. Was definitely over the top but I get it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We’ve got just under a month until the Halo World Championship – it’s time to lock in.</p>

            <p>Two-thirds of female players still report being harassed when playing online.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/why-gaming-still-has-a-women-problem-13210551">report</a> entitled "Why gaming still has a women problem", Sky News reflected on the propensity of misogyny and hatred against women in gaming spaces, particularly on Discord and in multiplayer games.</p>

<p>In primary research conducted for the report, tech journalist Mickey Carroll said she was harassed and called a host of slurs simply because her "profile picture showed that [she] was clearly a woman".</p>
<p>After receiving abuse on Discord "within seconds", Carroll asked the abuser to justify their position. In response, the male gamer said:</p>
<p>"You're female. You're a filthy female. We don't like females, we like men in here. You're a slag. You know that, right? Because you're a fucking female, all females are slags, and you're expired. You're a slag on the streets, bruv. Bro, she's a nonce, she's a paedophile, she's a nonce, she loves kids."</p>
<p>The research – conducted by Bryter's Jenny McBean – found abuse typically starts off as "sexist comments", "but it often escalates into something more threatening; rape threats, male gamers saying, 'I'm going to find out where you live, attack your family and attack you'."</p>
<p>Of the "around a thousand" female gamers polled across the UK and US, 72 percent reported experiences of online toxicity in 2022, but this fell to 65 percent in 2023.</p>
<p>"It's the first positive shift that we saw [since research began in 2019]. It's actually reduced to 65 percent, which is a significant decrease," McBean explained.</p>
<p>"It's great, but we can't just assume everything's fine now. It's still two in three women."</p>
<p>Despite the fall in harassment, 20 percent of women gamers who responded to the survey said they simply choose not to play online due to potential harassment. One in 10 have been threatened with rape.</p>
<p>19-year-old French esports professional Mathilde conurred, saying: "Being a woman in gaming is "scary. You need to have confidence in yourself… if someone jumps on me, I will jump back."</p>
<p>Stephanie Ijoma says she founded the diversity and inclusion agency NNESAGA in order to dismantle "a system that was against us, and we are doing it".</p>
<p>"I'm a Black woman and Black women in this space are subject to more abuse than anyone else," Ijoma said.</p>
<p>Discord told Sky News it takes "immediate action" when harassment is reported, insisting "safety is integrated into every aspect" of its service, including "use a mix of proactive and reactive tools".</p>
<p><em><strong>If you have experienced this kind of abuse and are in need support, the </strong></em><a href="https://www.cybersmile.org/"><em><strong>Cybersmile Foundation</strong></em></a><em><strong> has dedicated tools, including a global support service, to help people deal with abuse in gaming. </strong></em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/someone-made-an-animated-version-of-the-minecraft-movie-trailer-and-it%E2%80%99s-so-much-better.975306/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-trailer-animation/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Following the lackluster reception of the Minecraft movie trailer earlier this week, one animator has animated the entire trailer, and it’s so much better.</p>



<p>The animation is by 3D artist and animator <a href="https://x.com/Alumio_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@Alumio_</a>, who has since seen his trailer animation go viral on X (formerly Twitter). At the time of writing, the tweet had been up for just five hours and had already received 140,000 likes, which matches the original trailer uploaded by Minecraft themselves. You can watch the animated Minecraft trailer below:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>What’s more impressive is that the animation only took Alumio a few days.</p>



<p>The Minecraft movie has a preliminary budget of $150 million and features the likes of Jason Momoa and Jack Black (who doesn’t look anything like Steve in the trailer, but just Jack Black with a blue shirt, but whatever).</p>



<p>The animated trailer seems to be connecting better with audiences, and although it’s unclear how successful the movie will be, it would be awesome to see a fully animated film in the future. The original Minecraft movie trailer uploaded to YouTube has already generated over one million dislikes, so it’s safe to say that fans of the game are not particularly happy about the movie’s direction.</p>



<p>Minecraft, the movie, is set to launch in theatres on April 4, 2025. </p>



<p>What do you think of the trailer animation? Do you think the movie will be a success? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/peterbot-and-pollo-blow-150-point-lead-in-fortnite-globals/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The competition at the Fortnite Global Championship 2024 event has been absolutely insane, with some of the biggest names in Fortnite competing against each other under one roof in Texas. After gaining a 147-point lead yesterday, Peterbot and Pollo have officially dropped to second place.</p>



<p>Th0masHD and Queasy now take first place with a whopping 485 points, putting them well ahead of Peterbot and Pollo during Fortnite Globals.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-th0mashd-win-his-first-fncs">Will Th0masHD Win His First FNCS?</h2>



<p>Do not underestimate a duo like Th0masHD and Queasy. With both of the player’s crazy Fortnite history, these are two competitors you do not want to run into on the battlefield. Th0masHD, however, for how long he has been competing in Fortnite, has never had an FNCS win.</p>



<p>Now, being so far ahead of second place, this could actually be the day Th0masHD walks out a victor. But do not forget about Queasy, though, as the competitor, who used to duo with Veno, has been absolutely crushing the competition.</p>



<p>So, will today be history made for the duo?</p>



<h2 id="h-peterbot-and-pollo-throw-2-games-in-a-row-during-fortnite-globals">Peterbot And Pollo Throw 2 Games In A Row During Fortnite Globals</h2>



<p>Starting the day off, both Pollo and Peterbot talked a big game, claiming they were the best duo in the world. That momentum, however, was short-lived, as the two barely managed to grab any placement points during the first two games of today’s competition.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In fact, during game number eight of day two of Fortnite Globals, the team found themselves back in the lobby quite early, as the duo was pushed heavily in the storm earlier on. Sadly, after Peterbot accidentally closed off his downed teammate with a reinforced wall, the duo went down. </p>



<p>Still, with the 1.5x point-multiplier system coming into play today, we could see Peterbot and Pollo grab first place back for themselves.</p>

            <p>Director John Garvin says it's "kinda sad" that the leading man of his <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> game has been "reduced to a cartoon shill" by an image posted by his former studio, Bend.</p>
<p>The picture - released to mark fellow Sony studio Team Asobi's hugely successful Astro Bot launch - shows a Bot dressed in Deacon's garb reclining on a beach.</p>

<p>Garvin said, "[Deacon] has been reduced to promoting other games", adding: "Well done Bend Studio! Way to protect your legacy!"</p>
<p>When someone in his comments suggested that he "calm down my brotha", Garvin said: "Haha, I see my character reduced to a cartoon schill [sic] promoting some small game and I'm being harsh? Sit down, my brotha, adults are talking".</p> <div>

<p>We all already know Astro Bot has a lot of bots, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-has-lots-of-bots-but-concept-arts-got-those-that-are-not">but what bots has Astro Bot not got</a>?</p>
<p>Eurogamer just awarded <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-review">Astro Bot a sparkling five out of five stars</a>.</p>
<p>"When it's all done I'm left with that strange feeling of being very well cared for. I've seen a bunch of wild sights. I've messed around with cool gadgets, used the controller in unusual ways, tilting it, yes, but also blowing into it, trying to read the buried hieroglyphs of its rumble, I've ticked boxes, collected things, unlocked things, nodded at references that make me feel old, or sharp-eyed, or generally in the know," Donlan wrote.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">Star Wars Outlaws</a> director Julian Gerighty has confirmed a patch is coming "maybe in 10 days" to address the game's "unfair" and "incredibly punishing" insta-fail stealth sequences.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/star-wars-outlaws-director-agrees-the-early-instant-fail-stealth-missions-are-incredibly-punishing-and-ubisoft-is-easing-the-pain-with-a-patch-coming-maybe-in-10-days/">GamesRadar+</a>, Gerighty admitted that whilst the team had intentionally designed the sequence to build "tension", it "just [didn't] want it to feel unfair. And today, I think it feels unfair".</p>
<p>"This is more of something that crept in in the last week or so and that we're correcting already for a patch that's coming out maybe in 10 days," he added.</p>

<p>"So especially, I mean, you're probably thinking of one of the early missions in Mirogana, which is incredibly punishing," Gerighty said.</p>
<p>"And for me, that is a mistake, and this is something that we're going to work on improving.</p>
<p>"I don't think it means removing the fail state completely, but I do think there are millions of low-hanging fruits where we can make it so much more enjoyable and understandable."</p>
<p>Gerighty also confirmed that the team was on the lookout for other "blockers" that prevent players from "enjoying the game", revealing that Ubisoft will "tweak the narrative context" - such as, for example, adding additional PA announcements that better contextualise what's happening - "so that we can get people to enjoy those moments as much as possible". </p>
<p>"Star Wars Outlaws [...] feels like it's blagging it - much as Kay can, when regularly caught out by some far more worldly syndicate boss," We wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-star-wars-outlaws-pushes-the-latest-pc-technologies-hard-and-the-results-are-stunning">Eurogamer's Star Wars Outlaws review</a>, in which we gave the game two out of five stars.</p>
<p>"The result is a series of quite painful comparisons: it lacks the branching, open stealth of an Arkham game, the systemic options of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> or the incisive, relentlessly satisfying speed of picking enemies off in Assassin's Creed. It lacks the linear polish and charisma of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/uncharted">Uncharted</a>. Lacks the animation flow to its yellow-ledge platforming next to a Horizon, or the sheer joy of taking platforming and making it into an actual game in itself, as in Star Wars Jedi."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>'s average 30-day player count on Steam has dropped to its lowest level in the series' history.</p>
<p>Whilst participation in live-service games inevitably waxes and wanes - and these figures do not account for players on console - it's nonetheless an unwelcomed milestone for Bungie's beleaguered sci-fi shooter.</p>

<p>Despite launching Episodes, the three-part, self-contained seasons that kicked off in The Final Shape's shadow back in June, <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/1085660">Steam Charts</a> suggests the game is averaging just 31,300 players over the last 30 days – the lowest number ever recorded since Destiny launched on Steam back in 2019.</p>
<p>That's down 75 percent since June, when Destiny 2's final expansion, The Final Shape, launched.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://thegamepost.com/destiny-2-lowest-player-count-franchises-history/">TheGamePost</a>, that's less than half the number of players Destiny 2 boasted three months after The Witch Queen and Lightfall released in 2022 and 2023, respectively.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-acknowledges-uncertainty-surrounding-the-future-of-destiny-following-layoffs">Bungie recently issued a statement acknowledging concern over the future of its decade-old sci-fi franchise</a> following "recent changes" at the studio.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">Sweeping layoffs saw 220 Bungie staff out of a job</a>, less than a year after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-developer-bungie-latest-playstation-studio-to-be-hit-by-layoffs">further 100 employees were let go last October</a>. A further 155 Bungie staff are also departing the studio for roles within parent company PlayStation.</p>
<p>In response, Bungie has now said it remains "committed" to Destiny, though details of what's next remain thin on the ground. There's also no mention of the departures of key Destiny creatives Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy, who were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-destiny-project-payback-no-longer-happening-senior-execs-depart">reportedly developing a now-cancelled Destiny spin-off named Payback</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
