<p>I’m a massive fan of the Two Point universe, with countless hours spent playing Two Point Hospital and Two Point Campus over the years, and the moment developer Two Point Studios announced a third title in the franchise, I was sold. It could have been about running a burger shop, and I’d be in line to buy a copy metaphorically on day one. Thankfully, it’s not about running a fast food restaurant, but instead a totally authentic and genuine museum. Here’s what we know about the Two Point Museum release date!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-two-point-museum-come-out">When Does Two Point Museum Come Out?</h2>



<p>If you’re as excited to play Two Point Museum as I am, unfortunately, I have some sour news for you. You have to wait. The official Two Point Museum release date is <strong>March 4, 2025</strong>. For now, enjoy the announcement trailer once more:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Developer Two Point Studios recently announced the official release date, along with information on the game’s pricing (more on that shortly!), the Explorer Edition, and the Sonic Pre-Order Pack. It would seem that releasing the Two Point titles alongside something Sonic-related is becoming a long-running theme.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-does-two-point-museum-cost">How Much Does Two Point Museum Cost?</h2>



<p>As with the past two titles in the now-long-running Two Point franchise, Two Point Museum will launch with a retail price tag of <strong>$29.99</strong> for the Standard Edition and <strong>$39.99</strong> for the Explorer Edition, making it an extremely affordable strategy game with a long lifespan. You can easily spend many tens of hours playing the Two Point titles, and the studio often releases post-launch DLC that expands the game significantly with new maps and items that don’t break the bank, too!</p>

            <p>If I took my kid to a dinosaur museum and the gift shop and hallways were full of Sonic merchandise, I think I'd be kind of confused. I think that makes the inclusion of such items as pre-order bonuses for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a> - alongside Knuckles staff costumes and Sonic-themed interactive exhibits - a pretty strong extra incentive not to pre-order.
</p>
<p>But hey, at least the next management game in the growing 2.universe now has a release date: March 4th, 2025.

<p>Two Point Museum follows on from Campus and Hospital in offering a spiritual successor to the Bullfrog vein of management gaming. That means a cold-hearted core of financial efficiency as you lay down money-extracting entertainments for your roving customers to enjoy, with a loose layer of light satire and absurdity on top. It's as winning a formula now as it was in the '90s: Ed praised the "easygoing joy" in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/two-point-campus-review-a-relaxed-management-sim-bursting-with-silliness-and-seminars">Two Point Campus review</a>, while Nic found a healthy patient in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/two-point-hospital-review">Two Point Hospital review</a> back in 2018.
</p>
<p>This latest construction project will have you building a museum with an apparent natural history focus, your exhibits showing dinosaur bones, ocean fossils and the like. There's seemingly some new systems to fit the theme, too. As museum curator you'll be sending relic hunters out around a gradually uncovered world map to bring back wares, for example, like some sort of plundering employee of the British Museum, and your exhibits can be levelled-up so they generate more "Buzz", which is what prompts your visitors to make larger donations.
</p>
<p>You'll find more information about the pre-order bonuses and various editions <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2185060/Two_Point_Museum/">over on its Steam page now</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

According to Lariviere, he was contacted through the website CD Baby, where he was selling Lifeseeker’s album “Self Titled Debut Album” which contained “Gone Guru.” </p><p>“You could hear previews of the song there, so I guess someone who was scouting music for the game heard it there,” said Lariviere. “The person who contacted me told me that Capcom was interested in using ‘Gone Guru’ for a video game.” Lariviere agreed to a deal with Capcom, but wasn’t told what game his song would appear in.</p><p>Once he learned the song was in <em>Dead Rising</em>, he played the game and reached the aforementioned iconic scene just so he could hear “Gone Guru.” He told <em>TheGamer </em>that he was surprised so many people picked up on the lyrics because its actually hard to hear the song in-game. Funnily enough, while the singer finds Dead Rising’s mall “appealing and strange” and he appreciates the game’s difficulty for making it “special,” he struggled to play it. </p><p>“I may have to take another crack at it this time around.

To bear witness to that and know that a lot of your hard work has paid off and someone is enjoying the stuff you’ve made, that’s a great feeling.” </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/concord-director-steps-down-two-weeks/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/concord-director-steps-down-two-weeks-after-game-goes-offline.986379/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/concord-director-steps-down-two-weeks/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Two weeks ago, Concord had failed so badly that it was taken offline, leaving the team at Firewalk Studios sitting in despair at the situation they’d found themselves in. The game that they’d spent years putting together was DOA, pulling in so few players and missing the mark so monumentally that it failed to gain an ounce of traction at release.</p>



<p>Now, the game’s director, Ryan Ellis, has stepped down from his position and moved into a ‘support role’, per a report from Kotaku.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-going-down">Going Down</h2>



<p>In Kotaku’s report, it was mentioned that Ellis ‘was the main shot caller’ on Concord, which failed miserably from the moment it hit the market last month. It was only this summer that the game received a proper trailer, with many baulking at the price tag attached to what would have fared much better as a free-to-play shooter.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-firewalk-studios-relaunch-ps5-sony-playstation-1851652811" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a quote handed to Kotaku</a>, it was said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Ryan deeply believed in that project and bringing players together through the joy in it. Regardless of there being things that could have been done differently throughout development… he’s a good human, and full of heart.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was Ellis who published the blog post highlighting the failure and imminent shutdown of Concord. He wrote that the game hadn’t landed the way the team at Firewalk had intended and that it would be taken offline to ‘explore options’. That was two weeks ago, and already, the wider industry has forgotten all about Concord.</p>



<p>Firewalk Studios numbers some 160 developers, many of which are now concerned about their job security. It could go either way at present – the team could alter the operating model and remove the premium price point, or the studio could be shuttered and Concord will become nothing more than a painful memory.</p>

			<p>Two different PlayStation 6 SoCs are said to be in the works, suggesting that the next-generation Sony system will be released in two different SKUs.</p>
<p>Speaking on the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/kepler-theres-two-socs-in-development-for-next-gen-playstation-not-sure-if-its-a-series-x-s-situation-or-home-console-handheld.1675176/">NeoGAF forums</a>, well-known AMD leaker Kepler revealed there are two SoCs in development for the next-gen system, but the insider cannot confirm if it's an Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S situation or a home console and a handheld. One of the two, the insider added, should be affordable at least, suggesting there's a clear power difference between the two.</p>
<p>Very little is known about the PlayStation 6. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-powered-amd/">Earlier this week</a>, a new report from Reuters confirmed the system will once again be powered by AMD, although Intel was among the two final contenders to design the system. Apparently, negotiations fell through when a dispute over profits prevented the company from settling on a price. Backward compatibility concerns also arose during negotiations, and reportedly Sony and Intel talked at length about the matter.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-price-test-consequences/">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> right around the corner and the current generation likely lasting a few more years, it may be a long time before we learn more about the PlayStation 6 and the potential two SKUs suggested by the two SoCs in development. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <p>A few months ago, Minecraft's original console developer 4J Studios showed off a new in-house engine they had created, called the Elements Engine. Now they've announced what game they're making with it. It's called Reforj, and it's an "open-world multiplayer survival sandbox." But it's not aiming to be Minecraft 2, they say.

<figcaption>4J Studios' Elements Engine trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wa7rTm56bw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>"The fact this is coming from 4J means that the comparisons to Minecraft are unavoidable," Joseph Garrett <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-minecraft-studio-and-minecraft-youtuber-looking-to-transform-sandbox-gaming">told GamesIndustry.biz in a recent interview about the game</a>. Garrett is better known as Stampy, a Minecraft YouTuber, and he's working with 4J on Reforj. "We've already had articles about 4J making Minecraft 2. But that's not what we're trying to do. Despite all of us being huge fans of Minecraft, we don't need to make another one. It already exists."
</p>
<p>Reforj will instead offer "a very different gameplay experience," 4J co-founder Chris van der Kuyl says. The Elements engine has been designed to serve an open world survival game, however, one where players can change the world much like they can in Minecraft.
</p>
<p>4J Studios say they're hoping to release Reforj early and build it in partnership with its community, and that they recognise they're a small team and so their expectations of likely player numbers are low.
</p>
<p>We're long past the point in the industry where there's a new Minecraftbut launching every two months, but it's too early to tell if Reforj will offer something more than Ylands or Trove or any of a thousand of other block-building games which came and went. I will say this: I do not think swapping cubes for smaller, angled pieces is the good idea so many of these games think it is.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Concord game director Ryan Ellis has reportedly stepped down after the beleaguered 5v5 shooter was yanked offline amid apparently disastrous sales, with staff at developer Firewalk Studios said to be in limbo while they await Sony's decision on the future of the game.
</p>
<p>
Concord was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">removed from sale</a> earlier this month, just two weeks after its launch on PS5 and PC, with Sony offering full refunds to players. In a statement released at the time, Ellis wrote, "While many qualities of the experience resonated with players, we also recognise that other aspects of the game and our initial launch didn't land the way we'd intended."
</p>
<p>
Ellis added that Firewalk would "explore options" and "determine the best path ahead"  once the game was offline, but no further statements have been issued since then. According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-firewalk-studios-relaunch-ps5-sony-playstation-1851652811">Kotaku</a>, however, staff at Firewalk have remained "in limbo" in the two weeks following Concord's shutdown as they wait for a decision on both the game and the studio's future.

<p>
Three sources told Kotaku employees are "pessimistic" Concord will return, with some having already been asked to explore pitches the studio might work on next. Some are said to believe mass layoffs are on the cards for the Sony-owned Firewalk - which employs around 150-170 people - given the studio is reportedly one of the most expensive under PlayStation's watch on a per-head basis.
</p>
<p>
Kotaku says there's also speculation among staff that Sony may decide to set Firewalk to work co-developing one of its many other first-party projects - although "a few" employees have reportedly already preemptively exited the studio, while others are waiting to see what a potential severance package may look like before making a decision.
</p>
<p>
As for Ellis - who previously served as creative director on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> - he reportedly told staff last week he would be stepping down from his current role as game director and moving into a support role. "Ryan deeply believed in that project and bringing players together through the joy in it," one former developer told Kotaku. "Regardless of there being things that could have been done differently throughout development...he's a good human, and full of heart."
</p>
<p>
Firewalk was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-acquires-firewalk-studios-as-it-continues-work-on-triple-a-multiplayer-exclusive">acquired by Sony</a> last year, as part of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">massive live-service push</a> under former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan. The response to Concord, Firewalk's debut game, was lukewarm at best, with industry analysts estimating it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-has-sold-just-25000-copies-estimate-industry-analysts">sold less that 25,000 copies</a> across PS5 and PC.

		<p>To mark the 30th anniversary of the PlayStation console family, Sony is breaking out their stocks of grey plastic once again, decking out a full range of PS5 consoles and their accessories. There’s even the first limited edition of the PS5 Pro.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/10/ps5-pro-everything-we-now-know-about-the-souped-up-playstation-5/">PS5 Pro</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/06/dualsense-review-feeling-the-future-of-gaming/">DualSense</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/23/dualsense-edge-review-is-sonys-first-ps5-pro-controller-essential-for-gamers/">DualSense Edge</a> and even the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/13/playstation-portal-review/">PlayStation Portal</a> are all getting a 30th Anniversary makeover. They’ve even made the included USB cables look like the classic PlayStation controller connector!</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing the PlayStation 30th Anniversary Collection" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/amdZnHooTkk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The PS5 Pro is possibly going to be the most desirable of the bunch, with Sony making and numbering 12,300 of these consoles. These limited edition bundles will basically be the full set. You’ll naturally get the PS5 Pro itself with the grey faceplates, but there will also be an additional console cover included for the optional (and separately sold) disc drive. You’ll also get a vertical stand included (such luxury!), both a DualSense and a DualSense Edge controller, and special collector’s items including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Original PlayStation controller-style cable connector housing</li>
<li>Four PlayStation Shapes cable ties</li>
<li>PlayStation sticker</li>
<li>Limited Edition PlayStation Poster (1 of 30 possible designs)</li>
<li>PlayStation Paperclip</li>
</ul>


<p>The PS5 Slim bundle is the same, but only comes with one DualSense controller.</p>
<p>The DualSense, DualSense Edge and PlayStation Portal will also be sold separately.</p>

<p>The full collection will be released on 21st November, but pre-orders begin on 26th September exclusively at direct.playstation.com for the PS5 Pro, PS Portal, and DualSense Edge. In regions without a PlayStation Direct store, they’ll come from participating retailers instead.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, all regions will let retailers offer the PS5 bundle from 10th October, and the standard DualSense from 26th September.</p>
<p>No prices were confirmed, but given all of the items included with the consoles, expect them to cost a pretty penny…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/atari-launches-kickstarter-campaign-for-centipede-blast-card-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Atari has launched a new Kickstarter campaign today. It isn't a revival of an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-7800-retro-console-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank">older console</a>, but a a dip into tabletop gaming. Their first project is the <em>Centipede Blast Card Game</em>, an adaptation of a retro arcade classic.</p>

<p>According to the campaign page, the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/centipedeblast/atari-centipede-blast-card-game/description"><em>Centipede Blast Card Game</em></a> is based on the 1981 arcade game, <em>Centipede</em>. Much like the source material, the game requires a combination of quick reactions and strategy.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/centipede-blast-card-game-card-artwork.jpg?itok=Iy282DDY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/centipede-blast-card-game-card-artwork.jpg?itok=yuZe1Rh5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The <em>Centipede Blast Card Game</em> is a competitive experience&nbsp; Players take turns placing cards in a center pile. If two consecutive cards match in numbers Blast happens. When a blast occurs, all players must slam their hand on the top card. The last one to react takes the draw pile.</p>
<p>The first one to get rid of all their cards wins.</p>
<p>Several cards add creative wrinkles to this process. Blast! cards automatically trigger a Blast. Scorpion cards add 1 to every card's number until the end of the round. Mushroom cards reverse the direction of play.</p>
<p>All 60 cards in the <em>Centipede Blast Card Game</em> will feature a retro art style. This style is reminscent of the expressive arcade decals used to attract players back in the 1980s.</p>
<p>There are several pledge tiers for the <em>Centipede Blast Card Game</em>. They are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Standard Edition for $15:</strong> A copy of the game</li>
<li><strong>Double Up for $25:</strong> Two copies of the game</li>
<li><strong>Limited Edition for $35:</strong> A copy of the game, A limited edition game box, and an embroidered <em>Centipede Blast</em> patch</li>
<li><strong>VIP Bundle for $100:</strong> Everything in the Limited Edition tier, a Centipede Blast Sticker Pack, and a Centipede Blast-themed Gaming Mat.</li>
</ul><p>The <em>Centipede Blast Card Game</em> is relatively small compared to other tabletop adaptations of board games. According to an official press release,this is because the focus is on community engagement.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Kickstarter goal for Centipede Blast is quite modest. We are using the platform primarily for its community engagement tools, which pair well with the collaborative manner in which we designed the game,” said Tyler Drewitz, Director of Atari X. “Fans have the option to get a basic or special edition version of the game, and follow along as we move quickly from production to shipping.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At time of writing, the <em>Centipede Blast Card Game</em> has raised $575. Its initial funding goal is a relatively small $7,500. The campaign will conclude October 31.</p>

Formerly at Bungie where he served as creative director on <em>Destiny 2,</em> Ellis left in 2017 to lead development on what would eventually become<em> Concord.</em> He told staff at Firewalk last week that he would be stepping down from his game director role and move into a support role instead, according to three sources familiar with the change.<br></p><p>Sony did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p>Ellis was the main shot caller on <em>Concord</em>, which despite praise for its underlying shooter gameplay feel, failed to attract an audience, with analyst Simon Carless <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">estimating to<em> IGN</em></a></span> that the $40 PVP-only game had sold only around 25,000 copies, abysmal numbers given not just its budget but the PlayStation first-party brand it represented. Sony acquired Firewalk in 2023 for an undisclosed sum after the game had spent years in production and promoted <em>Concord </em>at both that year’s May PlayStation showcase and its 2024 one. </p><p> “Ryan deeply believed in that project and bringing players together through the joy in it,” said one former developer, who said he felt Ellis had poured a great deal of himself into the game, leading to a ton of stress. “Regardless of there being things that could have been done differently throughout development...he’s a good human, and full of heart.” </p><div><p>Sources told <em>Kotaku </em>that Ellis was too emotional to  speak at points during a post-launch studio-wide meeting after it had become clear that the game was bombing.

The game’s existing content roadmap extended through three seasons, complete with the promise of expensive weekly cutscenes telling the story of <em>Concord</em>’s world and characters. </p></div><p>But for many within the studio, it’s still not clear what will come next, three sources told <em>Kotaku</em>. They are pessimistic <em>Concord</em> will return, and some have been asked to explore pitches for something completely different that Firewalk, which is currently around 150-170 employees, might work on next. Speculation among some staff has also included whether the studio could be used as co-development on one of Sony’s myriad other first-party projects currently in production. </p><p>Others, however, feel like mass layoffs will be the most likely result of <em>Concord</em>’s failure, including the possible shutdown of the entire studio, which sources tell <em>Kotaku</em> is one of the more expensive studios in the PlayStation portfolio on a per-head basis. Some developers are updating their resumes and portfolios, a few have already preemptively exited the studio, and others are waiting to see what a potential severance package will look like before deciding what to do next. </p><p>Sony instituted <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547?_gl=1*1sn0s0t*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNjc2ODI3Mi4xNTQuMS4xNzI2NzY4MzQ1LjU5LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547?_gl=1*1sn0s0t*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNjc2ODI3Mi4xNTQuMS4xNzI2NzY4MzQ1LjU5LjAuMA..">deep cuts earlier this year</a></span>, which included the cancellation of multiple games and the closure of its PlayStation London Studio.

The 1990 title from LucasArts is an exemplary entry in the point-and-click adventure genre, as well as one of the funniest games around. For many, that success is thanks to the team behind it: series creators <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/return-monkey-island-ron-gilbert-art-style-angry-fans-1849128586&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/return-monkey-island-ron-gilbert-art-style-angry-fans-1849128586">Ron Gilbert</a></span>, Dave Grossman, and Tim Schafer (of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-buys-psychonauts-2-developer-double-fine-prod-1835359067&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-buys-psychonauts-2-developer-double-fine-prod-1835359067">Double Fine</a></span> fame). 2024’s Return to <em>Monkey Island</em> positioned itself as a return to form for the series, and it had big names involved in its production that long-time fans were excited about. Grossman, who worked on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tales-of-monkey-island-chapter-1-preview-guybrush-sail-5303149&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tales-of-monkey-island-chapter-1-preview-guybrush-sail-5303149">fifth entry</a></span> in 2009, returned alongside Gilbert, who hasn’t been involved in the series since <em>Monkey Island 2</em> in 1991. </p><p>Together, the team pulled off a truly amazing series retrospective by updating the classic gameplay loop, keeping the old humor, and subverting everything fans would have expected in its story. The point-and-click adventure mechanics of <em>Return to Monkey Island </em>have largely remained the same, but they’ve been gussied up for the modern age. Instead of the original’s frustrating <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/scummvm-is-bringing-cd-rom-games-back-1847517151&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/scummvm-is-bringing-cd-rom-games-back-1847517151">SCUMM</a></span> engine, whose convoluted text box interactions often made puzzles that much harder, now everything flows much smoother. </p><p>As the saying goes, you can never go home again, and despite the title of the game, <em>Return to Monkey Island</em> understands that. It might set up a grand pirate adventure reminiscent of the first game and you might revisit a number of iconic locales, but they’re the same as how they appear in the original <em>Monkey Island</em>. And that’s the point: thing’s change. Protagonist Guybrush Threepwood might still be the wise-cracking pirate you fell in love with so many years ago, but he’s much older. And furthermore, he’s old-fashioned— much like the player, Guybrush is thrown off by the way the places he once knew have changed with the times. </p><p>One of the best illustrations of this is <em>Return</em>’s pirate leaders. Guybrush expects to see the pirates he knows from the first game to still be running things, but when you finally come face-to-face with the i leaders it’s a trio of younger upstarts who have no respect for or knowledge of who he is. The old pirate leaders are there, but they’re just milling around on the street now, stripped of their old titles, men of no importance. This goes for almost everybody you meet—people have moved on from Guybrush and either don’t know him or don’t agree with his old-school mindset. </p><p><em>Monkey Island</em> has always reflected its creators and their journeys through life, and <em>Return</em> is no different: Grossman and Gilbert return to the game that made them after 34 long years, and try to recapture the glory of the old days in a field now populated by annoying youngsters who very well might have no idea who the hell they are. Can they recapture what they had in 1990? No. Because they aren’t the same people. Neither is Guybrush or the player. <em>Return</em> is a <em>Monkey Island </em>game that looks back on the past and appreciates it for what it was, while also coming to terms with the notion that things must change to move forward. Two years after its release, <em>Return to Monkey Island</em> has aged like a fine wine, and it’ll only get better.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>BLAST has unveiled a step towards mobile esports in partnership with Supercell, a leading developer of mobile games. The top-tier esports organiser revealed a triple-threat tournament structure made up exclusively of Supercell games. In October, competitors will try and win big on Clash of Clans, Clash Royal, and Brawl Stars.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-three-times-the-magic">Three Times The Magic</h2>



<p>BLAST has long been associated with top-shelf esports games like Counter-Strike and Rainbow Six, but now the organisation is making a major step into mobile esports. For years, mobile esports has been a growing vertical, and with more games emerging in the space all the time, it’s quickly becoming one of the most diverse sectors in the wider esports market.</p>



<p>Once upon a time, a mobile game held the record for the highest concurrent viewership for an esports tournament, before being dethroned by last year’s League of Legends World Championship.</p>



<p>In October, BLAST Bash will take place, featuring three games: Clash Royale, Clash of Clans, and Brawl Stars. Here’s the schedule for BLAST Bash:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>BLAST Clash</strong>: 12 – 13 October</li>



<li><strong>BLAST Royale: </strong>12 – 13 October</li>



<li><strong>BLAST Brawl: </strong>10 – 11 October</li>
</ul>



<p>The prize pools up for grabs aren’t massive, but this is BLAST’s first step in the direction of mobile esports, so it’s expected that it’ll be a relatively humble one. What’s great is that the BLAST Bash tournaments will incorporate teams from Europe, the EMEA, and North America, which means it’s an international event off the bat.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to BLAST’s mobile esports tournaments? Let us know on the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

<p>IShowSpeed’s ambitious Asian tour continues, and while visiting Indonesia, the controversial streamer hit a monumental milestone. In a segment that saw him surrounded by fans, IShowSpeed peaked <strong>at over one million concurrent viewers. </strong>It became the young content creator’s first time hitting those numbers.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-keep-climbing">Keep Climbing</h2>



<p>Just last week, IShowSpeed broke his all-time high viewership record by pulling in 610,000 concurrent users. This time around, he almost doubled that figure, landing 1,043,028 viewers at once while on tour in Indonesia.</p>



<p>In front of the camera and standing before the hundreds of fans that seem to surface wherever he goes, IShowSpeed broke down as his team celebrated the milestone. In recent months, IShowSpeed has gone from being a zany, divisive creator letting off fireworks in his bedroom to a globe-trotting superstar appearing on WWE broadcasts and being chased down the street by fans.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>His fame has reached such lofty heights that one developer recently created <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ishowspeed-the-game-revealed/">an IShowSpeed game</a>. In this satirical title, you control the man himself, running around town and barking at people as you try to earn more viewers.</p>



<p>IShowSpeed’s current Asian tour has been a remarkable success for the streamer, who is just 19 years old at the time of writing. He’ll be earning millions of dollars in revenue from these broadcasts, and whether you love him or hate him, there’s no shame in securing a bag like that.</p>
