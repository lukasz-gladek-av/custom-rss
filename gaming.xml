              <p>Scott Pilgrim is taking on the world, again, in March. Capcom leans into Leon’s “hot uncle” makeover. And an old Kickstarter for a tabletop game reveals the worst outcome possible. It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. Speaking of fan speculation and rumors, it’s never a good sign when the official franchise account <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/2016531108486095252">responds to you with a GIF from <em>Grand Theft Auto</em></a>. The <em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em> remake was reportedly delayed, but hopefully the <a href="https://x.com/yosp/status/2016446516236562657">next game from indie standout Red Candle Games</a> is coming along smoothly.</p> <h2><em>Scott Pilgrim EX</em> has a release date and a new trailer</h2>  <p>It’s out March 3 and will include League of Evil Exes’ Matthew Patel and Robot-01 as playable characters. This spiritual successor to the 2010 brawler is a bit more RPG-lite with non-linear quests and exploration, according to the devs at Tribute Games. They recently helped launch <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>, another excellent retro throwback with some neat tricks. Hopefully the team has put some cool surprises in <em>Scott Pilgrim EX</em> which, with today’s news, is now handily my most anticipated release of the winter.</p>

 <h2><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> fixes a bizarre DLC bug recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-framerate-dlc-2000660149">unearthed by a modder</a></h2> <p><a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-au/Ver.1.040.03.01.html">The new PC performance patch is out</a> and the notes include the following: “Fixed an issue where system load could increase around the Support Desk at Base Camp or the Grand Hub due to claimed content status checks.” Hopefully it brings the Steam version of the game more in line with the console version and turns things around in a meaningful way heading into the game’s one-year anniversary.</p> <h2><em>RuneScape</em> maker promises no genAI that players can “feel”</h2> <p>“We’ve got a pretty hard line stance with the team, which is a commitment that no generative AI will ever be present in any asset that a player can touch, hear or feel. There will be no generative AI in the game that they experience,” Jagex SVP of product James Dobrowski <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/runescape-maker-jagex-says-it-will-never-use-generative-ai-to-make-in-game-content">told <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em></a>. Tooling efficiency, which seemingly means coding, QA checks, and other process-oriented stuff, is another story.</p>

 <p>“Where we are open to the use of AI is in things like tooling efficiency; how do we make the way we work more efficient in order to make our staff’s lives easier and allow us to produce better content. But we do not want to be using AI to drive creativity,” he said.</p>

 <h2>Capcom talks about Leon’s “hot uncle” makeover</h2> <p>“We’ve spent quite a lot of time polishing Leon’s visuals,” <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> director Koshi Nakanishi <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/resident-evil-requiems-leon-kennedy-became-a-hot-uncle-thanks-to-hawk-eyed-female-capcom-staff-who-reviewed-even-the-finest-wrinkles-on-his-neck-director/">told <em>Automaton</em></a>. “Leon has many fans among Capcom employees, and women in particular were pretty strict when reviewing his design. They would point out and comment on even the finest details like the wrinkles on his neck. When I mentioned that story in the past, a female fan told me, The women developers at Capcom did a really good job&nbsp;(laughs).”</p> <h2><em>Arc Raiders</em> hit by DDoS attack ahead of next patch</h2> <p>Players who were recently having connection issues now know why. Community lead Julia Ossen told fans on the game’s Discord that the studio has been “under extensive, coordinated DDoS attacks” which the team is addressing. “The strike team has been working hard on mitigations and solutions to fix the problem, and we are making good progress,” she wrote. “But at this point in time the attacks are still ongoing.” The attack happened alongside the game’s new patch which <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qobyp9/here_we_go_slient_nerfs_not_mentioned_in_the/">includes some stealth nerfs</a>.</p>

 <h2>The<em> Darkest Dungeon</em> board game is dead</h2> <p>Over 28,000 backers&nbsp;pledged&nbsp;<span>$5,657,479</span> to help bring this project to life and no more shipments will be going out. “We put our trust in Mythic Games to deliver on their promises and uphold the <em>Darkest Dungeon</em> name,” Red Hook Games <a href="https://www.darkestdungeon.com/news/regarding-mythic-games-and-the-darkest-dungeon-board-game/">announced this week</a>. “We won’t mince words, their collapse and inability to fulfill Wave 2 orders is an enormously disappointing development and we know it deeply affects many <em>Darkest Dungeon</em> fans.” An ex-employee is providing the studio with the source files for all of Mythic’s work so players can make their own versions.</p> <h2>More indies are bailing on Xbox</h2> <p>Xbox versions of the stylish medieval combat game <em>1348 Ex Voto</em> and Nickelodeon’s<em> Splat Pack</em> have both been binned, <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/109896/two-indie-games-have-cancelled-their-xbox-versions/index.html"><em>TweakTown</em> reports</a>. “While we previously announced that the game would be released on Xbox consoles, we have the unfortunate news that this is no longer the case,” the developer behind 1348 Ex Voto <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/G_RrTmoWMAACEkw?format=jpg&amp;name=medium">said this week</a>. “As release approaches for the indie team, priorities are constantly evaluated and sometimes must shift to deliver the best experience possible.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/walmart-leak-gamecube-games-switch-online-metroid-pikmin-2000663430">More Switch Online GameCube games leaked</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/mining-crystals-in-highguard-is-so-damn-satisfying-ps5-pc-steam-2000663527">Something <em>Highguard</em> gets right: mining crystals</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/batman-arkham-parody-perfectly-captures-the-horror-and-absurdity-of-living-in-gotham-2000663597">Living inside <em>Batman: Arkham</em> would be terrifying</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

              <p>Digital PC gaming storefront <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-anti-drm-cd-projekt-witcher-3-cyberpunk-2000659280">Good Old Games</a> is the latest video game-related company to be caught using AI-generated artwork. As you might expect, a lot of people aren’t pleased about this, including an artist who works at GOG.</p> <p><a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2026/01/gog-now-using-ai-generated-images-on-their-store/">As first reported by <em>GamingOnLinux</em></a>, someone on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gog/comments/1qoigy5/ai_in_the_storefront/">Reddit spotted</a> what looks like AI-generated artwork being used to advertise an ongoing 2026 sale on GOG. The biggest giveaway that this art was generated using an AI tool or site is that a SNES-like console in the image seems to be melting. <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/5000_gog_patrons_and_an_ai_banner/page1">GOG users actually spotted this AI artwork last week</a> and began posting about it. For many, it was disappointing to see a company that <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">claims to care about preservation</a> and creators using AI to create a simple store banner.</p> <p>Likely in response to the hubbub surrounding the AI-generated banner, KosmicznaPluskwa, a GOG forums user who appears to be a graphic artist working at the company, <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/5000_gog_patrons_and_an_ai_banner?staff=yes">posted a lengthy response on the store’s forums on January 26.</a> And while KosmicznaPluskwa made it clear they aren’t a spokesperson for GOG, the artist confirmed that the image people were speculating was machine-created was indeed generated completely using AI tools, something that upset the artist.</p>

 <p>“OK, so to clear the air – current sale banner is fully AI. Not my work,” posted KosmicznaPluskwa. “This is all I can say on this. My team is much smaller now than it used to be, and the requirements for the role are completely different than it used to be.”</p> <p><em>Kotaku</em> contacted GOG about the art, but didn’t hear back before publication.</p> <p>KosmicznaPluskwa continued in their lengthy forum post and discussed how AI art is everywhere now and how it makes them sad to see.</p>

 <p>“It’s just miserable to think about how surrounded and how ever-present it all is now,” said KosmicznaPluskwa.</p> <p>“How will it affect us as the humanity. And no, I don’t think it will destroy art altogether but the omnipresence of it will not not go without its effect on us as a whole. Maybe it doesn’t matter some store put out sloppy work on promo banner – in the end everyone is just there to buy the product – but I know I enjoy seeing cool new artworks out there, when I’m out to buy new products as well. When I buy a new cool figure I like to keep the box around if it’s pretty – this is kind of the same, but on digital level. More cool art to see on top of buying art (video games in our case here) is always more cool art in the world and this is what I’m happy to have. So with everyone also feeling strongly in this thread – I’m with you. And continue speaking up – in the face of future we don’t like to see, complacency is not the way.”</p>

But after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/an-overlooked-disney-collection-from-digital-eclipse-has-been-rated-for-switch">an ESRB rating was spotted</a> recently, a listing has now appeared on <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000107124">the Japanese eShop</a> for both Switch 1 and Switch 2.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/disney-afternoon-collection-appears-on-switch-eshop-confirming-its-release-with-two-extra-snes-games/">VGC</a> spotted the listing earlier today and is listed for 2,300 yen (about 11 GBP, or 14 USD, so expect pricing to be a little higher in the West) on Switch 2, with a 10% pre-order discount and a release date of <strong>26th February 2026</strong>. At the time of writing, store pages have not gone up in other regions, but it's only a matter of time at this point.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ljxzqp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Looking at the key art and the game description (via Google Translate), 1993's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/goof_troop">Goof Troop</a> and 1994's <strong>Bonkers</strong> will also be part of the package. Neither of these games have been rereleased before, so that's pretty exciting!</p>
<p>Here's the full line-up of games in their NES or SNES versions for the Switch 1 &amp; 2 versions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bonkers (<strong>NEW</strong>)</li>

I like playing a game where I get to defend myself from/ take down the likes of ghouls, ghosts, demons and other such and much paranormal, supernatural beasties, but how about a game where you're the one doing the haunting? Ghost Keeper! Is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a>, puzzley game where you "lead your fearsome minions against the living" by attempting to scare them off, and just launched in early access today.
</p>
<p>
On the offset, Ghost Keeper almost looks like a Sims expansion, or perhaps incredibly dedicated mod, what with its top down view, exaggerated character animations, and semi-real but still kind of goofy in a fun way vibe. Taking place in a Victorian setting, with six locations to choose from as part of this early access launch, you control the likes of ghosts and various monsters, with the express goal of scaring off a group of humans called the Brotherhood who appear to be legally distinct Ghostbusters.

This might include some spectral floating plates, luring people in with a cute demonic kitty, or just giving them a tap on the shoulder to freak 'em out. Interestingly, the game is actually a story-driven one, though the early access release only offers a part of that right now. Upon beating what's currently available you do get access to a sandbox mode to play around with, though!
</p><p>
According to the game's Steam page, the plan is for it to be in early access for about a year, but right now a majority of the mechanics are already available. There are also plans for more creatures, abilities, areas and more in future updates. Also worth noting that as more updates roll out, the price will be gradually increased, so perhaps it's worth getting on the ground floor now if you're interested. You can check out, or wishlist, the game on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2708880/Ghost_Keeper/">here</a>.

              <p><span>A long-rumoured PlayStation 5 upgrade for Warhorse Studios’ 2018 game </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span></i><span> has seemingly been confirmed by mistake, as the PlayStation Store description listing now includes details for a “The PS5 version” version.</span></p> <p><span>Although this leak was </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qpgd10/kingdom_come_deliverance_ps5_information/"><span>initially spotted</span></a><span> on the PlayStation Store Italia page for the title, the same PS5-specific information has since appeared on the </span><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/227410"><span>British PlayStation Store listing</span></a><span> for </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>It now states that the game will be “Updated for PlayStation 5” and that the “PS5 version of Kingdom Come: Deliverance now features graphical updates including 4K resolution, improved framerate, high-resolution textures and many more. Medieval Bohemia has never been so beautiful.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The background of the key art on the PlayStation Store has also changed, removing the militia seen in the original artwork and replacing the scene with a darker orange background. The opening paragraph has also been updated: “(Re)discover Henry’s saga, from the start!”</span></p> <p><span>Neither the PlayStation Store Italia nor the British pages for </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span></i><span> have been updated to specify a new release date, and still display the game’s original 13 February 2018 PlayStation 4 release date.</span></p>

 <p><span>However, the “2017 Warhorse Studios” trademark information, which is still present on the US PlayStation Store Page, has since disappeared from both the Italian and British store pages.</span></p> <p><span>No word from any of the </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance </span></i><span>social accounts or any sort of announcement from publisher Deep Silver on its legitimacy yet, but rumours of a PlayStation 5 version of the game can be traced all the way back to </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1mdsewq/kingdom_come_deliverance_1_may_be_getting_a/"><span>July 2025</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>Those rumours have only ever mentioned a PS5 version of the game, and as of yet, none of the Xbox store pages for </span><i><span>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</span></i><span> have been updated with similar information.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/dispatch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dispatch</a> is set to release soon on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and with that comes some concessions…and censorship.</p>



<p>Releasing on the console on January 29, Dispatch features moments of vulgarity and nudity during the story. While there is an option to self-censor the game should you not want to hear or see those moments, it appears that Nintendo has made the decision for players.</p>







<p>In a statement provided to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-switch-switch-2-censored-adhoc-comment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, Adhoc Studios confirmed the censorship, but says that the overall narrative and experience will remain the same.</p>



<p><strong>“Different platforms have different content criteria, and submissions are evaluated individually,”</strong> AdHoc said in a statement. <strong>“We worked with Nintendo to ensure the content within the title met the criteria to release on their platforms, but the core narrative and gameplay experience remains identical to the original release.”</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<p>First released with weekly episodes in October, Dispatch quickly became one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dispatch-insider-gaming-community-biggest-surprise-hit-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest surprise hits</a> of 2025. The game sold two million copies in its first month, and has since surpassed 3 million copies on PlayStation and PC combined. With the game now coming to Nintendo Switch 2, and possibly more in the future, that number is likely to rise even more. </p>



<p>As far as the future of the franchise is concerned, the team at AdHoc have said repeatedly that they’d like to do and see more from the Z-Team. Whether that ultimately happens, obviously, remains to be seen.</p>

            <guid>1418830</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>There are plenty of Trinkets to find in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/games/arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, and looting them can be a great source of money, but there’s always been one that’s held dear amongst the community—the Rubber Duck.</p>



<p>These little guys are only Common loot and don’t sell for much at all, but some fans have enjoyed collecting them. Well, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/embark-studios/" id="96820">Embark Studios</a> has upped the ante with the Headwinds update, as a host of new Rubber Ducks have been added to the game, and they vary in rarity.</p>







<p>If you’re looking to start a brand new Rubber Duck collection in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/solo-vs-squads-matchmaking-arc-raiders-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/solo-vs-squads-matchmaking-arc-raiders-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, then you’re in the right place. This guide will show you all of the new Rubber Duck variants, as well as how you can get your hands on them all.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-new-rubber-ducks-are-there-in-arc-raiders">How Many New Rubber Ducks Are There In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>All from one raid. Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-update-release-date-times-confirmed-content/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-update-release-date-times-confirmed-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Headwinds update</a> has added six new Rubber Ducks to ARC Raiders, bringing the grand total to seven, including the original yellow one.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know if you’ve found a new Rubber Duck variant not just by its rarity, but by its skin, too. Each new Duck has a unique aesthetic, ranging from a duck with cow markings to a green alien duck! The full list of new Rubber Ducks is listed below:</p>



<ul>
<li>Tropical Duck</li>



<li>Gentle Duck</li>



<li>Alien Duck</li>



<li>Doodly Duck</li>



<li>Flashy Duck</li>



<li>Familiar Duck</li>
</ul>



<p>As fun as they are, they’re not just for show. Depending on the rarity, these Ducks can fetch a pretty penny, with the Familiar Duck selling for 7,000 Coins a pop! They can stack up to 15 times, meaning a full stack of Familiar Ducks is the most valuable group of items in ARC Raiders. If you’re looking to get rich, you’ll need to know where to find them first. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-find-the-new-rubber-ducks-in-arc-raiders">How To Find The New Rubber Ducks In ARC Raiders</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Check the chimneys! Image by Insider Gaming.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The six new Rubber Ducks can be found on the Buried City map, during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-bird-city-new-headwinds-map-condition-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-bird-city-new-headwinds-map-condition-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bird City</a> Minor Map Condition.</strong></p>



<p>They can’t be found just anywhere on the map, though, as you’ll need to take to the rooftops. Once you’re up high, search every chimney you come across; birds have made nests inside of them, and they’re prone to storing some valuable Trinkets inside.</p>







<p>As luck would have it, these birds have been stealing a whole variety of Rubber Ducks and stashing them in their nests. Who knows where they migrated from to bring these treasures to the Rust Belt, but your Coin collection should thank them. </p>

"Leon has many fans among Capcom employees, and women in particular were pretty strict when reviewing his design. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/28/tgas-2025-resident-evil-leon-1769613081364.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Leon S. Kennedy.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"They would point out and comment on even the finest details like the wrinkles on his neck," Nakanishi continued. "When I mentioned that story in the past, a female fan told me, 'The women developers at Capcom did a really good job' (laughs). Throughout the development process, Leon was thoroughly refined, and I think we managed to come through with a design that would make anyone's heart throb."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leon was finally revealed for Resident Evil Requiem late last year, following months of teases, rumors and speculation over his appearance. The returning hero of Resident Evil 2 and 4 (and a bit of 6), Leon will feature in action-heavy gameplay that will contrast with the quieter, horror-led sequences that feature series newbie Grace Ashcroft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How have the years treated Leon? Is he still pining for Ada? Will he be given a happy ending, after nearly three decades fighting zombies? And what is going on with that ominous-looking mark on his neck? All of these are questions that Requiem will hopefully answer, as well as just providing us all with more eye candy.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Every staff member had their own interpretation of Leon's 30-year-long history, so they would tell me things like, Leon would definitely not act like that in this kind of situation," Nakanishi continued. "So, there were more opinions about what he's like on the inside compared to his looks, and after many discussions, we were able to settle on something that clicked for us. When players see this Leon in the game, hopefully they will be able to find their own interpretation of him as well."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 27, and we just got a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-the-final-preview">final hands-on look at Leon in action</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Do you like tense survival horror? It’s here," IGN wrote. "Wanna go all guns blazing with intense action and a quip-obsessed hero? You get that too. Do you prefer playing RE games in first or third person? Doesn’t matter; you can do either. All these choices, along with my fears of a jarring play experience being mostly squashed, make it easy to believe that Capcom’s bold move to have its cake and eat it is going to pay off in a big way."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

But we do not want to be using AI to drive creativity." Jagex is even speaking with its external partners to make sure no genAI is being used in “inappropriate ways in any of their work that might filter through to the end game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The use of generative AI in game development is one of the hottest topics in the industry, and it has sparked a number of controversies. Following the reveal of Divinity at the 2025 The Game Awards, Swen Vincke, boss of developer Larian, met with a backlash after he said the studio was using genAI in various capacities. Larian ended up having to address AI concerns in a reddit AMA in which the studio confirmed a U-turn on some aspects of its use.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Jagex's "hard line stance" is in contrast to the approach of some video game companies that have gone all-in on the tech. The CEO of Genvid — the company behind choose-your-own-adventure interactive series Silent Hill Ascension — has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gen-z-loves-ai-slop-former-square-enix-exec-claims-a-lot-of-ai-sentiment-is-driven-by-emotion-rather-than-logic"><u>claimed "consumers generally do not care" about generative AI, and stated that: "Gen Z loves AI slop."</u></a> EA CEO Andrew Wilson, meanwhile, has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean"><u>said AI is "the very core of our business,"</u></a> and Square Enix recently implemented mass layoffs and reorganized, saying it needed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-undergoes-mass-layoffs-as-it-reorganizes-to-consolidate-development-in-japan"><u>be "aggressive in applying AI."</u></a> Dead Space creator Glen Schofield also recently detailed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-thinks-the-games-industry-is-broken-beaten-and-battered"><u>his plans to “fix” the industry in part via the use of generative AI in game development</u></a>, and former God of War dev Meghan Morgan Juinio said: "... if we don’t embrace [AI], <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-god-of-war-dev-on-the-use-of-ai-in-games-development-if-we-dont-embrace-it-were-selling-ourselves-short"><u>I think we’re selling ourselves short</u></a>.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of video games, some entertainment companies are banning the use of genAI altogether. For example, Games Workshop recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-maker-games-workshop-bans-its-staff-from-using-ai-in-its-content-or-designs-says-none-of-its-senior-managers-are-currently-excited-about-the-tech"><u>banned the use of generative AI for the production of its designs and content</u></a>, a decision many Warhammer fans welcomed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for RuneScape, it was in the news recently after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uk-court-rules-stealing-runescape-gold-is-criminal-theft-in-case-that-could-have-wider-repercussions-for-the-video-game-industry">a UK court ruled stealing RuneScape Gold was criminal theft in a case that could have wider repercussions for the video game industry</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>
Another month means another batch of games for PlayStation Plus and, as we ready for the hopefully marginally warmer embrace of February, Sony has revealed what's coming next for all subscribers.
</p>
<p>
In total, PlayStation Plus Essential, Extra, and Premium tier members get four games as part the service's usual monthly additions in February, and they'll all be available from Tuesday 3rd February until Monday 2nd March:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Subnautica: Below Zero (PS5)</li>
<li>Undisputed (PS5)</li>
<li>Ultros (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown (PS4)</li>
</ul>

<p>
It's a pretty good selection, then! Survival fans can brave the chilly depths and frozen wastes of planet 4546B in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-below-zero">Subnautica: Below Zero</a>, and there's boxing to be done in Undisputed. Ultros, meanwhile, is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ultros-review">wonderfully trippy, time-looping sci-fi Metroidvania</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown">Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</a> should tickle the aeronautical fancy of wannabe pilots.
</p><p>
Of course, new PlayStation Plus monthly additions also means departures, and subscribers have until Monday 2nd February to add <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-our-ps-plus-monthly-games-for-january">January's titles</a> to their libraries. These, if you don't already know, are Need For Speed Unbound, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed">Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</a>, and Core Keeper.

			<p>On top of <strong>Ubisoft</strong> being under fire from all sides after its <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">recent "<em><strong>major reset</strong></em>" announcement</a>, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/enough-is-enough-ubisoft-worker-unions-call-for-strike-in-response-to-layoffs-and-mandatory-rto/">its <strong>workers planning to strike</strong></a>, its <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lost-nearly-95-of-value-in-eight-years-34-share-price-drop-after-major-reset/">share price dropping to historic lows</a>, and upsetting its fans by cancelling projects like the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/breathtaking-leaked-pre-alpha-images-of-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-are-salt-in-the-wound-for-fans-in-mourning/">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</a></strong>, the studio's social media team has seemingly gone out of its way to cause more confusion and unrest in players with a bit of an odd response to a new leak regarding the heavily-rumored <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-targeting-march-2026-launch/">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Remake</a></strong>.</p>



<p>There have been several leaks regarding the Black Flag remake, the most recent of which (prior to today's leak) revealed the remake's supposed title: <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-pegi-rating-ubisoft/">Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced</a><em>.</em></strong> That was a result of a PEGI rating, which, compared to the new leak, is arguably a bigger deal than what we have now.</p>



<p>Today's leak came in the form of a new statue figurine for <strong>Edward Kenway</strong>, the protagonist of Assassin's Creed IV. The statue was shared online by <a href="https://x.com/TheRealZephryss/status/2016172983551984100">a user on X (formerly Twitter)</a> after being spotted on resale platform <strong>Vinted</strong>, where a seller identified it as a new figure that would be out later this year.</p>



<p>Ultimately, this leak doesn't do much beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-major-changes-rumor/">adding to the pile of leaks</a> we've already seen, which have really only proven <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-edward-kenway-actor-threatened-with-lawsuit-by-ubisoft/">that we can expect the remake to arrive eventually</a>. The current buzz is that the statue is that it's actually what'll be included in the Collector's Edition of the remake. However, for some reason, the leaked statue has prompted a direct response from the <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/2016531108486095252">official Assassin's Creed account on X (formerly Twitter)</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Ubisoft's social media team employed the classic Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas "<em>Ah s***, here we go again</em>" meme as its way of responding to the leak. Now, this can of course be taken positively, as if it's Ubisoft providing a soft confirmation that the remake is happening and that we're about to "<em>go again</em>" with Edward Kenway's journey.</p>



<p>But instead of Assassin's Creed fans replying with excitement to a soft unofficial confirmation, the reply has brought more ire towards Ubisoft, with multiple replies from users immediately taking the negative approach, with one saying, "<em>What? You gonna cancel it like you canceled Sands of Time?</em>"</p>



<p>As to the actual status of the remake, since the project has never been directly confirmed, we can't actually say where it stands. Following the announcement of Ubisoft's restructuring, it was reported that the Black Flag remake was one of the seven projects to get delayed, but that it was not one of the unannounced projects to get cancelled. The only cancelled project we knew about was the Sands of Time Remake, while the others were unannounced. None of the games that got delayed have been officially identified by Ubisoft.</p>



<p>If Ubisoft was even on the verge of thinking about cancelling the Black Flag Remake, then it's likely this reply never gets posted. This is much more likely a soft tease, potentially indicating that we'll get a reveal for the remake sometime soon, even if it has been delayed.</p>



<p>Still, it feels like if there was ever a time to pull back on memes and soft teases, this would be it for Ubisoft,<a href="https://wccftech.com/french-union-claims-ubisoft-ceo-has-no-knowledge-or-understanding-of-his-company-after-major-reset/"> as it is currently under heavy amounts of scrutiny over its restructuring</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Does Half Sword Have Multiplayer? Co-op & PvP Release Details, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/half-sword-multiplayer-co-op/</link>
            <guid>1418785</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Your life is on the line in Half Sword: Two combatants, two weapons, one winner, and a lot of blood spilled. Half Sword is a combat game designed to unleash the sadistic and barbaric medieval animal in you, and multiplayer or co-op would make it even more of a blood-filled blast.</p>



<p>It may seem hard to believe, but civilization is <em>slightly </em>more civilized than it was a few hundred years ago—even if that is hard to believe. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/half-sword/" id="3509" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Half Sword</a> takes us back in time to a more open age where duels-to-the-death were as common as bread. It requires two people, but does Half Sword require human or AI opponents?</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-half-sword-in-multiplayer-or-co-op">Can You Play Half Sword In Multiplayer or Co-op?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A crushing defeat in more ways than one. Credit to Half Sword Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The white flag needs to be waved on Half Sword co-op or multiplayer for now, with developer Half Sword Games confirming that there is no multiplayer present at the game’s launch.</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming will hand it over to the official Half Sword Discord <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1043854763189600337/1272470349245579396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">FAQ</a> to clear this one up:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We fully understand the appeal of multiplayer and especially PvP. However, we also wish to draw your attention to the fact that physics-based multiplayer on Unreal Engine 5 is as hardcore as it gets as far as development: it is no easy task &amp; Half Sword is our first game. We are focusing on single-player physics right now to build a strong experience aimed at offering hundreds if not thousands of hours of fun.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Developer <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/half-sword-games/" id="3510" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Half Sword Games</a> is clearly putting a lot of time and effort into this project, with a view to this being a long-term goal. So, while there’s no multiplayer at launch, it’s not being ruled out.</p>







<h2 id="h-half-sword-multiplayer-release-date">Half Sword Multiplayer Release Date</h2>



<p><strong>According to the developer, a “polished multiplayer experience” is the long-term goal for Half Sword.</strong></p>



<p>The core focus is on single-player. Despite this being a game tailor-made for two real people, the physics and enormity of the gameplay mean a lot more work is needed to ensure a stable base.</p>



<p>The FAQ says: “Are we able to offer multiplayer at release: highly unlikely. Will we do our utmost to provide multiplayer after release: more likely.”</p>



<p>It does seem like Half Sword is destined for multiplayer, doesn’t it? There’s still plenty to enjoy, even if it is only a single-player game for now. Is a lack of multiplayer a dealbreaker?

            <title><![CDATA[Kingdom Come: Deliverance PS5 Upgrade Revealed by PlayStation Store]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-ps5-upgrade-revealed/</link>
            <guid>1418782</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The PlayStation Store was recently updated with a new production description for Kingdom Come: Deliverance, and it unveils something fans have been curious about for a while. It points to a PS5 upgrade being released <strong>soon </strong>for the sensational medieval RPG, which will include 4K resolutions, a boosted framerate, and high-resolution textures.</p>



<p>This follows <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-upgrade-could-come/">a rumor that surfaced</a> in October 2025 suggesting that such an upgrade would emerge early in 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-kcd-is-getting-the-upgrade-treatment">KCD is Getting the Upgrade Treatment</h2>



<p>Last year, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II was released by Warhorse Studios, several years after the first game spawned off the back of a successful Kickstarter project. The sequel was a mindblowing title, bursting with cinematic storytelling, authentic combat sequences, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-kingdom-comes-tom-mckay-labels-game-success-a-fever-dream/">some of the best acting</a> we’ve seen in a hot minute in the gaming space.</p>



<p>Following in the footsteps of that delivery, the first title, released in 2018, appears to be getting a current-gen upgrade, thanks to the PlayStation Store.</p>



<p>It was recently discovered that <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/227410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a PS5 upgrade</a> is incoming for the nearly eight-year-old medieval RPG. On the game’s PS Store page, the product description was recently updated to include:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The PS5 version of Kingdom Come: Deliverance now features graphical updates including 4K resolution, improved framerate, high-resolution textures and many more. Medieval Bohemia has never been so beautiful.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>(<em>Thanks to <a href="https://x.com/RinoTheBouncer/status/2016556945323262317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rino</a> for the spot</em>)</p>



<p>It’s a safe bet it’ll also land on Xbox, of course.</p>



<p>It’s probably a stock-standard upgrade, and it’s not the re-release that some were hoping for, but that doesn’t take anything away from the thing. Kingdom Come: Deliverance is a masterful title that simply must be experienced, as it opens the door to the adventure that is Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, which is worth every one of the <strong>many </strong>hours you’ll sink into it.</p>



<p>That’s what <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/">our full review</a> said about it, anyway.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to exploring a potential PS5 upgrade for Kingdom Come: Deliverance? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Review: Dispatch Nintendo Switch 2 Edition - A Cracking Superhero Caper, With Some Naughty Bits Covered Up]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition</link>
            <guid>1418752</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<p>As a big old superhero nerd and a fan of Telltale's narrative adventure games of old, it's fair to say that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dispatch-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Dispatch</a> piqued my interest when it made its episodic arrival on PC and PS5 last year. Still, I took a punt and held back on purchasing because it simply had to be coming to Switch at some point in the future. Well, Jim of the past, come to Switch consoles it has.</p>
<p>Coming from AdHoc Studio, formed by four former Telltale employees in 2018 in the hopes of capturing the episodic magic they had with the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/walking_dead_the_complete_first_season">The Walking Dead</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/wolf_among_us">The Wolf Among Us</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tales_from_the_borderlands">Tales from the Borderlands</a>, Dispatch drew me in with top-notch writing, stellar voice work and a visual style that'd look right at home in an animated TV drama and didn't let me go until I reached its 'season finale'. It's not going to pick up any prizes in the gameplay department, but Dispatch is every bit as wonderful on Switch 2 as I hoped it would be.</p>
<figure><a title="Dispatch Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161592/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The game follows Robert Robertson, aka Mecha Man, an Iron Man-type man-in-a-suit (bar the billion-dollar backing) who, after his robo-suit is dramatically ripped from his clutches, is offered the chance to lead a rag-tag band of villains-on-the-mend at the Superhero Dispatch Network.</p>
<p>Right from the jump, you'll notice a fair few influences. There are shades of the 'super hero loses his powers' trope we've seen countless times before, and the team of reformed villains, the 'Z-Team', naturally brings the likes of <strong>Suicide Squad</strong> or <strong>Thunderbolts</strong> to mind. There's also more than a touch of <strong>Invincible</strong> in some of the visual stylings and adult themes. But through all of that noise, Dispatch manages to feel fresh.</p>
<p>It's only right I shout out the writing first, because this script <em>rules</em>. The quips and sight gags kept me giggling throughout, but damn, I did not expect these characters to get half as much development as they do. Folks were quickly drawn to the heroes' undeniable good looks at launch (in fairness, they are <em>all</em> outrageously sexy), but it's their personalities — their growth as people, not just heroes — that make them far more interesting than a set of chiselled abs.</p>
<figure><a title="Dispatch Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161591/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Take Chase, Robert's childhood babysitter, whose super-speed abilities have sped up his ageing process, rendering him an old man before hitting 40. He's as potty-mouthed as anyone — if the 18+ age rating wasn't enough of a giveaway, this is not a game for little ears — but underneath that rough exterior, there's a real sense of pain and fear of reaching a premature expiration date.</p>
<p>Across all eight episodes, I became equally attached to Invisigirl and she struggled to put her past behind her, Phenomaman and his post-break-up spiralling, and Blonde Blazer with her desire to do right, regardless of the cost. If it sounds rather grown-up, that's because it is.</p>
<p>Select cartoon superhero media like Invincible or 2019's <strong>Harley Quinn</strong> have juxtaposed child-friendly visuals with gore, sex and swearing, and Dispatch similarly wears its convention-defiance on its sleeve. Indeed, the first episode wastes no time dropping some f-bombs, discussing dead dads and throwing some full-frontal in there for good measure.</p>
<figure><a title="Dispatch Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161593/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The Switch 2 version mostly stays true to this edgy vision, with some caveats which might water down the experience for some. The 'Visual Censorship' setting from the PS5 and PC release — which gives you the option to cover any rude bits with an obnoxious censor bar — isn't present here. From private parts to middle fingers, everything is <em>automatically</em> covered with no option to remove. A particularly steamy scene at the start of episode four also takes place in complete silence, whether you have the 'Profanity Censorship' toggle on or not.</p>
<p>Personally, I don't think this takes anything away from the experience; the scenes still exist, just with a few strange bars with often-hilarious placements, but it's odd that we can't choose to remove the restrictions. I reached out to AdHoc to ask why the setting had been removed and was told the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Different platforms have different content criteria, and submissions are evaluated individually. For our Switch release, we worked with Nintendo to adapt certain elements so Dispatch could be on their platform.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, the writing was on the wall for this one all along (we noted the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/censored-dispatch-artwork-spotted-on-nintendos-digital-storefront">game's 'censored' eShop artwork</a> back in December). Yet, if <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a>'s *<em>ahem</em>* <em>detailed</em> character customisation can slip through uncensored, I don't understand why Dispatch is forced to make omissions.</p>
<figure><a title="Dispatch Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161590/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The plot remains untouched, mind you, which is great, because my love of the characters is the driving force behind my decision-making. Much like the team's back catalogue, Dispatch lives and dies on its dialogue trees. Some options are inconsequential, but the vast majority are met with a little message in the top corner of the screen as a reminder that my choice, good or bad, will have consequences.</p>
<p>I've played the game through twice now, intentionally making different choices on my second playthrough to see just how much sway they held. Certain story beats are set in stone, but I was pleased to see just how much influence I held over the journey; even the less important decisions rewarded me with some cracking unique dialogue for taking the path less travelled.</p>
<p>That dialogue really sings thanks to one of the most stacked voice casts in recent memory. Everyone from Hollywood big hitters like Aaron Paul (<strong>Breaking Bad</strong>, <strong>BoJack Horseman</strong>) and Jeffrey Wright (<strong>Boardwalk Empire</strong>, <strong>Westworld</strong>), to YouTube stars <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@penguinz0">MoistCr1TiKaL</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@jacksepticeye">jacksepticeye</a> is involved. The immensely popular D&amp;D wizards at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@criticalrole">Critical Role</a> — Laura Bailey, Travis Willingham and Matt Mercer — are also part of the cast.</p>
<figure><a title="Dispatch Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161589/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In short, you won't be bored during the cutscenes. And that's good, because Dispatch has a <em>lot</em> of them. Dialogue tree cinematics are broken up by your dispatching work at the SDN offices, where the game turns into something vaguely reminiscent of a management sim. Calls come in with different skill requirements, and it's up to you to pick the right hero for the job.</p>
<p>Successfully completing jobs lets you enhance your heroes' skills to have more control over the situations you're putting them in, and you can even train them to learn unique abilities. I soon began to mould the team to my liking, utilising unlocked skills rather than base abilities to answer more calls and shift the odds in my favour. Suffice to say, I became far more engaged in the call-outs' tactics than I expected.</p>
<p>Dispatching heroes with controller inputs is a little fiddly and feels more suited to a mouse and keyboard — Mouse Mode is not available in the Switch 2 version — but I soon settled into the rhythms of using the D-pad to select a call/hero. Luckily, touch controls have been implemented for handheld play, which is a nice touch.</p>
<figure><a title="Dispatch Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 6 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161588/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Short 'hacking' minigames also appear while Robert is on call, tasking him with moving through a virtual maze without being caught/timed out. While it lacks the depth of the hero management side, it was a welcome change whenever I got tired of comparing the team's mobility and vigour.</p>
<p>But the beautifully animated story sequences are the real meat here. You can opt to play in either 'Cinematic' or 'Interactive' modes, the latter of which includes some mostly-pointless quick-time events for you to input in select combat sequences. It's a fine enough way of breaking up the watching, if that's your cup of tea, but I quickly turned them off to just watch the action play out instead. After all, how often can you say that you've 'binged' a game?</p>
<p>And just as a final brief note on performance, it all plays swimmingly on Switch 2. I wouldn't expect something like this to be too demanding on Nintendo's latest, of course, but a stable 60fps went a long way to convincing me that I was tucking into a juicy TV show.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Thanks to the sublime writing, fantastic voiceovers, and a level of animation you'd usually expect from a big-budget streaming series, Dispatch is the kind of superhero drama that draws you in with the sexy characters and funny one-liners, and hooks you until the bitter end with the potential of its ever-changing arcs.</p>
<p>The lack of any visual censorship options on Switch is a strange one, and some will undoubtedly find things lacking in the gameplay department, but I'm already gearing myself up for a potential 'season 2'. It won't be for everyone, but if you're like me and it clicks, it <em>really</em> clicks. Is it too soon for a 'rewatch'?</p></section>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>An Assassin's Creed level designer has claimed that Ubisoft have put him on unpaid disciplinary leave for speaking out publicly against the company’s recently introduced requirement that staff return to the office full-time.</p>
<p>The level designer in question is David Michaud-Cromp, team lead for level design on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> (which is cited on his LinkedIn with its older “Codename Red” working title). He started at Ubisoft Montreal in 2012, working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-unity">Assassin's Creed Unity</a>, and also has credits on the best-selling Assassin's Creed Valhalla and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/watch-dogs-legion">Watch Dogs Legion</a>.</p>
<p>The backstory: last week, Ubisoft announced that they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">cancelling a load of games</a> and laying off staff in the course of transforming themselves into the New Hotness with funding from Tencent. They also announced that they would no longer allow hybrid or remote working, with staff receiving a yearly allowance of work from home days, instead. An executive commented that “the one and only objective [for the new RTO policy] is to enhance collective efficiency, to drive the dynamics, the creativity, the sense of belonging.” Unionised Ubisoft developers were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/it-is-out-of-the-question-to-let-a-boss-run-rampant-ubisoft-workers-strike-against-disastrous-cutbacks">not convinced</a>.</p>
<p>Michaud-Cromp offered his own thoughts on the RTO policy in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7420149620619509761/">a LinkedIn post from 23rd January</a>. "Last week, So... Ubisoft wanna bring back 5 days in the office... because they "believe in collaboration"... but c'mon, we're not completely stupid... we very well know why you want to go back to 5 days in the office…" he wrote.</p>
<p>The post includes a link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1D6Tml2ZTCo">a Youtube video</a> from Damon Cassidy, which argues that RTO policies are better understood as “a way to maintain oversight and reinforce traditional hierarchies”, while propping up office real estate prices.</p>
<p>According to Michaud-Cromp, Ubisoft haven’t reacted well to his taking a public stance on RTO, though I’m not sure which specific comments he’s referring to. In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/david-michaud-cromp-10668035_professional-update-ubisoft-informed-me-today-share-7422041590346661889-7e3C/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_android&amp;rcm=ACoAAAsO93UBTZM2evkelLuCJQRZA60kwdEabuQ">a LinkedIn post from yesterday</a>, he writes that: “Ubisoft informed me today of a three-day unpaid disciplinary suspension, effective Tomorrow.</p>
<p>“The measure was presented to me as being related to public comments I expressed regarding the company’s return-to-office policy, and based on an alleged breach of the duty of loyalty,” the post continues.</p>
<p>“I am sharing this information for transparency purposes. I take note of the decision and will make no further comment at this time.”</p>
<p>I’ve asked Ubisoft for a statement. I've seen a couple other Ubisoft developers speaking up about the RTO policy and wider cutbacks - in the circumstances, it's probably best not to name them. In other news, Ubisoft are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-propose-cutting-up-to-200-jobs-at-paris-headquarters-as-unions-reportedly-agree-three-day-strike">proposing up to 200 layoffs</a> at Ubisoft Paris, even as unionised workers ready themselves for another strike.</p>

              <p><span>Streaming PS3 games through <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-ps-plus-essential-extra-premium-microsoft-xbox-gam-1848722178">PlayStation Plus Premium</a>, Sony’s most expensive subscription tier, has seemingly been busted for at least two weeks now. It’s especially bad timing with <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-finally-fixing-dumb-midnight-release-time-2000663241"><em>Fallout</em> season 2</a> inspiring some PS5 owners to try to revisit the PS3 version of </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Exactly two weeks ago today, one fan on the PS Plus subreddit posted a </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1qct49v/got_a_problem_with_streaming_on_ps5/"><span>thread titled</span></a><span> “Got a problem with Streaming on PS5.”As they explained, they were unable to boot up 2012’s </span><i><span>Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two</span></i><span> through PlayStation Plus Premium’s cloud gaming service.</span></p>

 <p><span>After some attempts at troubleshooting, other players in the same thread quickly discovered they were facing the same problem. Every single PS3 cloud streaming game, for seemingly every subscriber, was suddenly refusing to load. No error message, no attempt to boot, nothing. <em>Kotaku</em> just&nbsp;tried to boot up Fallout: New Vegas and other PS3 games from the PS Plus and library menus on PS5 and had the same problem.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>From this point on, dozens more threads detailing the same issue began to crop up on the subreddit. In fact, the issue has become such a problem that, as spotted by </span><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/01/ps3-game-streaming-still-broken-and-sony-draws-criticism"><i><span>Push Square</span></i></a><span>, moderators have started deleting threads discussing the matter and guiding users towards a single megathread.</span></p>

 <p><span>Players have discovered a few </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1qfg98u/workaround_for_streaming_ps3_games_on_ps5/"><span>workarounds</span></a><span> for the issue, such as booting a Cloud Streaming title from their libraries instead of the store, but the fix doesn’t seem to work for everyone, and appears to be temporary for others. As of today, the </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1qol9xu/comment/o228w5a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>top comment</span></a><span> on the moderator-created PS+ Criticism Thread claims the issue still hasn’t been fixed. “Insane this had been broken for nearly 2 weeks and no comms or fix,” reads one reply.</span></p>

 <p><span>Some fans </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1qj3zs5/contacted_support_about_the_streaming_and_this_is/"><span>have opted</span></a><span> to pester PlayStation Support for answers. One member of the support team reportedly confirmed that Sony is aware of the problem, stating that the “issue only impacts PS3 titles within the Classic Catalog.” But there’s still no explanation of what’s causing the problem and when it might be fixed. Sony didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. </span></p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/sony-interactive-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony</a> has announced the free games coming for PlayStation Plus members in February. As per usual, the games will be available for all active PlayStation Plus subscribers.</p>



<p>Starting on February 3, members will <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/28/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-february-undisputed-subnautica-below-zero-ultros-ace-combat-7-skies-unknown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">have four games</a> from different genres to add to their library. </p>







<p>The headline game in February will be <strong>Undisputed</strong> from Steel City Interactive. First <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/undisputed-coming-to-playstation-plus-free-games-in-february-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported on earlier this week</a>, Undisputed joins the catalog roughly 15 months after it’s 1.0 release. </p>



<p>Also coming is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genres/survival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survival</a> action-adventure game <strong>Subnautica: Below Zero</strong>, science fiction title <strong>Ultros</strong>, and the combat flight game <strong>Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</strong>.</p>







<p>As mentioned, the games will be available starting February 3 until March 2. Simply adding them to your library will give you continued access to install them when you want, as long as you have an active subscription.</p>



<p>If you haven’t yet, you have until February 2 to add January’s free games to your library. Those games include Need For Speed: Unbound, Disney’s Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, and Core Keeper. Again, you don’t have to download them right away to add them to your account. </p>
