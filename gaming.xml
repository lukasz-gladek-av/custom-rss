			<p>It’s hard work being a young Diokek warrior. One moment you are minding your own business, exploring some ancient ruins, and the next you’re discovering a legendary sword and are tasked with saving the entire world from sinister forces! Turns out you’re a long-prophesied heroic saviour. Typical.</p>
<p><iframe title="Astor: Blade of the Monolith -  Official Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hhs--UE8cGw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>And so begins Astor: Blade of the Monolith, a fast-paced Zelda-like action RPG. And fast-paced the game certainly is! There is no mucking about with long introductions and tedious tutorials here; Astor has their sword and starts their quest within a few minutes of the game booting up. This efficient and effective storytelling is a breath of fresh air. Throughout the quest, the game keeps never-ending text boxes and long-winded waffle to a minimum; Astor’s fellow Diokek’s clearly know this hero has got a lot of saving the world to do, so they keep their exposition welcomingly concise. As such, Astor: Blade of Monolith has a pleasing arcade quality that suffuses its otherwise standard action RPG experience.</p>



<p>Visually, Astor: Blade of the Monolith is rather lovely too. Sure, the environments themselves are standard video game fare – dark caves, forests, deserts, you get the idea – but they are pleasingly designed with a chunky cartoon aesthetic that sets the game apart from its many contemporaries. Seeing the wind rustle through the red leaves, shrubs, and long grass of the forest world, even teasing Astor’s cloak playfully, was an unexpected visual treat for what is a budget-priced game. It’s a shame that the environments are so empty. Wandering back and forth across a desert, you’ll encounter handfuls of enemies but there is little of interest to lure you from the path to your next dungeon.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the dungeons themselves are much more interesting to explore. Though gameplay-wise the experience is akin to a My First Zelda, there is still fun to be had. After all, all the elements you would expect are present. There are weapons and tools to gather, puzzles to progress through, foes to best, and big bosses to battle. Nothing to blow you away perhaps, but there is a certain satisfaction to be had from a decent adventure that’s reliably delivered with classic mechanics.</p>

<p>Combat, again, is reasonable but lacking in heft. Astor can swipe and slash their sword like the best of them, but it never feels like a foe is being hit. Indeed, were it not for diminishing health bars, it would be hard to tell if Astor’s intricate combos were having any impact whatsoever. Everything feels a little flat. Even when Astor juggles opponents with an air combo, rarely do you feel like there is any contact or connection. The same goes for incoming enemy attacks, their lack of visual commitment makes them difficult to read. Successful dodging and parrying then, is far more down to luck than skill.</p>
<p>Mind you, with a gentle difficulty curve and minimal hassle, even with the lacklustre combat, Astor: Blade of the Monolith proves an enjoyable means to while away a few hours.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Astor: Blade of the Monolith offers an enjoyable action RPG experience with charming visuals and character design. However, with weak combat and a lack of things to see and do in the overworld, it’s an experience that will soon be forgotten.	</p></div>

            <p>A retail listing for Resident Evil 9 has popped up on Play Asia, along with PS5 versions of Code Veronica, Resident Evil 0, and Resident Evil 5.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-zero-and-code-veronica-remakes-currently-in-development-leak-claims">Whilst the remakes have long been rumoured to be in development</a>, the former includes a hitherto unknown subtitle, "Revenant Shadows", what may or may not be the final cover art, and a description of the game.</p>

<p>"Resident Evil 9: Revenant Shadows is the latest instalment in the iconic survival horror series by Capcom," the store description <a href="https://www.play-asia.com/resident-evil-9/13/70hafz">says</a>.</p>
<p>"This game continues the chilling legacy with a fresh story, new characters, and the return of familiar faces. Set in an expansive, terrifying world filled with new threats and mysteries, Revenant Shadows blends intense action, intricate puzzles, and the atmospheric dread that fans have come to love."</p>
<p>There are also listings for Resident Evil 5 on <a href="https://www.play-asia.com/resident-evil-5/13/70hadf">PS5</a> – the description says there's been "new technology developed specifically for the game, as well as incredible changes to both the gameplay and world of Resident Evil", suggesting it's not a mere remaster – and <a href="https://www.play-asia.com/biohazard-code-veronica-x/13/70haan">Code Veronica</a>, although it's unclear at this stage if that's a port or a remaster.</p>

<p>A PS5 version of <a href="https://www.play-asia.com/biohazard-zero-hd-remaster/13/70haa7">Resident Evil Zero</a> is also listed, although that is clearly marked as an "HD remaster."</p> <div>

<p>Capcom has yet to comment on the listings, and no release dates are given for any of these presently unannounced games. At the time of writing, only PS5 versions of the horror games are available.</p>
<p>The listings all but prove the rumours from earlier in the week that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-zero-and-code-veronica-remakes-currently-in-development-leak-claims">intimated Capcom had remakes of both Resident Evil Zero and Resident Evil: Code Veronica in development</a>.</p>
<p>In a long thread of posts on social media platform X, Dusk Golem attempted to clarify what has been a confusing time for claims about the future of the Resident Evil series, following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-is-doing-incredibly-well">huge success of the recent Resident Evil 4 Remake</a>.</p>
<p>Capcom's main team behind RE4 Remake is now worked on Code Veronica, Dusk Golem stated, while its secondary studio that worked on RE4 Remake's Separate Ways DLC is handling work on Zero.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kill-knight">KILL KNIGHT</a>, the silly-named twin stick <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a> you may have caught at similarly silly-named event <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/the-triple-i-initiative">The Triple-I Initiative</a> in April, is joining this year's Steam next fest with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694420/KILL_KNIGHT/">a demo</a> ahead of its expected release date later this year. I’ve played it, and I feel must apologise, Mr. Knight. I still think it's a silly name, but with frantic flowing action this immediately gratifying, you can call yourself whatever your killy little heart so desires. For this knight is not like other knights: this is a knight who kills. Wait, they all do that? Oh. Well, this one has four guns. Suck it, literally every other knight.</p>

<p>Imagine I’ve got a whiteboard pointer, because I’d first like to highlight Kill Knight’s spread of individual tutorials, each adding another trick to your arsenal. You start with the basics - twin automatic pistols with a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gears-of-war">Gears Of War</a>-style active reload that makes them deadlier, and a highly reactive dodge with i-frames for phasing through projectiles. You’ve also got a screen-clearing shotgun, great for much-needed crowd control, since Kill Knight overwhelms you with foes from second one. The shotgun has limited ammunition, but you’ll gain more by slaying foes with your sword. Oh, right. Yeah. You’ve got a sword!</p>

<p>You’ve also got a fourth gun (Four guns <em>and</em> a sword!) but this one is special. Kills made with this gun are the only way to spawn health orbs, and you can only fill up its shoot-o-meter by absorbing the red orbs that fallen foes drop. But! These orbs are also how you power up your character, increasing your speed, damage, and possibly some other bits. It’s a lot to balance! Also you can parry. Also the parrying slows down time. I tell thee what, this knight has truly put a lot of thought into the myriad ways in which kills may be achieved.</p>
<p>It all comes together to blend the twitchy with the cerebral, the pressure of making smart calls to safeguard the next ten seconds while murder-dodging your way through the current ten seconds. I’ve not quite mastered the balance myself, but it’s already got its hooks in me to the point where I’d be well up for getting even mildly proficient at it. I’m writing this in the past, but I assume there'll be some sort of tag where you can keep up with all our picks from this year’s Steam Next Fest. That’s my promise to you as a Word Writer.</p>
<p>Steam Next Fest 2024 doesn't kick off properly until the 10th of June, but we've already got some lovely demos trickling in. You can keep up with all our coverage<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/steam-next-fest-2024"> here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24166316/keanu-reeves-china-mieville-book-of-elsewhere-brzrkr<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="XMYN2U">Who or what can’t <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23640292/best-keanu-reeves-movies-john-wick">Keanu Reeves</a> beat in a fight? The titan of action cinema, who has also recently expanded his enthusiasm and prowess <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/cyberpunk-2077/7564">to video games</a>, has been taking on a new foe of late: literature. What started as a wildly successful venture into comic books with the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2021/3/4/22313805/keanu-reeves-brzrkr-comic-boom-studios-review">Kickstarter-funded series <em>BRZRKR</em></a>, co-created by Matt Kindt and Ron Garney, has now expanded into Reeves’ first co-written novel, <em>The Book of Elsewhere</em>. </p>
<p id="TMCThj">Don’t worry if you’re not familiar — <em>The Book of Elsewhere </em>is not solely for fans of <em>BRZRKR</em>, but it’s a good fit for fans of Keanu Reeves. A philosophical, violent thriller about an immortal soldier pondering the nature of his existence, <em>The Book of Elsewhere</em> has an elegance that might surprise you for a pulp thriller, thanks to Reeves’ chosen collaborator: weird-fiction legend China Miéville. </p>
<p id="W7tdFZ">Miéville is a prolific and wide-ranging writer known as one of the preeminent voices in the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_weird">new weird</a>” canon of the ’90s and ’00s, with novels like <em>Perdido Street Station</em>, <em>Embassytown</em>, and <em>The City &amp; the City</em> that, generally speaking, applied the cosmic horror sensibilities of H.P. Lovecraft and Robert W. Chambers to other genres — most often urban fantasy, in Miéville’s case. His presence as Reeves’ narrative collaborator on <em>The Book of Elsewhere</em> immediately makes it more interesting, even for those who aren’t already fans of the comic. </p>
<p id="SvMdsf">Because while <em>BRZRKR</em> is a hell of a thrill ride, it takes some doing to expand into a worthwhile novelistic experience. The story of an immortal warrior named Unute, or “B,” <em>BRZRKR</em>’s 12-issue narrative is an ultra-violent fable about a warrior-poet of sorts, an 80,000-year-old man with the might of a demigod in search of an end to his immortal condition. He doesn’t want to die, he repeatedly says; he just wants to be able to. To this end, Unute has struck a devil’s bargain with the United States government: He does dangerous black ops work for the military, and in exchange they get to study him to see if anything about his superhuman strength is replicable, as long as they also try and find a way to cure him. </p>

<p id="mBypAJ">It’s a very comic book-y story, depicted with unsparing brutality under Garney’s pen, but the three men who made it <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/22717755/keanu-reeves-interview-brzrkr-comic">do the work to ensure it is also a thoughtful comic book-y story</a>. <em>The Book of Elsewhere</em> doesn’t just transpose <em>BRZRKR</em> into a new medium, though. It’s more an entirely different take on the same basic premise, like seeing two stylistically different filmmakers adapt the same story. </p>
<p id="Ok8p4e">Under Miéville, the stranger aspects of Reeves’ unkillable warrior take center stage. While its violent, in-medias-res opening may make the reader feel like they missed something, Miéville introduces Unute/B and his world as if <em>BRZRKR </em>didn’t exist. Different aspects of the story find new emphasis, and its plot centers on a strange new dilemma: a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babirusa">babirusa</a>, or deer-pig, that is also immortal, just like Unute, and has followed him throughout his life. </p>
<p id="GfRtLS">It’s a thoughtful twist that allows Miéville to bring an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/2/21/17036936/annihilation-movie-review-2018-natalie-portman-alex-garland"><em>Annihilation</em>-esque</a> flair to the world of <em>BRZRKR</em>, turning Unute’s immortality into something more like an eco-horror mystery, with a conspiracy thriller on the side. Chapters alternate between the main narrative and vignettes from throughout history, recounting people or places that Unute or the babirusa encountered, ruminating more deeply on the philosophical ideas of cyclical violence gestured at in the comic. And it’s worth repeating: I read <em>The Book of Elsewhere</em> before <em>BRZRKR</em>, and it stood alone just fine. In fact, being a fan of one of Reeves’ two takes on Unute’s story does not necessarily mean you will enjoy the other. This is a good thing, as both are distinct works reflective of the creators working with the raw material Reeves gives them. </p>
<p id="7OhZWB">In this, <em>BRZRKR</em> and <em>The Book of Elsewhere</em> mirror the actor’s career in cinema: Whether it’s in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22847211/the-matrix-resurrections-review"><em>The Matrix</em></a><em> </em>or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23653939/john-wick-chapter-4-eat-the-rich"><em>John Wick</em></a>, Reeves excels in enabling fellow artists to bring their A game. </p>
<p id="ige7MO"><em>The Book of Elsewhere</em> will be available July 23. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-leaks-tease-possible-new-characters-stages/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>According to a variety of leaks from <a href="https://x.com/AusilMV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter/X user @AusilMV</a>, MultiVersus plans to add multiple fan favorite characters, stages, and more.</p>



<p>The following contains potential spoilers for MultiVersus. In fact, user @AusilMV warned readers that their account has multiple strikes and may be taken down soon. But many fans have already had a good look at the following spoilers.</p>



<p>After apparent datamining, @AusilMV claims that some of the upcoming characters include Daffy Duck, Samurai Jack, and Aquaman, among others. The latter two do line up with easter eggs in the latest trailer. Some fans spotted a trident and a katana around the WB tower in the teaser.</p>



<p>@AusilMV also claims that some major stages are coming to the game, such as a Cat Concerto stage and Candy Kingdom. The Cat Concerto would be a reference to one of the most beloved Tom &amp; Jerry episodes of all time. </p>



<p>Again, the most recent trailer hinted at stages like the Teen Titans tower, which @AusilMV also seemed to find. They also mentioned a Water Tower and a Mousewheel.</p>



<p>At this time, the dev team did not officially confirm any of these characters and other leaks are actually coming to MultiVersus.</p>



<p>MultiVersus only <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-release-date-announced-for-may-28th/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just launched again</a> on May 28 after a long hiatus, introducing new content and features. Notably, the devs confirmed that both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-trailer-teases-jason-voorhees-agent-smith-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jason Voorhees and Agent Smith</a>, from Friday the 13th and The Matrix, joined the roster.</p>

<p>Bloober Team is looking for a new publisher for its new unannounced survival horror game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bloober-team-working-with-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">known as Project C</a>, after Take-Two Interactive’s Private Division has reportedly canceled its publishing deal with the studio.</p>



<p>As first spotted by <a href="https://x.com/MauroNL3/status/1796102364463501426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MauroNL on Twitter</a>, the terms of the termination are being negotiated. Bloober Team is also looking for another publisher for the game, which is expected to be a brand new IP from the Polish studio.</p>



<p>The deal between Bloober Team and Private Division was signed back in September 2021. That deal included an option for Private Division to cancel without reason, according to MauroNL.</p>



<p>The cancellation comes amid Take-Two Interactive’s announced plans to cancel multiple games. </p>



<p>As of publishing, neither Take-Two Interactive or Bloober Team have commented on the termination. Insider Gaming has reached out to both parties for comment. Should a response be received, it’ll be added to this story. </p>



<p>Currently, Bloober Team is still working on the Silent Hill 2 remake that is expected to be sometime in 2024.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/30/playstation-says-live-service-games-will-launch-day-and-date-on-pc-but-single<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>PlayStation has reiterated its approach to releasing its games on PC, stating live-service games will launch day-and-date on PC. However, its tentpole single player games will not.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This comes from <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/14/hermen-hulst-and-hideaki-nishino-named-dual-playstation-ceos-following-jim-ryans">one of PlayStation's dual CEOs, Hermen Hulst</a>, during a public business <a href="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/business_segment_meeting/pdf/2024/GNS_E.pdf">presentation</a> held earlier this morning. During it, Hulst explained the strategy for releasing PlayStation's single-player games on PC at a later date, rather than day-and-date, citing it's part of a strategy to bring more people into the PlayStation platform.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GF8M0YoySoc" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>"Indeed, we are bringing our titles to the PC platform, and we have a dual approach here," Hulst said. "On the live service side, we are releasing our titles simultaneously, so day and date on PlayStation 5 and PC. But with our tentpole titles, our single player narrative-driven titles that [are] the backbone of what PlayStation studios has delivered in recent years and in our history, we take a more strategic approach and we introduce our great franchises to new audiences, and we're finding new audiences that are potentially going to be very interested in playing, for example, sequels, on the PlayStation platform.</p>

<p>"We have high hopes that we are actually able to bring new players into PlayStation at large, but into PlayStation platforms specifically. Actually, the same goes for the work that we do with extending our great properties onto other media, such as television series and film, for example, as you have seen with <em>The Last of Us</em> on HBO or <em>Gran Turismo</em> on film, that brings new players into our franchises as well."</p>

<p>While this doesn't come as a surprise – we saw the live-service multiplayer <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/helldivers-2/bullet-heaven">Helldivers 2</a> launch earlier this year simultaneously on PS5 and PC while <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/03/06/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-rides-to-pc-in-may">Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut</a> only just hit PC this month, years after its PS5 release – it's nice to officially hear PlayStation's approach moving forward.</p>

<p data-characters="277" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Natsume continues to diligently plow the fields of <em>Harvest Moon</em>, and its latest crack at the farming sim series takes it to mobile. The developer and publisher <a href="https://www.natsume.com/news/news_pdffiles/pid_351_HMHSH_Title%20AnnouncementF.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> <em>Harvest Moon: Home Sweet Home </em>as a mobile game that’s eyeing an August 2024 launch on iOS and Android.</p> <p data-characters="419" data-current-count="419" data-injectable="true">Details are light at the moment, but <em>Home Sweet Home </em>has players moving back to their hometown at the behest of their childhood friend. It turns out the town of Alba is in rough shape now, and it’s up to you to revitalize it. In the process, you’ll need to team up with friends while convincing the more doubtful townsfolk that someone from the city has what it takes to bring their town back to life.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-i-want-to-see-you-dance-again" data-injectable="false">I want to see you dance again</h2> <p data-characters="450" data-current-count="450" data-injectable="true">Interestingly enough, the news about the latest <em>Harvest Moon </em>game arrived a day prior to the Marvelous Game Showcase 2024 event. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jiK4CpQg1aw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stream</a> is set to kick off today, on May 30, at 3 p.m. Pacific Time, and it sure would be a coincidence if one of their announcements had to do with the <em>Story of Seasons </em>series. As you may know, the original, long-running <em>Harvest Moon </em>series continues under the <em>Story of Seasons </em>title in the west due to rights issues.</p>
 <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="275" data-injectable="false">We’ll see what comes of the Marvelous stream soon while we wait for more information from Natsume on the next <em>Harvest Moon </em>entry. Prior to this, the most recent game was <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/new-harvest-moon-screens-winds-of-anthos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Harvest Moon: The Winds of Anthos</em></a>, which hit consoles and PCs around the world in September 2023.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Minecraft Animated Series Coming to Netflix]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-animated-series-netflix</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/minecraft-animated-series-coming-to-netflix.884844/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-animated-series-netflix<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix and Microsoft have announced a&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>animated series as part of the hugely popular sandbox game's 15-year anniversary celebrations.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/netflix-series" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>website, the series will tell "an original story with new characters" and will "reflect the world of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>in a new light".</p>

<p>It's being worked on by WildBrain, the company responsible for shows like&nbsp;<em>Sonic Prime</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Ninjago: Dragons Rising</em>, so if you've seen either of those shows then you'll know roughly what to expect from&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/minecraft-animated-series-telltale-story-mode.jpg?itok=BFY_ZHAv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/minecraft-animated-series-telltale-story-mode.jpg?itok=bSgIF9yE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The upcoming Netflix&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>animated series won't be the franchise's first foray into narrative media.</figcaption></figure><p>Details about the series are pretty thin on the ground right now; we know that&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>will be exclusive to Netflix, but we don't know what its story will be, who it will star, or even what its name is.</p>

<p>The teaser trailer for the&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>animated series is light on info, too; it features a single Creeper shuffling its way across the screen, followed by a&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>-style Netflix logo surrounded by lava and a promise that the series is "coming soon".</p>

<p>You can check the teaser out below, but be aware that it's very much a teaser, so there probably isn't much information to mine (oho!) from it.</p>




<p>Netflix's&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>animated series won't be the franchise's first flirtation with narrative media, and it also won't be the first time&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>has appeared on Netflix, either.</p>

<p>Telltale's&nbsp;<em>Minecraft: Story Mode</em>, which was originally released episodically between 2015 and 2017, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-story-mode-comes-to-netflix-november-7">made its way to Netflix in 2018</a>&nbsp;as well, although it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/download-minecraft-story-mode-before-its-gone-for-good-later-in-june-2019">subsequently delisted in 2019</a>.</p>

<p>There's also a live-action&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>movie in the works, and it's set to star Jack Black as main character Steve, apparently alongside stars like Jason Momoa, Jennifer Coolidge, and Kate McKinnon.</p>

<p>It's not clear whether the movie will launch before Netflix's animated series does. Stay tuned for more info on this and all other things&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>.</p>

There is speculation that Sony may have mistakenly pushed out the new build for Bungie’s game onto the PlayStation Network early, though there hasn’t yet been any confirmation of how players were able to access the content. The end result, however, is that lore entries, info on the next seasonal update Echoes, and even references to raid mechanics for <em>The Final Shape </em>have now leaked ahead of schedule. </p><p>Sony and Bungie did not immediately respond to requests for comment. </p><p><em>The Final Shape</em> is set to conclude 10 years of storytelling in the sci-fi loot shooter series, with new and old players alike facing off against The Witness, a powerful alien hellbent on ending all life in the universe. It’s a showdown fans have been waiting a long time for, and one that could be ruined if any big reveals or surprising details spread ahead of time. </p><p> Like a lot of live service games, <em>Destiny 2 </em>has long struggled with how to keep its upcoming content and story beats secret due to data mining on PC. Massive leaks have also become more frequent in recent years, between physical copies of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> getting released early and malicious hacks of company data surfacing in-development footage of high-profile games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gtavi-gta-vi-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-leak-video-dump-1849550414&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gtavi-gta-vi-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-leak-video-dump-1849550414"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em></a></span><em> </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/what-hacked-files-tell-us-about-the-studio-behind-spide-1851115233&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/what-hacked-files-tell-us-about-the-studio-behind-spide-1851115233"><em>Wolverine</em></a></span>. In this case at least, the leaks seem to have been self-inflicted.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/netflix/status/1796164705628688726" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X, Netflix officially confirms that a new animated Minecraft series is now “in the works.” </p>



<p>Both Netflix and Mojang Studios are working on the series. Fans of the game are pleased that the show will directly involve the iconic developers.</p>



<p>Today’s post includes a brief teaser trailer, though it doesn’t seem to feature any actual footage from the show. Instead, a classic Minecraft creeper appears and proceeds to explode, revealing the Netflix logo. So, there aren’t any hints about the potential plot or characters.</p>



<p>Netflix did not announce a release window or date either, though the new teaser does say the animated series is “coming soon.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Since the animated series is already in the works and coming soon, another trailer should drop sooner than later. </p>



<p>In the meantime, fans are also looking forward to the Minecraft movie adaptation, which was revealed a while ago. Some recent updates include <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jack-black-minecraft-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jack Black joining the cast</a> of the anticipated film. They will reportedly play the familiar Steve character that players can start the game with.</p>



<p>For the time being, the Minecraft movie is still set to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release on April 4, 2025</a>. However, the production faced frequent delays, so the release date is hardly concrete.</p>



<p>Netflix’s new series accompanies a variety of other animated game adaptations, such as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ark-the-animated-series-shadow-dropped-on-paramount-plus/">recent Ark show</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/among-us-animated-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Among Us series</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/30/playstation-5-generation-is-already-sonys-most-profitable-yet<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The PlayStation 5 generation is already Sony's most profitable yet, the company has announced. In terms of numbers, the PS5 generation has already earned Sony $106 billion, according to a slide from its "Game &amp; Network Services Segment" <a href="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/business_segment_meeting/pdf/2024/GNS_E.pdf">presentation</a> from <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/14/hermen-hulst-and-hideaki-nishino-named-dual-playstation-ceos-following-jim-ryans">PlayStation's two new CEOs, Hideaki Nishino and Hermen Hulst</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, on that same slide, Sony shows that the PlayStation 4 generation earned $107 billion, which is obviously more than $106 billion. But, the reason Sony is calling the PS5 generation the most profitable one yet is because the PS4 generation is largely complete whereas the PS5 presumably still has years to go. Given it's made $106 billion in roughly four years, it seems Sony is confident it will surpass $107 billion in the coming months or years.&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>As for what Sony is including in its profits, it's the entire gamut of the PS5 generation. This includes the PS5 console itself, associated hardware and accessories, and software, too. It also includes services, like PlayStation Plus, according to the presentation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the reasons the PS5 generation might be Sony's most profitable yet is because even though the playerbase is as big as the PS4 – both are sitting at 49 million active consoles as of last month – PS5 players are playing significantly more on their console. The PS5 generation sits at 2.4 billion total gameplay hours while the PS4 sits at 1.4 billon. More playtime likely equates to more spending, which might be one of the reasons the PS5 generation is doing financially as well as it is.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Life-to-date spending on the PS5 is also higher amongst players than the PS4, too. Across peripherals, services, content/add-ons, and content/full games, the PS4 life-to-date spend is $580 while PS5 players average $731.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-2-final-shape-expansion-leaks</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/destiny-2-the-final-shape-expansion-leaks-after-sony-streaming-slip-up.884820/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-2-final-shape-expansion-leaks<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The entirety of upcoming&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>expansion&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape&nbsp;</em>has been leaked, and although the leak has subsequently been taken down, it seems that the damage has already been done.</p>

<p><em>The Final Shape&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-2-final-shape-expansion-officially-delayed-to-deliver-even-bigger-and-bolder">set to launch next week</a>, but it looks like the expansion was mistakenly made available to players via Sony's PlayStation 5 streaming feature last night.</p>

<p>Reddit user Cupcake_Of_Doom <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1d3y49x/final_shape_on_ps5_streaming/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported</a> being able to launch the expansion and experience some of its content (although they logged off before delving into it too deeply), and user Soracaz <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1d3ykat/code_red_spoilers_incoming_everywhere_the_dlc_has/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">documented the leak</a> in something approaching real time, recommending players "get off the internet" to avoid spoilers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-leaks-axe.jpg?itok=XCLwAzqc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-leaks-axe.jpg?itok=U2U2UbJ6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you're looking forward to&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape&nbsp;</em>and you don't want it spoiled, you might want to stay offline.</figcaption></figure><p>It seems that players who did manage to access&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape&nbsp;</em>were prompted to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1d3y49x/comment/l6b6n3b/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">create a new character</a> rather than being able to access their original Guardians, so much of&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>'s story <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1d3y49x/comment/l6ay5z0/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">remains a mystery</a>, as does the majority of its new playable area.</p>

<p>In addition, the expansion's new raid <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1d3ykat/comment/l6astv2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wasn't accessible to players</a>, as they weren't able to achieve the necessary prerequisites before&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape&nbsp;</em>was removed from the PS5's streaming service.</p>

<p>However, it looks like a vast amount of content relating to Collections and the Season Pass was made publicly available, and eagle-eyed players also seemingly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1d3ykat/comment/l6ar96b/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">spotted a raid mechanic</a>&nbsp;that pertains to&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>'s raid, although details are scarce.</p>

<p>Additionally, a <a href="https://x.com/Bungie_Leaks/status/1796113034387062789" rel="noopener" target="_blank">collaboration</a> between&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://x.com/Bungie_Leaks/status/1796108632091734329" rel="noopener" target="_blank">seemingly leaked</a>, and although this crossover is naturally unconfirmed at time of writing, it'd make sense given&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>' recent&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>team-up.</p>

<p>In short, while the entirety of&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape&nbsp;</em>probably won't be spoiled by this leak, it's still a pretty devastating moment for Bungie and Sony, but in particular for the latter, where the blame for this mistake seemingly mostly lies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-leaks-knife.jpg?itok=a405Mzoa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-the-final-shape-leaks-knife.jpg?itok=K_MCZmkY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Final Shape&nbsp;</em>wasn't completely spoiled, but this still isn't great news for Bungie or Sony.</figcaption></figure><p>Reports are also circulating that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-trailer">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC</a>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-release-date" rel="noopener" target="_blank">set to launch on June 21st</a>,&nbsp;was made available via the same method, but we've been unable to confirm those reports.</p>

<p>If you want to delve deep into what's been leaked from&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>, you can check out the X (formerly Twitter) feed <a href="https://x.com/Bungie_Leaks" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BungieLeaks</a>, where much of&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>'s leaked content is still visible (for now, at least).</p>

<p>Since the leaked version of&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape&nbsp;</em>isn't available anymore, you won't be able to hop in and confirm these leaks yourself until next week, but you won't have long to wait, since&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape&nbsp;</em>arrives on June 4th.</p>

            <p>Eyes up, Guardian – The Final Shape DLC has leaked online after the expansion was temporarily available earlier today.</p>
<p>As reported dozens of times in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1d3y49x/final_shape_on_ps5_streaming/">Destiny 2 subreddit community</a> and beyond, "the entire" The Final Shape DLC was "playable" – although some say this is an exaggeration and the content was merely accessible – until, eventually, developer Bungie "killed" the servers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this was not before spoilers about the story, raid, trophies, loot, and more – much, much more – swamped social media and online communities. It appears the content became available after yesterday's scheduled maintenance.</p>

<p>"The entire DLC is playable right now. If you don't want spoilers now is your chance to bail outta the sub, off X, off everything," said a Destiny 2 player on the official subreddit, entitling their post: "CODE RED: SPOILERS INCOMING EVERYWHERE. THE DLC HAS LEAKED".</p>
<p>"PC servers killed, Bungie/Sony about to attempt full damage control," said the first update to their post, swiftly followed by, "UPDATE 2: This leak tops everything else. Raid gear, raid mechanics, HUGE STORY SPOILERS. LIKE... MASSIVE. If you don't like leaks/spoilers tomorrow is gonna be hell. Get off the internet. It's so bad that I'd be surprised if they didn't just release TFC early to avoid people getting spoiled."</p>
<p>According to the poster, the players who'd accidentally found themselves with the new update were "somehow still online despite servers being taken down lmao".</p>
<p>"Full campaign is available. Season stuff too," the poster explained.</p>
<p>Eventually, the content was taken offline again. It's speculated, but not definitively confirmed, that players were able to access the new content via "a Sony backend fu*k up" similar to the one some used to get a premature peek at the Elden Ring DLC.</p>

            <p>Destructive third-person <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a> Just Cause is getting made into a movie, produced by the men behind The Fall Guy and Nobody, according to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/just-cause-movie-in-the-works-1235910913/">the Hollywood Reporter</a>. This isn't the first time the over-the-top explode 'em up has been in line to get the big screen treatment. Another version spent years in development hell until the rights lapsed. But it's been picked up again by Universal, who are no strangers to turning video games into box office burger bucks (they did The Super Mario Bros. Movie). So, it might result in an actual movie this time.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The flick is set to be directed by Ángel Manuel Soto, who directed superhero movie Blue Beetle. That might be reassuring to anyone worried about the representation of the game's hero Rico Rodriguez, who is largely coded as Latin American, even though his origin nation is supposedly somewhere in the Mediterranean (the Just Cause games always take place in fictional nations, so there is a lot of generalised hand-waving at the atlas). Blue Beetle had a largely Latin American and latino cast, so it's unlikely the starring role will be given to eg. Timothée Chalamet. Right? RIGHT?</p>
<p>Two of the producers in charge, Kelly McCormick and David Leitch, were behind Ryan Gosling stuntman movie The Fall Guy and the "everyday bloke lets loose" action of Nobody, starring Bob Odenkirk.  Another producer on the team, Dimitri M. Johnson, was involved in Sonic The Hedgehog 3, plus the co-op videogame <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a>. So, that seems like the right crowd to make a movie largely about grappling hook hijinks. Pray they get further than the last crowd who <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/-i-just-cause-i-film-rights-optioned">optioned the rights back in 2010</a>, as that plan slowly fizzled out.</p>
<p>Just Cause as an open world shooter has had ups and downs. Its most recent installment, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/just-cause-4">Just Cause 4</a>, was our least-liked so far, suffering bugs and annoying menus. "How did such an established and entertaining series end up in such a quagmire?" asked John (RPS in peace) in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/just-cause-4-review-pc">Just Cause 4 review</a>. Maybe the movie will take us back to simpler times, when it was enough to ride along in your speedboat, the  pleasure of the sea spray in your hair, an enemy soldier screaming sonorously as you drag him along behind you on a rope. Ah, el mar.</p>

			<p>The fourteen titles featured in today's PlayStation State of Play broadcast might have leaked in advance.</p>
<p>-- <strong>SPOILER ALERT</strong> --</p>
<p>Yesterday, after various rumors, Sony finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-state-of-play-featuring-14-announced-for-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced a new State of Play event</a> for later today.&nbsp; As confirmed by Sony, fourteen titles for PS5 and PS VR2 will be shown off during the 30-minute-long broadcast. Additional details haven't been provided, but as expected, many have been speculating about which games will be present during the show. Last week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-firewalk-studios-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we reported</a> on Firewalk Studio's upcoming sci-fi PvP multiplayer FPS 'Concord', which might very well be featured during the show. Another title that is likely to get some screen time is the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-showcase-may-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>. In addition, recent rumors suggest that Sony will soon also be officially announcing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-port-announcement-imminent-leaker-reiterates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">God of War: Ragnarok PC port</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, a Spanish leaker 'Leakeo De Proximidad' <a href="https://x.com/LeakProximidad/status/1796126726239461679" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has now allegedly leaked</a> the full lineup of today's State of Play event. From the looks of it, the initial list that the leaker posted has been deleted, but luckily, X user 'MauroNL' managed to grab the list. In addition, aside from the 14 titles that Sony will be showing, there is said to be a 'surprise' 15th announcement as well. As claimed by the Spanish leaker, the following titles will be present during today's show (<strong>SPOILER ALERT):</strong></p>
<hr>
<hr>

<hr>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-announcement-soon-may-2024-playstation-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The recently rumored new Astrobot title</a></li>
<li>God of War Ragnarok for PC</li>
<li>A new Five Nights at Freddy's</li>
<li>A new Dynasty Warrior title</li>
<li>Marvel Rivals console port announcement</li>
<li>Alien: Rogue Incursion</li>
<li>Path of Exile 2</li>
<li>Monster Hunter: Wilds</li>
<li>Silent Hill 2 Remake</li>
<li>Phantom Blade Zero</li>
<li>[A new title from the Middle east]</li>
<li><a href="https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-remake-pc-ps5-unreal-engine-5-full-camera-control/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Until Dawn for PS5 and PC</a></li>
<li>Concord</li>
<li>A new VR title</li>
</ul>
<p>Granted, some of these titles are easy guesses based on earlier rumors or leaks from other leakers. Then again, this Spanish leaker correctly leaked the recently confirmed Dragon Quest 3 HD announcement some months ago. In addition, he was spot-on about <a href="https://x.com/LeakProximidad/status/1775825448183664717?t=E5_QX8Ys816R7oYyCq4aeg&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kingdom Hearts coming to Steam</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/LeakProximidad/status/1775825446715699386" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hinted</a> at the Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 announcement roughly two months before the official confirmation from Warhorse. Interestingly enough, the leaker <a href="https://x.com/LeakProximidad/status/1775825445230891198?t=zVZhU5aNpMO5JoZeEK6GWg&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also hinted at a new non-VR Astro game last month</a>.</p>
<p>Whether this Spanish leaker is right on the money remains to be seen, but we figured it would be worth sharing nonetheless.</p>
<p>The PlayStation State of Play broadcast is airing later today at 3 pm PT / 6 pm ET | May 31, 12 am CEST / 7 am JST on YouTube, Twitch, and TikTok.</p>

			<p>NVIDIA has announced that Blizzard's World of Warcraft, for a long time the biggest MMORPG on the market, is now available to play via cloud through GeForce NOW.</p>

<ul>

Ultimate and Priority members can redeem it starting today, while free members will be able to claim it starting May 31.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-update-adds-boss-rush-modes-and-performance-improvements-in-time-for-game-pass-launch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Lords of the Fallen launches on Game Pass (both console and PC), <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-and-sniper-ghost-warrior-contracts-2-confirmed-to-be-coming-to-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as previously reported</a>. At the same time, the developers have released a meaty free update, introducing two boss rush modes accessible through the game’s Vestige checkpoint markers. The boss rush modes feature two distinct experiences for players: Echoes of Battle and Crucible. While Echoes of Battle allows players to relive their favorite boss encounters, including Ellianne the Starved, Congregator of Flesh, and Radiant Sentinel, Crucible is a series of six increasingly challenging trials of pre-selected bosses that must be overcome without dying to unlock rewards, including Shrine Currency and exclusive new armor tincts.</p>
<p>Saul Gascon, Executive Producer at HEXWORKS, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>We’re delighted to welcome the many new players exploring Lords of the Fallen’s dual worlds for the very first time thanks to the game’s addition to the incredible Game Pass library. We’re extremely excited to greet this new wave of Lampbearers with the surprise release of our ‘Clash of Champions’ update, which includes the all-new Boss Rush modes as requested by our community. These new additions further add to the extensive gameplay variety Lords of the Fallen already offers, especially following the recent inclusion of the Advanced Game Modifier System.</em></p>
<p>Both modes are playable either in single player or cooperative multiplayer with a fellow adventurer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lords of the Fallen - 'Clash of Champions' OUT NOW | Buy Now on PC, PS5 &amp; Xbox Series X|S" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vOH16kFFjT0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lords of the Fallen earned a weak score (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6.8</a>) at launch on Wccftech. Francesco De Meo wrote:</p>
<p><em>Lords of the Fallen showed a lot of promise before release, and I was disappointed to see how the game failed to deliver an enjoyable experience. Some die-hard Souls series fans may find some enjoyment in the 35 or so hours-long journey to save Mournstead, but everyone else likely won't be able to see past the game's many shortcomings. Combat is the heart and the (dark) soul of any soulslike, and an interesting story and solid world design can only do so little to alleviate issues stemming from clunky combat design.</em></p>
<p>To be fair, there's been over thirty post-launch free updates, which have considerably improved certain areas of the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24166579/wwe-wrestling-explainer-why-rock-summer-event-big<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="ilwG5S">A decade ago, when I started watching professional wrestling, I was taught two things with absolute certainty: The first was that Vince McMahon, the chairman and guiding creative force behind the world’s biggest wrestling company, was an out-of-touch, possibly psychopathic old man who was strangling the life out of the business. Second was that his son-in-law, 14-time WWE World Champion Paul “Triple H” Levesque, was going to save it. </p>
<p id="p3JLh4">Levesque is considered the mastermind behind WWE’s popular developmental brand, NXT, which has run concurrently with mainline WWE programming since 2012 and has consistently outshined its big sibling in the eyes of fans and professional wrestling pundits. Now, at last, Levesque’s time has come and the retired wrestler has the creative reins of the entire company, stepping in as chief content officer of WWE, unencumbered by his disgraced father-in-law. Fan enthusiasm is at a fever pitch and <a href="https://www.ringsidenews.com/2024/04/16/wwes-impressive-sell-out-streak-comes-to-an-end-on-4-15-wwe-raw/">ticket sales are</a> <a href="https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/wwe-backlash-breaks-record-largest-gate-any-arena-show-wwe-history">reaching record highs</a>. There’s an air of rebirth, a palpable sense of joy and renewal in WWE’s recent programming, and the internet wrestling community — whose favorite pastime is complaining about the product — seems relatively satisfied.</p>
<p id="iM08hs">Like everything else in pro wrestling, the idea that WWE has entered “a new era” is at least partially a “work,” part of the con in which the audience has agreed to participate. WWE is a company that has endured decades of well-deserved bad press while owned and operated by McMahon, a proudly predatory businessman who is <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/wwe-founder-vince-mcmahon-federal-investigation-surrounding-sex-traffi-rcna136941">currently under federal investigation for sex trafficking</a>. (For an exhaustive account of McMahon’s life and many, many alleged misdeeds, check out the book <em>Ringmaster: Vince McMahon and the Unmaking of America</em> by Polygon contributor Abraham Josephine Riesman.) Now that McMahon is gone, presumably for good, it behooves the publicly traded company, which is now majority owned by media conglomerate Endeavor, to distance itself from its radioactive former chairman as much as possible.</p>
<p id="eA7ruG">However, WWE has used the occasion of Paul Levesque’s long-awaited rise to creative control over the company’s product to give their programming a new coat of paint, a new confidence, and, arguably, a new peak in quality. Some of these improvements are quantifiable, but there’s also an immeasurable improvement in <em>vibes</em> — and in a medium where perception is reality, vibes can account for a great deal. Perhaps the biggest shift this year in WWE is that, for the first time in recent memory, the fan base seems to <em>want</em> to enjoy it. While commentary and fans have taken to calling this period “the Paul Levesque Era,” you could just as appropriately label it…</p>

<p id="LbjvAD">April’s WrestleMania XL wasn’t, strictly speaking, even the first of the annual super-shows to run under Paul Levesque’s creative stewardship. The previous year’s two-night event took place during the limbo period in which Levesque was <a href="https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2023/1/13/23554380/report-triple-h-assures-talent-vince-mcmahons-return-wont-affect-wwe-creative">nominally the chief creative officer</a> but <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakeoestriecher/2023/06/07/vince-mcmahon-reportedly-back-on-the-throne-of-wwe-creative/?sh=2bc8afee60dd">Vince McMahon was reportedly still backstage issuing orders</a>. But in January, McMahon had <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/01/vince-mcmahon-resigns-rape-lawsuit-tko-group-holding-sex-trafficking-1235805961/">resigned in disgrace</a> (<a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/vince-mcmahon-resigns-from-wwe-after-former-employee-files-sexual-abuse-sui">for the second time</a>) just one day before the de facto kickoff of 2024’s WrestleMania season, meaning that this year would be the first time that the new CCO would get to manage the buildup of every storyline and execute their payoffs on the “grandest stage of them all.” Stephanie McMahon, who hadn’t been seen on WWE TV since being dethroned as chairwoman by her own father in 2023, addressed the <a href="https://www.fightful.com/wrestling/wwe-announces-attendance-72755-fans-wrestlemania-xl-sunday?amp">purported 72,755 fans in attendance</a> on night two of WrestleMania XL to proudly declare it “the first WrestleMania of the Paul Levesque Era.” This announcement was met with thunderous applause, and the next night on <em>Raw</em>, the assembled die-hards greeted the <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/how-did-legendary-wwe-wrestler-triple-h-get-his-name-see-details/articleshow/100947292.cms?from=mdr">former Hunter Hearst Helmsley</a> with a chant of “Thank you, Hunter.”</p>
<p id="TO3pdI">The build to WrestleMania XL was some of the most thrilling WWE TV in years, but some of the credit has to go to one of Levesque’s chief rivals, who also took on a new leadership role this year. On Jan. 23, the <em>day</em> before the NY Post published the latest allegations against Vince McMahon, WWE legend <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/dwayne-the-rock-johnson-board-member-wwe-tko-group-1235882746/">Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson joined the board of directors of TKO</a>, the Endeavor subsidiary that includes both WWE and UFC. Soon, The Rock became a consistent on-screen presence on WWE TV. The return of one of Hollywood’s biggest stars to weekly wrestling television was, naturally, a boon to ratings and a siren song for lapsed WWE fans, and he was expected to leverage his star power as a baby face. However, his insertion into the main event of WrestleMania meant preempting a storyline in which fans were already deeply invested, which accidentally made Rock the promotion’s biggest villain. WWE pivoted to make use of the fan outrage, recasting Rock as a heel and reframing the story as a fight between the company’s past and its future. The story’s climax at WrestleMania XL was transcendent, simultaneously making the most out of The Rock’s intrusion <em>and</em> paying off a story two years in the making between longtime heel champion Roman Reigns and fan-favorite challenger Cody Rhodes. (The Rock is expected to return for next year’s ’Mania, likely in time for <em>Raw</em>’s big move to Netflix in January 2025.)</p>
<p id="KnUhBj">Since then, the phrase “Paul Levesque Era” has been in common rotation on WWE programming, employed by wrestlers, authority figures, and commentators — though never by Levesque himself. But what that term actually means has been left for the audience to interpret. Levesque has exerted an influence over WWE’s output for years, as the sensibilities of his NXT have trickled onto the main roster along with its performers. One need look no further than the current WWE women’s division, which is unrecognizable from the exploitative sideshow it was 10 years ago. Still, there has been a number of marked changes in the way WWE’s flagship shows, <em>Raw</em> and <em>SmackDown</em>, have been programmed and presented since WrestleMania XL. The literal rules of the fictional sport haven’t changed, but the rules of the <em>show </em>are, in many ways, far less rigid, no longer subject to Vince McMahon’s bizarre bugaboos.</p>
<p id="ARKrvU">For starters, the yearslong embargo over the words “wrestler” and “wrestling” has finally been lifted, and performers and commentary are no longer required to refer to their profession as “sports entertainment.” This is a symbolic change, but a crucial one, as the return to the terminology of the real sport upon which WWE is based has been accompanied by a greater emphasis on the action taking place in the ring. The cinematography of the action itself has dramatically changed to feel more like a modern combat sports broadcast, as longtime producer Kevin Dunn — loathed by swaths of fans for his rapid cutting and insistence that operators shake their cameras to emphasize the impact of wrestling moves — has been <a href="https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2024/1/9/24032242/wwe-hires-kevin-dunn-replacement-lee-fitting-espn-head-television-production">replaced by ESPN veteran Lee Fitting</a>. Long takes and tracking shots have become the norm, allowing the athletes’ work in the ring to speak for itself. </p>

<p id="h2HSSB">WWE has also expanded the parameters of its kayfabe wrestling universe, acknowledging the histories of its performers outside of WWE programming. For example, on the May 13 episode of <em>Raw</em>, play-by-play commentator Michael Cole referred to the long history between competitors Shayna Baszler and Iyo Sky seven years prior at Japanese promotion Wonder Ring Stardom. During their (admittedly underwhelming) feud just after WrestleMania, Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes acknowledged his opponent AJ Styles as the only other man to have held both the WWE Championship and the NWA Championship, which was the sport’s grandest prize in the U.S. and Canada before Vince McMahon’s conquest of the wrestling world. Since McMahon purchased his last major domestic competitor in 2000, WWE usually treated itself as if it was the only wrestling company on the planet, and direct references to its performers’ activities beyond its influence were extremely rare. Now, no opportunity to use a wrestler’s full history to raise the stakes of a story is being ignored. This is indicative of a major shift in attitude, encouraging viewers to explore the wider wrestling world rather than dismiss it as insignificant. Simply by referring to its competitors in a respectful tone, WWE’s spokespeople make the company seem less outwardly petty, less insecure — or, in short, less like Vince.</p>
<p id="zLUG8b">Everyone on screen seems more at ease than they did just months ago, from the in-ring talent to the commentary team. This is one of those “vibes only” alterations, which could be a result of the less adversarial relationship with the fans or a less hostile environment backstage, or simply be a figment of the viewer’s imagination. The backstage culture of professional wrestling has been gradually changing since even before Levesque’s NXT. Wrestlers were once infamous for their hard drinking, drug use, bullying, and partying on the road. Today’s crop of WWE superstars are, in a word, nerds.</p>
<p id="T9ZKIM">The popular pastime among both male and female wrestlers on the road is video gaming, either with their traveling partner or for a streaming audience. (If you want a clear picture of how the culture has changed, <a href="https://youtu.be/EL6SC62m4XM?si=wAut2-jhKT2H3Ha7">watch this video</a> of two recently released WWE wrestlers recounting their “wild” LAN party to a perplexed good ol’ boy from the strippers and coke days.) In a recent interview, wrestling iconoclast CM Punk described the way that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6xQo-bko00">the WWE locker room had become less toxic</a> during his eight-year absence from the company — and, in typical CM Punk fashion, gave himself credit for it. Since it runs parallel to an overall shift in interests and attitudes between generations, it probably can’t be attributed to any one person. Pro wrestling may have previously circumvented traditional human resources workflows in favor of carny-style traditions like <a href="https://www.thesportster.com/wwe-wrestlers-court-controversial/">“wrestler’s court,”</a> but now that WWE is a public company and its workforce includes a lot more millennials, the culture is, reportedly, much more chill.</p>

<p id="8Dt2JC">In truth, it’s not hard to improve upon Vince McMahon’s WWE as either a workplace or a product. On screen, the “sport” of WWE has acquired a sense of earned stakes and consequences that many fans agree were sorely lacking under McMahon. Today, rarely does a match take place that does not figure into at least one ongoing storyline; in fact, more often than not it will advance more than one. To an outsider, this may sound like an obvious expectation to have of any scripted entertainment, but a weary WWE fan will tell you that McMahon’s wrestling booking often made no sense from week to week, as the chairman habitually demanded revisions on promos or match outcomes mere hours before broadcast. Wrestlers would get lost in the shuffle, their storylines abruptly ending or pivoting in some wild direction based purely on McMahon’s gut feelings about what was or wasn’t working. This drove both on-screen and backstage talent — <a href="https://www.ringsidenews.com/2023/06/30/vince-mcmahons-mindset-regarding-last-minute-changes-in-wwe/">including Levesque, reportedly</a> — up a wall. At present, nearly every performer appearing on <em>Raw</em> and <em>SmackDown</em> is on some sort of trajectory, and their stories are interlocking in a way that builds excitement for what’s coming next.</p>
<p id="8lfn52">Take the King and Queen of the Ring tournaments, which occupied the entire month of May on both <em>Raw</em> and <em>SmackDown</em>. Sixteen women and 16 men competed in a pair of single-elimination tournaments, and though not everyone knocked out in the first round was immediately propelled into a new storyline, there have been a number of new feuds set up between those who did not make the finals. LA Knight and Carmelo Hayes didn’t face each other in the tournament, but they matched wits and traded braggadocious barbs backstage between matches and (even though neither will be King of the Ring) they’ve both got a big money match on deck. Next big thing/<a href="https://www.cbr.com/x-men-jade-cargill-storm-cosplay/">Storm cosplayer</a> Jade Cargill lost by disqualification to “the irresistible force” Nia Jax, preserving both wrestlers’ reputations and saving a showdown between Jade and her tag-team partner Bianca Belair for a future main event. Hell, young NXT call-up Bron Breakker now has a fiery feud with <em>Raw</em> general manager Adam Pierce over having missed the tournament altogether. Outside of the men’s tag-team division, which got squeezed almost entirely off television by the sheer number of tournament matches, the month of May was good for just about everybody.</p>
<p id="WoAEV6">The tournament helped to build momentum during what is usually one of the slower periods in the WWE calendar. In years past, the winner of the King of the Ring tournament would earn the right to wear a robe and crown and act regal. This year, the winners of each tournament will be awarded a world title opportunity at SummerSlam, one of WWE’s biggest shows of the year, giving the tournament stakes and importance comparable to the Royal Rumble. The tournament matches themselves have felt worthy of those stakes, with each competitor giving their all for the opportunity at the throne. Now, with the winners crowned, there’s an instant long-term story to carry the main event scenes to SummerSlam in August.</p>

<p id="UzEvwb">Alas, the King and Queen of the Ring tournaments were also a reminder of everything that <em>hasn’t </em>changed at WWE. The finals of the two tourneys took place in Saudi Arabia, where the company returns for two stadium shows every year. WWE <a href="https://corporate.wwe.com/news/company-news/2019/04-11-2019">began a long-term business relationship</a> with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2018 as part of Mohammed bin Salman’s “Vision 2030” public relations and tourism campaign. WWE’s Saudi events are heavily subsidized by the local government and the broadcasts are frequently interrupted with what are, essentially, propaganda packages about progressive reforms in the country. Most WWE premium live events have similar tourism ad spots from the host’s tourism board, but given the KSA’s history of human rights violations, it is an unsettling reminder of how WWE, as a company, has no scruples. (One fan nickname for the Saudi PLEs is “blood money shows.”) Lest anyone think that the new management might reconsider the relationship, TKO’s board has already <a href="https://www.si.com/fannation/mma/news/major-update-wwe-future-with-saudi-arabia-before-king-queen-ring-2024">announced its intention to extend it</a>, and the chairman of KSA’s sports commission <a href="https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2024/5/8/24152042/saudi-arabia-royal-rumble-wrestlemania-enhanced-wwe-deal">has expressed interest</a> in hosting one of WWE’s “big four” events, such as the Royal Rumble or even WrestleMania. Given the Saudi authorities’ deep pockets, it seems unlikely that TKO’s board would turn them down.</p>
<p id="LJiziS">The removal of Vince McMahon also doesn’t magically cleanse the company or its current leadership of responsibility for his decades of alleged sexual misconduct. In addition to McMahon himself, former head of talent relations John Laurinaitis and seven-time WWE Champion Brock Lesnar <a href="https://www.si.com/fannation/mma/news/brock-lesnar-wwe-major-update">have also been named</a> in former WWE employee Janel Grant’s sex trafficking allegations. Paul Levesque is McMahon’s son-in-law and has worked closely with him for decades; as much as fans may be enjoying Levesque’s presence and the company’s output under his leadership, they must also brace themselves for the possibility that he, or some other beloved member of the cast and crew, will be found to be knowingly complicit in McMahon’s crimes, or worse, a participant. </p>
<p id="6LmOhU">It’s ironic that professional wrestling, a medium that deliberately exploits the real-life personalities and relationships of its performers, often requires socially conscious viewers to willfully detach the art from the artist. It’s not just show business, it’s business <em>as</em> show, and as fascinating as the business side of wrestling may be, it’s also a major bummer. Deception and exploitation have been baked into the art form since it rose up from its roots as a carnival hustle. Today, we dress it up in the respectable trappings of publicly traded mass media, but that hardly makes it less shady, predatory, or exploitative.</p>
<p id="EI0kGw">The industry’s most notorious ghoul has finally been banished, lifting an enormous weight off the shoulders of performers, executives, and fans. With the rise of Paul Levesque in his place, WWE has given fans an occasion to celebrate Vince McMahon’s absence without speaking his name aloud. It’s an era of good feelings. Does that really represent a bold new beginning for WWE, a clean slate both on screen and behind the scenes? Time will tell. For now, pro wrestling fans will have to do what we’ve always done — choose to believe. </p>

<p>As reported <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/05/30/sony-just-leaked-all-of-destiny-2s-the-final-shape-expansion-early/?sh=370a18481524" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Forbes</a> and a wide range of players, the widely anticipated Final Shape DLC for Destiny 2 leaked today, and Sony itself appeared to be at fault.</p>



<p>For some time, players gained access to the entire DLC, including everything from the campaign to collections, weapons, and seasonal content. </p>



<p>However, Sony and Bungie swiftly took action, and removed all access to the DLC. So, you won’t be able to access this content anymore, though extensive spoilers are now available.</p>



<p>Fans reported that they could force the update via PlayStation 5 streaming. However, Sony still hasn’t explained what the exact cause of the issue was. Either way, it represents an unusually large and damaging leak for Sony.</p>



<p>Destiny 2 The Final Shape DLC leaked a week ahead of its release on June 4, 2024. The release date follows a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-delayed-to-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delay from last November</a>, originally expected months ago. The Final Shape is also intended to be the epic conclusion of years fans invested in the ongoing story.</p>



<p>The upcoming DLC only just got a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-gameplay-trailer-released/">new gameplay trailer</a> last month, teasing a variety of new content and major narrative beats. Fans can pre-order The Final Shape for Destiny 2 now.</p>



<p>At this time, Sony has not issued an official comment about the Final Shape leak. </p>



<p>Another major Sony leak surfaced today, revealing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/state-of-play-leaked-may/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a list of titles</a> coming to the State of Play showcase.</p>

The update features two previously unannounced ‘boss rush’ modes for the dark fantasy <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,188 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">action RPG</a>; players can now replay singular boss battles with previously vanquished foes or confront them sequentially in one of several grueling trials. Both modes are playable either in single-player or with a fellow Lampbearer in online <a title="Genres > Co-Op [169 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative multiplayer</a>. The update also includes additional performance improvements.</p><p>Today’s update closely follows version 1.5 update “Master of <a title="Series > Fate [59 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/fate">Fate</a>,” the concluding part of <em>Lords of the Fallen</em>‘s post-launch content roadmap, released at the end of April. “Master of Fate” represented the culmination of over 30 post-launch updates, significantly improving performance, stability and difficulty balancing across the board, in addition to several substantial content drops. It also featured an advanced game modifier system, allowing players to customise several in-game mechanics (including number of enemies, randomised loot, and pre-upgraded weapons) to make their adventure easier, harder, or simply a completely new experience every playthrough.</p><p>Accessible through the game’s Vestige checkpoint markers, the Boss Rush modes feature two distinct experiences for players: “Echoes of Battle” and “Crucible.” While Echoes of Battle allows players to relive their favorite boss encounters, including Ellianne the Starved, Congregator of Flesh, and Radiant Sentinel, Crucible is a series of six increasingly challenging trials of pre-selected bosses that must be overcome without dying to unlock rewards, including Shrine Currency and exclusive new armor tincts.</p></blockquote><p>“We’re delighted to welcome the many new players exploring <em>Lords of the Fallen</em>‘s dual worlds for the very first time thanks to the game’s addition to the incredible Game Pass library,” said Hexworks executive producer and head of studio Saul Gascon in a press release. “We’re extremely excited to greet this new wave of Lampbearers with the surprise release of our ‘Clash of Champions’ update, which includes the all-new Boss Rush modes as requested by our community. These new additions further add to the extensive gameplay variety Lords of the Fallen already offers, especially following the recent inclusion of the Advanced Game Modifier System.”</p><!-- AD: content -->

According to a warning post on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1d3ykat/code_red_spoilers_incoming_everywhere_the_dlc_has/" rel="nofollow ">Destiny 2 subreddit</a>, details on the entire campaign, seasonal content, and the raid were leaked online.</p><p>"If you don't like leaks/spoilers, tomorrow is gonna be hell. Get off the internet. It's so bad that I'd be surprised if they didn't just release The Final Shape early to avoid people getting spoiled," the warning reads.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Destiny 2 : The Final Shape Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p>Bungie has not responded to the leaks yet, which are reportedly the result of an accidental update made by Sony. What makes this leak notable is that The Final Shape is being billed as the conclusion to the decade-long Light and Darkness Saga of Destiny. The last few years have seen Bungie focus more on the story of its game, slowly weaving in new threads and developments across multiple expansions and seasons, and this expansion is expected to provide a satisfying conclusion to all of this work.</p><p>A recent cinematic set at the end of Season of the Wish has reintroduced a pivotal and previously dead character back to Destiny--he got better--and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-story-trailer-sets-the-stakes-and-suggests-a-fallen-zavala/1100-6523758/" data-ref-id="1100-6523758">The Final Shape launch trailer</a> has hinted at another major character possibly being corrupted by the Witness as it seeks to bring about the "Final Shape" of the universe.</p><p>The Final Shape launches on June 4, and until then, you can check out spoiler-free previews discussing the expansion's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-final-shape-brings-new-depth-to-its-missions-and-defragmented-world/1100-6523728/" data-ref-id="1100-6523728">new destination, the Pale Heart of the Traveler</a>, and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shapes-prismatic-subclass-avoids-the-mistakes-of-strand-in-lightfall/1100-6523730/" data-ref-id="1100-6523730">new Prismatic subclass</a>.</p>

The news comes as part of a celebration of Minecraft’s 15th anniversary.</p>

<p>WildBrain, the studio behind other Netflix shows such as <em>Sonic Prime</em>, <em>Ninjago: Dragons Rising</em>, and <em>Carmen Sandiego</em>, is developing this CG-animated Minecraft show. Plot details are nonexistent, but a press release states the series will be "showing the world of Minecraft in a new light" and feature an original story with new characters.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sf7TC0poGlg" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>This won't be the only on-screen adaptation of the <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/best-selling-video-game">best-selling video game of all time</a>. A live-action Minecraft movie is currently in production, with <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gamer-culture/2024/04/18/jack-black-all-but-confirms-hes-steve-in-the-minecraft-movie">Jack Black confirmed to star as Steve</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Minecraft show, whatever it winds up being titled, has no premiere date.

Less than a year later, the excellent gaming mouse remains the fastest the company has ever made — one that’s currently on sale at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Superlight-Lightspeed-Lightweight-Programmable/dp/B09NBWL8J5/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://howl.me/cmlwLZiexfy">Best Buy</a> starting at $136.75 ($23 off), an all-time low.</p><p>Like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21562618/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-wireless-gaming-mouse-release-date-price-features-weight">original model</a>, the Superlight 2 is all about shedding weight while simultaneously ratcheting up the polling rate. The wireless mouse offers a 4kHz response rate thanks to a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094746/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-2-4khz-polling-rate-update-firmware">recent firmware update</a>, along with a newer Hero 2 sensor that tracks at 500 inches per second (and up to 32,000 DPI). That combo, combined with the fact that the gaming mouse weighs a mere 60 grams (2.1 ounces), makes it ideal for esports PC players who desire high DPI / low in-game sensitivity. It also touts up to 95 hours of battery life when using its power saving modes (or 51 hours without) and compatibility with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Powerplay-Wireless-Charging-Lightspeed/dp/B071WZ56G9/?tag=theverge02-20">Logitech’s Powerplay charging mousepad</a>, though, keep in mind that the new 4kHZ mode will eat up more battery life when engaged.</p><p>Personally, I have a hard time telling the difference between 1kHz and 2kHz polling — let alone a 4kHZ polling rate. However, I am a fan of the Superlight 2’s hybrid optical / mechanical switches, which still provide a satisfying click when pressed. I’m not a tournament gamer by any means, but if you want a pro-grade gaming mouse that will work great for work and play, it’s hard to go wrong with Logitech’s latest.</p><div><p>The G Pro X Superlight 2 is Logitech’s lightest and most advanced mouse to date. It features a 32,000 DPI Hero 2 sensor and 4kHz polling rate as well as support for USB-C charging and Logitech’s Powerplay mouse mat.</p></div><div><div><h2>Verge Deals on X<!-- --> <!-- --> / </h2><p>Join more than 50,000 followers and keep up with the best daily tech deals with @vergedeals</p></div><p><a href="http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud">Follow us!</a></p></div><p><h3>More deals, discounts, and ways to save</h3></p><div><ul><li>Right-to-repair bills <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24166894/colorado-right-to-repair-law-electronics-devices-parts-pairing">continue to sweep the nation</a>, but unless you have the right tools for the job, it doesn’t matter if you obtain the instructions and all the necessary parts.

Plus, the included magnetic case doubles as a sorting tray, which makes keeping tabs on your Phillips and flatheads that much easier.</li><li>If you’re looking for a pair of headphones that offer premium features without the premium price tag, <strong>Sony’s new ULT Wear</strong> are down to an all-time low of $178 ($22 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Canceling-Wireless-Headphones-Comfortable/dp/B0CWVX1GNX/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cmlCNodgRdi">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-ULT-WEAR-Wireless-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-Black%2F5212591696%2F&amp;subid1=vergerdeals052924">Walmart</a>.
