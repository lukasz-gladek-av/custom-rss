            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-2025-mega-sale-live-now-dead-island-2-available-for-free/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There's a new Epic Games Store MEGA sale <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/sales-and-specials/mega-sale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live now</a>, featuring discounts for lots of fun PC games. First things first, though: alongside the discounts, Epic is also bringing back the sale's trademark freebies, starting with the psychedelic indie horror game <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/happy-game-35a105" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Happy Game</a> and with <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/dead-island-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dead Island 2</a>, both of which can be added to your libraries for free until Thursday, May 22 at 5 PM.</p>
<p>Dead Island 2 is, of course, the bigger of the two offerings, having sold 4 million units to date. The project started with Yager Development and then moved to Sumo Digital, but it was Deep Silver Dambuster that eventually brought it over the end of the line in a rather successful fashion. On Wccftech, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-island-2-cool-zombie-slaying-and-little-else/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned a 7.5/10 score from Francesco De Meo</a>:</p>
<p><em>Games that go through development hell hardly turn out great, but Dambuster Studio proved with Dead Island 2 that this is not always the case, although the game is far from a masterpiece. While the gameplay works and feels quite fun at the start of the game, things become repetitive very quickly due to the linearity of the experience and the shallowness of the combat system. Offering nothing more than some mindless fun, the game would have been more than fine if launched at a lower price, but at full price, Dead Island 2 doesn't offer that much to justify it.</em></p>
<p>If you don't fancy these games, there's plenty of engaging titles that you can grab at discounts in the Epic Games Store 2025 MEGA sale, and you can even take advantage of boosted Epic Rewards (from 5% to 20%) for all purchases made in the store using Epic's payment system until 31 August. Additionally, when using Epic's payment system, you can get 20% back permanently on Fortnite, Rocket League, and Fall Guys purchases.</p>

            <p>
There's a newish Persona game on the way next month, and it is, of course, yet another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/persona-5-royal">Persona 5</a> spinoff. I'm not sure if another cow in existence has been so thoroughly milked before, but here we are. I call <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/persona-5">Persona 5</a>: The Phantom X (that's its name, by the way) newish because it's actually been available in China through an ongoing open beta for the last year. Earlier today, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/atlus">Atlus</a> held a pre-recorded livestream confirming that the mobile game is finally coming westward, and that it'll be getting a PC release as well.
</p>
<p>
Now, despite being Persona 5 by name and aesthetic, it'll be offering up some fresh characters for once. You're still the Phantom Thieves, just a different bunch - the protagonist in this one is called Wonder, and the animal companion is an owl-looking critter. 
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="P5X News -First announcement! We’re the Phantom Thieves, and we’re here to steal your heart!-" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yQsdIWTGn_Y?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQsdIWTGn_Y" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
Much like in the original, during the day you'll hang out with friends and study, and at night you'll venture out into dungeons. Apparently you will be able to meet Joker and other characters from the almost decade-old <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-japanese-games-to-play-on-pc">JRPG</a> (see what I mean about milking that cow) as part of special contracts. You'll apparently also find PvE elements called Velvet trials, alongside mini-games and the ability to make and join guilds.
</p>
<p>
It's definitely worth mentioning that this very much does seem to be Atlus' (very late) response to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>, as it is a free-to-play gacha game. Not ideal, particularly for those that find it difficult to play gacha games, but I'm sure Atlus will figure out how they can make yet another spinoff at some point.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and that release date! It's June 26th, a little over a month away, meaning you could probably fit in a Persona 5 replay as long as you just don't eat or sleep at all until then.

<section><p>Even just a few hours was enough to show the power of WoW's upcoming housing-decoration systems, which Blizzard plans on expanding for years to come.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>There's a reason Blizzard used <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft's</a> 20th-anniversary livestream in November 2024 as the stage to finally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-20-long-years-wow-is-getting-player-housing-in-its-midnight-expansion/1100-6527718/">announce player housing</a>. It's likely to be the biggest feature in the game's two-decade history: a huge undertaking that players have wanted Blizzard to commit to since WoW first launched back in 2004. The news that Blizzard was finally rolling up its sleeves and tackling it was a huge deal that had players buzzing with ideas, possibilities, and more than a few concerns.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard is buzzing with ideas and possibilities, too. That much is clear after spending several hours going hands-on with an early version of WoW's player housing and talking to the developers behind it. There's no shortage of "what if this was possible?" or "that's a great idea!" conversations during my day at Blizzard's Boston office. It's the first time a group of players outside Blizzard have been able to take the game's player-housing decoration tools for a spin, and the team seems eager to learn what members of the press and various WoW content creators in attendance think, both good and bad. Blizzard employees are constantly jotting down ideas or making notes about player feedback. It's almost as if you can see light bulbs going off in real time about what might be possible.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQXHFrLX6A4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fQXHFrLX6A4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The basics of player housing seem set in stone--the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-housing-will-allow-for-plenty-of-nitty-gritty-interior-decoration-options/1100-6530083/">actual mechanics of decorating a home</a>, the philosophy behind all players being homeowners, and the social-driven nature of the entire endeavor--and have already been officially detailed by Blizzard in a series of blog posts dedicated to the subject. Every <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/housing-in-wow-will-be-available-to-everyone-wont-come-with-exorbitant-requirements/1100-6529278/">player who wants a house will be able to get one</a>, and homes will be located in neighborhoods (one for each faction) where players will have persistent neighbors. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-housing-system-will-reward-decor-based-on-past-achievements/1100-6531163/">Home decor will be doled out as quest rewards</a>, from professions, and other areas of the game. Those are the major facts we already knew, but the finer details, as well as the big ideas for what the housing system could be potentially capable of in the future, all still feel a bit ethereal.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard seems well aware it hasn't thought of everything when it comes to housing. It's both a little concerning but also, in a strange way, refreshing. There is an air of possibility that comes with seeing such a game-changing feature still in its infancy. Blizzard has made clear that the version of housing that will launch as part of the Midnight expansion (or, as has been heavily implied, ahead of it) will just be a starting point. It won't launch with 20 years of assets at the beginning, nor will all the tools and functions players might like to see be there on day one.</p><p dir="ltr">Lead game designer Toby Ragaini says the first version of housing Blizzard is shipping will be "an initial step." The team is already planning multiple years ahead for a feature that hasn't even launched yet, he said, and the size and scope of the endeavor is definitely a little intimidating.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's a huge responsibility," Ragaini tells GameSpot. "Players have been asking for player housing for decades now. The belief has always been we will release it when we feel like we can do it justice. We were determined not to just simply meet players' expectations; we needed to exceed them…It's something that's going to be with the game for as long as there is WoW. We really couldn't do a half measure."</p><p dir="ltr">At least on the housing-decoration front, Blizzard already seems poised to exceed expectations. While much of what we experienced as part of the hands-on housing demo has already been "revealed," actually using the systems for myself, and seeing them used in the hands of a pro like Jay Hwang--a principal artist on WoW and the player housing system's lead decoration designer--completely changed my preconceived opinion on what the housing tools could be capable of.</p><p dir="ltr">On its surface, WoW's house-decoration system is simple. Players will have a collection of decor earned from quests, bought from vendors, or gained through other sources, that can be placed within a home. A house is capable of holding thousands and thousands of decor objects. Decor can be placed simply using the game's Basic placement mode, in which decor will attempt to snap to walls, ceilings, or floors without fuss. For finer placement, players can turn on Advanced mode, which disables decor collision and can be used for more granular positioning. Players can additionally rotate and resize decor. As Blizzard has previously revealed, a player's home on the inside can be as big or small as they want, ranging from just one room to a mansion of dozens. There are a variety of different room layouts to choose from, including pre-built staircase rooms that can be used to create a multi-story home. A top-down room layout mode makes it simple to add or delete rooms.</p><p dir="ltr">For the demo, Blizzard starts each player with a few pre-decorated rooms made by Hwang to help players to get an idea for what might be possible, and from there it's on each participant to explore their creativity and push the decorating tools to their limit in whatever way they see fit. As someone who is not typically into home building or decorating (both in-game or in real-life), it's a little nerve-wracking trying to be creative and cook up a cool room while curious Blizzard employees look over my shoulder, eager to see how I interact with the systems they've long been working on.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite not being a survival-crafting player accustomed to placing walls and adjusting objects, it isn't long before I'm putting together a magical study or a Forsaken-themed dungeon, all with relative ease. I found WoW's housing tools extremely simple to use, albeit with a few minor frustrations.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1647/16470614/4495662-wowhousingpreviewstudy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495662" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1647/16470614/4495662-wowhousingpreviewstudy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495662"></a><figcaption>A room I built using WoW's interior-decoration tools.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1647/16470614/4495662-wowhousingpreviewstudy.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The basics are easy. Clicking and dragging decor, resizing them, and placing them in the 3D space works like you would expect it to, which is a bigger compliment than it might seem. A hotbar of housing tools at the bottom of the screen lets players easily swap between modes, whether it's decor placement or changing the color of decor with various dyes. Some basic functionality you might expect, like the ability to place an object multiple times or copy and paste it in some way, isn't currently present, resulting in a bit of menu fatigue as you need to open the menu, click an object, place it, and then rinse and repeat every single time. Despite that and my lack of virtual-home-building skills, slapping together a room still felt relatively quick, and I came away happy with the handful of rooms I was able to create in the span of a few hours.</p><p dir="ltr">While actually assembling rooms felt straightforward in a positive way, I did fairly quickly begin to find the list of decor I could use lacking. All of the basics are there: various chairs, rugs, lamps, beds, and tables. Many of the decor items are themed around various WoW races like Humans, Blood Elves, Night Elves, Tauren, and others. Hwang says it's a priority for the team to let players decorate their homes according to various race and class fantasies, and so Blizzard focused on providing those kinds of decorating assets first, though there are a few oddball items, like two different guillotines, as well. Overall, the number of decor items on offer is serviceable, but still feels like there are too few objects to satisfy those truly looking to create their Azerothian dream hom54e.</p><p dir="ltr">That was, until I started paying more attention to the Advanced mode, thanks in part to a live demo Hwang gives that shows off the decorating tool's full power. Because using Advanced mode eliminates object collision and ignores the standard object-snapping rules, it can be used to essentially make entirely new objects out of existing ones. Suddenly, a bookshelf floating in the middle of a wall can become a kitchen cabinet. A fence angled in mid-air in a particular way can become a stair railing. A container, moved halfway under the floor and combined with a small pillow, can become a cat bed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4495664-wowhousingpreviewadvancedmode.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495664" data-ratio="0.56262626262626" data-width="1980" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4495664-wowhousingpreviewadvancedmode.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495664"></a><figcaption>An example of what's possible using the decoration system's Advanced mode.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4495664-wowhousingpreviewadvancedmode.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's in the Advanced decoration mode where the true genius of WoW's player-housing system is hidden. Suddenly, the possibilities seem nearly endless, even more so when combined with the ability to resize objects and to use additional walls, pillars, and other objects to transform cookie-cutter room layouts into unique ones or even turn a single room into an entire multi-room home in and of itself.</p><p dir="ltr">Once I started to look at objects not exactly as they were, but in terms of their individual pieces and components, it was as if an entire new realm of possibility had been unlocked. There aren't just hundreds of decor items to use--there are thousands, all of which can be used in all manner of creative ways.</p><p dir="ltr">Hwang says he is a fan of games where building houses is a key component, like Valheim and Minecraft, and wanted to create a decoration system with both simple and more-complex tools. As he continued to work on the decorating system and bumped into various limitations, he began to ask if it would be possible to incorporate more and more features, like Advanced mode.</p><p dir="ltr">"We got to where it is because we are the kind of player we are making the feature for," Hwang says.</p><p dir="ltr">By the end of our hands-on demo time, it's difficult not to be impressed by what everyone in attendance has accomplished. One player crafted a 3D-platforming maze. Another made an elaborate wrestling arena. Others combined decor or used the Advanced mode to craft items and rooms that I couldn't even comprehend how'd they'd done it, much less try to replicate it myself. If this is what a handful of people can create in the span of just a few hours, what will the game's playerbase of millions come up with once it's fully in their hands? With the tools Blizzard is providing, it's easy to see players creating dance clubs, taverns, casinos, sprawling apartment complexes, and everything in between. Add in the fact that the decor available at launch will be just a fraction of the total possible decor assets in the game, all of which can be manipulated in all kinds of unforeseen ways, and it's easy to be overwhelmed at the possibilities.</p><p dir="ltr">"Those two decades of content for WoW [are] enormously valuable right now," Ragaini says. "Suddenly, all these assets, every piece of furniture you've ever seen in the game, for example, is something that could potentially, and fairly easily, be turned into decor for the player. We're not going to hit every single one--there [are] tens of thousands of items at that scale--but we'll get there eventually. It's just a matter of prioritization."</p><p dir="ltr">It's clear that Blizzard has built a powerful tool--one that hands players the keys to the proverbial castle and says, "Go wild." In a game that has become increasingly on rails over the last two decades, and where many expansion-specific systems in the past have often felt restrictive and intended to be engaged with in a very specific way, the feeling of freedom found in the housing-decorating system caught me off guard. That this is the tool in what is essentially its first form, before UI improvements, added features, and thousands upon thousands more decor objects, is even more astounding.</p><p dir="ltr">As for when those improvements and additional decor rewards will be coming, Blizzard won't say. After all, it's not even ready to disclose when housing is officially arriving. But like many other more recent WoW features like skyriding, hero talents, or delves, Blizzard is treating housing as an ongoing evergreen feature and not a one-off expansion bullet point for Midnight. Ragaini says Blizzard already has a multi-year content roadmap for housing, but it's leaving ample room for player feedback and suggestions.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're going to be listening," Ragaini says. "We're going to be iterating and improving from day one. It would be premature to have this perfectly laid-out plan, because that would assume we know perfectly well how players will respond."</p><p dir="ltr">It's easy to imagine players spending dozens upon dozens of hours building fantastical rooms and elaborate homes once housing launches: an entire game within an already massive one. Blizzard's hope is that by giving a home to essentially every player who wants one, it will become a core pillar of the game moving forward, with housing rewards sprinkled throughout the game's various activities serving as a feedback loop for players to return to their home and see what new items they unlocked after completing dungeons or unlocking an achievement.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4495666-wowhousingpreviewneighborhoods.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495666" data-ratio="0.56262626262626" data-width="1980" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4495666-wowhousingpreviewneighborhoods.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4495666"></a><figcaption>Neighborhoods will be an important part of WoW player housing, but details are still light.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4495666-wowhousingpreviewneighborhoods.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If, however, a player has no real interest in spending much time in their home, Blizzard says that's fine too. There will be "prefab" rooms designed to already look like specific parts of a house, such as a foyer, that players will be able to place down and quickly decorate for those who don't want to get into the nitty-gritty details of building themselves. Ultimately, Blizzard says that if a player doesn't want to engage with housing at all, they don't have to. There will be no player power associated with housing, and Blizzard seems very keen to not repeat the mistakes of Warlords of Draenor's Garrisons, where players could gather crafting materials and essentially access everything they ever needed without having to leave their own personal base. As one of the core design goals behind housing is for it to be a social experience, Blizzard wants to avoid the pitfall of having homes be a place for things like a mission table or an herb garden that would eliminate reasons to venture out into Azeroth.</p><p dir="ltr">If there was one landmine Blizzard seems primed to step on during the demo, it's a prominent "shop" icon located directly in the housing decoration interface. Though it isn't functioning during the hands-on, Blizzard confirms that it will, in theory, take players to WoW's in-game cash shop, where certain housing items will be available for purchase.</p><p dir="ltr">That raises a few alarm bells, to say the least, if for no other reason than it would be the first time a button to the in-game shop was displayed so prominently, as it's normally relegated to WoW's main menu or a small button in the right corner of the game's UI. Blizzard emphasizes that it plans to treat player-housing items for sale just as it does mounts and other cosmetics currently, and that the majority of items for housing will be earnable through gameplay. That being said, Blizzard seems open to the idea of removing the shop tab from the decorating interface, though whether or not that will actually happen by launch remains to be seen.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard, at the end of the day, seems open to a lot of things when it comes to housing, as it hones in on what the feature will look like initially but banks ideas for the future. It's poised to be the biggest evergreen addition to WoW in the game's 21-year life, but it's also one that may not reach its full potential for many years to come: a fact that Blizzard isn't shying away from. There are still plenty of unknowns, like additional details about player neighborhoods, the ability to decorate the outside of homes, and the cadence and scarcity of decor rewards. Those are all things Blizzard isn't ready to talk about just yet, and any one of them, if not done correctly, could potentially derail one of the most important features in WoW history. Even still, this early version of the housing-decoration system, and the creativity it is likely to unleash, feels special. It may have taken over two decades to become a reality, but if Blizzard can stick the landing, WoW's player housing system could be worth the wait.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/blue-protocol/" data-ref-id="5000-499449">Blue Protocol: Star Resonance</a> is the anime MMORPG Blue Protocol brought back from the dead, only it's from a completely different development team and, unlike the original Blue Protocol, will actually be receiving a Western release later this year.</p><p dir="ltr">You may remember Blue Protocol as a long-in-development MMO from Bandai Namco. The game was released in Japan in 2023, with a planned Western release in conjunction with Amazon Games planned for 2024. Unfortunately, the game struggled to find an audience, and Bandai Namco announced last year it would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-and-bandai-namco-cancel-western-release-for-mmo-as-service-ends-in-japan/1100-6526156/" data-ref-id="1100-6526156">end service for Blue Protocol in January 2025, with its Western release also canceled</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aI_qVWHiHnQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aI_qVWHiHnQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Flash forward to now, and Chinese gaming giant Tencent has struck a deal with Bandai Namco to use Blue Protocol's assets, and under a new studio called Shanghai Bokura Network Technology, has essentially rebuilt and will be rereleasing Blue Protocol with a new subtitle: Star Resonance. It's slated to release this year on Steam, the Epic Games Store, and on mobile devices, with cross-play and cross-progression between platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">Though Blue Protocol: Star Resonance is now confirmed for a Western release, it still doesn't have an exact release date. The original Blue Protocol was originally slated to release on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 as well as PC, but at least for now, Star Resonance appears to be on PC and mobile only.</p><p dir="ltr">Blue Protocol: Star Resonance has actually been playable in beta form in China, and playtesters have already reported quite a number of changes from Bandai Namco's version. The game still features an anime-aesthetic, but its visuals are now closer to the look of something like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/genshin-impact/" data-ref-id="5000-500614">Genshin Impact</a>. Players have also reported significant combat changes and updates to Blue Protocol's various progression systems, as well as new classes. While it will feature some of the gacha mechanics games like Genshin Impact are known for, they will be relegated to cosmetic items like costumes and weapon skins.</p>

			<p>After the release date for Stellar Blade on PC was <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-accidentally-reveals-stellar-blades-pc-release-date/">accidentally</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-accidentally-reveals-stellar-blades-pc-release-date/">leaked by PlayStation earlier this week</a>, we now have the official announcement that PC players will be able to help Eve defend Earth on June 11, 2025.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/15/stellar-blade-launches-june-11-on-pc-specs-and-features-revealed/">PlayStation Blog post</a>, Shift Up's chief technical officer and Stellar Blade's technical director, DongKi Lee, walks players through the announcement and many of the features PC players will be able to enjoy. Features that were already spoiled by the trailer dropping earlier than it should have this past Monday.</p>
<p><iframe title="Stellar Blade - PC Features Trailer | PC Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pex7jW3Tqwo?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>What wasn't spoiled by the trailer, however, was the minimum and recommended technical specs for PC players.</p>
<p>For the minimum, average performance of a 1080p resolution at 60fps, with graphics preset to 'Low,' Shift Up says you need to have at least an Intel Core i5-7600K or an AMD Ryzen 5 1600X CPU, paired with either an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 or an AMD Radeon RX 580 GPU, and 16GB of RAM.</p>
<p>For a recommended experience of the graphics set to 'Medium,' with Stellar Blade running at a 1440p resolution and 60fps, Shift Up says you should have an Intel Core i5-8400 or an AMD Ryzen 5 3600X CPU, paired with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 Super or an AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT GPU.</p>
<p>Recommended GPUs are the only change in the chart as the specs move from 'Recommended' to 'Very High.'</p>

About $10 a month since the cheapest plan without ads is $18. To put that in perspective, Reinhard said people on the ad-supported tier watch about 41 hours of Netflix a month, which would include roughly three hours of ads. </p><p>Starting sometime in 2026, however, at least some of those ads will be AI-generated and interrupting the middle of your latest <em>Squid Game</em>&nbsp;or <em>Stranger Things</em> binge-session, rather than being just at the beginning before a show starts streaming.

In the show’s first season she would have been around 16 years old and hanging around the senate. But according to Gilroy, the idea just didn’t work. </p><p>“There were some conversations early on, there was much to be made. This is in the sketching stage,” said Gilroy. “This is in the really soggy beginning, trying to figure out what to do because trying to figure out, I was trying to make that Investiture Week idea,” he said, referring to an idea for a storyline involving Leia and Mon Mothma during a period of celebration around the senate. “I was trying to get the most out of that investiture week and those parties, and we have Alden’s party now… and we’re making a thing out of it. And we were trying to find out on the timeline where she would be in the Senate.”</p><p>“There were some nutrients for a scene between her and Mothma that if she was going there at 16 and Mothma had gone to the Senate when she was 16, there was some basic cool things for a scene, but it never got past that, and it never went to the casting stage, or it never got more real than that,” confirmed Gilroy. </p><p> “I remember talking to [Lucasfilm’s] Kathy [Kennedy] about it and talking to Pablo [Hidalgo] about it, but it never got traction, and then it became a distraction.” </p><p>While I know some people might be sad that we didn’t get a Leia cameo, I think Gilroy was right to realize it would have been a distraction. This story didn’t need to have Leia pop up for a cameo and overshadow everything else happening. I still think that a moment between a young Leia and Mothma in the senate could be cool, but that’s something I’d rather read about in a <em>Star Wars</em> novel or comic.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the statement, the company confirmed that such a data breach had taken place, but reassured users that “as of May 12, we have not confirmed the leak of any user personal information or player account information due to the unauthorized access.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The company is currently working with outside experts to investigate and confirm the cause of the breach and determine exactly what data was leaked.

So far, the Game Key-Card route seems a common choice among third-party game developers with games planned for the Switch 2.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/next-generation-xbox-arm/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Next-generation Xbox products may be based on the ARM/Snapdragon platform, a new job listing spotted online suggests.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/job-listing-hints-at-next-generation-xbox-to-be-arm-snapdragon-based.1190199/">ResetERA forums</a>, a <a href="https://jobs.abven.com/companies/nuvia/jobs/50821791-director-sales-surface" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Qualcomm job ad</a> for a director of sales that was posted online two days ago mentions that the position will involve supporting the <em>"sell-in activities for the next generation of Surface and Xbox products built on Snapdragon solutions,</em>" suggesting that the ARM/Snapdragon platform will power one or more offerings of the next generation of console by Microsoft. Given how the platform would provide great benefits in terms of power efficiency, it's likely that the yet-to-be-revealed Xbox handheld will be the next generation product that will be based on it, though it could create quite a few problems with compatibility with currently available games built with the x86 architecture that has powers the Xbox One and the Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Xbox-Qualcomm.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Microsoft has yet to officially outline its next-generation plans, although there's no doubt that a handheld system will be part of it, as Xbox head Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-once-again-teased-by-phil-spencer/">teased</a> such a system multiple times in the past. According to an earlier report, these <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-release-2027-premium-handheld/">next-generation Xbox plans</a> include not only this yet-to-be-announced full-fledged handheld but also a successor to the Xbox Series X as well as another <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-project-kennan-is-reportedly-being-made-by-asus/">handheld gaming system </a>known as Project Kennan in the vein of the Steam Deck that will run Windows and feature an interface reminiscent of Microsoft's other systems. This handheld, which should launch this year, is reportedly being worked on in collaboration with ASUS.</p>
<p>With the Nintendo Switch 2 poised to become another <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-to-sell-100m-units-by-end-of-2029-is-the-most-important-console-launch-ever-says-dfc/">massively successful console</a>, it's not surprising that both Microsoft and Sony are planning to enter, or re-enter, in Sony's case, the handheld market. A <a href="https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-ps5-games-patch/">PlayStation 6 handheld system</a> is rumored to be in the works alongside a home system that will be able to run PlayStation 5 games natively, though it won't be as powerful as the current generation console.</p>

You know what got announced a little over three years ago now? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-hearts-4-announced-and-some-think-its-hinting-at-a-star-wars-crossover">Kingdom Hearts 4</a>.

If you said <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts-4">Kingdom Hearts 4</a>, you don't win anything because the direction of this bit was pretty obvious. The game still doesn't have a new trailer, by the way, but the series' official Blue Sky account did oh so generously offer up a handful of screenshots today which do show off some new bits (mostly).

In terms of the screenshots themselves, there's best boy Sora in his real-world look skating along some chains in a city, with some Heartless-like enemies beneath him. There's Strelitzia, the girl you would have seen in the first trailer, and a character that will mean absolutely nothing to you if you haven't played the mobile game. There's a couple more shots of Sora just… standing around. All in all, there's two actually notable screenshots.
</p>
<p>
One is the fact that you get to play as Mickey Mouse again, who's cheekily hanging out on top of a chandelier in a library. This'll likely be Scala ad Caelum, the last world you visit in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts-iii">Kingdom Hearts 3</a>, as Mr. Michael Mouse was sent there at the end of Melody of Memory (that's right, even the rhythm game has important cutscenes).
</p>
<p>
The other screenshot, interestingly, is of an old rotary phone. A few people believe this might be something akin to a <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/what-are-wind-phones-and-how-do-they-help-with-grief-180985113/">wind phone</a>. These are often disconnected rotary phones found in the middle of nowhere, where people have one-way conversations with a loved one that's passed on. The trend of using them started in Japan too, and considering what happens to Sora at the end of Kingdom Hearts 3, I'm inclined to buy into this one.
</p>
<p>
If you're wondering why Square Enix showed off these new screenshots on a random Wednesday in May, it'll likely be to do with the fact the developer cancelled the series' next entry Missing Link <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-hearts-missing-link-mobile-game-cancelled-but-its-not-all-bad-news-as-square-enix-teases-it-is-hard-at-work-on-kingdom-hearts-4">just yesterday</a>. This one was set to be a Pokemon Go-like mobile <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> where you could make your own character. I imagine this cancellation has something to do with Square Enix's multiplatform plan they established last year, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-reiterates-plans-for-quality-over-quantity-and-multiformat-games-going-forward/">a point it doubled down on during its latest financial results</a>.
</p>
<p>
Any which way, I'll take a JPEG of a rotary phone and Mickey Mouse over silence. Thanks Nomura/ Square Enix's social team who probably stressed that they needed something to placate people!

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-need-for-gta-6%E2%80%99s-success-is-a-symptom-of-a-broken-industry.1190286/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-games-industry<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imagine, for a moment, that you can see the future, and it is one where <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> is a massive flop. Maybe it's a technical disaster. Maybe it doesn't connect with anyone. Maybe industry rumors about a $100 price tag are true and, in the economic picture of summer 2026, that's just not tenable for anyone. Does that seem absurd? Perhaps it shouldn't.&nbsp;</p><p>This is not about rooting for the game to fail, or hating on a game that no one has played yet. Rather, this is about perspective, and a sober assessment of an industry entirely in the thrall of a single release.&nbsp;</p><p>The first week of May has been instructive here. On Friday, May 2, Rockstar Games triggered the video game industry's Great Exhale: Announcing <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, previously scheduled to release in 2025, <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/258aa538o412ok/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-now-coming-may-26-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will now arrive May 26, 2026</a>. The fallout was immediate: Shares for Rockstar's publisher Take-Two Interactive <a href="https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ttwo-stock-take-two-gta-6-game-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took a dive</a>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjew84ev3yyo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mainstream news outlets</a> <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/02/tech/gta-6-release-delayed-may-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published reports</a>, and YouTubers began uploading in earnest. The following Tuesday, Rockstar released the second trailer for <em>GTA 6</em>, along with <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the first detailed descriptions</a> of the game's plot and characters.&nbsp;</p><p>As early looks go, the trailer is quite impressive and admirably restrained. <em>GTA 6</em>, by virtue of Rockstar's stature and reputation for tremendously expensive, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/10/the-making-of-rockstar-games-red-dead-redemption-2.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">painstakingly detailed video games</a>, is expected to look and sound like nothing else on the market, achieving a level of verisimilitude that most developers can only dream of. The trailer is also effectively meaningless, divulging nothing about what it's like to play <em>GTA 6</em>. That's fine, par for the course, even. Mostly, it serves to prop up the business of anticipating <em>GTA 6</em>, which is almost more important than the game itself.&nbsp;</p><p>Right now, as you read this, countless people are writing very diligently about <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, a game that will not arrive for another year. They are not doing this for you. They are doing it for the algorithm. The algorithm has wants and needs more important than yours, because the algorithm is what determines what Google surfaces and what it buries, whether a publication will get enough clicks to justify its existence or a YouTuber enough views to fund the next video. In a very real sense, the reader barely matters, or at least not as much as the algorithmic black box that determines whether or not the reader knows a video or article even exists.&nbsp;</p><p>This is why, prior to May 2, you could read many thousands of words and watch hundreds of hours of content about <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, even though everyone more or less had access to the same amount of public information: just <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231204993583/en/Rockstar-Games-Announces-Grand-Theft-Auto-VI-Coming-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a brief press release</a> accompanied by a single 90-second trailer released in December 2023. Many more words and hours of video will spin up in the wake of this second trailer, long after the shallow well of concrete analysis has run dry.&nbsp;</p><p>The byzantine logic that governs discoverability – on Google, on YouTube, on any number of social media platforms – changes all the time, but one of the best ways to game the system in your favor is to prime it. The machine doesn't know to regard a content creator as a <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> authority if that creator does not have an established track record of creating <em>Grand Theft Auto </em>content. So: If you <em>want</em> the algorithm to notice and prefer you when <em>GTA 6</em> <em>does</em> arrive, you'd better start making content <em>yesterday</em>. Then, when Rockstar finally deems the game ready for release, you will be better positioned to reap the views you desire for your coverage of the actual game,&nbsp; justifying all that pre-content you diligently produced.</p><p>In a way, this is familiar. While games media is no longer the sole purview of enthusiast outlets, that culture still emerges in coverage of the biggest games. It's fun to speculate, after all, and the informed speculation of a journalist with expertise can also debunk the more egregious tall tales spun by shameless clout-chasers. Unfortunately, the algorithmic unmaking of digital media has turned many of us into shameless clout-chasers.</p><p>This is why the success of <em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>feels like an inevitable fact: Everyone who makes a living covering games, from the dwindling number of digital media outlets to the most popular YouTubers, needs it to be, which creates the perception that it <em>will</em> be. And if the media is that invested in <em>GTA</em>, because they have to be, then what chance does any other game have? As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/grand-theft-auto/the-specter-of-a-gta-6-delay-haunts-the-games-industry-some-companies-are-going-to-tank-if-they-guess-wrong-says-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC Gamers' Tyler Wilde</a> noted earlier this year, weathering <em>GTA 6'</em>s arrival – or, more importantly, calling its bluff and predicting May's delay – would be central to the survival of developers big and small.&nbsp;</p><p>Journalistic and business thinking converge here, in <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/marathon-switch-2-very-serious-business-analysis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ways they should not</a>. It is unwise in the former to treat anything as a foregone conclusion, but quite sensible in the business world to exude confidence, even if it appears foolish. The party that stands to benefit the most from <em>GTA 6</em> being “good” is Rockstar; for the rest of us, no one wants to miss any potential windfall should&nbsp;video games' most dispassionate titan repeat its previous, astonishing successes. But the way that success trickles down has less to do with the game itself and more with the game as a media singularity, impossible to obtain perspective on.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, it's worth stressing: Games outlets and content creators are not dependent on <em>GTA</em>-related content, but rather the massive boost <em>GTA 6's</em> eventual release will bring them, which is not quite the same thing. Everyone, in other words, is preparing for a feeding frenzy, a bout of gluttony that will continue until diminishing returns demand a retreat back to business as usual. How long that spree will last is anyone's guess – Rockstar has kept people on the <em>GTA </em>treadmill through extensive support of <em>GTA 5</em>'s online component, <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em>. <em>GTA Online </em>is arguably the reason why 2013's <em>Grand Theft Auto 5</em> has remained a fixture on sales charts, such a tremendous success that it's reasonable to argue that whatever shape its follow-up takes might be more important to Rockstar's fortunes than <em>GTA 6</em>. Reports suggest that Rockstar is very interested in repeating the <em>GTA Online</em> phenomenon, and if they are correct, the <a href="https://digiday.com/media/rockstar-games-talks-with-top-metaverse-creators-with-an-eye-on-making-grand-theft-auto-the-next-creator-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scale might be tremendous</a>, a <em>Roblox</em>-style money-printer built on user-generated content.</p><p>Yet the event horizon here is <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, not whatever <em>GTA Online</em> successor will presumably follow it, no matter how instrumental it may be. And an industry where a single release can be so potentially destabilizing or galvanizing is irreparably broken. The press should not need to spend this much energy on one series, in a desperate bid to please the algorithm. Game developers should not have to plan their own releases around <em>GTA 6</em>; <em>GTA 6 </em>should not be able to dominate so much attention.&nbsp;</p><p>There is virtually no chance that any new release can become the next <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, and certainly not by simply being a video game. The money and time (and lack of investor pressure that comes with both) one would need to hire the talent and develop the tech to mount a challenge of comparable scale has all been hoovered up by the one percent of the games industry, the <em>Fortnite</em>s and <em>Roblox</em>es and gacha behemoths of the world. But <em>Fortnite</em> has become an ad platform and a machine for user generated content. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTMF6xEiAaY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reports have demonstrated</a> that the <em>Roblox</em> empire is built on exploiting its very young userbase, a practice that might finally face <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/sec-confirms-game-service-roblox-part-of-active-investigation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scrutiny from regulators</a>. And free-to-play gacha games are now elaborate enough to compete with the best console and PC games on offer, because they are full of ways to funnel players into gambling, and the longer you play, the more likely you are to make a habit of paying.</p><p>This is the new games industry, a greedier, more exploitative evolution of the one that existed when the last <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> was released. When you consider this, the all-encompassing fixation on <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> takes on a new lens: It is a fetish <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetishism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the religious sense</a>, an object of power by which a world that no longer exists might return, if only for a little while. Expensive consoles, with few exclusive releases to justify their technical power, will have a game that will make owning one – or finally buying a new one – feel "worth it." Writers and creators working in the media ecosystem of guides and updates and takes will get outrageous numbers to send to their bosses, to make a case for their value, to prove their jobs are worth it. Gaming, as a hobby, will once again generate headlines for how much money the industry can make in such a brief amount of time, proving once again to the rest of the world that the medium is worth it.&nbsp;</p><p>And if <em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>can't pull that off, then nothing can, and we're all just wasting our time.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hbo-max-warner"><h3>HBO, Which Was Always HBO, Is HBO Again</h3></a><p>If I owned HBO I would just tell everyone I owned HBO, but I guess I'm built different</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sour-patch-kids-flavor-rankings"><h3>Sour Patch Kids, Ranked</h3></a><p>An objectively correct ranking of Sour Patch Kids and various Sour Patch Kids-flavored things</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/thunderbolts-marvel-avengers-cube-escape-room"><h3>Thunderbolts* Could Have Been Marvel’s Cube</h3></a><p>It could have been an escape room movie starring Florence Pugh, but we got New Avengers instead

            <p>
The internet is currently driving to Canada via Google Maps, and I'm along for the ride. 
</p>
<p>
This is <a href="https://neal.fun/internet-roadtrip/">Internet Roadtrip, the next browser-based creation from Infinite Craft developer Neal Agarwal</a>, which launched last week and has since picked up momentum.
</p>
<p>
1610 so-called "drivers" are currently online, traversing the highways of New England via images from Google Streetview that update every 10 seconds. Just as with internet phenomenon <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> Plays Pokémon, viewers can collectively vote to determine which direction the car heads next.
</p>
<p>
Internet Roadtrip launched with its car initially placed upon the streets of Boston - there's a handy map to show the virtual vehicle's full journey to date - but after a brief foray to the city's southern suburbs it has been driven north ever since. 
</p>
<p>
Eight days later and Internet Roadtrip is now enjoying a slow drive north through the picturesque state of Maine, and there's currently discussion in its chat feed about stopping off at the tourist hotspot of Bar Harbor (which, to be fair, is lovely this time of year).
</p>
<p>
In a brilliant turn of events, Internet Roadtrip's journey through Maine has caught the attention of a local student-run radio station (WBOR), which spent some time curating songs to be picked up on the in-game FM radio.
</p>

</span></p><p>
Just as with Twitch Plays Pokémon, there's a fun community building in the chat - and a general consensus that the vehicle is headed north of the US border to Canada. Will it get there? And where will it go next? I'll be keeping an eye.
</p>
<p>For now, viewers are having fun remarking on some of the grandiose place names Maine features for some of its tiny rural towns. Travelling from state capital Augusta up to the border you can pass through Calais, Cambridge, China, Denmark, Lebanon, Madrid, Mexico and Moscow. As I write this, Internet Roadtrip is currently in South China, Maine.</p>
<p>
"What a pleasure to be able to peer into others' imaginations like this," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/infinite-craft-is-a-powerful-glimpse-into-other-minds">Christian Donlan wrote of Agarwhal's brilliant creation Infinite Craft</a> upon its launch last year. "It really does feel like a chance to see how your friends' brains truly work."

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s seven-year development journey might officially be at an end thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-last-ever-major-update-gets-a-long-awaited-release-date">April's final major update</a>, but Larian is still loitering around to hammer out the last few wrinkles. That brings us to its newly released Hotfix #31, which, among other things, excises some bits of "defunct dialogue" from an abandoned Minthara storyline inadvertently restored in Patch 8.
</p>
<p>
Baldur's Gate 3 fans have, of course, had fun eking out scraps of unused content over the years, curious to know what else Larian might have at one time planned. And studio boss Swen Vincke has even joined in on occasion, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-would-have-originally-let-you-recruit-a-major-villain">revealing cut locations and plans to allow players to recruit a prominent villain</a>. In 2023, for instance, the community <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z8WXh0qr7c">uncovered unused voice lines</a> referencing Minthara having a child (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/baldurs-gate/baldurs-gate-3s-latest-hotfix-quietly-removes-artifacts-of-a-cut-storyline-never-meant-to-be-heard/">PC Gamer</a>), which brings us full circle back today.
</p>
<p>
Footage <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BG3/comments/1k3jlf6/minthara_does_have_a_daughter_new_patch_8/">captured by fans prior to Hotfix #31</a> reveals some related dialogue - specifically a line about Minthara finding a "home for myself and my child" during her Speak with Dead scene - managed to sneak back into Baldur's Gate 3 as part of Patch 8's release. But as Larian states in its <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1086940">latest patch notes</a>, these potentially baffling bits of "defunct dialogue" are now no more.

<p>
Beyond that particular curiosity, Baldur's Gate 3's Hotfix #31 is, as expected, entirely focused on bug fixes, tidying up some annoyances relating to crashes and performance, subclasses, gameplay and scripting, photo mode, plus tool tips and UI.
</p>
<p>
As for what Larian is doing next now Baldur's Gate 3 is mostly all wrapped up, we still don't know. Vincke recently revealed the studio is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-boss-says-studio-didnt-do-dlc-because-it-was-the-boring-option">currently "deep in the trenches" of a "crazy ambitious" project</a> described as its "next big thing" - one of two projects it's currently working on. That doesn't mean we won't see more <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a>, however. Larian <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">definitely won't be involved</a>, but earlier this year Dungeons and Dragons owner Hasbro <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hasbro-wants-baldurs-gate-4-but-isnt-in-a-hurry">confirmed it's "very interested" in a new series instalment</a>, even if it's not in a hurry.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ea-is-pushing-its-employees-back-into-the-office-remote-hiring-to-be-sunset/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA is pushing its developers back into the office and phasing out its remote work policies, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-pushes-full-return-to-office-effectively-ends-remote-hiring">IGN</a> reports.</p>
<p>Electronic Arts chief executive officer Andrew Wilson told employees in an email that hybrid work will now mean at least three days in the office, and that the company would not be hiring for any more locally remote roles.</p>
<p>In a separate email, EA Entertainment president Laura Miele clarified that these changes will not take effect immediately and that employees currently working remotely who are being asked back into the office will have a minimum of 12 weeks' notice to make the transition.</p>
<p>EA is also introducing a new 30-mile/48km radius around its offices, which will set the ground rules for what work model employees will fall under. If you live within that radius and currently work remotely, you'll transition to the newly defined hybrid model of three days a week in the office.</p>
<p>If you live outside of that radius, you'll continue to work as you are until EA designates that you have to transition either to a hybrid or an on-site model, the latter meaning you'd have to be in the office five days a week.</p>
<p>A final key change with this push back to in office work is that all future remote work hires and any exemptions to the hybrid or on-site models as they are now defined will have to go through the approval of EA's top executives, which means it'll be up to EA Entertainment president Laura Miele or Andrew Wilson to approve an employee's remote work request.</p>
<p>In Wilson's email, IGN reports he said that working in an office allows for "<em>a kinetic energy that fuels creativity, innovation, and connection, often resulting in unexpected breakthroughs that lead to incredible experiences for our players</em>."</p>
<p>That all sounds wonderful, but game studios proved, even before the COVID-19 pandemic, that remote work models can be successful for teams. The pandemic proved even further that the video game industry's biggest studios could be successful with remote work models. It's not like anything Wilson describes is exclusive to working in an office.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, EA employees are not all too happy with the push, and some who anonymously spoke to IGN expressed concerns around whether they'd be able to move closer to the office in the transition period, and how needing to return to the office, even just three days a week, means a complete uprooting of their lives.</p>
<p>These new changes will undoubtedly cause talented developers who, for their own valid reasons, can't make it into an EA office three times a week to leave the company. It's a way of making cuts that doesn't have to involve EA saying they are laying people off, and without having to pay severance to those who are forced to leave due to these changes. EA's balance sheet might be better off in the eyes of Wilson and the company's bean counters, but that gain does not offset the loss of key talent.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/">EA laid off 300-400 developers,</a> 100 of them from Respawn, and canceled another project it was incubating, which was reportedly an extraction shooter set in the world of Titanfall.</p>

Many are the minigames that threaten to be more entertaining than the games that host them, stealing the player’s attention like those flatworms that absorb snails from the inside. Tetra Master. Gwent. Fishing in any number of RPGs. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSSGZ9O8RX4">The flushable sinks in Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a>. Or how about Space Harrier, which has only ever existed as an arcade cabinet offering inside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yakuza-0">Yakuza 0</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, these minigames escape the host's body and achieve a standalone eistence. It’s not <em>entirely</em> true to say this of Dicealot, which is based on Farkle, a dice game you<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-how-to-play-dice"> may have played</a> inside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>.</p> <!--more-->
<p>For Farkle is actually a real medieval dice game from the 12th century, in which you roll six dice and score by achieving certain combinations. Dicealot takes a few liberties with the premise: it introduces a frame narrative in which Queen Gwynevere is trying to save a bewitched <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/king-arthur">King Arthur</a>, together with additional power and quest dice, acquired from mission to mission, that modify the basic rules. It’s a roguelite, in other words. I know, we haven’t played a lot of those lately. Here’s a trailer.

<p>
There’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3035330/Dicealot/">a demo on Steam</a> if you’d like to give it a whirl. I am keen on the presentation: it’s like an illuminated parchment and a cathode-ray TV had a baby, and the baby grew up and dabbled in art deco. 
</p>
<p>
The developers are Goodviewgames, who are based in based in Leeds and Bordeaux. I was born in Leeds and still have family in Yorkshire. I assure you that I discovered this after viewing and enjoying the trailer. Let it be known, developers and publishers, that you will not automatically earn my interest if you happen to be based in Leeds. Though if you do want to relocate there and host some studio visits, it’d mean I could see my dad more often. Ball's in your court.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/hunger-is-a-multiplayer-first-person-rpg-that-uses-an-extraction-loop-but-isnt-defined-by-it<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Extraction shooters are, at this point, a dime a dozen. And for my money, you’ve got to really do something different to stand out in that increasingly crowded genre. That’s why I was eager to meet up with a couple of developers from the team at Good Fun Corporation so they could show me Hunger, their upcoming zombie-tastic Unreal Engine 5-powered first-person action-RPG that utilizes an extraction loop. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, the developers specifically phrased it that way, as they seemingly aren’t looking to be thought of as just another extraction shooter. And in fairness to them, based on what I saw of an impressive early build (the team’s Early Access launch is still far enough away that they weren’t comfortable giving me an on-the-record release window quite yet), Hunger is going to be anything but another generic extraction shooter in the Steam pile.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hunger - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Two things about Hunger piqued my interest immediately: its visual aesthetic and its actual visuals. Starting with the former, game director Maximilian Rea described Hunger’s look as “Renaissance gothic,” which seems like a fair way to sum it up. As you can see in the videos and screenshots in this article, Hunger mixes first-gen firearms with brutal melee weapons inside of filthy lived-in towns and glorious castles. And then, in terms of raw graphics, the foliage, lighting, and texture detail are all absolutely stunning. This is easily one of the best uses of Unreal Engine 5 I’ve seen so far.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is easily one of the best uses of Unreal Engine 5 I’ve seen so far.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But, you might ask, how does it actually <em>play</em>? Sadly I can’t answer that quite yet, as my demo was just a hands-off first look, but it does seem built to last. In short, the team tells me, they’re aiming for the simplicity of ARC Raiders with the complexity of Escape From Tarkov. You begin in the Outer Ramparts, a social, violence-free hub within the Chateau where other players and NPCs alike roam. Like Destiny, you can switch to third-person perspective here if you like (though in proper combat, you’ll always be in first-person). Here you can shop with Piro, a quirky shopkeeper who wears a weird metal mask and offers items up for sale on a tray that’s worn around his neck as if he’s some cigarette girl from the 1920’s. Or you can add or remove items from your stash by checking in with Louis, the Stashmaster who also doles out the occasional quest. Reynauld, meanwhile, is the Expedition Master. He's missing parts of a couple fingers, indicating that he’s tussled with the zombies at least once, and talking to him queues you into an expedition (i.e. a raid).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The initial Early Access release will have three maps: Jacques Bridge, Sombre Forest, and Sarlat Farm. Each is one square kilometer, and each one has a big dungeon beneath it as well. Expect six weather varieties per map, including noon (clear), noon (fog), sunset, and sunrise. More dynamic stuff will be added post-release. Rea explained that they’re aiming for 50-60 hours of content here, and then you unlock the Cauldron, a new area of the Chateau. You will learn your profession there. There are six professions: three gathering (like Scavenging, which means you’re a purveyor of metals and materials; a Conservator who finds mechanisms and trinkets to make tools or guns; and the Naturalist, who gathers herbs and spices to make food, drinks, and medicine) and three crafting (examples here include Metallurgy, Gunsmithing, and Cooking). You can have two professions at a time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story of this map is that there was civil conflict when The End  – the bacteria that led to the Hunger – began. As you play, there's lore to find and extract with. Missives and Maps, as examples of this, are Common, Rare, or Legendary. And if you extract with a Missive you can read it back in the Chateau and get a quest's worth of XP, and once you’ve found everything you can read the whole story of the game. The developers also plan to tell the story through NPC dialogue. "We try to infuse every aspect of the game with story," Rea told me.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Hunger all have different qualities and aspects, which means that going melee-only has the advantage of letting you be silent. Shooting, on the other hand, makes noise and invites more Hunger. The Bloater, as an example of one such Hunger, is a blob-like thing that explodes into a cloud of poisonous gas. Shambler hits, meanwhile, cause bleed damage.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Going melee-only has the advantage of letting you be silent. Shooting, on the other hand, makes noise and invites more Hunger.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a whopping 33 weapons between melee and ranged, from daggers, pistols, and rifles to maces and primitive machine guns. You can find exotic ammo for the guns that add additional damage effects to the bullets. And yes, there will be dedicated PvP experiences if you need to scratch that itch. Furthermore, there's a Mastery Tree, and as you level up from 10-100 you get a mastery point. This includes four trees: Physiology, Survival, Martial, and Cunning, and the developers hope this ensures there are multiple ways to progress through the game besides PvP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, you can play solo or in duos if you want as well. "Being a solo or duo player isn't a death sentence,” Rea said. “In fact it's one of the quickest ways to progress in the game." You'll also unlock progression cosmetics as well when you level up, kill bosses, etc. And yes, there are cosmetics for every weapon and bag.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hunger won’t be free-to-play, which hopefully helps ensure its design principles won’t be compromised by pay-to-win nonsense, and there definitely won’t be any battle passes. They did mention a “Support the Developers” edition that would include extra cosmetics for whatever it ends up priced at above the $30 the team is aiming for on the standard edition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As to how long a session might last, Rea suggested that the low end of an expedition might be 30-35 minutes, hopefully ensuring that Hunger is an easy game to jump in for a little while with at night with friends, and then go to bed feeling accomplished and not feeling guilty for having hopped off of some live-service hamster wheel. If and when you die, everything you do contributes to XP gains, so the goal is for you to never have a pointless session. "If they've played for an hour, we want them to feel like they've meaningfully moved the ball forward for their character," Rea said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hunger might still be a ways away, but from what I’ve already seen, it looks like the team – who also made Hell Let Loose – is cooking up something unique and worth keeping an eye on. We’ll have more on Hunger on IGN as development progresses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

One of the first major idle games, Cookie Clicker originally released on the web in 2013 before hitting Steam in 2021. The title, developed by DashNet, is coming to PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2</a> (though of course at a later date).</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/cookie-clicker-switch/">Nintendo's listing</a> for Cookie Clicker notes that the game will cost $5. This is in line with the Steam edition of the idle game. Playsaurus is promising more than 600 upgrades in Cookie Clicker, as well as the ability to "pet your dragon."

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5-the-phantom-x">Persona 5: The Phantom X</a>, the spin-off mobile and PC game, now has a global release date.</p>
<p>As revealed in a livestream today, the free-to-play game will release globally on 26th June and will be available across iOS, Android and PC via Steam.</p>
<p>Pre-registration across all platforms is available from today and system requirements have been revealed, both on the <a href="https://persona5x.com/">game's official website</a>.</p>

<p>Persona 5: The Phantom X is the next game in the Persona series, which has now collectively sold 22m copies. It's been co-developed by Chinese studio Perfect World, Atlus and Sega.</p>
<p>The spin-off was first revealed back in 2023 and has already had an open beta in China. It was unclear, until this week, whether a global release was on the cards. It's now received various improvements "to meet the needs of RPG fans in Japan, turning it into a game with a lot of polish to it", as stated during the livestream.</p>
<p>The team also wanted to ensure it met western standards before announcing a release. As it was first developed in Chinese, it needed to be localised into Japanese before moving to the English language version. And as the game is a live-service, it will require simultaneous updates across the globe.</p>
<p>Indeed, the livestream began with a typically stylish anime sequence, as has become standard for the series.</p>
<p>The release date was then revealed in a new trailer, combining cinematics with gameplay. You can expect the usual mix of social interactions, city and dungeon exploration, and turn-based combat, to give an authentic Persona experience.</p>
<p>Typically Persona games take place over a school year, but with this live-service version players will experience the world in real time. It features a new protagonist (codenamed Wonder) and his owl companion who becomes a Phantom Thief by night as he's plagued by mysterious visions from the Metaverse and must restore the stolen desires of the population.</p>
<p>The livestream also introduced other characters: popular fellow student Motoha Arai, awkward student Shun Kano, and the intellectual student Riko Tanemura.</p>
<p>The game will include Phantom Idols who act like Confidants alongside the protagonist in the Metaverse and are created in the Velvet Room. The stream showed a handful of these Idols, who were all new characters from P5X and each have their own backstory.</p>
<p>It follows two previous spin-off games from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5">Persona 5</a>: hack and slash sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5-strikers">Persona 5 Strikers</a> and strategy game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/persona-5-tactica">Persona 5 Tactica</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tribe-nine-shutdown</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/free-to-play-action-rpg-tribe-nine-announces-shutdown-three-months-after-launch.1190175/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tribe-nine-shutdown<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Akatsuki Games has announced that its free-to-play "brutal action RPG"&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine&nbsp;</em>will be ending service, and the announcement comes just a few months after the game's initial release.</p>

<p>Following in the footsteps of other Japanese mobile-focused games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-brave-exvius-shutting-down" rel="nofollow">Final Fantasy Brave Exvius</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-reincarnation-shutting-down" rel="nofollow"><em>Nier Reincarnation</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine&nbsp;</em>will be shutting down in November, according to a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2376580/view/500572747038983820" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the game's official Steam page.</p>

<p>In the post, Akatsuki Games says that the decision to shut down&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine&nbsp;</em>was taken after "careful consideration". The studio doesn't provide any more specific reason for the game's closure, but it does say that its development team worked hard to "provide excellent service and improve player experience".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tribe-nine-shutdown-announcement-combat.jpg?itok=bXDb1nxp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tribe-nine-shutdown-announcement-combat.jpg?itok=pCndJ3lj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tribe Nine&nbsp;</em>is shutting down less than a year after its launch.</figcaption></figure><p>This isn't a gentle closure, either; in addition to the game's shutdown, Akatsuki says it won't be updating&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine&nbsp;</em>with its planned fourth chapter, apologizing for the "sudden nature" of the announcement.</p>

<p>Not only that, but all "new features, adjustments, and known-issue fixes previously announced" won't be implemented, so&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine&nbsp;</em>will remain in its current state until November.</p>

<p>Additionally, new characters Ichinosuke Akiba and Saizo Akiba, who were both due to debut as part of&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine</em>'s roadmap, will be canned, and any Paid Enigma Entities you've used in the game will be fully refunded. Naturally, in-game shop items won't be available to buy for real money either.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine&nbsp;</em>is, it's the flagship video game of an intended multimedia franchise masterminded by Akatsuki Games and Kazutaka Kodaka's Too Kyo Games, which is also responsible for&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tribe-nine-shutdown-announcement-warning.jpg?itok=-g4cl_Fm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tribe-nine-shutdown-announcement-warning.jpg?itok=hwcJmLqa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tribe Nine&nbsp;</em>will remain in its current state until shutdown in November.</figcaption></figure><p>Too Kyo Games is currently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-ps5-xbox-unlikely" rel="nofollow">struggling with its financial situation</a> following the release of&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line</em>, and while that's not given as a reason for&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine</em>'s shutdown, it probably won't help matters either.</p>

<p>In any case, you can still play&nbsp;<em>Tribe Nine&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2376580/TRIBE_NINE/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and mobile devices for the time being. The game will shut down on November 27th.</p>
