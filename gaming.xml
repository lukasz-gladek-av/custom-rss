                <p>Modern gamers who have fully embraced digital gaming may believe that the titles they've purchased will belong to them in perpetuity. But if anyone is hoping to pass on their Steam backlog to their next of kin, it turns out that Valve doesn't allow the rights to be transferred. In other words, your Steam library dies with you.</p><p>Via <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/after-you-die-your-steam-games-will-be-stuck-in-legal-limbo/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ars Technica</a>, a user on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/to-anyone-who-is-curious-no-you-cannot-transfer-your-steam-account-via-a-will-you-can-only-take-your-games-to-your-graves.875634/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ResetEra</a> posted a reply that they received from Steam support regarding their question about passing on their Steam library through a will. "Unfortunately, Steam accounts and games are non-transferable," replied a representative from Valve. "Steam Support can't provide someone else with access to the account or merge its contents with another account. I regret to inform you that your Steam account cannot be transferred via a will."</p><p>Some gamers have put a considerable amount of money into their Steam libraries, and it may be disheartening to hear that those games could simply be gone following the death of the Steam account owner. However, the easiest workaround may be to simply pass on the username and login info to potential heirs without informing Steam. The thorny issue of who really owns the digital games would remain, but at least the titles would still be playable.</p><p>An additional way to preserve Steam games is to pass down any computers that already have the titles downloaded. However, without access to the original Steam account, those games wouldn't be available for installation on a different device or even accessible for reinstallation on the computer they're currently on in the event of a hard-drive crash or other system failure. For that reason alone, this may not be an optimal solution. But until Valve offers users a better way to pass on their games, there aren't many other options available.</p>

        <p>Publisher was awarded $14.4 million in damages</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Activision has won a lawsuit against cheats manufacturer EngineOwning.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/activision-wins-14-4m-judgment-against-call-of-duty-cheat-vendor/">VentureBeat</a>, the publisher was awarded $14.4 million in damages and $292,912 in legal fees granted by the United States District Court of the Central District of California.</p>
<p>The court also issued an injunction to the Germany-based website, and ruled that the domain name must be transferred to Activision.</p>
<p>EngineOwning provides and sells cheats for Call of Duty, in addition to other titles including Counter-Strike, Battlefield, and Titanfall.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/activision-files-lawsuit-against-cheat-provider">initially filed in January 2022</a>, in which Activision argued that cheats provided by the website caused "massive and irreparable damage to its goodwill and reputation and to lose substantial revenue."</p>

        <p>Latest entry in Activision's flagship franchise will be available via subscription service at launch</p>

    </div>


  

    

</header>  <div>



            <p>Microsoft has confirmed this year's Call of Duty will launch on Xbox Game Pass alongside its retail and digital versions.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/28/play-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-game-pass/">Xbox Wire post</a> added that players will be able to pre-install Black Ops 6 when it launches later this year. The game will be officially revealed during the Xbox Games Showcase on June 9, which runs during Summer Game Fest.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-microsoft-to-add-next-call-of-duty-title-to-game-pass">Reports earlier this month</a> suggested the new Call of Duty would be added day-and-date to Game Pass, with <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1795385251306324292">The Verge's Tom Warren</a> reporting yesterday that the subscription service's app let slip the confirmation ahead of the official announcement.</p>
<p>Microsoft is gradually bringing Activision titles to Game Pass following the completion of its acquisition last year, banking on the publisher's portfolio to boost the subscription service.</p>
<p>The first such launch was Diablo 4 in March, with the platform holder's latest financials revealing it was played for ten million hours within the first ten days, making it <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-and-diablo-boost-microsofts-gaming-revenues-but-xbox-sales-continue-to-fall#:~:text=played%20for%20ten%20million%20hours%20within%20the%20first%20ten%20days%20of%20being%20on%20the%20service%2C%20making%20it%20one%20of%20the%20biggest%20first%2Dparty%20launches%20since%20the%20subscription%20service%20began">one of the biggest first-party launches for Game Pass</a> since the service launched in 2017.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be the first Activison Blizzard title to launch day-and-date on Game Pass, a practice Microsoft has implemented with all of its internally developed titles since the subscription began.</p>
<p>Opinion is divided on the impact the inclusion of Call of Duty in Game Pass will have on developers. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/so-microsoft-now-owns-activision-blizzard-how-will-this-affect-the-rest-of-the-industry#:~:text=%22If%20you%20can%20get%20the%20new%20COD%20for%20%27free%27%2C%20why%20should%20you%20try%20out%20the%20next%20indie%20gem%3F%22">Speaking to GamesIndustry.biz</a> shortly after the Activision acquisition, The Last Worker director JÃ¶rg Tittel argued that having access to the shooter would dissuade subscribers from trying out indie games, while No More Robots founder Mike Rose suggested it may boost the exposure of indie games included in the service.</p>
<p>While the acquisition was being <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsofts-acquisition-of-activision-blizzard-whats-going-on-and-what-happens-next">scrutinised by regulators</a>, there were concerns that Microsoft would not only launch Call of Duty simultaneously on Game Pass but also withhold it from other platforms in order to grow the subscription service.</p>
<p>However, Microsoft has made a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-nintendo-sign-ten-year-call-of-duty-deal-more-xbox-games-to-follow">binding agreement with Sony to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation</a> for the next ten years, with a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-nintendo-sign-ten-year-call-of-duty-deal-more-xbox-games-to-follow">similar agreement in place for Nintendo</a>.</p>

            <p>
MultiVersus welcomed over 100,000 Steam brawlers on its relaunch, but new character restrictions have left a bad taste in the mouth of players.
</p>
<p>
The multi-franchise Warner Bros. fighter re-released last night across PC, Xbox and PlayStation, following the end of its open beta last year. On <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1818750/charts/">Steam</a>, it recorded a concurrent player peak of 114,515 in the last 24 hours.
</p>
<p>
However, despite some fairly impressive numbers, the free-to-play brawler has come under fire from the community for a number of reasons, with the main issue being new character restrictions.

</figure>
<p>
MultiVersus players have found themselves blocked from using the full roster when playing locally, as well when accessing the training mode. While on the MultiVersus <a href="https://multiversus.com/en/faq">website</a>, developer Player First Games states "All characters can eventually be earned through gameplay", these restrictions are <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1818750/discussions/0/4331979056057264963/">different from how it worked during the beta</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"It used to be the case that you could play any character for local play, and I've been having a blast playing with my siblings all year, but now that the game is out, the characters you can select are only the ones you've officially unlocked," reads one thread on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiVersusTheGame/comments/1d2lxzt/character_restrictions_for_local_play_is_a_major/">reddit</a>. "I mean, I know why they did it (money), but I'm really disappointed by this new edition and my hype has been officially killed."
</p>
<p>
"This is going to actually lose them money in the long run because now people won't invite their friends over to play local matches," another user replied. "Fighting game tournaments will be far less likely to host this game. It's only day one and they're already bottlenecking the amount of people that will see the game."
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="740"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiVersusTheGame/comments/1d2lxzt/character_restrictions_for_local_play_is_a_major/">Character restrictions for local play is a major disappointment</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/EricDubYuh/">u/EricDubYuh</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiVersusTheGame/">MultiVersusTheGame</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

Currently, players can unlock new MultiVersus characters by purchasing them with Gleamium (the in-game premium currency) or with Fighter Currency. Both Gleamium and Fighter Currency can be earned through events and grinding, but Gleamium can also be acquired with real-world money. Some characters are unlocked by completing challenges, and there are a handful of characters available to play without purchasing them.
</p>
<p>
A number of players have subsequently reasoned MultiVersus is a free-to-play game, and needs to generate revenue somehow, and therefore they don't see a problem with the new restrictions. However, others feel locking characters even in training mode is an especially low blow. Many argued this is when players could take a 'try before you buy' approach to fighters.

Other <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiVersusTheGame/comments/1d2tccz/everything_that_changed_for_the_worse_from_the/">quibbles</a> on MultiVersus' relaunch have included reports the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1818750/MultiVersus/#app_reviews_hash">now feels "slow and clunky to play"</a>, the camera zooms in far too often, lag, and "no more battle pass XP after every match".
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has reached out to Warner Bros. for further comment on the aforementioned change.

            <p>A producer on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kerbal-space-program-2">Kerbal Space Program 2</a> has confirmed that those working on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space flight sim</a> are being laid off en masse. We already knew that the developers at Intercept Games would be losing their jobs thanks to a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/kerbal-space-program-2-feared-cancelled-as-70-layoffs-reported-at-take-twos-seattle-offices">closure announcement from Washington State</a>. Until remarks from Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Take-Two Interactive, muddied the waters. Zelnick refused to acknowledge that the studio was being closed when asked by a reporter, even going so far as to claim the opposite. "We didn't shutter those studios," he <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-on-intercept-roll7-we-didnt-shutter-those-studios">told IGN</a>. But it seems clear from one producer's testimony that Zelnick's remarks are inaccurate. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The team at Intercept Games will be laid off as of June 28th so a great group will be out and about looking for their new roles. As will I," said senior design manager Quinn Duffy in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/quinn-duffy_well-here-we-go-again-the-team-at-intercept-activity-7201280703215394816-uyzd/">a post on LinkedIn</a>. Duffy has been working at the studio in its final months.</p>
<p>"I got to know the designers pretty well in my all-too-brief time there," he said. "These are some fantastically smart and talented people and I'm happy to vouch for their qualities."</p>
<p>Intercept Games was not the only studio to be affected by Take-Two's decision to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-publishers-take-two-cancel-games-and-lay-off-hundreds-to-rationalize-their-pipeline">"rationalize"</a> hundreds of people out of their livelihoods. Roll7, the creators of OlliOlli World and Rollerdrome, are also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skateboarding-studio-roll7-is-reportedly-being-closed-down-by-parent-company-take-two">reportedly being completely closed</a>. We've asked folks at Roll7 and Intercept Games for comment to clarify Zelnick's remarks, but so far no word. </p>
<p>To those affected the reality appears obvious. The studios are being closed. So why doesn't the CEO admit as much? Jason Schreier of the Washington Post points out that Take-Two <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1791221924636270950">behaved in a similar way with 2K Marin</a>, a studio they shut down in 2013. Although that studio has not been operating for 11 years, executives have never admitted to closing the studio in plain language. </p>
<p>It's hard to know what Zelnick (or his PR people) are thinking when they commit to inscrutable language that seems to defy reality. It is possible that, since the process of closure is ongoing, there are legal reasons (or tax reasons (or both)) behind the reluctance to state clear facts. </p>
<p>To close a limited company in the UK in the most simple (and cheapest) way is known as "striking off", and costs as little as Â£10. However, one condition is that the company needs to have assets less than Â£25,000. Otherwise you need to go through a "liquidation" process, which can cost a lot more. Since it takes time to offload assets and get affairs in order, it's possible Zelnick has been advised not to confirm any closures explicitly yet, even though notice has been served to staff. It is also possible that company names like Intercept or Roll7 are being treated as resources in themselves. In other words, the corporation may not want to close the studios in the legal sense, but instead leave them dormant on paper. Like that bit in Indiana Jones were the US government stacks the Ark of the Covenant away into a vast stockpile of looted perils. </p>
<p>But I don't know. This is all thoughts-out-loud. I'm not an accountant or a corporate lawyer. Nor do I have any inside knowledge about Take Two's practices when it comes to auto-cannibalising and absorbing the life force of its child companies. Nevertheless, we've reached out to them for comment too.</p>

			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro has been reportedly ready for release since last year, but the console's launch may have been delayed to coincide with big game releases.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of the Broken Silicon podcast, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">Moore's Law is Dead</a> briefly commented on the upcoming mid-generation hardware refresh from Sony, saying that, at some point, the console was unlikely to be released. Work continued, however, and the system's final silicon was completed and ready for release last year.</p>
<p>As for why the PlayStation 5 Pro, Moore's Law is Dead believes Sony wants its launch to coincide with the release of big games that could better showcase the system's power, such as Grand Theft Auto 6. This definitely makes a lot of sense, considering the latest entry in the series by Rockstar Games is only releasing on current generation consoles, and it is likely going to be a huge system seller, and Sony is not launching any big game this year.</p>

<p>Very little is currently known about the PlayStation 5 Pro, and everything we do know comes from reports and rumors that have yet to be officially confirmed. From what we know about its specs, we should expect <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-cpu-boost-performance-40-fps/">more stable 40 FPS modes</a> thanks to the modest CPU upgrade may lead to more stable 40 FPS modes and better-looking games using dynamic resolution scaling thanks to the 45% faster GPU.&nbsp;The system will also support the PlayStation Super Spectral Resolution upscaler, which will eventually support up to <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-45-faster-base-ps5/">8K resolutions </a>and considerably better ray tracing performance over the base model.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro has yet to be officially announced. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/steam-clip-recording/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Valve is still actively working on Steam clip recording, according to SteamDB creator and dataminer Pavel Djundik.</p>
<p>That's what Djundik <a href="https://x.com/thexpaw/status/1795720970742993331?t=I7f9ujVS1G9IMdUpQarxbw&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on X some hours ago. Apparently, the Steam feature will allow users to share clips via the Steam community in a similar fashion as screenshots. Steam users can already take in-game screenshots by pressing the F12 key in games that run the Steam Overlay. Players can then share these screenshots with a player's Steam community. In addition, players can share the shots on social media. This feature was made available back in 2011 after a short beta period. Currently, Steam users have 1GB of cloud space per user account. This space is used for the aforementioned screenshots, game settings, save games, profile stats, and more.</p>
<p>Clip recording is said to offer support for background recording. In addition, the clip recording feature is said to offer timeline markers in supported titles for various in-game events. A comparable feature is already available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox, where the console automatically records a clip whenever achievements unlock. On X, Djundik<a href="https://x.com/thexpaw/status/1795720973809033332" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> also shared</a> some additional screenshots of this feature, which we've included below.</p>
<figure>

<p>At the moment, Steam users need to make use of Microsoft's Game Bar record feature, third-party tools, or NVIDIA's and AMD's video capture tools in the GPU drivers. No additional details about the feature have been shared just yet. We'll update you as soon as we learn more.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts about this Steam clip recording feature? Would you be using it? Hit the comments below.</p>

Activision is awarded $14,465,600 in statutory damages and $292,912 in attorneysâ fees, and the court issued a permanent injunction to enjoin EngineOwningâs âunlawful conductâ and to transfer its domain name, www.EngineOwning.to, to Activision.</p><p>Activision successfully argued that EngineOwning continued to circumvent its security systems and sell the cheating software in violation of the The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). It called for the minimum statutory damages of $200 under the DMCA multiplied by the general approximation of the number of downloads of the cheating software in the United States (72,328), for a total of $14,465,600. The Court found the request âreasonableâ under the circumstances.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Live Action Reveal Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>In February 2023, a judge ruled that EngineOwning must pay Activision $3 million in damages after a lawsuit in which Activision claimed high-profile streamers used Warzone cheats. But EngineOwning continued its operation, selling cheats for 2023âs Call of Duty game <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-2023">Modern Warfare 3</a> as well as Warzone. Activision then continued its long-running battle with the cheat maker, resulting in this ruling.</p><p>There are now questions about whether Activision will see any of the money it is owed by EngineOwning, or its ability to claim ownership of the website. At the time of this articleâs publication, cheats and HWID spoofers remain available to buy from EngineOwning, which seemingly operates outside the U.S.</p><p>Of course, competitive multiplayer video games have endured a cheating problem for decades, and Call of Duty in particular is seen as having a cheating and hacking problem, most prominently on the free-to-download battle royale Warzone on PC. Activision and other video game publishers face an uphill battle in the war against cheat makers, but the Call of Duty company will be hoping rulings such as these act as a meaningful deterrent as it prepares to release <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a> later this year.</p><p>Overnight, Activision <a href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1795554591020642673" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> to say that all accounts found to have participated in any form of boosting behavior in Multiplayer or Warzone Ranked Play would have their SR reset and be removed from the Leaderboard ahead of the Season 4 launch. Activision continued: "Additionally, as previously announced, accounts that boosted their progression in Ranked Play will be permanently restricted from accessing Ranked Play modes in Modern Warfare 3 and Warzone."</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>A new earnings report from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/witcher-3-tips">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> makers CD Projekt Red has revealed that the follow-up to the sorceress-courting, Nekker-thwacking, horse-reassuring <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG </a>is currently being worked on by around 400 people, and plans to move into the production phase by the âsecond half of the year.â Elsewhere, the report shows that the studioâs previous RPG, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-walkthrough-hub-all-of-our-guides-in-one-handy-place">Cyberpunk 2077</a> officially ended all development at the end of April, at which time the remaining 17 staff still tweaking that gameâs ray-traced chewing gum foil moved on to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">Witcher 4</a> , or âPolarisâ, as they keep insisting it's called.</p>

<p>Hereâs a little graphy-graph below. Iâm sorry I just wrote that. I was trying to make the graph sound fun. Itâs on the page now. Thereâs nothing I can do about it.</p>

<p> An investors call was also made recently, in which joint CEO Piotr Karwowski spoke about the companyâs market strategy going forward. "I would actually not look at Cyberpunk as the guidebook of how it's going to be with The Witcher specifically," Karwowski said. He added that CD Projekt wonât go full steam ahead on marketing until something âactionable,â is available, such as preorders, via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-witcher/the-witcher-4-is-the-largest-game-in-development-at-cd-projekt-by-the-size-of-the-team-but-also-by-the-progress-of-ongoing-work/">PC Gamer</a>. You can come back to this article and call me a big doofus in a few years time if Iâm wrong, but I have to assume CD Projekt wonât make the same mistake twice, especially when it comes to golden greyboy Geralt.</p>
<p>If you fancy reading some of the best words on both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty </a>expansion this side of those nifty gaps in Keanu Reevesâ beard I promise Iâve never tried to replicate while shaving, our Graham has you covered. He reviewed both the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-review">original release </a>and its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review">chunky expac</a>, and also wrote about that expacâs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-new-ending-is-its-most-heartbreaking-and-worth-returning-for">heartbreaking ending</a> - a genuinely moving bit of storytelling that contained the sort of subtlety and reserve you may not have previously assumed the game was capable of, say I.</p>
<p>My own contribution to the conversation that Iâm sure everyone else has noticed by now but Iâve never read anywhere else is this: Did anyone else notice how the Grimes performance at Phantom Libertyâs party scene perfectly mirrors Songbirdâs story arc? It does! Itâs all there, told in expressive dance and lasers. Go watch it on YouTube if you missed it, assuming you still care enough about Cyberpunk easter eggs and/or Nic Reuben conjecture.</p>

			<p>Final Fantasy series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi's latest game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fantasian-the-new-jrpg-made-by-final-fantasy-creator-is-out-now-on-apple-arcade/">Fantasian</a>, could be making its way on other platforms very soon, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Earlier today, well-known leaker Midori <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1795720873913278921" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that a former Apple Arcade exclusive will soon be announced for multiple platforms without hinting at which game will make the jump. X/Twitter user Genki mentioned Hironobu Sakaguchi's Fantasian, and Midori's reply seems to suggest the unique JRPG by Mistwalker will be the one making the jump.</p>
<p>The Final Fantasy series creator's latest JRPG release on other platforms would be very welcome, but it wouldn't really be surprising.<a href="https://wccftech.com/hironobu-sakaguchi-is-open-to-bring-fantasian-to-pc/"> Last year</a>, Hironobu Sakaguchi mentioned during the MAGIC 2023 anime and game festival that he is aware of the demand for a PC version of the game and a sequel and that he is open to both. Hopefully, the time has come for more players to experience one of Mistwalker's most visually unique games.</p>
<p>Before releasing Fantasian, the development team headed by the creator of the Final Fantasy series released plenty of other JRPGs, including Lost Odyssey and Blue Dragon, both launched on Xbox 360 years ago. With rumors of next week's Xbox Showcase being interesting for fans of<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-showcase-360-era-jrpg/"> Xbox 360-era JRPGs</a> and Fantasian launching on other platforms, it seems like Mistwalker may be coming back into the JRPG spotlight very soon.</p>
<p>Fantasian is now available as part of the Apple Arcade service. We will let you know if the game is indeed releasing on other platforms as soon as an announcement is made, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/psvr-2-pc/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-is-certifying-an-adapter-to-bring-the-psvr2-to-pc.883599/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/psvr-2-pc/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>A new certification license has been found that could make the PSVR 2 headset compatible with PC sooner rather than later.</p>



<p>First found by Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1795734108058042709" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@SadlyItsBradley</a>, the new <a href="https://www.rra.go.kr/ko/license/A_b_popup.do?app_no=202417210000102053" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">certification license</a>, which happened on March 27, 2024, suggests that Sony could be thinking about changing its PSVR 2 strategy.</p>



<p>The new adapter could mean that players who own the headset or intend to buy one soon have access to a huge library of games on the PC. In early 2024, PlayStation announced that it is planning to add <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-planning-pc-support-for-psvr2-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC support for the PSVR2</a> system sometime in 2024.</p>



<p>The announcement read, âAlso, weâre pleased to share that we are currently testing the ability for PS VR2 players to access additional games on PC to offer even more game variety in addition to the PS VR2 titles available through PS5.â</p>



<p>In March 2023 and despite rumours suggesting that the headset was selling poorly, PlayStation announced that the headset sold around <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/psvr-2-is-outselling-the-psvr-sony-reports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">600,000 units in its first six weeks</a>. However, the headset has since seen a lack of post-launch support with new games since its release, with recent rumors suggesting that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-pauses-psvr2-production-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">company has paused production of the headset</a> due to poor sales.</p>



<p>One could speculate that the move to PC facilitates the lack of games on the companyâs hardware and if the rumors of production being paused are true, perhaps we could see a relaunch alongside the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-pro-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 Pro</a>, which is scheduled to release later this year. </p>



<p>What do you think of the PSVR 2 coming to PC? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

According to a <a href="https://www.rra.go.kr/ko/license/A_b_popup.do?app_no=202417210000102053">certification</a> discovered by <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1795734108058042709/photo/1">VR enthusiast Brad Lynch</a>, Sony has developed a PSVR 2 âadapterâ that provides PC support for the otherwise PS5-exclusive device.</p><p>Sony said that it was working on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/22/24079928/sony-psvr2-pc-support-2024">PC support for PSVR 2 in February</a>, targeting a non-specific 2024 release date, but the company hadnât previously mentioned what form this support would take. With the adapter certification being filed back on March 27th with South Koreaâs regulator, it seems Sony is on track to easily meet its self-imposed PC support deadline.&nbsp;</p><p>No other information about this mysterious adapter â including its price, appearance, or specified release date â is currently available. Weâve reached out to Sony to clarify and will update this story if we hear back.</p><p>Still, its existence should be a welcome bit of news for the modding community thatâs been attempting to get the PSVR 2 working on PC gaming rigs since the headset was launched in 2023. The $549.99 PSVR 2 went on sale for more than the PS5âs $499.99 launch price, making it a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/3/23439183/vr-virtual-reality-psvr2-playstation-meta-quest-pro-apple#:~:text=PSVR2%E2%80%99s%20%24549.99%20price%20is%20already%20high%2C%20but%20tack%20that%20on%20with%20the%20starting%20PS5%20price%20of%20%24399.99%20and%20it%20means%20the%20minimum%20cost%20to%20use%20PSVR2%20is%20%24950">controversial purchase</a> that should be usable beyond Sonyâs console.&nbsp;</p><p>Enabling PC support should eliminate one of the biggest deterrents keeping people away from the device.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/is-paletools-safe-to-use-in-ea-fc-24/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=is-paletools-safe-to-use-in-ea-fc-24<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="121" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Paletools is a handy tool to use for those who have invested a lot of time and energy in the <em>EA FC 24</em> Ultimate Team mode.</p> <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">The Ultimate Team offers a web app and a companion app (exclusively available on mobile devices). EA Sports has hardly innovated these tools despite critical feedback from many users. This is where a tool like Paletools comes in, but thereâs always a risk of using third-party applications. However, much of the fear around using this tool is more of a myth than a certified fact.</p>  <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="672" data-injectable="true">The web app is mainly used to solve different SBCs, open packs quickly, and buy/sell cards on the Ultimate Team market. Unfortunately, there are still plenty of limitations that affect its utility. For example, the method of completing SBCs in EAâs app isnât really optimum.</p>
 <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false">To remove these limitations, you can use the Paletools extension to automate a lot of these processes. While the official app canât disregard the positions of a card while <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-90-tots-player-pick-sbc-tasks-solutions/">completing SBCs</a>, the third-party extension can allow you to bypass that limitation. There are plenty of other great features like automated pack openings, removing animations from opening packs, and more.</p> <figure data-current-count="682" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>
  <p data-characters="154" data-current-count="154" data-injectable="false">Itâs a fact that no third-party extension is 100% safe, but the safety depends on how youâre using the tool. Two activities can get you a ban:</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="234" data-injectable="false"> <li>Using the market bot (can get a permanent ban and lose all Ultimate Team progress)</li> <li>Solving too many SBCs too quickly (can get temporary ban without losing any Ultimate Team progress)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="610" data-injectable="true">Do note that you can also get an SBC ban from using the official app. The best way to prevent that is to give a cap after solving a certain number of SBCs. I never use the market bot, and there hasnât been any problem in the last three months. I also take regular breaks from solving SBCs and havenât yet faced a temporary ban of any duration from completing them.</p>
  <p data-characters="144" data-current-count="144" data-injectable="false">Using this highly useful extension is extremely easy. First, youâll have to set it up, and I prefer using it on the Google Chrome browser.</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="264" data-injectable="false"> <li>Go to the official website.</li> <li>From the home screen, drag the URL link to a blank bookmark bar.</li> <li>Save the bookmark and refresh the web app.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="519" data-injectable="false">Do remember that a third-party app/tool will always have some danger, so take the risk of your free will. When used properly, a lot of your time and efforts will be saved, especially at times when so many <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-henrikh-mkhitaryan-tots-sbc-solutions-tasks/">TOTS SBCs</a> are available in <em>EA FC 24</em> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-renato-sanches-flashback-sbc-solutions/">Ultimate Team</a>.</p>

            <p>Well, itâs been a long hard road, but since I vowed to only consume alcohol matured while having game soundtracks forcibly blasted into its molecules, giving up drinking has been a lot easier. Now, to take the final gulp of my Snake Eater-theme-reared IPA, and open up my web browserâ¦.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Oh. Welp. Partyâs back on I suppose, because Japanese retailer Onkyo Direct <a href="https://onkyodirect.jp/shop/pages/WOTW.aspx">are selling</a> two varieties of official <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier-automata">Nier: Automata</a> wine, matured in barrels with speakers attached to them that exclusively pump out the character <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action games</a>â soundtrack. The two red wines - named 9S and 2B for Automataâs android heroes -  were each force-fed different playlists selected from the gameâs soundtrack. The wineâs retail at around $80 US a bottle, and each comes with an exclusive glass featuring a Lunar Tear design (thatâs a thing from the video game, Nier: Automata.) I really donât have too much else to add to this, aside from bringing its existence to your attention. However, upon learning of it, I am confident that you, too, will think: Yes, that is definitely a thing someone has done then put up for sale.</p>
<p>When I showed this to Edders, he immediately compared it to those <a href="https://www.up.ac.za/research-matters/news/post_3133767-moo-nlight-sonata-up-study-finds-that-cows-soothed-by-classical-music-produce-more-milk">cows they play classical music at to yield more milk</a>, although Iâm left both unsure and intrigued to exactly what effect the Automata music would have on wine. Naysayers among you will have already dismissed the whole thing as a marketing stunt, but I do believe the Nier soundtrack has some deep magic to it. For example, itâs very effective at making you treat incredibly hokey and surface-level allusions to undergrad philosophy as if theyâre mind-shattering layers of subtext. I mock because I love - Automata is a beautiful piece of work and Yoko Taro is the only person allowed to call a big robot âEngelsâ like it means something in my presence.</p>
<p>For those still clamouring for further adventures in the Taro-verse, Nier producer Yosuke Saito <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nier-will-continue-as-long-as-yoko-taro-lives-producer-says-but-dont-expect-an-automata-follow-up-soon">recently teased</a> that the team may be working on more Nier. âIâve been talking about wanting to do something with Yoko and Okabe for some time now,â said Saito. âIâll have something a bit more put-together to say in the not-too-distant future, so please stay tuned. It might be NieR, it might not be NieR. (Laughs.) Thatâs about all I can say for now.â Cheers for the wine spot, <a href="https://x.com/SpBrando/status/1795488188443881916">BrandoSP</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-vr2-official-pc-adapter-by-sony-is-being-certified/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>An official PlayStation VR2 PC adapter made by Sony Interactive Entertainment is being certified, <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1795734108058042709?ref_src" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to YouTuber Brad Lynch</a>, who found <a href="https://www.rra.go.kr/ko/license/A_b_popup.do?app_no=202417210000102053" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a listing</a> on the South Korean National Radio Research Agency (RRA).</p>
<p>Ever since the PlayStation VR2 headset was unveiled with its high-end capabilities, PC users have been eager to find a way to make it work on their favorite platform. In June 2023, the developer behind the driver that allowed the original PS VR headset to be used on PC <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-vr2-pc-hardware/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that the PS VR2's design meant additional hardware would be required to make it work. However, not long afterward, the same developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-vr2-on-pc-is-closer-now-that-6dof-tracking-has-been-fully-ported/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solved the hardware authentication problem</a> and fully ported 6DOF (six degrees of freedom) tracking.</p>
<p>Still, it was far from official support of PlayStation VR2 on PC. Sony would have had to change its stance for that to happen, which it did <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-vr2-official-pc-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this February</a>. In late March, the headset's latest firmware also <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-vr2-firmware-pc-connection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enabled PC access</a>, hinting at a direct connection. We've now received confirmation that this will occur through the official PC adapter mentioned above.</p>
<p>PlayStation VR 2 launched for Sony's PlayStation 5 console in February 2023. At the time, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-vr2-headset-one-cord-to-rule-them-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> by Kai Tatsumoto earned it an 8.5 out of 10 score:</p>
<p><em>Sonyâs PlayStation VR2 headset had a lot to prove to justify a cost higher than that of the base PlayStation 5 console needed to operate it. The hands-on test confirms that this is how next-gen should look and play in virtual reality with an experience unlike anything else in the HMD space. Every aspect of the first PlayStation VR has been improved (aside from Cinematic Mode largely remaining as is) with no expense spared for comfort and design. This is the sort of revolution in virtual reality that can showcase not just the experiences that are fun to play but also those that can take advantage of the next-generation consoleâs power. As new experiences are brought to PlayStation VR2, the value can only improve, but the initial cost of admission may leave some players wanting to take the headset for a test drive first before investing in something the price of a second PlayStation 5.</em></p>
<p>Despite glowing reviews, PS VR2 sales have been underwhelming, to say the least. Sony even <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-vr2-production-reportedly-paused-until-sony-sells-current-backlog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had to pause production</a> while it waited for the current backlog to be sold. They're clearly hoping that opening up PC support will increase sales, though it might be too late for that. Let us know how you feel about it in the comments.</p>

<p data-characters="243" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Cheating has been an issue in <em>Call of Duty</em> for a long time, especially affecting their free-to-play battle royale <em>Warzone</em>. Activision has landed a major blow in the war against hackers though, winning $14 million in damages from EngineOwning. </p> <p data-characters="389" data-current-count="389" data-injectable="false">Activision filed a suit against the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/activision-files-lawsuit-against-call-of-duty-cheat-site-engineowning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cheat providers in 2022</a> and on May 28, Central District of California Judge Michael Fitzgerald ordered EngineOwning to pay $14,465,200 to Activision in damages. The judge ruled that the company must pay $200 for every cheat that was downloaded, along with $290,000 in legal fines, and the handover of the EngineOwning domain, as shared by CharlieIntel. </p> <figure data-current-count="689" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>BREAKING: Activision has been granted default judgement in its court case against cheat provider EngineOwning. </p><p>Judge ruled EngineOwning owes Activision $14.45M in damages and $292,900 in legal fees. </p><p>Judge ruled EngineOwning website domain must be transferred to Activision. <a href="https://t.co/oWTbYygiZe">pic.twitter.com/oWTbYygiZe</a></p></div>â CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1795639002416271574?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 29, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false">The minutes of the judgment reveal that in the United States, cheats were downloaded from EngineOwning 72,328 times, which is a huge number. Itâs worth remembering that this only includes the U.S. too, and not worldwide sales of the cheats that the company provided. </p> <p data-characters="336" data-current-count="609" data-injectable="true">EngineOwning was best known for <em>Call of Duty</em> cheats, selling hacks that allowed players to use aimbots, see enemies through walls, and make changes to in-game lobbies. Cheating became an epidemic in <em>Warzone</em>, with players begging Activision to do something about it, eventually leading to the creation of the RICOCHET anti-cheat system. </p>
 <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="false">The system, along with Activisionâs pursuit of cheat providers, has helped to bring the number of hackers in <em>Warzone</em> down, although the unfortunate reality is that itâs almost impossible to wipe them out completely. Seeing the huge payout that EngineOwning has been ordered to pay in court, however, may be a big deterrent to other providers who think selling cheats is worth their time. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/29/samurai-warriors-4-dx-review-a-series-favourite-returns/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Itâs been almost a decade since the initial launch of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/samurai-warriors-4">Samurai Warriors 4,</a> which was quickly followed up by 3 spin-offs: <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/samurai-warriors-4-II">Samurai Warriors 4-II</a>, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/samurai-warriors-4-empires">Empires</a>, and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/samurai-warriors-spirit-of-sanada">Spirit of Sanada</a>. With the franchiseâs latest numbered instalment still in recent memory, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/koei-tecmo">Koei Tecmo</a> has decided to take a trip down memory lane with the newly-released Samurai Warriors 4 DX on PC via Steam.</p>
<p><iframe title="Samurai Warriors 4 DX - Steam Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/psEN_sukaCI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Itâs unclear why the Japanese publisher chose now to do this, possibly fuelled by the recent surge in popularity surrounding samurai media, and a need to plug a hole in its release calendar. After all, itâs been a while since we last had an update on whatâs happening with Koeiâs long-running Warriors series. It didnât seem all that long ago that hack nâ slash fans could reliably look forward to a new <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/dynasty-warriors">Dynasty Warriors</a> game every few years, with Samurai Warriors instalments comfortably sandwiched in between.</p>


<p>Regardless of its motives, Samurai Warriors 4 DX allows Koei Tecmo to showcase one of the seriesâ most popular offerings to a new audience of PC gamers. If this is somehow your first dalliance with these games, they follow a similar template that honestly hasnât changed too much since Dynasty Warriors 2 (known in Japan as Shin Sangoku Musou) first tore up the genre on PS2 back in 2000. Taking on the role of famed warriors from Japanâs Warring States period, youâll blitz through entire battlefields, annihilating enemies by the screenful as you bash out button combinations in an almost zen-like state.</p>


<p>Samurai Warriors 4 is fondly remembered for a number of reasons. Firstly, the game offered a playable roster of 55 characters each with their own unique movesets, and customisable weapons. It also offered a wider selection of story-driven missions, allowing you to watch events unfold from the perspective of certain clans and characters, including Nobunaga Oda and posterboy Yukimura Sanada.</p>
<p>In terms of gameplay, original developer Omega Force also made some welcome improvements starting with Hyper Attacks. These enabled players to seamlessly weave from one group of enemies into the next without breaking their combo chain, complemented by other mechanics such as the Spirit Gauge. Being able to switch between characters on the fly would also help manage the battlefield, with an option to assign command to your inactive partner. The game also felt more fleshed out than previous entries, bundling in the addictive Chronicles mode where you could create your own character and skirmish your way across Sengoku era Japan.</p>

<p>Samurai Warriors 4 DX presents itself as the definitive way to experience all of this, bolstered by an extensive catalogue of over 150 DLC packs. Granted, most of these are purely cosmetic and superfluous, though DX has another trump card: allowing for handheld play via the Steam Deck. The laid back, low-commitment style of gameplay these titles ascribe to goes hand-in-hand with portable gaming, unless youâre dialling up the difficulty to its most extreme.</p>
<p>If youâre at all curious about the Warriors franchise, this is perhaps the best gateway. However, with this re-release brandishing a Â£39.99 launch price, you might rather hunt down a cheaper copy of the newer Samurai Warriors 5, or wait for a cheeky discount.</p>

            <p>
Three-and-a-half years after its disastrous December 2020 debut, after dozens of patches and the launch of last year's Phantom Liberty expansion, CD Projekt Red no longer has anyone working on Cyberpunk 2077.
</p>
<p>
Just 17 people had been working on the game still as of 29th February this year, CD Projekt previously shared as part of their last financial update. Now, as of 30th April, that number is zero. 
</p>
<p>
It's a small but significant moment for CD Projekt as it finally leaves Cyberpunk 2077 behind - with the vast bulk of its development might now focused on its next game in The Witcher series, currently still codenamed Polaris.

<p>
But CD Projekt has several other projects in the works as well, of course, including a growing contingent (as of last month, 56 people) focused on a full-blown sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, currently codenamed Orion.
</p>
<p>
39 people, meanwhile, are working on The Witcher multiplayer spin-off codenamed Sirius, which is being primarily put together by internal studio The Molasses Flood.

<p>
Lastly, and most mysteriously, CD Projekt retains a team of 20 people working on its all-new franchise, codenamed Project Hadar. 
</p>
<p>
With no-one still assigned to Cyberpunk 2077, its now unclear whether the game will get any further tweaks or patches. But Cyberpunk 2077 is now in a strong state - and last month CD Projekt thanked fans as its game finally hit the milestone of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-director-thanks-fans-as-the-game-hits-a-95-positive-review-rating-on-steam">having a 95 percent positive rating on Steam</a>. It's also now one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/best-rpgs">our favourite RPGs to play right now</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-aims-to-increase-the-cadence-of-game-launches/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>CD Projekt RED reported the company's Q1 2024 financial results yesterday. The Polish company registered $57.89 million in consolidated revenues for the first quarter, while consolidated net profit came in at $25.50 million, a 44% improvement year-over-year. Most of those sales were driven by Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-has-sold-more-than-5-million-units-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already sold over 5 million units in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>CD Projekt RED also proudly boasted that, on May 10, recent user reviews on Steam for the Cyberpunk 2077 expansion surpassed 95% positive score, labeled 'Overwhelmingly Positive.' However, at the time of writing, this appears to have gone down to 90% - which is still great, of course.</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6IQvSCRU_Pc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ensuing earnings call</a>, CD Projekt RED Joint CEO MichaÅ Nowakowski confirmed the studio's goal to increase the cadence of game releases.</p>
<p><em>We already worked on two projects at the same time when we worked on Phantom Liberty because that was a game-sized project with almost 300 people working on it, and at the same time, we have already been working on Polaris, so we've had an experience of working on more than one project. And we are working on more than one project at this time as well. There is Cyberpunk 2 being developed in Boston, there is Polaris being developed predominantly here in Europe, and obviously, we have other projects with other teams like Project Sirius, also in Boston with The Molasses Flood.</em></p>
<p><em>And there is The Witcher 1 remake done in cooperation with Fool's Theory, so you can definitely expect us to release more titles and the cadence of launches is something we definitely plan to increase, although I will obviously not comment on what is the space between the projects time wise.</em></p>
<p>As always, CD Projekt RED also provided an update on how many developers are working on each project. 407 staff members are working on Polaris (The Witcher 4), 56 on Orion (Cyberpunk 2), 39 on Sirius (the spin-off), 20 on Hadar (the new intellectual property), 96 on 'shared services' (localization, quality assurance, data, insights and experiences, artificial intelligence), and 13 on other projects.</p>

		<p>Bungie have released the launch trailer for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/destiny-2-the-final-shape/">The Final Shape</a>, the last (?) large expansion for Destiny 2 which launches on June 4th 2024. The previous expansion, Lightfall, was not particularly good but it does look like Bungie are going to knock it out of the park for the end game, for the first time in a very long time I am actually excited to play!</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny 2: The Final Shape | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dZrxWFrd1zQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer teases a lot, most notably the âcubingâ of not just The Last City, but the entire of Earth and everyone on it. What this means for areas such as the Cosmodrome and the EDZ, and indeed characters who live there such as Shaxx and Ada, is unclear.</p>
<p>Further on we see Zavala being tempted by The Witness, Cade looking at his own dead body, and Crow finally going super and using Golden Gun. Thereâs also the Avengers Endgame moment with all the allies pouring through the triangular portal.</p>
<p>The Final Shape will not only bring the story to conclusion, there are massive changes coming to the game not least of which is a new Prismatic class.</p>

<p>âFor the first time, players will be able to wield the powers of Light and Darkness simultaneously, unlocking combinations of abilities never before possible,â<a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/prismatic_deep_dive"> say Bungie</a>.&nbsp; âThe Prismatic subclass is familiar, but with a twist. Your Super, melee, grenade, and Aspect slots will feature a selection of Light and Darkness abilities from all five damage types. You can also select from all available movement modes and class abilities, including the subclass-specific ones, such as Phoenix Dive, Acrobatâs Dodge, and Thruster. â</p>
<p>âOur main goal for Prismatic is to enable new and interesting buildcrafting combinations that lead to new types of gameplay, so that we can keep the game feeling fresh. As part of this, some of the abilities weâve chosen are ones that we think have been underused since their initial release and have exciting interactions with the rest of the roster. In many cases, weâve adjusted how certain Aspects function to specifically enable these unique interactions.â</p>
<p>Destiny 2 will be going offline for a whopping 25 hours before the Final Shape launches which is on&nbsp;June 4, 2024 and will be available for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

			<p>The rumored announcement of the God of War Ragnarok PC port is imminent, according to a reputable leaker.</p>
<p>On X, known deals leaker 'Billbil-kun' <a href="https://twitter.com/billbil_kun/status/1795562998196560063" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reiterated</a> that Sony and Santa Monica Studio will be announcing the PC version of the God of War sequel "very soon". Unfortunately, the leaker can't specify an exact date just yet. Earlier this month, the leaker <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> that 2022's God of Ragnarok would be the next former PlayStation exclusive to be ported to PC. In addition, it was claimed that the announcement could very well be made this month.</p>
<p>Take this information with a pinch of salt for now, but 'Billbil-kun' has been spot on when it comes to leaking upcoming new PS Plus and Game Pass titles. In addition, the leaker has proven to be reliable when it comes to leaking unannounced titles as well - last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mortal-kombat-1-is-the-series-next-installment-coming-to-pc-ps5-xsx-and-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the leaker correctly leaked Mortal Kombat 1</a>.</p>
<p>God of War Ragnarok was released for PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 back in November of 2022. Last year, the game received the excellent free Valhalla expansion. Here's what we wrote about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-valhalla-facing-the-past/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expansion in our review last year</a>:</p>
<p><em>For a free expansion, God of War Ragnarok: Valhalla offers quite a lot. The roguelite take on the base game's formula works extremely well, thanks to the excellent combat system, which truly shines in the extreme combat scenarios Kratos will have to conquer to confront his past and finally make a step towards the future. Its short length, which prevents the adventure from overstaying its welcome, and excellent accessibility with multiple difficulty settings that don't lock content behind them, also make the expansion one that all those who loved the base game should play.</em></p>
<p>Would you play God of War Ragnarok on PC or would you rather have Sony port another PlayStation title to PC first? Hit the comments below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/intercept-games-lay-offs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Following cost-cutting measures by Take-Two Interactive, the CEO of the firm, Strauss Zelnick, denied that Intercept Games â the developer behind Kerbal Space Program 2 â had closed down. However, he refused to comment on whether Take-Two Interactive <strong>would </strong>shut down Intercept Games â among other studios.  </p>



<p>Now, posts on social media have surfaced claiming that the team at Intercept Games will be made redundant as of June 28, 2024. Weeks ago, <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1791236904580436176/photo/2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg obtained documentation</a> showing that Take-Two was proposing the closure of the Roll7 studio â but these notes didnât mention Intercept.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-here-we-go-again">âHere We Go Againâ</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7201280703215394816/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post on LinkedIn</a>, Interceptâs Quinn Duffy posted the following:</p>



<p><em>âWell, here we go again.<p>The team at Intercept Games will be laid off as of June 28th so a great group will be out and about looking for their new roles. As will I.</p><p>I got to know the designers pretty well in my all-too-brief time there. These are some fantastically smart and talented people and Iâm happy to vouch for their qualities. And I can say the same about the other disciplines â good folks across the board.</p><p>Kerbal Space Program 2 is a delightful game, deeply engrossing, and incredibly pretty even in its early-access state and I hope you have a chance to check it out.â</p></em></p>



<p>In 2020, Take-Two Interactive opened Intercept Games in Seattle, Washington. The team was tasked with assuming the development of Kerbal Space Program 2, which has since been review-bombed on Steam following the news of the studio closure. It boasts a recent review rating of âOverwhelmingly Negativeâ with most comments referring to the laying off of the team by Take-Two Interactive.</p>



<p>This is the latest in a long line of shutdowns in the industry that have led to almost 20,000 workers being made redundant since the start of 2023.</p>

<p>In an all-new financial report, CD Projekt revealed that development on Cyberpunk 2077 has officially ended. In the last report, published in February, there were just 17 developers left supporting the title â and now, that number has diminished completely. More than 400 developers are working on âPolarisâ, the next game in The Witcher series, and 56 are occupied with Orion, the sequel to Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-end-of-an-era">End of an Era</h2>



<p>Cyberpunk 2077 was released in 2020 to an overwhelmingly negative reception. It was such a failed game at launch that investors pursued legal action against CD Projekt Red. Then, amid a huge and ongoing expenditure, Cyberpunk 2077 was pulled out of the gutter by the team, and hundreds of millions of dollars turned it around for the better. By the time Phantom Liberty was released in 2023 (the gameâs only expansion), Cyberpunk had come to be regarded as one of the most iconic rags-to-riches stories in gaming history.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/pl/wp-content/uploads-pl/2024/05/prezentacja-wynikowa-grupy-cd-projekt-q1-2024-en.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent financial report</a> published by CDR confirmed that not a single developer is left working on Cyberpunk 2077. This is the first time in over a decade that nobody is supporting the game at CDPR. </p>



<p>Cyberpunk 2077 ended life on a high. It won a BAFTA Award for the âBest Evolving Gameâ and secured a whopping 95% positivity rating on Steam, a remarkable number by all accounts â especially when little more than two years ago, the game boasted around a 50% positivity rating.</p>



<p>We can now look forward to whatâs coming next from CD Projekt.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/engineowning-must-pay-activision-15-million-and-surrender-domain.883527/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/engineowning-activision-court-case/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Last year, Activision Blizzard saw success in the courts, with EngineOwning â arguably the most prolific cheat provider in gaming â being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-2-cheaters-banned/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ordered to pay</a> a whopping $3 million in damages. This case concerned both Overwatch and Call of Duty, but it wasnât the end of the debacle as AB refused to relent. </p>



<p>Now, a judge has ruled that EngineOwning owes Activision Blizzard around $15 million in damages and legal fees, based on the platformâs constant (successful) attempts to circumvent ABâs anti-cheat systems. Not only that but the court also ruled that the EngineOwning domain must be surrendered to Activision Blizzard.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-crime-doesn-t-pay">Crime Doesnât Pay</h2>



<p>In this lengthy fight between EngineOwning and Activision Blizzard, thousands of gamers were named and revealed as having used EngineOwningâs cheat software. This included a slew of content creators who were effectively besmirched by the lawsuit â and their malicious activities.</p>



<p>It was claimed in the final documentation from the court case that, in the United States, EngineOwningâs software was downloaded 72,328 times. The court therefore found it âreasonableâ that AB sought such a high sum in damages. It was later revealed that attorney fees alone amounted to $292,912. </p>



<p>For years, EngineOwning has provided cheat solutions for Call of Duty, Counter-Strike, Battlefield, and Titanfall â amongst other games. The company also offered a hardware ID spoofer, which circumvents one of the core functions of anti-cheat software, particularly the high-end solutions that can enact âhardware bansâ against cheaters.</p>



<p>Ultimately, this wonât do much to slow down these malicious operators, as the video game cheating market is like a multi-headed hydra â but itâs certainly a solid blow.</p>

			<p>Sonyâs <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/28/get-ready-days-of-play-celebration-kicks-off-on-may-29/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">âDays of Playâ celebration</a> kicks off tomorrow, and as part of that, theyâre adding a bunch of new titles to <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/ps-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Plus</a>, including a number of âbonusâ titles for Extra/Premium subscribers on top of the regular collection of games that will be added later on in June. First up, there are the standard monthly PS Plus Essential titles for June, which include SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake, AEW Fight Forever, and more. Hereâs a rundown of the monthly Essential titles, which will be added on June 4.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpsplus25.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><em><strong>SpongeBob Squarepants: The Cosmic Shake</strong> (PS4, PS5)</em></p>
<p><em>âWish-granting Mermaidâs Tears in the hands of SpongeBob and Patrickâ¦ What could go wrong? Sure, the very fabric holding the universe together could come undone, opening portals into wild Wishworlds. But thatâs nothing our favorite sponge canât handle- with the right cosmic costume!â</em></p>
<p><em><strong>AEW Fight Forever</strong> (PS4, PS5)</em></p>
<p><em>From Wccftechâs review â âLike the promotion itâs based on, AEW: Fight Forever can be a bit rough around the edges, but the game is also a welcome breath of fresh air. Fun, approachable in-ring action and an endearingly-quirky career mode largely make up for scruffy visuals and some missing content. AEW: Fight Forever wonât be for everyone, but if youâre looking for an alternative, feel free to push your chips All In.â</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Streets of Rage 4 (</strong>PS4, PS5)</em></p>
<p><em>From Wccftechâs review â âStreets of Rage 4 doesnât reinvent the wheel, but honestly, thatâs okay. The gameâs dazzling visuals, silky-smooth action, varied level design, and sexy sense of cool more than make up for a few minor old-school irritations. Veteran Bare Knuckle brawlers will get the most out of Streets of Rage 4, but it should provide a satisfying thumb workout for players from all eras.â</em></p>
<p>Meanwhile, here are the âbonusâ titles available to PS Plus Extra and Premium membersâ¦</p>
<p><em><strong>PS Plus Extra</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Dredge (PS4, PS5) May 29</em></li>
<li><em>Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2 (PS4) May 31</em></li>
<li><em>Cricket 24 (PS4, PS5) June 5</em></li>
<li><em>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas â The Definitive Edition (PS4, PS5) June 7</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>PS Plus Premium Classics</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Tomb Raider Legend (PS2) June 11</em></li>
<li><em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars (PS2) June 11</em></li>
<li><em>Sly Cooper and the Thievius Raccoonus (PS2) June 11</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>PS Plus Premium PS VR2 Games</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Ghostbusters: Rise of the Ghost Lord â June 6</em></li>
<li><em>Walkabout Mini Golf â June 6</em></li>
<li><em>Synth Riders â June 6</em></li>
<li><em>Before Your Eyes - June 6</em></li>
<li><em>The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners Chapters 1 &amp; 2 â June 6</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Sony now offers three tiers of PS Plus â Essential, Extra, and Premium.&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-prices-increasing-all-tiers-september-2023-ps-plus-essential-saints-row/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The price for all three tiers have gone up</a>&nbsp;for those subscribing for a year, but the monthly cost hasnât changed. You can&nbsp;<a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/ps-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explore the games available via each tier and sign up here</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the PS Plus games above, Days of Play, with various promotions and activities, kicks off tomorrow (May 29) and runs until June 12.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-sim-4s-summer-of-love-continues-this-week-with-riviera-retreat-and-cozy-bistro-kit-dlc.883440/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sim-4s-summer-of-love-continues-with-riviera-retreat-and-cozy-bistro-kit-dlc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
The Sims 4, you might recall, is currently embarking on a sexy "summer of love" - which, so far, has mainly involved <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-is-getting-ready-for-a-summer-of-sexy-updates-starting-with-swimsuits">some new swimsuits</a>. Now, though, EA has <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/cozy-bistro-and-riviera-retreat-kits">revealed</a> the next two items on its vaguely saucy list: the Riviera Retreat and Cozy Bistro Kit DLC, both arriving on 30th May.
</p>
<p>
First up, for those summery sunny days of relaxation and shameless undress, is the Riviera Retreat - a "secluded oasis" incorporating "stucco textures, beautiful archways, and shimmering waterfalls with comfortable linen furniture, wicker lounge chairs, and vine-covered pergolas."
</p>
<p>
This one's all about creating an "ambience of serenity and connection" for your Sims, says EA, whether reclining and rejuvenating alone or together with a smooching pal.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
As for the Cozy Bistro Kit, expect a DLC of charming "old world" streets and "hole-in-the-wall" noshing ("hole-in-the-wall" apparently being a US term for an easily overlooked establishment in case you were wondering - which I definitely was).

<p>
"With welcoming awnings, classic furniture settings, and its inviting atmosphere," explains EA, "this beloved bistro is sure to become a neighbourhood favourite." It promises amenities that can be used in a bar or lounge lot, alongside building items including tall etched glass windows and doors, polished metal accents, bistro tables and chairs, plus vintage wall decor.
</p>
<p>
The Sims 4's Riviera Retreat and Cozy Bistro Kits launch for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC (via Steam, the EA App, and Epic Games Store) this Thursday 30th May, where they'll likely cost Â£4.99/$4.99 apiece. EA says it's also adding two new builds utilising each pack - the The Cozy Bistro and Riviera Retreat Poolhouse - to The Sims 4's in-game gallery on the same day.

                <p>RPG fans who haven't picked up Star Ocean: The Second Story R are in luck. The beautiful reimagining of the classic 1998 role-playing game is on sale for an awesome price. The remake gives the beloved entry in the series a modern touch; it's an adventure that deftly bridges the gap between past and future. The Second Story R has only received a couple discounts since launching last holiday, and the current $35 price matches the all-time low--which sold out quickly at this price last time. This deal is available for Nintendo Switch, PS5, and PS4 versions of the game at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8WC4ZX7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D24348%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fproducts%2Fstar-ocean-the-second-story-r---nintendo-switch%2F20006770-6c0948f1.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fstar-ocean-the-second-story-r-discounted-to-best-price-yet-at-amazon%2F1100-6522045%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GameStop</a>.</p><p>Similar to the Octopath Traveler games, Star Ocean: The Second Story R was entirely remade to be both faithful to the source material while incorporating modern elements into its design. The game makes use of 2D pixel art character sprites and places them in retro-styled 3D environments, with the final result being looking like a 4K PlayStation One game. It's a mesmerizing effect that <em>shouldn't </em>work this well but has to be seen in action.</p><p>The game also features both English and Japanese voice acting, a newly arranged soundtrack, and a high degree of replayability. Alongside several tweaks and quality-of-life changes, it strikes an ideal balance between staying faithful to the original game and giving it a welcome update for the current era.</p><p>"Star Ocean: The Second Story R is a remake that manages to not only have the retro feel of its older PS1 and PSP incarnations, but also make it feel fresh with new battle mechanics, as well as audio and visuals updates. It may not be the big break thatâll finally make the Star Ocean franchise explode in popularity, but itâs a fine Japanese RPG on its own terms," George Yang wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/star-ocean-the-second-story-r-review-back-to-the-future/1900-6418147/" data-ref-id="1900-6418147">Star Ocean: The Second Story R review</a>.</p><p>Star Ocean: The Second Story R isn't the only Square Enix game on sale for an all-time best price.

                <p>Official Xbox Wireless Controllers are awesome as is, but if you want a little more versatility without breaking the bank, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3FGJ6FB?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Horizon Vista Strikepack from Collective Minds</a> is a quick and easy way to enhance your device. The detachable gadget is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3FGJ6FB?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">available to preorder for $50 at Amazon</a> ahead of its June 3 release.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309085-strikepack.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4309085" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309085-strikepack.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4309085"></a><figcaption>Collective Minds Strikepack - Horizon Vista M.O.D.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4309085-strikepack.jpg"></figure><p>This is revitalized and updated version of previous Strikepacks, and the layout for the Horizon Vista model remains the same. What you're getting here is four programmable back buttons that can be bolted onto your controller through the battery pack, creating a fairly seamless appearance. You can still connect a USB-C cable for wired gaming and charging and a dedicated app allows you to tinker with each button to a high degree. Using the dedicated mobile app, you can set your own combos and do some more fine-tuning, making this a pretty versatile device.</p><p>The Strikepack is pretty cool since it allows you to keep using your existing Xbox controllers, but it's far from the only customizable controller option out there. Our top pick is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elite-2-Controller-Black-Xbox-One/dp/B07SFKTLZM?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Elite Series 2</a>, Microsoft's premium wireless controller that offers awesome customization features and swappable components.

It has swappabl sticks (offset and aligned layouts), comes with a fight pad module with six microswitch buttons, an interchangeable D-pad, stick caps, and stick gates. On top of that, a smartphone app allows for even more fine-tuning under the plastic hood.</p><p>On the budget side of customizable controllers, 8BitDo has released a couple of solid options: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Controller-Xbox-One-Joysticks-Officially/dp/B0CWLGNCBD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8BitDo-Wired-Controller-Xbox-Windows-x/dp/B07P5K93ZN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pro 2</a>, both of which retail for $45. There's also an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1VHH4C5?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">upcoming 8BitDo controller for Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One</a>, although this one comes with a few caveats on console and is perhaps even better suited for PC gamers. While this controller features the high build quality and flexibility of other 8BitDo Ultimate devices, you can only use it in wired mode with the included detachable USB-C cable on Xbox consoles. PC users can sync the controller using 2.4GHz wireless or Bluetooth, sidestepping those console shortcomings.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mad-max-5-film-limited-edition-4k-collection-and-furiosa-steelbook-up-for-preorder/1100-6523703/">Mad Max 5-Film Limited Edition 4K Collection And Furiosa Steelbook Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cuphead-delicious-last-course-art-book-has-never-before-seen-content-limited-edition-up-for-preorder/1100-6523733/">Cuphead Delicious Last Course Art Book Has Never-Before-Seen Content, Limited Edition Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-preorder-guide-ps5-xbox-series-x/1100-6523506/">Walmart Has An Exclusive Edition For EA Sports College Football 25</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (4)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-nintendo-switch-preorder-guide/1100-6521751/">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door Preorders - Release-Day Delivery Still Available</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-over-60-on-12-months-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-with-targets-limited-time-deal/1100-6523230/">Save Over $60 On 12 Months Of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate With Target's Limited-Time Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-preorder-guide-nintendo-switch/1100-6523267/">Nintendo World Championships Deluxe Set Preorders Are Only Available At Select Retailers</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-portal-restock-guide/1100-6520876/">PlayStation Portal Is Back In Stock At Multiple Major Retailers</a></li>   </ul> </div>
