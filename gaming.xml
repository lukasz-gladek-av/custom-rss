            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/19/powerwash-simulator-2-gets-a-funky-new-gameplay-trailer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Futurlab has shared a new gameplay trailer for their spick-and-span sequel <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/powerwash-simulator-2">PowerWash Simulator 2</a>. The game is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC in late 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="PowerWash Simulator 2: Official Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-rLMus-sx1I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer showed off a bunch of the tools you’re using to tidy up Muckingham, from your standard powerwasher to a buffing thingy, new elevated platforms, isolated powerwashing jobs for pianos and rugs, and plenty more. It ended off with the new cat companion, Ulysses, who you can pet and take with you on every job. Cute!</p>
<p>But there’s more! PowerWash Simulator 2 will have multi-stage jobs, home case customisation, and even some mysteries to uncover around Muckingham.</p>
<p>We loved the original Powerwash Simulator, awarding it an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/22/powerwash-simulator-review/">8/10 for its original version</a>, and 9/10 for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/13/powerwash-simulator-vr-review/">excellent VR rendition</a>. Talking about the original we said, “PowerWash Simulator is a rare example of a game that more than lives up to its expectations. If the calming loop of the gameplay gets you then you’ll easily find hours of your life disappearing along with the dirt and grime. Add in some interesting challenge modes and a story that caught me by surprise and you have a game that more than deserves your time”. We then called the VR version, “the ultimate evolution of Futurlab’s astoundingly satisfying smash hit, effortlessly translating the calming clean ’em up to virtual reality.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-zelda-totk-autobuild-sharing-exploit-lets-you-summon-an-army-of-ganondorf-and-epona<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Ganondorf face collage" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/103f98688c570/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-ganondorf-face-collage.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>You know what would make <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> much easier? A herd of Epona. In terms of making it harder? How about multiple Ganondorfs? Well, you can have all that and more thanks to an exploit discovered by the TOTK community. (Thanks <a href="https://gamingreinvented.com/feature/what-happens-if-you-send-glitched-items-to-zelda-notes/">GamingReinvented</a>!).</p>
<p>With the new Zelda Notes companion app (compatible only with the Switch 2 Edition), it's possible to share Autobuild creations by uploading them to the app in-game, which then creates a QR code that you can share online. When someone scans that code in and uploads it to the game, voila, they have your Autobuild creation ready to roll.</p>
<p>Those with modded save files have been taking advantage of this feature in hilarious ways, uploading QR codes for "creations" that range from food, bubbles, items locked to shrines, and, uh, Ganondorf. Complete with a health bar and ready to absolutely destroy Link. He'll follow him absolutely everywhere, too, unless you fast travel away.</p>
<p>For something a little more relaxing than being chased by Demon King Ganondorf, there are codes that allow you to summon multiple Epona too — all of this demonstrated over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tearsofthekingdom/comments/1ledk4e/totk_autobuild_sharing_is_so_broken/#lightbox">tearsofthekingdom subreddit</a>.</p>

<p>How is this possible, though? It requires modded save data and access to a modded Switch 1 with TOTK, before transferring the save data to Switch 2. But, essentially, in the save data, you can change any part of an Autobuild to any kind of 'actor' or item.</p>
<p>So, as long as you find a QR code that lets you summon the respective item or character you want (we won't share them here, though they're relatively easy to hunt down), then you can go ahead and cause a different kind of chaos in Hyrule.</p>
<p>Oh, and in case you were wondering; yes, you can summon an army of good boys, too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/deals-for-today-nintendo-switch-power-bank-death-stranding-vinyl-skytech-gaming-pc-and-more<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve been holding out for a solid deal, today’s lineup delivers some excellent finds. From a $12 power bank perfect for your Nintendo Switch 2 to a hefty Skytech gaming PC loaded with AMD’s latest hardware, there’s a little something for everyone. </p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL;DR: Deals For Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vinyl collectors can also look forward to Woodkid’s emotionally rich <em>Death Stranding 2</em> soundtrack, while digital deal hunters should check out the IGN Live 2025 Bundle. Eight well-reviewed PC games for just $22.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hulu + Live TV Free Trial</h2><div catalogid="77f3624c-3861-436e-b835-55c123112a11" id="216770"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hulu + Live TV <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-get-hulu-plus-live-tv-free-trial">offers a three-day free trial</a> that allows you to take the live TV streaming service for a spin. This is one of the overall <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-streaming-service-free-trials">best streaming free trials</a> because it gets you a bundle of services. It is quite a bit shorter than the standard Hulu free trial of 30 days, but it's a great way to test it out over the weekend.</p></div><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Final Fantasy x Secret Lair</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">While boosters, Commander decks, and a new Starter Kit are up for grabs (if you can find them in stock), collectors will be most drawn to the highly coveted Secret Lair drops. Despite selling out instantly via Wizards of the Coast, these limited-edition mini-sets (Game Over, Weapons, and Grimoire) are still available through third-party platforms like TCGPlayer, though you’ll be paying premium prices well above the original $30–$40 MSRP. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each set features beautifully reimagined cards themed around iconic Final Fantasy characters and spells: the Weapons drop highlights legendary arms like Cloud’s Buster Sword and Tidus’s Brotherhood, Grimoire centers on magic-wielders like Vivi and Aerith, and Game Over pays tribute to villains with cards like Spira’s Punishment and Meteorfall. All sets come in standard and foil variants, with Japanese versions available as well. If you’re considering adding these to your collection, be sure to check listings carefully and be prepared for markups ranging from $70 to $150 or more.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">MTG Final Fantasy Chase Cards</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's insane how quickly these cards have climbed in value just days after release, and I can guarantee you (almost) that they won't be coming down any time soon. If you fancy saving some money ripping packs of MTG FF, just buy the card you want on TCGPlayer instead and save a fortune.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Where To Buy MTG: Final Fantasy</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's finally here, Magic the Gathering: Final Fantasy is out in the wild. If you got a preorder for MSRP, well played, but many TCG and Final Fantasy fans missed out. Fear not, there's still some options on sealed products available right now, including options from the secondary market with TCG Player which is around the same or lower than the pricing of big box retailers right now.
</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Restock Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Checking these prices against TCG Player secondary market values, a lot of these products aren't far off the mark. Make no mistake, they're still way off MSRP, but finding Pokémon products on shelves that haven't been marked up past the point of anyone caring is a positive. Still refusing to pay over MSRP for new sets? Well played, I'm proud of you. Here's some single card highlights for you to shuffle through instead. Spoiler, there's plenty of deals to be had.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Destined Rivals Singles Are On The Rise (Again)</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's hard to stick a pin on Destined Rivals single card values right now, and the dips in value seem to match the little bits of stock distributors release to stores. Looking at the tracking charts for each of these cards, we can see mostly plummets from day one, then either upticks or cards for sale that exceed the original value at launch. It's crazy, but we now know how low these cards can go. Sure there's always attempts at market manipulation, but I wouldn't buy any cards on the rise right now.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">The Most Expensive Pokémon Cards In Packs RIGHT NOW</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're not talking about vintage or out of print sets, all of these are incredible chase cards you can pull from booster packs available now. You can probably put money on their value going up as soon as their respective sets go out of print. If you don't want to spend mega money ripping open packs, market values on these single cards are quite reasonable for the most part..</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Destined Rivals Sealed Stock</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wew're look to market values for Destined Rivals at the moment, seeing as big box stores are either fresh out of stock or charging over MSRP and what they're worth on the secondary market. So here's the full lineup to pop on your shelf or rip open like THAT Tyranitar. If you know you know.</p><p id="skytech-king-95-gaming-pc"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Skytech King 95 Gaming PC">Skytech King 95 Gaming PC</h2></p><div catalogid="12468fbf-8990-4f79-9cda-997cbff2a2aa" id="223214"><div id="223214" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Skytech King 95 Gaming PC</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Skytech King 95 Gaming PC delivers serious performance for gamers ready to step into high-end territory without going overboard.

<p>Sub-layers of new info</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We're all still hyped full of bananergy after yesterday's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>-focused <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/reaction-donkey-kong-bananza-has-instantly-become-my-most-anticipated-game-of-2025">Direct</a> and, if you're anything like us, you'll likely have been straight onto the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/featured-games/donkey-kong-bananza/">official Nintendo website</a> to check out further details. Standard practice.</p>
<p>However, as we've found over the past 24 hours or so, jumping onto the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/aaaca/index.html?m=stage">Japanese version of the site</a> reveals a Donkey Kong Bananza section that has a bunch more details than we've got so far in the US/UK. Indeed, our man Zion has been breaking down the Direct, whilst also digging into new deets he's uncovered on said Japanese site, and well, there's lots juicy stuff to pick at here.</p>
<p>You can check out Zion's video for yourself up top for a much more detailed round-up of everything, but of particular interest here is that he's been looking at the sub-layers (that is, the levels that make up the world that you dig down through in the game) and attempting to piece them all together using both the Direct trailer and the extra details found tucked away on Nintendo's Japanese site.</p>


<p>By doing so, he's attempted to order the nine levels he believes are included, as they'll appear in the game, even digging into some of the minigames and deducing where they may show up.</p>
<p>The levels Zion's managed to work out thus far <em>seem</em> to appear in the game in the following order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ingot Isle</li>
<li>Lagoon Layer</li>
<li>Hilltop Layer</li>
<li>Canyon Layer</li>
<li><strong>???</strong></li>
<li>'Ice &amp; Lava'</li>
<li>Forest Layer</li>
<li><strong>???</strong></li>
<li>'Beach'</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, there's info still missing here, including two missing areas and some names that are placeholders. It certainly gives us a much easier-to-grasp overview of how this one may flow, and an early idea of just how much variety there's gonna be in this one when it drops in just a few weeks' time.</p>
<p>Other juicy details that Zion has picked out in this breakdown include some returning tracks from DK games of the past, as well as a whole bunch of other stuff that, we'll be honest, we'd never have noticed without him!</p>
<p>It's fascinating — and very exciting — stuff for anyone who's been waiting years for a new DK game. Bananza really is beginning to look like a surprisingly inventive banger, and the full breakdown gives lots of details on each area too, so go check it out!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendos-first-party-games-are-dominating-game-sales-on-nintendo-switch-2-while-third-party-published-games-are-off-to-a-slow-start/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is off to an incredible start, selling <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/">3.5 million units globally</a> in just its first four days on the market.</p>
<p>Nintendo is selling as many Switch 2 units as it can make, but the massive hardware launch doesn't seem to translate to huge game sales, at least for non-Nintendo games. <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/it-was-the-biggest-console-launch">The Game Business</a> reports that in the US, 62% of physical game sales for the Nintendo Switch 2 were for first-party Nintendo games, not including Mario Kart World.</p>
<p>In the UK, once again without including Mario Kart World, 48% of physical game sales were first-party Nintendo games, and with Mario Kart World included in those sales, that number bumps up to 86% of physical game sales going to first-party, Nintendo-made titles. Though you might think this leaves out a big piece of the picture by only focusing on physical sales, in cases where games were available digitally and physically, "<em>over 80% of Switch 2 game sales came from physical retailers,</em>" according to data shared by publishers to The Game Business.</p>
<p>A third-party publisher also told The Game Business that their sales numbers were "<em>below our lowest estimates</em>" for what they expected to sell on the Switch 2. The only third-party game that seems to have had great success on the Switch 2 so far is Cyberpunk 2077, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-set-another-record-by-selling-1-1-million-units-in-its-launch-week-in-the-us/">Circana reported was the third best-selling game in the US</a> during the Switch 2's launch week.</p>
<p>So, at least on a global scale, it looks like third-party publishers aren't having the best time on Switch 2, with first-party Nintendo games swallowing up all the attention. But at least regionally, according to Circana analyst and executive director Mat Piscatella, third-party game sales for Switch 2 games are doing much better than they were compared to the Switch 1's launch.</p>
<p>"<em>Third party unit share of Switch 2 physical software during week 1 just reached shy of 40%</em>," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lrxzjgdngs2t">Piscatella writes on BlueSky</a>. "<em>For month 1 of the Switch launch it was less than 20%.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>It's far too early to claim best or worst this or that or whatever when it comes to Switch 2</em>."</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/app.bsky.feed.post/3lrxzlxpmlk2t" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreibt6po5g6srzn35mitsjizz2fkvfyqigwje2m6u4fxzw2zjbecn5m">
<p lang="en">Third party unit share of Switch 2 physical software during week 1 reached just shy of 40%. For month 1 of the Switch launch it was less than 20%.</p>
<p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x?ref_src=embed">Mat Piscatella (@matpiscatella.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/post/3lrxzlxpmlk2t?ref_src=embed">2025-06-19T17:15:19.742Z</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As Piscatella also points out, the Switch 2 has not even been out for a month. We'll have a better look at sales numbers in due time, and there are also plenty of other factors to consider.</p>
<p>For example, the number of Switch's available at launch in 2017 is nowhere close to the number of units Nintendo was prepared with for the Switch 2's launch. There are simply more consoles out in the wild, for people to buy games on.</p>
<p>And that's before getting into the fact that people buy Nintendo consoles to play Nintendo games. It's only with the Switch that third-party publishers saw more success on the platform. Piscatella also pointed out in a separate post that as of March 2025, "<em>approximately half of all US owners of either the PS5 or Xbox Series also owned a Switch.</em>"</p>
<p>Someone who has never played Cyberpunk 2077 because they don't have a console or PC to play it on is more likely to buy it now that it's on Switch 2 than someone who bought their Switch 2 to play Mario Kart, and already played Cyberpunk on their current-gen console or high-end PC, and that goes for all third-party titles that are essentially ports to the Switch 2 for games that couldn't run on the Switch.</p>
<p>Again, as Piscatella pointed out, it's far too early to really say how third-party games will perform on the Switch 2. With the new hardware being capable of more 'impossible ports' like the Witcher 3 running on the original Switch, and more new games potentially releasing on Switch 2 alongside PS5 and Xbox Series X/S versions, the Switch 2 could still be a good platform for third-party games to thrive.</p>
<p>Though, seemingly that's contingent on whether Nintendo has a new Mario game out for the console at the same time.</p>

But if you’ve gotten good and need a harder challenge, you’ll be able to take on “Everdark Sovereigns,” which are more difficult versions of the game’s Nightlord foes you face to conclude a run.</p><p>“These limited-time versions of the Nightlords are extremely challenging and pose an even greater threat to the Nightfarers with new moves and increased power,” according to <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.com/news/elden-ring-nightreign-the-everdark-sovereigns-have-emerged">a blog post from Bandai Namco</a>.</p><p>The first Everdark Sovereign you can fight is a new version of Adel, Baron of the Night, aka Gaping Jaw. If you’ve beaten the normal version of that boss, you’ll be able to take on the new form. When you beat an Everdark Sovereign, you’ll get “Sovereign Sigils,” which you can exchange for “special Relics and other items.”</p><p>There are a couple caveats to be aware of. You can only fight Everdark Sovereigns while playing online. And Everdark Sovereigns will only be available for a limited time — the upgraded Gaping Jaw, for example, will stick around until June 25th at 8:59 PM ET.</p><p>Bandai Namco says a new Everdark Sovereign will be added every week, and over the “next few weeks,” Everdark versions of Sentient Pest and Darkdrift Knight will be added to the game. Other Everdark bosses will be added “at a later date.” Based on the blog post, it seems like Everdark variations will eventually return after they’ve disappeared.</p><p>At some point, the game will also get DLC that adds new playable characters and bosses.

            <p>
Crytek had a little bit of an oopsie yesterday with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown 1896's</a> 2.4 update yesterday. As soon as it arrived, there were reports of server problems and issues with buying Blood Bonds. This led to Crytek trying to fix it, taking the game's servers offline to do so, except when the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> was brought back online, it wasn't with a fixed version of the new update, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/594650/view/500576552635859005?l=english">but version 2.3</a>. However! It looks like the team continued work on getting it fixed (hope you didn't have to crunch too hard, Crytek staff), and the update is back and available to download.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
"Our team has been working tirelessly to resolve the issues that followed the original rollout, and after extensive testing and final checks, we’re confident in this new release," Crytek explained in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/594650/view/500576552635859184?l=english">Steam post</a>. "We’ll continue monitoring stability closely and remain committed to delivering the best possible experience moving forward." For what it's worth, now that the update is live and stable, <a href="https://x.com/HuntShowdown/status/1935431568409116845">you'll be able to redeem a code for 10,000 Hunt dollars as compensation</a> (I'd also like to take a second to note how funny Hunt dollars is as a name, couldn't figure out anything else huh).
</p>
<p>
In terms of the actual content of the update, also called the Judgement of the Fool update, it goes as follows: there's a new area called The Fool's Hideout to explore, where you can use Pledge Marks to unlock Sealed Rewards. The map DeSalle is back too, "revitalized with significant enhancements." 
</p>
<p>
There's a new Catalyst Trait too, which "unlocks powerful Conditional Trait Effects for specific Traits when they’re equipped on your Hunter." And there's also The Brute, a "formidable offspring of Ursa Mortis" that is stealthy in nature, so keep your wits about you. You can read more about the update in a blog post <a href="https://www.huntshowdown.com/news/update-24-judgement-of-the-fool-live-now">here</a>.

She used to live above ground, but for some reason she was brought to the underground world and transformed into a rock."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-confirms-super-mario-odysseys-pauline-is-your-new-sidekick-and-dk-can-now-transform-into-a-zebra-or-flying-ostrich">Yesterday's reveal of this younger Pauline, during the Donkey Kong Bananza Nintendo Direct</a>, strongly suggested she was the same music-loving version of the character seen in Nintendo Switch platformer Super Mario Odyssey, where a grown-up Pauline serves as both the mayor of New Donk City and the lead singer of a popular band.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo fans have been quick to highlight what this might mean for Pauline's overall timeline — and the fact that DK and Pauline's friendly team-up in Bananza is a very different vibe to the pair's usual relationship of kidnapper and victim. Does something happen to DK, turning him evil? Or have we been getting Pauline and DK's friendship wrong all these years?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong Bananza sees the two characters working together to help the teenage Pauline get back to the surface, in order to pursue her dream of becoming a world famous singer. Pauline's appearance as a singer in Odyssey suggests that she does indeed make it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But while Bananza looks story-wise to be an Odyssey prequel, the exact timeline here is somewhat unclear. Nintendo has never stated Pauline's age in Odyssey, or in any of her other appearances, so it's unknown how long before those events it is that Bananza takes place. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But by linking the character across these games through Pauline's musical ambitions, it also highlights the fact that Odyssey's Pauline does address her kidnapping by DK — something she describes as "traumatic."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Donkey Kong Bananza Direct Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Pauline has been kidnapped by DK multiple times over the years. Most notably, she is saved from DK's clutches in the original Donkey Kong arcade game, but she is then abducted again in various entries within the Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2 series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis, Pauline is snatched by Donkey Kong after the she dares to pick a gift from Mario instead of DK. In Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Minis March Again!, Pauline is kidnapped once more by an enraged DK, upset that he's missed out on a theme park opening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Later entries in the Mario vs. Donkey Kong series paint Pauline's interactions with DK in a kinder light, however, such as in Mario and Donkey Kong: Minis on the Move, where the two team up to host a mini-game, and Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Tipping Stars, where the pair plan Mario a surprise party.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Does something happen to sour DK and Pauline's relationship at the end of Donkey Kong Bananza, turning the ape from an ally to kidnapper? Will we see the events of the original Donkey Kong arcade game take place within Bananza, perhaps, with Mario coming in to save the day? Or have we been getting it wrong all these years?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some fans have suggested that Bananza will turn the Mario universe on its head by revealing that DK and Pauline are in fact friends — and that Mario has been the villain all along, effectively stealing Pauline back when she's just been hanging out with her pal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hopefully all will be revealed when Donkey Kong Bananza arrives as Nintendo's next major Switch 2 launch on July 17, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

<figure><a title="Photo Mode Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7a7165cabc459/photo-mode-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is the biggest Mario Kart to date. The map is huge, with Easter Eggs and little secrets hiding under bridges, atop towering buildings, and in the middle of sprawling oceans. Knockout Tour is the most chaotic concoction of multiplayer I've ever seen. And I'm still knee-deep in unlocking characters (darn, Kamek...).</p>
<p>And yet, here I am to talk about photo mode. <em>Bloody</em> photo mode, you're probably thinking. A modern-day video game checkbox. Probably 60% of games have a photo mode nowadays, either at launch or patched in at a later date. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> are just a few Nintendo first-party games that have some way of taking expressive pics of your characters.</p>
<p>But, news flash, I love it in Mario Kart World more than any of those other games.</p>
<figure><a title="Photo Mode Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bb7ab61f2bbb7/photo-mode-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Look, see, a <em>real</em> newsflash! — <em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Having spent a <em>lot</em> of time with Mario Kart World over the past couple weeks, and absolutely loving it, it's not the deeper mechanics, the chaotic racing, or the chillness of exploring the open world that have really stuck with me. It's how loud and expressive it lets you be, both in and out of the game. I touched on it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">in my review</a> in terms of the animations and visuals, but I think this applies across everything, particularly photo mode.</p>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>, Nintendo seems to have given Mario a new lease of life. Remakes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_rpg">Super Mario RPG</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a>, and a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_and_luigi_brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi</a> entry are indicative of that (Odyssey also just about fits the bill). These games represent Mario, Luigi, and a whole host of other characters, old and new, at their most colourful, their most jovial, and their most <em>stupid</em> in the best way possible.</p>

<p>Mario Kart World carries that torch but in an entirely new setting — not a 2D platformer or turn-based RPG, not even with any dialogue. This is a kart racer with over 100 costumes, multiple biomes, and 50 different characters ranging from classics like Peach and Wario to the stupidest of choices, like the Cow, Cataquack, and Peepa. I can drive around as <em>Peepa</em> from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/super_mario_3d_land">Super Mario 3D Land</a>.</p>
<p>Photo mode, to me, is an extension of the daft playfulness that's alive and well in the Mushroom Kingdom right now. It goes beyond just being an easy, fun way of sharing screenshots online or with friends. As with the best photo modes, it's about expressing yourself and the moment.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm way too deep into this, but a lot goes into a Mario Kart World photo. Which character would suit which location? What about the kart? Or a bike? Which costume? Do I want other racers in the shot? Enemies? Which pose looks best? What mood do I want to convey? Do I use a frame?</p>
<p>I'm not a professional photographer — please don't ask me to take good photos of any animal that isn't my cat — but when it comes to these kinds of shots, with this variety of characters? I'm all in.</p>
<p>Let's take Yoshi in his Biker outfit, for example. He <em>has</em> to be in the W-Twin Chopper (nothing else goes with those shades), and we need somewhere either suitably muddy <em>or</em> very cool to look effortless. So, off to Choco Mountain I went, driving around, looking for the best spots to frame my photo.</p>
<p>The muddy chocolate makes things a little tougher around here; you'll drown if you stay in it too long, and item boxes weren't giving me Mushrooms so I could zip over the little pools. But then a Feather and a curved wall gave me the chance to do something that looks easy as hell, but really isn't. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/mario-kart-world-how-to-wall-ride">Wall riding</a>...</p>

<p>Et voilà! Something that conveys a very cute character, looking very cool in the moment, with shades, a leather jacket, and a very suitable vehicle.</p>
<p>Or, you know, sometimes I just get really stupid ideas and decide to put Bowser, in a similar biker outfit, in Lil' Dumpy. As soon as I unlocked the costume for the king of Koopas, I knew immediately I was going to do something ridiculous with it. And, there you have it:</p>
<figure><a title="Photo Mode Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a911293fce4e8/photo-mode-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>I don't always use frames, but when I do... — <em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a franchise with over 40 years of history behind it, Mario has done a <em>lot</em> of things, and that also gives me a chance to relive, and re-experiment, with those moments. One of my favourite shots was a complete coincidence as I was driving around collecting P Switches in the snowy regions of Free Roam.</p>
<p>I went off-road after driving down from Starview Peak, hoping to find a big, blue button to bash my head against multiple times. But what I got instead was a goldmine: A group of penguins gathered around an oil drum.</p>
<p>Nintendo references Mario's hatred of penguins <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/mq4uCJDwO9U?si=ZRWLAc_HKVcnb8Y4&amp;t=726">in the Mario Kart World Direct</a> (we've all thrown the penguin off of Cool, Cool Mountain in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a>, right?), but what if the penguin wanted to take revenge? Luckily, penguin just happens to be a character in Mario Kart World, and in my eyes, he craves <em>violence</em>.</p>
<figure><a title="Photo Mode Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/51fd5573ded2f/photo-mode-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Beyond the sheer expressiveness of the game and the vastness of the world, the moment-to-moment action is just so easy to snapshot, and because every single moment can cause complete chaos, there are so many chances to put characters in danger for the sheer sake of art.</p>
<p>This makes me sound bad, doesn't it? I'm sure if Mario and friends were real, they'd hate me for putting them in perilous situations. But they're not all life-threatening; firing Daisy out of barrel cannons on the bridge between Faraway Oasis and Crown City is just kind of delightful, and getting into a heated contest with your brother brings out the drama.</p>

<p>The possibilities are endless, and all of that hooting and hollering while you're racing — groaning from being hit by a Blue Shell or cheering as you knock your best friend off the course and push them down 10 places in an instant — can be <em>captured</em> in an instant.</p>
<p>Plus, we can finally find out what happens when a Cataquack encounters another Cataquack:</p>
<figure><a title="Photo Mode Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/597826d37dddb/photo-mode-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, Knockout Tour is still my favourite thing about this game, and in those moments where I'm scrambling to make it into the top 16, or top 8, or simply just aim to win, I forget all about taking snapshots because I'm on the edge of my seat.</p>
<p>But when I do want to channel my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_Macmillan">Iain Macmillan</a> or <a href="https://www.kymillman.com/photography/formula-1/?srsltid=AfmBOoojdRYkIwFQ2bUpN7gdY_TmHRD08qkIuwYam7MZ0JfTlNyISzbx">Kym Illman</a>, Mario Kart World lets me capture the action, the calm, the fun, and the drama, with aplomb. May Mario and friends <em>always</em> feel this alive and expressive. I can't wait to mess around with it in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, too.</p>
<p>Or, you know, I could just admire the food. I <em>need</em> those Boo Buns in my life.</p>

<h3>The Nintendo Life Mario Kart World Photo Gallery</h3>
<p>As a little bonus, I thought it would be fun to round up a few shots from the NL Crew of their Mario Kart World escapades.</p>
<p>First up is reviewer extraordinaire PJ, who's making sure Mario gets some exercise in while riding along the high roads. Good for him! Love the little Baby Blooper, too — one of my favourite four-wheel vehicles in the game</p>

<p>Okay, next is a DK pic from our esteemed editor Gavin. Oh, uh, erm...no! Stop. Oh god... it's a photo of the popular Nintendo character Donkey Kong, as supplied by Gavin, you dirty people. There's some Waluigi here too, so you can keep your minds out of the gutter.</p>
<p>Anyway, <em>buns</em>. We like buns, right?</p>

<p>Following on from <em>that</em> fiasco, we have my trusty P Switch comrade Jim; he's taken a shine to the lovely little Monty Mole. Simple, effective, adorable — and look, there's even <em>another</em> Monty! Thanks, Moo Moo Meadows!</p>

<p>Last, but absolutely not least, Ollie has caught Baby Mario in the act — how on earth did he manage to get the biggest ice cream?? Also, thanks Ollie for reminding me that bees can be dangerous. Good for nature, not good for... crabs?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/techland-would-love-to-bring-dying-light-the-beast-to-the-nintendo-switch-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During our <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-impressions-and-qa-from-sgf-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Summer Game Fest 2025 interview with Tymon Smektała</a>, we asked the Techland Dying Light Franchise Director whether there were any plans to bring Dying Light: The Beast to the Nintendo Switch 2 console. Without promising anything, Smektała was very open about his desire to do it at some stage:</p>
<p><em>I would love this to happen at some point, but nothing to announce at this time.</em></p>
<p>On one hand, Techland's Director has detailed several technical improvements made to the C-Engine for Dying Light: The Beast:</p>
<p><em>We have also improved the visuals a lot. Our in-house C-Engine engine went through a number of iterations. Now, all the weather effects, the rendering of materials, lighting, shadows, and how the sun moves in the sky. All of those things are on a completely different level compared to Dying Light 2: Stay Human.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>On the other hand, the game is one of the very few to be still targeting a launch on old-generation consoles (PlayStation 4 and Xbox One) in 2025. As such, there's little doubt that the Nintendo Switch 2 could run the game in terms of raw power. It's rather a matter of opportunity, then. With the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch sales</a> it's had so far, it would seem like a no-brainer to bring a game to Nintendo's console, but that doesn't mean it would be easy for the Polish developer.</p>
<p>The first Dying Light only launched on the Switch six and a half years after the game's original debut in 2015. It took the opportunity to gather all DLCs into a <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-platinum-edition-leaked-due-on-thursday-may-27th/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Platinum Edition</a> that launched everywhere and added the Switch version. Whether Techland plans to do the same for this 'unofficial third game' remains to be seen.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Dying Light 2: Stay Human was announced to be coming to the original Nintendo Switch through a cloud version that, however, never materialized.</p>

            <p>
Space <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellaris">Stellaris</a> has received another update jam-packed with the kind of systemic adjustments that, were you to shout them through your bedroom door at your mum, would cause her to smile shakily, then go downstairs and sob into a tea towel at the knowledge that her treasured child, her brightest and best, will never amount to anything useful, for they are too busy obsessing over ringworlds and genesis arks and xeno-compatibility. 
</p>
<p>
Mum! MUM. I've just heard that "Storm Aftermath events will no longer happen in systems where you are constructing megastructures"! Even better, "Evolutionary Predator Empires can now once more gain and keep the Psionic Ephase trait"! Christmas has come early, mum! The eagle has landed! MOTHER, LOOK AT ME. I will not be denied.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The Storm Aftermath-fixing update in question, Stellaris patch 4.0.21, accompanies <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/281990/view/502828352450592822?l=english">a cautionary note from game director Stephen "Eladrin" Muray</a>, who says that developers Paradox Interactive are planning to slow down the rate of Stellaris patching in the wake of the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-date-stellaris-40-a-phoenix-update-to-attract-new-players-and-improve-performance">4.0 update</a>, because they keep accidentally lighting whole planets on fire. It turns out the old Zuck mantra "move fast and break things" only gets you so far when you're troubleshooting galaxies.
</p>
<p>
"We've released a tremendous number of patches since then at a rapid rate - but our patch cadence has become problematic (and even counterproductive) in some ways," Muray writes. "Too often in game development, fixing one bug introduces another - and I haven't been giving our internal QA testers enough time to fully vet and test the changes we've been making. 
</p>
<p>
"Examples from recent patches include a few weeks ago when an unrelated fix to a pop issue caused Wilderness empires to seemingly randomly destroy themselves by killing all of their biomass, or when another fix just after that caused save games to corrupt and become unloadable," he goes on.
</p>
<p>
Paradox remain "committed" to patching Stellaris, which has sunk to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/">a Mixed Steam user review consensus</a> following the release of the apparently cataclysmic 4.0 update, but they'll be "taking a more measured and deliberate approach to allow internal testing to catch up while giving you a more stable environment to play the game in". 
</p>
<p>
Specifically, they're shifting the emphasis to open betas that bring together QA work and player feedback more organically - the first of these will be updated "on a weekly to fortnightly basis depending on internal progress throughout the summer", with "the next 4.0.x live release" due sometime in August. Muray suggests that modders who "have been waiting for a moment of stability" take advantage of the shortage of major changes during that period.
</p>
<p>
As for what exactly they'll be patching next, please summon your mother back upstairs, for it is once again time to defeat and confuse her with the kind of preposterous sci-fantasy jargon she never ever imagined her darling baby would ever learn, back when you were just a wee tyke nuzzling at the nipple.
</p>
<p>
"I'm personally currently looking at ways to improve the AI's behavior," Muray continues. "Other things currently in active development are OOS investigations, a number of strata issues that affect slavery, purging, and other oddities among pop employment, and more of a design change rather than a bugfix - based on your feedback we're looking at having newly grown pops go straight into the Civilian stratum or its appropriate equivalent instead of being unemployed members of their parent pop group. 
</p>
<p>
"While we liked the verisimilitude of top-heavy planets having more stability issues than ones that were more evenly developed, we acknowledge that having a persistent trickle of unemployed pops feels wrong," Muray continues.</p>
<p>Did you hear that, mum? He took the words right out of my mouth. Mother, will you stop weeping and fetch me my abacus so I can calculate the performance losses from the bug "where every empire was calculating their Biomass total far too often". No, I do not want to speak to the careers advisor again. Yes, I will be eating dinner in my room this evening.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-showcase-announced-for-next-week/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bandai Namco has announced it will host a Little Nightmares Showcase for next week on <strong>June 24, 2025, at 12pm PST / 5pm EST / 8pm BST</strong>.</p>
<p>The news was announced with a short post to the <a href="https://x.com/LittleNights/status/1935729464823976221">Little Nightmares III official X account</a>, with a short video clip showing the date and time of the showcase and the caption "<em>Something unsettling is coming. It's closer than you think. Are you ready to face it, little ones?</em>"</p>
<p>That's all Bandai shared about the showcase, though we can infer that it'll include good deal of information on the next entry in the Little Nightmares series, Little Nightmares III, which is still without an official release date after it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-iii-gets-delayed-to-2025/">delayed last year</a> and pushed into 2025.</p>
<p>Though a release date hasn't been officially confirmed, a product listing for Little Nightmares III on Target (spotted by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/539541/article/little-nightmares-iii-release-date-potentially-leaked/">Gameranx</a>) has the release date set for September 15, 2025. We'll find out next week if that leak was correct.</p>
<p>It'll also be interesting to see more of Little Nightmares III, as this is the first game in the series that isn't being developed by the series creators at Tarsier Studios. Supermassive Games has taken over the series, and while the initial clips and previews suggest that it'll stay very close to the kind of game Tarsier already established, Supermassive will undoubtedly bring their own flair to the games in some way.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-iii-gamescom-hand-on-preview-surviving-together/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo previewed the game at Gamescom 2024,</a> he wrote that from the top of the demo, "<em>there was no doubt that I was playing a Little Nightmares game. Everything was in the right place: the characters, the atmosphere, the tone, and the gameplay</em>."</p>
<p>So far, some of the key differences seem to be that the characters in Little Nightmares III can use a series of weapons, but no doubt, there are more changes yet to be revealed, even if it's all staying close to what we all know to be a Little Nightmares game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-latest-patch-shadowdropped-its-first-enhanced-boss<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The downpour gets heavier.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Yesterday, the new patch 1.01.3 went live for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>. It was a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-1013-adds-a-little-bit-of-madness-but-players-are-really-happy-about-one-bug-fix">seemingly small patch</a>, centered on bugs and quality-of-life tune-ups. It seemed like most players saw it and went about their day. But then, gradually, some started to notice a new option in their Expeditions menu.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A new Gaping Jaw undertaking, dubbed the "Everdark Sovereign," was appearing on the Expeditions menu. Soon it became clear that FromSoftware had delivered on its promise to add enhanced bosses to Elden Ring Nightreign this month, and it did so without warning, letting players potentially stumble into the new venture. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lexykq/wtf_is_this_new/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Watching the community piece this together</a>, in the late hours of the night, was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lf04m4/just_a_small_performancebug_fixing_update_nothing/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">truly fantastic</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As confirmed this morning on <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/the-everdark-sovereigns-have-emerged-elden-ring-nightreign" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bandai Namco's site</a>, enhanced versions of current Nightlords—duibbed Everdark Sovereigns—will start appearing in Elden Ring Nightreign over the coming weeks. Each week, a new Sovereign will arrive in Limveld, with Gaping Jaw as the current Sovereign and both Sentient Pest and Darkdrift Knight due to get new, more challenging versions as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everdark Sovereigns are only available while online, and each Sovereign will hang around for a week, then leave and get replaced by another one. You have to have beaten the base, original form of the Nightlord to challenge its Everdark Sovereign form.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Early reports from players indicate that this souped-up Gaping Jaw <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lf1qck/welp_that_was_brutal/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is, truly, enhanced</a>. Videos of the fights show the empowered Adel zipping aruond the field, creating massive storms, and generally wiping the floor with entire trios of players in short order.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you can tackle the Everdark Sovereign solo, or with friends and/or strangers, it seems like the new fight is truly adding some challenge, even for those who have been putting a lot of hours into Elden Ring Nightreign. To me, it's reminiscent of Monster Hunter's upgraded fights that get added post-launch, like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/How_to_Beat_Arch-Tempered_Rey_Dau">Tempered versions of monsters</a>, that seem meant to add extra challenge as players' knowledge and power rises exponentially over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What's the reward for felling an Everdark Sovereign? Well, a brand-new shop located in the hub area will let you spend all the Sovereign Sigils you'll earn from a clear, and even this shop is a pretty exciting update. Alongside offering special Relics and other items, the Sigils allow playes to change the Roundtable Hold's lighting, acquire the currently available skins, and set shifting earth statuses. The latter has been a major request from the community, and it's great to see it addressed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So while the patch notes for 1.01.3 were fairly unassuming at first, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lf09p1/this_update_fixed_the_game/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">players now seem to feel like this is a huge update</a>. The roll-out of enhanced bosses has already brought some new life and challenge back to Nightreign, and the promise of more to come is enticing, as are the new short-term pursuits to chase after.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bandai Namco is also teasing this as the start of something: "This is only the beginning of the Everdark Sovereign cycle. As the power of the Night ebbs and wanes, the Sovereigns will soon return to the abyss they came from." We already know Elden Ring Nightreign is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-will-get-dlc-bosses-and-characters-according-to-steam-page-slip-up">due to get full updates</a> down the road, so if this is an early indication of what we can expect, the long-term prospects for FromSoft's new co-op survival action game seem good.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> community is torn right now. In the Deep Desert, roaming hordes of orniphopters (the Dune equivilent of a plane or helicopter) are dominating the end game and making an already dangerous area even more perilous. The thing is, I don't think this is a bad thing. In fact, I think it's good for the game in the long run.</p>
<p>For those who aren't familiar, the Deep Desert is a no-holds-barred open world PvP area that makes up the majority of Dune: Awakening's end game. It's a vast, mostly barren, landscape where the best materials can be found. It's also a place where any player can kill you and snatch any money or materials you have on you.</p>
<p>So the stakes are high. At the moment, the Deep Desert is being patrolled by Assault Orniphopters. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-is-being-dominated-by-one-busted-technique-crushing-people-with-helicopters">They may not be able to crush you to death anymore</a>, but they're still armed with missiles, allowing pilots to shoot down other orniphopters with relative ease. One can be evaded easily enough, but when eight of them fly towards you, you're done for.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, there are numerous complaints about these flocks of orniphopters dotted around social media and Dune: Awakening community hubs. Take <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lcojf7/to_the_surprise_of_nobody/">this Reddit post</a> conveying the sadness tied to the Deep Desert compared to Hagga Basin. Or this one, in which user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1ld7yi5/what_we_really_need_for_the_deep_desert/">nowheels64</a> makes a plea for the lock-on missile launchers that appear in the recent Dune movies. The frustration <em>is</em> real. It's palpable.</p>
<p>Those annoyed by the Deep Desert all have valid opinions. It is undoubtedly frustrating when you're on your own, mining materials, and get blown to pieces from some unseen threat on high. Losing all your things is a bummer, there's no two ways about it.</p>
<p>But I'm going to make an argument that the scurge of orniphopters isn't <em>inherently</em> a bad thing for the Dune: Awakening end game. The Deep Desert, the Landsraad - it's all about collaboration with your fellows within the faction you have chosen. Player guilds are attached by the hip to the Landsraad, and objectives assigned each week are so lofty as to practically require group effort. Could one person theoretically farm up 1,000 Adept swords and hand them in on their own? Sure. Is that the intention? Obviously not.</p>
<p>So where does this leave the player, fresh from Hagga Basin? Well, they're outnumbered and unable to make a real dent in the Landsraad. The only option is to join a guild, to dive headfirst into the social pool of a very community-focused end game.</p>
<p>Dune: Awakening doesn't force you to do this, to be a social animal, but it's so obviously the point that the only other thing Funcom could do to emphasise it further is to build a big neon sign that says "join a guild" in the small PvE slice of the Deep Desert.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Flying out alone, like this, is perilous. That's kind of the point! | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I appreciate that this isn't everyone's bag. In fact, history has taught us it's not the majority of people's preferred way to play. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/throne-and-liberty">Throne and Liberty</a> lost a lot of players who didn't want to touch the guild zone control mechanics, no matter how cool sieges looked. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/darkfall-online">Dark Fall Online</a> was incredibly PvP focused, and incredibly niche as a result. In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a>, if you do a War Mode world quest and see another player PvP tagged, a lot of folks will just /wave and go on with their business.</p>
<p>But with a game like Dune: Awakening, the conflict between the factions is so integral to the mechanics, and even the narrative. You're on Arrakis during the war of assassins, Landsraad bonuses are faction-wide. It's Atreides vs Harkonnen baby, all the way down into the mud. To shy away from that would be to separate from the source material in a way I'm not convinced Funcom wants to do.</p>
<p>I'm not going to sit here and tell people they're playing the game wrong: you play the game you pay for however you want. There's nothing wrong with popping back to Dune: Awakening when a new faction or major story update happens. But in terms of the Deep Desert, I hope this spirit of danger remains. It can be aggravating, yet it's also a necessary force to push players into the wider faction conflict. And isn't that what Dune is really all about?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/digital-foundry-delivers-its-tech-review-for-pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-on-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWRt-PiOzlI">Digital Foundry</a> has presented its tech review for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a> on the Switch 2, with the latest generation receiving a pretty substantial performance update for Nintendo's newest console.</p>
<p>All things considered, it seems that this has proven to be a pretty positive outcome for the games (though one that, in this writer's opinion, arrived far too late), with visual quality and frame rates receiving significant boosts.</p>
<p>To start off, the games' visuals are much cleaner than before and, according to DF, "hold up well on a 4K television set". Shimmering has more or less been eliminated, with a solid 1080p internal resolution at play. Though not definitively confirmed, it's speculated that the game is likely making use of Nvidia's DLSS technology to boost the visuals slightly.</p><p><figure data-videoid="-mwkAYKvypQ" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-mwkAYKvypQ?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mwkAYKvypQ"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mwkAYKvypQ">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Frame rate is also a huge improvement, running at a decent 60fps for the most part. There are some dips here and there – particularly during busy scenes – but it's a night and day difference when compared to the sub-30fps you would expect to see on the Switch 1.</p>
<p>Similarly, distant characters and objects now move in full animation sequences, rather than the weird, jittering animation seen on Switch 1. This can be applied to trainers walking in the open world and even the infamous windmill, which now runs smoothly at far distances. Loading times are also much better, with fast travel now taking on average between 3 and 4 seconds each time, whereas you could be looking at anything up to 15 seconds on the Switch 1.</p>
<p>A few areas haven't been touched, though. Draw distances are largely the same across both consoles, while pop in is also still a bit of an issue on the Switch 2. The Pokémon still aren't persistent either, so if you happen to leave a specific area, the same Pokémon you saw previously won't remain there upon return. Keep an eye out for those shinies.</p>
<p>Overall though, it's a much-needed improvement, and actually makes playing Scarlet and Violet quite a pleasurable experience when compared to the Switch 1. It still looks kinda rough, of course, with blocky textures and bland environments, but performance-wise, this is very welcome, indeed.</p>

			<p>There's now two Death Stranding film adaptations in the works. The first is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-death-stranding-movie-has-found-a-writer-and-director-in-a-quiet-place-day-ones-michael-sarnoski/">A24 movie with Michael Sarnoski directing</a>, and the second is a newly announced animated film being made by animation studio Line Mileage in collaboration with Kojima Productions, with Raised by Wolves creator Aaron Guzikowski signed on to write the script.</p>
<p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/06/death-stranding-animated-adaptation-aaron-guzikowski-writer-1236436519/">Deadline</a> reports that the film will be a more mature-focused animated feature, and will center a new story in the Death Stranding universe that has not been explored in the games.</p>
<p>"<em>I love the world of Death Stranding,</em>" Guzikowski said in a statement to Deadline. "<em>It's so creatively freeing, so beautifully dark and yet hopeful; I'm so excited and honored that Hideo Kojima, whose work I've long admired, has invited me to dwell within his creation, to birth new stories into this fertile, mind-bending universe. Drawing and animation have always been near and dear to my heart, so to finally get to play in this space is a dream come true</em>."</p>
<p>Line Mileage's chief creative officer, Daniel Dominguez added "<em>As an avid gamer I can say, unequivocally, Death Stranding is the most cinematic, thought-provoking video game I have ever played. Playing it gave me the same emotional rush, visceral punch, and intellectual pleasure I had the first time I watched Blade Runner, or Ghost in the Shell. Adapting it into a form it so naturally evokes is an honor. And for Aaron Guzikowski to lend his talents, whose authorial mind and creative energy humble me...needless to say, this project is a dream come true</em>."</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is due a week from this current time of writing, and now with two movie adaptations in the works, it's clear we'll be hearing about this series for a long time to come. Whether that's in a good or bad way remains to be seen with how the next game and these subsequent adaptations do.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-changed-death-stranding-2-wasn-t-polarizing-enough/">recent interview with Rolling Stone,</a> co-composer for Death Stranding 2, Woodkid, revealed that Hideo Kojima's reactions to players being extremely positive about how the game was shaping up in early playtests were to change it and make it more polarizing. Kojima wasn't satisfied with positive responses across the board, he wanted to see more people react differently than just delivering full praise.</p>
<p>It's still unclear how deeply involved Kojima will be in both the A24 live-action adaptation and Line Mileage's animated adaptation, but the litmus test for both, as to how well they work as adaptations of a Hideo Kojima game, will undoubtedly be how differently people react to the narrative in each film.</p>

        <p>They also plan to "add new contracts across the board" at some point</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> developers Funcom have revealed in a post-launch Reddit AMA that they're currently aiming to release a fresh update full of quality of life-related tweaks in early July, as well as adding "new contracts across the board" down the line.</p>
<p>However, if you're after big new stuff to do, you'll have to wait for the major updates that'll be releasing alongside the game's DLCs.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We have an update in testing that contains a lot of quality of life updates, which we are aiming to release in early July," DA executive producer Scott Junior wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lehj35/official_dune_awakening_launch_ama_with_funcom/">in response</a> to a question about Funcom's immediate future plans, "When we get closer to it being publicly testable we will release the full patch notes. It contains too many changes for me to list here, but you'll be seeing it soon!"</p>
<p>If I had to guess, I'd say there's a chance that update includes simple base building tweaks folks have been begging for, such as storage containers and vehicles you can name, as well as the option to deposit all of their water with one button press. All of those were confirmed as being in the works at different points in the thread.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, in terms of bigger additions to the game, Junior explained: "each of our major updates will always continue new story content and new PvE content, which will release at the same time as our DLCs come out. Our goal is to have these release every 3/4 months."</p>
<p>In terms of what the developer's plans are to tweak PvP, which has <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/dune-awakening-devs-promise-a-bunch-of-changes-as-the-survival-mmos-pvp-and-endgame-content-come-under-fire-over-loot-balance-concerns-and-more-total-mess/">come under fire</a> from players early doors, DA senior game director Viljar Sommerbakk wrote that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-players-kept-getting-squashed-by-ornithopters-so-an-update-has-made-everyone-invulnerable-to-vehicle-bashing">scout ornithopter</a> won't be losing its rockets, with the devs instead instead aiming to make its performance vary depending on what gear you equip it with.</p>
<p>In line with that, specifically in terms of deep desert PvP, Sommerbakk said the devs are currently "formulating a plan" for changes based around three considerations. They want players to have to make "meaningful decisions" about their loadouts, the mode to feel "reliable, responsive, and clearly understood" moment to moment, and are fixing "issues with movement desyncs and rubber banding, as well as ability activation reliability".</p>
<p>One of the major things players asked about in the thread was the possibility of the game getting more contracts for PvE folks to work through on a weekly basis, rather than running out of stuff to do. "There are plans to add new contracts across the board," wrote DA creative director Joel Bylos, "In addition, the Landsraad itself is supposed to involve more contracts in order to reveal tasks for the Houses. As well as contracts that lead into the Deep Desert."</p>
<p>In terms of the Landsraad, the devs were also clear they've read feedback about issues like tasks locking early or being too tough for solo players, and plan to rectify those as well as making sure folks feel like its rewards are worth the work.</p>
<p>As for folks missing out on Landsraad tasks that are claimed not long after they're released, Bylos replied that Funcom's "current plan is to allow your contributions to stack week after week, so that small groups and solos can work towards larger rewards over time. And then adding more tiers of rewards as well as new activity drivers".</p>
<p>It's a lot of spicy stuff to be sure. Funcom definitely aren't shying away from the raging sandworms of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-review">player opinion</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Mike Klubnika's previous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/buckshot-roulette">Buckshot Roulette</a> was a simple, harrowing game about aiming a shotgun at your very own face and praying for a click, not a bang, then challenging a manky git across the table to do likewise. The developer's forthcoming s.p.l.i.t, by contrast, looks like a squirming snakepit of moving parts that calls to mind both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/duskers">Duskers</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/space-warlord-organ-trading-simulator">Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator</a>.

In this "short psychological horror game", you are part of a team of hackers attempting to break into "an unethical superstructure". The whole thing appears to unfold in a small, grubby room full of crackling monitors, with despairing trees visible through a curtained window. Your job is to poke at a command prompt interface while bandying words with shadowy strangers over IRC. The below trailer is already giving me a migraine. I can feel my guts uncoiling in protest. How very glorious.

"The facility you and your crew infiltrate is a superstructure of unethical electronics," the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3684610/split/">Steam page</a> adds. "The daunting task is only made possible by careful planning, and vulnerabilities hidden deep below legacy code and engineering." Be warned that the game will contain depictions of self-harm and suicide. That noose in the picture seemingly isn't just for show.

<p>
Alice O, greatest of news editors, is a fan of Klubnika's work. "I really like how his games are small visits to unexplained terrible places," she <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/inscryption-meets-russian-roulette-in-this-weird-short-horror-game">wrote back in 2024</a>, shortly before she quit this stinking james gournalism business and, as legend tells, escaped to the mountains in a hamster-powered balloon.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure s.p.l.i.t. will be similarly dense and anomalous, and as such, I'm prepared to forgive the Tom Clancy-ass title punctuation here. Perhaps the abbreviation stands for "Send Pizza Lest I Tunnel (Past Your Network Security)"? We'll find out when the game hits e-shelves on 24th July. If you'd rather play more Buckshot Roulette, know that it now has a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/buckshot-roulette-now-has-a-4-person-multiplayer-mode-which-im-sure-you-will-survive">four-person multiplayer mode</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
