            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capstone Games' newest tabletop game, Aquaria, is available now for pre-order. The game is a family-friendly experience about who can build and maintain the most impressive aquarium.</p>

<h2>The <em>Aquaria</em> Pre-Order Announcement</h2>

<p>According to the <a href="https://capstone-games.com/product/aquaria/" rel="nofollow">store page</a>, <em>Aquaria</em> is a board game designed for 1-4 players and takes about 60-180 minutes to complete. Each player takes turns building their own aquarium with its own unique ecosystem of marine life. Those turns are spent buying new fish, feeding them, and keeping the aquarium in good condition.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aquaria-board-game-player-board-artwork.jpg?itok=kNfnTLF_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aquaria-board-game-player-board-artwork.jpg?itok=EHrQNtiW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>All player progress is tracked through an encyclopedia. The encyclopedia rewards points for how involved each player becomes in their understanding of marine biology and their aquarium maintenance. Whoever has the most points at the end wins the game. Notably, the game revolves less around exotic fish and more around aquascaping and fauna management.</p>

<p>The lead designer of <em>Aquaria</em> is&nbsp;Tomáš Holek, the award-winning tabletop designer, no stranger to management-oriented tabletop experiences. His work includes <em>Tea Garden</em>, a game about managing and cultivating your own tea garden in China's Yunnan region, and <em>SETI: Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence</em>, a sci-fi game about searching for life beyond planet Earth.</p>

<p>This management focus is also not unheard of for Capstone Games. Their most beloved board game is 2012's <em>Terra Mystica</em>, a euro-game designed by&nbsp;Jens Drögemüller and&nbsp;Helge Ostertag about managing your own small part of a vast fantasy kingdom. It is an experience so beloved it has won multiple awards over the years, including the acclaimed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/diana-jones-award-2025-winners-have-been-announced-their-prize-includes-trip-to" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Diana Jones Award</a>, Meeples' Choice, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/designer-of-bomb-busters-board-game-wins-this-years-spiel-des-jahres" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Spiel des Jahres</a>.</p>

<p>The acclaim is so profound that Steamforged Games has announced plans to <a href="https://steamforged.com/blogs/brands/terra-mystica-special-edition" rel="nofollow">reprint the game</a> through a crowdfunding campaign.</p>

<p>The <em>Aquaria</em> board game is available for pre-order at an MSRP of $74.95 not including shipping. It is expected to ship out to customers in November.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Hades 2</em> is finally out of Early Access and Supergiant Games has rolled out the red carpet with patch notes showing every major change as the game enters version 1.0 on PC and comes to Switch 1 and Switch 2. The true ending to Princess Melinoë’s adventure is now live, along with fresh secrets and a bevy of balancing tweaks.</p> <p>Supergiant Games put <em>Hades 2</em> out in Early Access <a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-pc-early-access-release-date-surprise-1851458365">back in May 2024</a> and it was already pretty decent. The studio’s been adding more content and fine-tuning its more ambitious scope ever since. In addition to the True Ending and Epilogue, there are also new story events, gift events, keepsakes to discover and fresh artwork and music for players to enjoy. Most of the balance changes are buffs or bug fixes. Appearance rates for resources have undergone some changes as well<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->all Prestige are now Kudos<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->and Tablet of Peace and Rod of Fishing sequences have been sped up.</p> <p>“While <em>Hades 2</em> spent more than four-and-a-half years in development, including about a year and a half in Early Access, it’s also the culmination of all the experience we’ve gained together as a team since Supergiant Games started back in 2009,” director Greg Kasavin wrote in the game’s Discord. “Early Access development was foundational to the entire idea of the original <em>Hades</em>, and proved instrumental to this latest game as well. So, from all of us, thank you for inspiring us to do our best, and we hope you enjoy your time with <em>Hades 2</em>.”</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-ii-the-kotaku-review-2000628064">Opinions may vary</a> on how well this sequel builds on the foundations of the original, but <em>Hades 2</em> is an impressive achievement for a studio that’s retained all seven of its founding members and continues releasing popular indie hits without a CEO or conventional business structure. “I don’t have some kind of magical explanation for why we’ve been able to stick around for this long while some others haven’t been as fortunate,” Kasavin <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/tech/article/hades-supergiant-games-studio-21057611.php">told <em>SFChronicle</em></a> in a new interview. “I do attribute it to the value that we place on sticking together as a team, on keeping our ambitions relatively modest. We don’t have an ambition to grow big for its own sake.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-27-inch-asus-tuf-gaming-monitor-has-never-been-this-cheap-before-now-with-3-year-warranty-included.1309164/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gamers who love multiplayer online combat games where teamwork is key — think&nbsp;<em>Helldivers II</em> or <em>Marvel Rivals</em> — are all too aware that it only takes one laggy teammate to kill an entire mission. It’s not always a slow internet connection or console either — a subpar monitor with a bad refresh time can spell doom for the whole team.</p>
<p>If you end up being&nbsp;<em>that guy</em> who says “sorry, my screen is slow” one time too many, you might find your team membership revoked. This limited-time Amazon deal <em>that guy</em>-proofs you and ensures your screen is totally ready for combat: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4321/">Act now and save 30% off the price of the 27-inch ASUS TUF gaming monitor</a>, a 1440p QHD gaming superstar with a blistering 260Hz refresh rate, Adaptive Sync technology, and many more features that will upgrade your gaming performance. It’s just $229 while this deal is in effect.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4321/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Silky Smooth, Lightning Quick</h2>
<p>First things first — the ultra-fast 260Hz overclocked refresh rate and 1 ms pixel response time. No blur, smooth frames, or delay, even in the fastest action of your favorite shooter or racing game. ASUS doubled down on killing the bluir with their ELMB Sync tech (Extreme Low Motion Blur), and adaptive sync options that keeps things moving even if your graphics card is having a hard time. That translates to less tearing.</p>
<p>The colors pop too, and the anti-glare coating is a huge plus if your rig is located with your back to a window. That, of course, comes in handy if you decide to take a break from gaming to enjoy some streaming or YouTube.</p>



<h2>Not a Space Hog</h2>
<p>The ASUS TUF monitor won’t require a total overhaul of your gaming space either. It’s razor thin and weighs only 11 pounds, meaning it’s also easily wall-mountable of you go that route. The display port and two HDMI 2.0 ports are located in the back of the unit along with an earphone jack, and it comes with DisplayPort and HDMI cables so you can go from unboxing to heavy-duty action in mere minutes.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4321/">The 30% off deal happening right now at Amazon on the 27-inch ASUS TUF gaming monitor translates to a $100 price break</a>, and also to one of the best $230 gaming monitors you’ll find. Finding a gaming monitor with enough speed to keep up with the most intense action gaming at this price is beyond rare, but as limited time deals do, this one could end at any time.</p>

While the announcement trailer didn't show off much <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-6-races-into-japan-in-official-teaser-trailer/1100-6535010/" data-ref-id="1100-6535010">beyond Mount Fuji in the background</a>, Xbox Game Studios spared no expense to help the devs understand Japanese culture for the game. That included hiring a cultural consultant to guide them throughout development.</p><p>On <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/25/forza-horizon-6-japan-setting-2026/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a>, cultural consultant, Kyoko Yamashita explained why the Forza Horizon 6 team felt the need to have a deeper knowledge about Japan while recreating it for the game.</p><p>"Japan is widely loved, but it can also be widely misread when you only see it from afar," said Yamashita. "The team wanted to present more than a postcard or a backdrop; they wanted a lived-in world. Having a cultural consultant early helps you make a thousand small, respectful decisions: how neighborhoods sound, even what a sign color communicates about a shop. Those small choices add up to credibility and help avoid stereotypes, while also making it a truly immersive experience for players."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXedKqX5Wa4" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VXedKqX5Wa4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Yamashita added that the approach to authenticity was treated "as a practice, not a checkbox," and noted that it extended to the game's seasonal changes as well as the day-and-night cycles. Forza Horizon 6's Japan won't be a one-to-one recreation of the entire country, but it's meant to feel familiar for locals and visitors alike. That includes the way it incorporates Japan's car culture.</p><p>"In Japanese car culture, the depth and diversity is astonishing," noted Yamashita. "Kei cars and vans with cult followings, precision motorsport, drifting’s roots, and their passion for customization really stands out. It's welcoming to different levels of enthusiasm and knowledge, which is exactly the kind of layered world I want players to feel."</p><p>Forza Horizon 6 will be released in 2026 on Xbox Series X|S and PC, and it will be a day-one title on Xbox Game Pass. There is a PS5 port in development, but it will be a post-launch release.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/fbc-firebreaks-first-big-update-detailed-whats-coming-in-breakpoint/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fbc-firebreak%E2%80%99s-first-big-update-detailed-%E2%80%93-what%E2%80%99s-coming-in-breakpoint.1309146/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Remedy Entertainment has detailed the Breakpoint update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>, a free major update that will bring systemic ovehauls, quality of life improvements, new content and more when it is released on 29th September.</p>
<p>The core of FBC: Firebreak is staying the same, as a three-player co-op FPS where you dive into missions to tamp down some paranormal threats within the Federal Bureau of Control. After a rocky launch, Remedy has gone back to the drawing board for how to get people into the game and keep them engaged.</p>


<p>The Job Board has been replaced with the Crisis Board, to present missions in a new way, while each mission has been broadened to be less predictable than before. There’s a new playable tutorial called Orientation to get people into the game, which was sorely missed at launch.</p>
<p>There’s also a new Crisis mission (which would previously have been known as a Job), set in the Research sector of the Oldest House, with three new guns, grenades and cosmetics to earn. Speaking of which, a new Gun Mod system lets you modify weapons with three mod slots.</p>


<p>Here’s the breakdown from Remedy:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Crisis Board</strong> – The Crisis Board replaces the Job Board, presenting playable, curated, content in a new way. With this new overhaul, players can easily track the various Crises that appear at different levels around the Oldest House, offering a larger variety of fun gameplay and utilizing level content better than ever.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Gameplay Loop </strong>– Each Crisis has more variety than what came before, making FBC: Firebreak more dynamic, less predictable, and closer to the first-responder fantasy at the heart of the game.</li>
<li><strong>An Improved Onboarding Experience</strong> – Remedy is making changes to the new player experience, making it easier to understand the core mechanics and to eliminate previous barriers for entry. This includes a new playable tutorial called “Orientation”, an introduction video which helps set the scene and Job overview videos, which helps players learn about each Crisis.</li>
<li><strong>New Content – Outbreak </strong>– A brand-new Crisis (formerly Job), which is set in the Research sector of the Oldest House. Firebreakers must research and contain a dangerous mold cluster, while battling new enemies. The update also adds three new guns, grenades, cosmetics and much more.</li>
<li><strong>Gun Improvements</strong> – A completely new feature in Breakpoint is the Gun Mod system. Gun Mods have modifiers that make guns more powerful or change their functionality. Each gun has three mod slots, giving you new options for customizing your arsenal.</li>
<li><strong>And Much More! </strong>– Players will notice improvements from top to bottom, including the way FBC: Firebreak communicates to players, such as improved visual communication of harmful conditions to help players better understand their surroundings and what causes damage.</li>
</ul>
<p>After this update, Remedy will be forging ahead with another update set for November, <span>which will add cross-platform voice chat, </span>and then another in March of 2026. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/530984095140809426?l=english">Catch the full details here</a>.</p>
<p>FBC: Firebreak is an ambitious step into live service and multiplayer gaming for Remedy, taking the setting of the Oldest House from Control and then spinning it out into a rather quirky riff on the form of Left 4 Dead and other co-op shooters. Alas, it didn’t quite strike a chord with gamers when it launched earlier this year, despite being readily available on PS Plus and Game Pass. Teething issues at launch and more systemic complaints had Remedy looking for ways to revamp the game going forward. This is just the first step down that path, hopefully.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/07/fbc-firebreak-review/">Firebreak review</a>, I said, “I quite like FBC: Firebreak, but I wish I could like it more. There’s the amusing ideas of plaguing players with haunted sticky notes and rubber ducks, there’s discovering unique level quirks for how to deal with picking up radioactive orbs safely, and the inherent joy of getting through tense backs-to-the-wall moments with allies by your side, but those moments of delight dissipate through a clunky user interface, abbreviated mission structure and too few levels to take on. This can still grow into something special, but Remedy might have to explore new directions to manage that.”</p>

			<p>UK indie developer Playtonic Games is about to launch Yooka-Replaylee, a remaster of 2017's platform game Yooka-Laylee, and they have now shared the first gameplay footage and info on the Nintendo Switch 2 version.</p>



<p>The footage was provided to IGN and you can find it embedded below. As for the Switch 2 port, Playtonic Games <a href="https://x.com/PlaytonicGames/status/1971201407001809335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared on X today</a> that this version will only run at 30 frames per second, on both handheld and TV mode.</p>



<p><em>To provide players the best possible looking and seamless version of the game, Yooka-Replaylee will be running at a consistent 30fps on Nintendo Switch 2 both in handheld and docked mode. Due to limited time with the development kits, we're investigating the possibility of implementing a performance mode to follow some time post launch.</em></p>



<p><em>We've also received a lot of questions regarding a playable demo on Nintendo Switch 2. Unfortunately, this is not something we're able to accommodate pre-launch but are planning to release post-launch.</em></p>

<p>Yooka-Replaylee features many changes compared to the original (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/yookalaylee-1998/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we reviewed on this page</a>):</p>



<ul>
<li>A new storybook-style presentation with new sequences introduced throughout the game.</li>



<li>New areas and challenges have been added, and old challenges have been improved or replaced. </li>



<li>Collectibles have been rearranged across all levels, and the number of discoverable Pagies has doubled.</li>



<li>The moveset has been tweaked and upgraded to include new moves and combos, and the camera has been refined.</li>



<li>New hidden arcade games are scattered throughout the adventure.</li>



<li>A new collectible currency called Q.U.I.D.S.</li>



<li>An adventurer's notebook to help players hunt down everything hidden in the game</li>



<li>New tonics offer multiple game-changing enhancements to customize and perk up your playstyle.</li>
</ul>



<p>Yooka-Replaylee launches on October 9 for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch for $29.99.</p>

                  Hugh Jackman has tricked millions of fans into thinking Wolverine is six feet tall
                </p><div>
              
              <p><span>Folks, if I know one thing in this world, it’s the lived experience of being a short king. My 5’3” ass has always seen the world from a lower standing than my peers, and it’s rare for me to come across heroes in media who see the world from that same point of view. Wolverine, the X-Man who has pointy metal claws in his knuckles, is one of the few short kings I have to cling to in popular culture, but a lot of people don’t realize that he’s supposed to be a little guy. In the comics, he’s my height exactly, but so many people know him from the movies where he’s played by 6’2” actor Hugh Jackman. </span><i><span>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine </span></i><span>makes a joke about this when, through the magic of filmmaking, Deadpool meets a “comic-accurate” version of Logan who needs a booster seat to sit at the bar. Now, however, Wolfie is getting his own game, and there’s no reason that casting a particular actor has to define the character’s stature. So has Insomniac stayed true to his short king status? Fans can’t seem to agree.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000628728" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628728"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628728">© Insomniac Games</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Strictly eyeballing it, Logan looks like he’s definitely of short stature in the trailer that premiered during the State of Play showcase yesterday. Some fans note that </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayWolverine/comments/1nppa0b/looks_like_they_actually_made_him_height_accurate/"><span>he definitely appears significantly shorter</span></a><span> than the enemies he’s slicing and dicing, but some don’t think that’s quite enough.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">my gripe is, why is Logan so tall? He should be short and wide <a href="https://t.co/eTMS13BXx9">https://t.co/eTMS13BXx9</a></p> <p>— ✦ JYDAWN ✦ (@_jydawn) <a href="https://twitter.com/_jydawn/status/1971009918087119247?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Sorry, I just took some mild psychic damage at reading someone say that Logan being short would make him a “twink,” and I need people to stop trying to use words they don’t understand. This is an annoying case of both tall people and straight people bastardizing my culture. Anyway, the weird part of the conversation is that people actually somehow think that a short Wolverine would be inherently weird or comical. The Hugh Jackman bit in </span><i><span>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine </span></i><span>was a joke because it showed that Jackman himself would look ridiculous if he were made a foot shorter with minimal changes to his proportions, but a 5’3” man can absolutely fuck up some mutant-hunting baddy as well as a man who towers over him.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We need to banish the idea of 5'2 Logan from existence at this point. People were seriously saying this sized Deadpool Wolverine should be the MCU one. I get it, it's from the comic, but sometimes comic things need to die <a href="https://t.co/90umBvRLYO">https://t.co/90umBvRLYO</a> <a href="https://t.co/X0AwbiohBA">pic.twitter.com/X0AwbiohBA</a></p> <p>— Paul Tassi (@PaulTassi) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulTassi/status/1971197931387785534?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wolverine being 5’2 is legit the worst piece of character lore of all time ngl</p> <p>— Matt b (@hipppyjump) <a href="https://twitter.com/hipppyjump/status/1971068452585800134?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>Some of this sentiment is rooted in the fact that many people view shorter men as “less manly” or some such weird, toxic shit, which makes me very glad I opted out of all of that when I became interested in video games as a kid and men in adulthood. When people say that Wolverine should be a hulking beast of a tall guy, it’s usually because it conforms to some idealized image of what a man should look like. But that’s boring, and if that’s your problem, you should grow the fuck up. Wolverine is short in </span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975">Marvel Rivals</a>,</span></i><span> and it rules, actually.</span></p>   <p><span>But is Logan a proper short king in </span><i><span>Wolverine</span></i><span>? That we probably won’t know for sure until the game is out and people can rip the models from the files and properly measure him. Insomniac made a </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/insomniacleaks/comments/18s4pmr/character_scale/"><span>character scale reference sheet</span></a><span> that was part </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/wolverine-ps5-insomniac-games-leak-rhysida-hack-sony-1851111188"><span>of a leak in 2023</span></a><span>, which shows Logan is noticeably shorter than Mystique, Omega Red, and Sabretooth. So it doesn’t look like the studio is trying to size him up </span><i><span>too</span></i><span> much.&nbsp; Even so, Insomniac seems </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grantpdesign.bsky.social/post/3lzmjn7pdrs2g"><span>aware that not everyone thinks he’s short enough</span></a><span>. But shrinking a character model would have a massive ripple effect on nearly every animation in the game, so I’d be very surprised if Insomniac made a real change this far into development. Maybe as a secret unlockable mode down the line, but for now, the height debate will rage on until </span><i><span>Wolverine </span></i><span>launches on PS5 in 2026.</span></p>

<p>"If we had realized the change would be happening so close to the subscription launch, we wouldn't have done it," Nisser said. "In addition, we always aim to communicate upcoming price changes to our community and in this case we missed doing that as well. So basically we messed up in a couple of different ways, particularly both internal coordination and community communication and ... the results speak for themselves. The community has been pretty clear that they felt it looked like we were trying to push people into the subscription, and I completely understand that. For better or worse that's not the case, literally just a mishap."</p><p>To do good by the game's ardent fanbase, Starbreeze has not only apologized but also completely reversed course. The Infamous Collection is back to its original $118 price, with an additional 31% off on top of that, bringing the bundle down to $84.92 (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/34119/PAYDAY_2_Infamous_Collection/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Steam</a>).</p><p>"The community has been pretty clear about how it looks next to the subscription launch--and they're not wrong, it's terrible timing," Nisser said. "We definitely didn't handle this right, and we'll be apologising to the community. Hopefully there will be at least some acceptance that this was an honest mistake."</p><p>Both the Infamous Collection and the Subscription program are strictly for Payday 2, not <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/payday-3/" data-ref-id="5000-455016">Payday 3</a>. That's seemingly because, according to SteamDB data, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1272080/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Payday 3 doesn't tend to crack 1,000 concurrent players</a> while <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/218620/charts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Payday 2 frequently has tens of thousands playing</a> at any given time. The former is clearly more popular than the latter.</p><p>The Infamous Collection (only available for the PC version of the game right now) features over 70 pieces of DLC, including various cosmetics, weapons, characters, and more. You don't have to spend $118 (or $84.92) for any of these packs, though, as they're all available piecemeal and currently discounted on Steam.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A major update and overhaul for the 4X strategy game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ara-history-untold">Ara: History Untold</a> has been released, with version 2.0, dubbed the Revolutions Update, out now.</p>
<p><iframe title="v2.0 Revolutions Update | Ara: History Untold" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z5xFw_o-ANs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This update is when we see the fruits of the new development partnership with Stardock, who stepped into a production role to further the game’s post-launch roadmap earlier this year. The revolutions update has been developed with key community feedback, building in a new culture and influence system, units specific to certain nations, quota crafting systems and more.</p>
<p>Here’s the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Culture &amp; Influence Systems – </strong>Cities gain a new quality of life category called Culture. Culture generates Influence, a new currency used to acquire cultural traits and expand territory through claims. This creates meaningful alternatives to military expansion.</li>
<li><strong>Agitator Unit – </strong>Introduced with the Revolutions technology at the end of the Renaissance, Agitators can be sent into adjacent foreign regions to stir rebellion and, through Influence, bring those territories into your nation. This unlocks a second form of conquest in Act II: ideological subversion.</li>
<li><strong>Per-Nation Units – </strong>Every civilization now commands unique historical forces, from Mongol Horse Archers to Japanese Samurai, adding tactical depth and flavor.</li>
<li><strong>Leader Redesigns – </strong>Every leader has been reimagined with unique mechanics, traits, and abilities, ensuring more replayability and personality-driven diplomacy.</li>
<li><strong>Priority &amp; Quota Crafting System – </strong>Micromanaged production queues are replaced with smarter stockpile and priority controls, freeing players to focus on high-level strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Adaptive AI – </strong>A more dynamic and personality-driven AI responds to player performance, making diplomacy, warfare, and resource management more challenging and believable.</li>
<li><strong>Map Generation Overhaul – </strong>Realistic natural resource clustering plus new exclusivity rules modeling historical trade and competition.</li>
<li><strong>High DPI UI &amp; Visual Update – </strong>A sharper, scalable UI built for modern displays, with new accessibility and customization options.</li>
<li><strong>Performance Boosts – </strong>Major engine optimizations deliver faster turns, smoother framerates, and reduced CPU usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>“We’re thrilled to introduce Culture as a gameplay element in <em>Ara: History Untold</em>,” stated Brad Wardell, CEO of Stardock and Oxide. “The importance of ‘soft power’ is immense. Although military conquest is the most straightforward method for territorial expansion, we aimed to provide players with alternative strategies for asserting their influence over the world. This becomes particularly significant in the late game, when exploration and expansion have already reached their limits.”</p>

<p>Ara: History Untold is one of a number of historical 4X titles that have sprung up to challenge Civilization – especially looking to launch ahead of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/14/civilization-7-review/">Civ 7</a> – each introducing their own twist on how to deal with the passage of time. Now, with Civ 7’s stumbles, there’s a chance to carve out an audience for this game through steady updates and community building. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/23/ara-history-untold-review/">our review</a>, I said, “Ara: History Untold is another distinctive take on the historical 4X strategy genre, putting a real emphasis on furthering your nation, managing supply chains and resources, and shifting the focus away from warring mentality it’s so easy to sink into. There’s room to grow, but this is a strong contender.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new update for Borderlands 4 was <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/">pushed to all platforms today</a>, adding an FOV slider for console players, stability and performance improvements for all platforms, UI, audio, visual, gear refinements, and more.</p>



<p>As the latest entry in Gearbox's shooter series, even with <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/borderlands-4/">critical acclaim from multiple outlets</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-sold-2-million-units-earned-150-million/">major commercial success right at launch</a>, the story of Borderlands 4 isn't about everyone grabbing their own copies and having a blast. </p>



<p>It's about the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-developer-says-fixing-pc-performance-is-top-priority/">poor technical performance at launch</a>, Gearbox boss <a href="https://wccftech.com/gearbox-boss-tells-4k-stubborn-players-switch-1440p-use-dlss/">Randy Pitchford's bizarre approach of antagonizing players upset at the state of the game</a>, and, as of two days ago, how the <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-pre-orders-cancelled/">Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game has been indefinitely delayed</a> while Gearbox works on the versions already in players' hands.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Today's update, and every update that'll come after it, is slowly trying to chip away at that narrative and turn it around from 'Borderlands 4 is broken but fun' to 'Borderlands 4 is fun.'</p>



<p>Starting with stability updates and performance improvements, which are key elements of today's update, and will likely remain key elements of every update going forward. Character animations have been updated, issues of frame rate hitching and crashes have been addressed, and several issues where players didn't get the rewards they were owed from completing an objective have been fixed. </p>



<p>For console players, an FOV slider has finally been added, and for all players, there's a series of balance changes for each of the Vault Hunters and several gameplay elements.</p>



<p>It's all a start, of course, but the work on Borderlands 4 is far from done. Hopefully, it doesn't take Gearbox too much longer to fix the myriad of issues the game launched with. Though with how many problems the game had, it feels like we're in this for the long haul.</p>

                  Rahul Kohli has been in video games before, but he says this gig is ‘a dream come true’
                </p><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/saros-sci-fi-trailer-returnal-housemarque-ps5-state-of-play-2000628274"><i><span>Saros</span></i></a><span>, the next action game from </span><i><span>Returnal </span></i><span>developers Housemarque, was one of the tentpole games during yesterday’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/state-of-play-playstation-5-sony-stream-youtube-twitch-2000628258"><span>State of Play presentation</span></a><span>. The game stars </span><i><span>iZombie </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>The Fall of the House of Usher </span></i><span>actor Rahul Kohli as Arjun Devraj, a soldier investigating a foreign planet full of vicious aliens who will kill him over and over again. Kohli has starred in a few video games, including </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/modern-warfare-3-call-of-duty-single-player-campaign-1850991005"><i><span>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stray-gods-review-musical-songs-grace-laura-bailey-1850747942"><i><span>Stray Gods: The Roleplaying Musical</span></i></a><span>, but this is easily his biggest game role yet, and the dude seems stoked to be there.</span></p>

 <p><span>In a post on Bluesky, Kohli laid out how video games have always been part of his hopes and dreams. As a kid, he wanted to make video games. He used to work in a game store, and one of his first acting gigs was in a commercial for </span><i><span>LittleBigPlanet </span></i><span>on Vita. So really, it’s all been leading up to this point.</span></p>    <blockquote><p><span>I know it’s cliche to say “this is a dream come true” but in the case of </span><i><span>Saros</span></i><span>, it really is. My first hobby/love was gaming. Before I left primary school, we were asked in assembly to tell the school what we wanted to do for a career. I played a VHS of video game trailers and said I wanted to make video games.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>One of my first jobs was working as a sales assistant at Gamestation (the UK equivalent of GameStop). One of my earliest paid acting gigs was a commercial for Little Big Planet on the PS Vita – I thought I finally made it. My next gig after starring in </span><i><span>iZOMBiE</span></i><span> was playing Fahz in </span><i><span>Gears 5</span></i><span>, I didn’t think anything could top that… until I was approached by Housemarque to play the lead in </span><i><span>Saros</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It’s been a long journey to get here, each moment along the way was special and the final destination isn’t just a career highlight, it’s one of the best moments of my life. Thank you HouseMarque with trusting me with your character, I hope Arjun is everything you asked for. And for the players, see you on March 20th.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>That’s sweet. I was a big fan of Kohli’s performance in </span><i><span>The</span></i> <i><span>Fall of the House of Usher</span></i><span>, so I’m interested to see what he brings to the role of Arjun when </span><i><span>Saros </span></i><span>comes to PlayStation 5 on March 20. </span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-remastered-trailer-ugly-bad-comparison-ps5-pc-mods-nightdive-2000628799</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-new-deus-ex-remaster-is-a-reminder-that-better-isn%E2%80%99t-always-better.1309086/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Just because a remaster of an old game has improved textures, better lighting, runs at a higher resolution, and features fancy new effects doesn’t mean it’s better. I mean, <em>technically</em> it is, but the end result can often look very ugly and wrong. And sadly, this is the case with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/state-of-play-playstation-5-sony-stream-youtube-twitch-2000628258#:~:text=One%20of%20the,on%20February%205.">recently announced <em>Deus Ex Remastered.</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em></p> <p>Yesterday, during Sony’s short and so-so State of Play, we got our first look at a newly announced remaster of the classic immersive sim <em>Deus Ex</em>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musks-favorite-game-is-getting-remastered-25-years-later-2000628283">This new version of Elon Musk’s favorite video game</a> is being marketed as a remaster, with higher resolution textures and fancier lighting. And yes, technically, what is seen in the trailer is “better” than the original release. These are higher-resolution textures with more detail. Models are more detailed and complicated, too. What’s here is better in the sense that it is all stuff that couldn’t have been done 25 years ago in 2000. And yet many online, myself included, aren’t impressed with <em>Deus Ex Remastered’</em>s “improved” visuals. In fact, I think the new game looks really terrible.</p> <p>You would think that replacing the old textures from 2000 with new and higher-resolution textures would make<em> Deus Ex</em> look great. The problem with this new remastered port isn’t that the textures are bad, but that they are being slapped on a very old game. The models, levels, and other parts of<em> Deus Ex</em> were designed 25 years ago, with the tech limitations of the period in mind. The original devs and artists worked within those limits to create art that offered just enough detail and let your mind fill in the gaps.</p>

  <p>Covering the game in new, sharp textures that don’t seem to take into consideration the art design and intentions behind the visuals of the OG <em>Deus Ex</em> leads to an odd juxtaposition. You have the old game running under this new skin that feels out of place. Add in new lighting that changes the mood and appearance of the characters and world even more, and you end up with this odd plastic-y look that we’ve also seen in other similar remasters, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-trilogys-san-andreas-now-feels-depressing-without-i-1848047292?_gl=1*242l6h*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTQzNTAyMi4xMDQuMS4xNzMxNDQ1MjEwLjYwLjAuMA..">like the infamous <em>GTA Trilogy</em> bundle</a>. It’s also the same look I spotted in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-remastered-review-pc-lara-croft-1851250080">remastered<em> Tomb Raider</em> games,</a> which were also developed by Aspyr, the same team that’s behind <em>Deus Ex Remastered.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p>Reactions to the <em>Deus Ex Remastered</em> trailer have been nearly universally negative. People have criticized the plastic-like sheen on everything, the way the game now seems filled with <em>Doom 3</em>-like stencil shadows, and the overall vibes of this new remaster being off. One highly upvoted comment on YouTube said: “Upgraded visuals from 2000 to 2005.” In direct comparisons between the two, it’s hard not to see the remastered <em>Deus Ex</em> as anything but an ugly mess.</p>   <p>It seems like the remastered version of <em>Deus Ex</em> will be the worst way to replay the original game, especially considering the fact that for decades, fans have created incredible mods that improve the game in smart ways without altering its overall look and vibes too much.</p>

 <p>And that’s the most annoying thing to me about this remastered version of <em>Deus Ex.</em> There are ways to remaster and modernize old games and make them look great. <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-star-wars-game-dark-forces-fps-remaster-ps5-xbox-1851294048">Nightdive Studios has done some fantastic work</a> bringing back classic titles, like <em>Dark Forces</em> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-thing-remastered-2002-ps2-xbox-pc-sequel-4k-120-ps5-1851524769"><em>The Thing,</em></a> without making these games look horrible. I think the key is that Nightdive is very careful with the new art it adds to its projects. They tend to create remasters that perhaps aren’t as “fancy” as some others but which almost always look like you remember the games looking back in the day, despite them very much not appearing that way back in the ’90s. Nightdive also tends to let you turn off many or most of the new visual features, too, which is always an appreciated option.</p> <p>So you can definitely remaster a classic game in a faithful way. It can be done. Sadly, for <em>Deus Ex,</em> it seems that it won’t be so lucky with this remaster, and instead, we are left with an overly shiny and visually jarring port of <a href="https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-25-years-ion-storm-looking-glass-warren-ellis-1851784985">one of the best PC games of all time</a>. Ah well, at least it’s easy as heck to play and mod on PC in 2025.</p>
