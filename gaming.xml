            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/factorio-space-age-dlc-sales-400k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Factorio: Space Age&nbsp;</em>has reached a pretty impressive sales milestone despite being on release for less than a week, developer Wube Software has revealed.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-434" rel="noopener" target="_blank">latest Friday Facts</a>&nbsp;<em>Factorio&nbsp;</em>blog post, Wube says that&nbsp;<em>Space Age&nbsp;</em>sales have passed the 400,000 mark. Earlier this week,&nbsp;<em>Factorio&nbsp;</em>enjoyed its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/factorio-player-count-space-age-20-update">highest ever concurrent player count</a>&nbsp;thanks to the launch of said DLC, as well as the base game's 2.0 update.</p>

<p>By way of one "last little surprise" for&nbsp;<em>Space Age</em>, Wube also announced a new feature called the Galaxy of Fame. Essentially, when you finish&nbsp;<em>Space Age</em>'s campaign, you'll be able to upload a snapshot of your game, which will then add your game's info and stats to a collective gallery.</p>

Wube says it isn't banning "saves that use cheats/commands/editor" yet, although more "filtering options" will soon be added.</p>

<p>The studio also provides an update on&nbsp;<em>Factorio: Space Age&nbsp;</em>and the 2.0 update for Nintendo Switch. Sadly, if you were hoping for the DLC to hit Nintendo's console, there's some bad news: the Switch isn't getting&nbsp;<em>Space Age</em>.</p>

<p>Wube says that there's "simply not enough RAM" in the Switch to fit&nbsp;<em>Space Age</em>'s new factories, nor is there enough CPU to run the DLC at 60fps thanks to the expanded systems. New sprites also won't fit in the Switch's VRAM, apparently.</p>

<p>However, the 2.0 update will be making its way to the Switch. Wube says it should arrive in "1-2 months", although the studio is reluctant to commit to a release date "since the release process on consoles takes a long time".</p>




<p><em>Factorio: Space Age&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/645390/Factorio_Space_Age/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, and the base game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">also available on Steam</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/factorio-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

If you look at titles such as <em>Resident Evil 4</em> and <em>Resident Evil 2</em>, they clearly know how to modernize famous franchises for today’s audiences, while remaining mainly faithful to the source material. They’re playing on our nostalgia, and everyone wins. Add to that, <em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</em>.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196215" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Resident Evil Goes VR And More New Releases | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="68" data-playlist="196215,196055,196572" data-current="196215"><div><p>The Best Resident Evil Goes VR And More New Releases | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196215/196215_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196215/196215_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196215/196215_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196215/196215_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21757.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>After spending nearly one hundred hours playing as Frank West this go-around, I don’t have many bad things to say. But you’re not here for my personal opinions, you’re here to check out the Steam user reviews—the best of the best and worst of the worst, with perhaps a few meme reviews thrown in for good measure, right?</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-drdr-capcom-frank-changes-1851658921&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-drdr-capcom-frank-changes-1851658921">Capcom Explains Why Frank West Looks So Different In Dead Rising’s Remaster</a></span> </p><p>Things definitely skew well for the game. At the time of writing, <em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</em> is sitting on a solid “Very Positive” rating, with 83 percent of reviews in favor.</p><p>Most positive reviews left by satisfied users fall into two categories: They’ve either played for a handful of hours, usually under ten, and are satisfied with the general experience. Or you have those who spend tens or hundreds of hours scouring every inch of the Willamette Mall, and they still love the game. Most point toward the quality-of-life features like the ability to skip time between cases, and the overall polish of the remaster. It’s a stable, smooth game that’s downright fun to play.</p><p>However, even the most user-friendly gaming experience will attract negative reviews. <em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</em> isn’t perfect, and the bad reviews point out its flaws in spades. They indicate poor voice acting, complaints of censorship, missing content, and stuttering issues that mar the overall experience.</p><p>If you’re still on the fence about this wacky survival horror experience set in the confines of a Midwest mall, here is <em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</em>, as told by Steam reviews!</p><figure id="" data-id="b8039459fc3bb1b0aa4e2b8b4188ec5b"

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-management-to-blame-for-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-sales-issues-baldurs-gate-3-exec-says/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Those looking to for a reason as to why Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown sold below expectations thus leading to a sequel being rejected need to look to the top of Ubisoft. </p>



<p>That’s what Michael Douse, the director of publishing at Baldur’s Gate 3 developer Larian Studios, had to say about the situation. </p>



<p>In a social media post (h/t <a href="https://80.lv/articles/baldur-s-gate-3-publishing-director-blames-ubisoft-for-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-s-poor-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">80 Level</a>), Douse pointed the fingers at Ubisoft management, saying that the decision to not release the game on Steam day one hurt any chance of the game’s success.</p>



<p>“The last notable game on their platform was arguably Far Cry 6 in 2021,” <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1849147473354211400" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Douse said</a>. “The Crew, Mirage and Avatar came in 2023 and didn’t perform, so you can assume subscriptions were at a lull when PoP released by 2024. Which means people wouldn’t be launching their store all too much.</p>



<p>“If it had released on Steam not only would it have been a market success, but there would likely be a sequel because the team are so strong.”</p>



<p>He then went on to call out the game’s critical success across the board.</p>



<p>“It’s such a broken strategy,” he said. “The hardest thing is to make a 85+ game — it is much, much easier to release one. It just shouldn’t be done as it was.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown has sold around one million copies since its launch, far below what the internal expectations were for the game. Insider Gaming learned that Ubisoft was was expecting the game to sell on par, or better, than some of biggest Metroidvania’s in the market. When that didn’t happen right away, a decision was made to move on from the project.</p>



<p>Now, the team that developed Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown is no more after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-three-new-projects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft disbanded them to move on</a> to different games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-finally-fixes-blu-scouts-pants-17-years-after-team-fortress-2-came-out<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve has finally fixed a problem with Team Fortress 2 that’s been in the game since it launched 17 years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since the influential hero shooter came out on October 10, 2007, the Scout’s pants on the blue side were the wrong color. Now, among <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/oldnews/231496" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patch notes</a> for a recently released Team Fortress 2 update, Valve buried the big news: Scout’s pants are now fixed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the rather innocuous line from the patch notes:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed BLU Scout using the incorrect team color pants</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">In typical Valve fashion, it made the change without explanation or fanfare. No explanation for why it’s taken 17 years to change the color of Scout’s pants, and no reason for why it’s done so only now. Ever mysterious, Valve is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s fair to say the reaction from the Team Fortress 2 community has been a mix of shock and excitement. “They changed a character design 17 years later! What!” X/Twitter user @heavyfortres asked.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— heavy team fortres 2 (@heavyfortres) <a href="https://twitter.com/heavyfortres/status/1849564536795242979?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 24, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Honestly I can't believe they did it,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/1gbcl0t/comment/ltl0s4x/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor KyleTheWalrus added</a>. “BLU Scout had gray pants and blue belt loops for 17 years, and he has several cosmetics that require the gray pants color to work correctly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If they fixed anything, I was sure they would just make the belt loops gray because it's easier. But those crazy bastards took the hard route.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Now we wait another 17 years for the rest of Scout's pants cosmetics to become the correct shade of blue. Hooray!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve’s relationship with the Team Fortress 2 community has certainly had its ups and downs over the years. The game’s had an awful bot problem for some time, and exacerbated players often call for Valve to do more to clamp down. They’ve also asked for more support and content for Team Fortress 2 from Valve, which, some say, is more focused on its other, more popular games. Team Fortress 2 remains incredibly popular, though, and is among one of Steam’s most played games ahead of the likes of Warframe, Overwatch 2, and Destiny 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/team-fortress-2-players-make-an-actual-book-out-of-340000-anti-bot-petition-signatures-and-deliver-it-to-valve-hq">Team Fortress 2 players got creative in the fight against the shooter's rampant bot problem</a> by turning a 340,000 signature strong petition into an actual book and delivering it to Valve headquarters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>A new update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-college-football-25/" data-ref-id="5000-618409">EA Sports College Football 25</a> is here, and a whole lot more college athletes are being added to the game--718 of them, to be precise. The update also contains upgrades to player abilities, rating adjustments, Team Builder, and generative AI features. Here's everything that's new, as well as the full patch notes.</p><p>The update is adding 718 new NIL players, and also new to the game is Nissan Stadium, which will be the default stadium for PlayStation tournaments. The latest update also includes a number of ratings updates for players, as well as an update to overall team rankings. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-uniforms-in-ea-sports-college-football-25/2900-5621/" data-ref-id="2900-5621">Uniform</a> pieces have also been updated or newly added for almost 50 teams in the game.</p><p>The new update also adds Play A Friend mode to College Ultimate Team for the first time, and increased the AP limit to 12 for Season 3.</p><p>Also new in the update is an upgrade for Team Builder that adds Adobe Express integration, providing generative AI tools to create designs, which could prove to be controversial for some players. The tools can be accessed from the logos page, where you'll now see a "Create with Adobe Express" link. You'll need to create or log into an existing Adobe account to use Express, which will provide 25 credits. These can be spent to generate new logos, or you can use to Express create something from scratch.</p><p>While these are the main new additions in the patch, it also contains a whole lot of bug fixes, covering common bugs across regular gameplay, Dynasty, Ultimate Team, and more.</p><p>For everything that's new in the latest update, check out the full patch notes below:</p><h2>Title Update Notes</h2><h3>GAMEPLAY</h3><h4>General</h4><ul><li>Refreshed the Ability Loadouts of players in Front End Rosters.  <ul><li>DEV NOTE: <i>These ability changes are based on current player performance this season and changes to their ratings.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/25/towers-of-aghasba-preview-explore-survive-and-rebuild-in-a-withered-ecosystem/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Towers of Aghasba is a fascinating melting pot of ideas, both novel and new, and borrowed from other games, movies and anime. It’s one of those games that feels almost impossibly ambitious, Dreamlit inc. crafting a truly gorgeous game world that you’ll shape as you fill it with life.</p>
<p><iframe title="Towers of Aghasba: Early Access Gameplay Showcase + Release Date Announcement!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Cm-02rxXdY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game will take you to the desolate landscapes of Aghasba, a region that was once home to huge amounts of vibrant life, both in nature and with the Shimu people settled there. That civilisation and the balance of ecosystems was torn apart by the Withered, forcing the Shimu to flee. Now you, as a junior architect for your people, are returning to restore Aghasba to something of its former glory.</p>


<p>Dreamlit inc. CEO and game director Khang Lee is refreshingly open about how he came to the core concept of Towers of Aghasba, and how it’s morphed over time. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/minecraft">Minecraft</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/30/shadow-of-the-colossus-remake-review/">Shadow of the Colossus</a>, and the films <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausica%C3%A4_of_the_Valley_of_the_Wind_(film)">Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_(1986_film)">Labyrinth</a> were all amongst the early inspirations for this game – essentially, looking to harness the creativity of Minecraft within a much prettier art style and world – and Towers of Aghasba actually started out as a 2D side scrolling game. But then came <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review/">Breath of the Wild</a> to push the studio’s ambitions further – you can see it in the free climbing and glider – and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/animal-cross-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> to refocus the game in a different direction. What was a survival game in 2019 has had some of the edges of that genre sanded back to morph into more of a building and exploration game.</p>


<p>You’ll naturally need to start off small as you plant your first Colossal Tree – it starts off relatively small, but will grow to live up to its name over time – a life-giving tree that will instantly spread grasses and other plant life in the immediate surrounding area. It will define the biome of the region, bring creatures back to the area and create a little pocket of vibrant life for you to live in. There’s some really fantastical creature designs here, that blend the familiar with utterly alien.</p>
<p>It will also provide the foundation for a lot of the general activities you’ll be doing, giving you the opportunities to hunt, to fish, to feed the animals and more. One point of emphasis here compared to other survival and builder games is that you will likely want to try and be sustainable in how you do this, ensuring the the ecosystem can continue to thrive alongside your actions.</p>

<p>In parallel to the local ecology, you’ll also look to rebuild villages for the Shimu. You’ll come across the ruins from before the Withered forced your people away, and have to rebuild structure-by-structure. You’ll need to find and harvest the minerals to build the structures, and then use them to foster things like farming, production and more.</p>
<p>Helping to guide you is the world’s lore and a menagerie of characters and ancient gods that you’ll meet along the way. They’ll explore some of the backstory of the world, helping you figure out what happened to the island, giving you quests and missions to follow along the way. It’s really more about onboarding you and nudging you along the way to restore the island in your own way.</p>

<p>And that will mean fighting to push back the Withered and unlock new areas that you can restore. Still filled with a poisonous atmosphere and more horrific creatures, you’ll have to battle against towering monsters to loosen the Withered’s grip on the region.</p>
<p>Your time within the Withered will be limited, every second that you spend within these dark places seeing an inky black miasma bubbling around you, slowly poisoning you over time. The survival aspects of Towers of Aghasba won’t extend to needing food to satiate your hunger –&nbsp;it’s more casual in that regard –&nbsp;but as you step into the Withered, you’ll need to have crafted potions to help build a resistance to the atmosphere, armour to defend against the monsters and soldiers you face, and weapons to help you fight back.</p>
<p>Thankfully you won’t have to go alone. You can play in groups of up to four, inviting friends to your personal island, trading with them, and heading in to fight back the Withered together.</p>

<p>Towers of Aghasba is a fascinating endeavour that looks to strike an intriguing balance and blend between its various inspirations. It’s a lovely looking game, with an impressive scale and ambition to let you shape it as you please.</p>
<p>Thankfully it won’t be too long before we can try it for ourselves. Towers of Aghasba will launch into Early Access on PC and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> on 19th November, a little less than a month from now.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-13-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zenless-zone-zero-version-1-3-set-to-launch-next-month.1019295/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-13-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.3, and it'll bring two new S-level characters to add to your team, plus new areas to explore and more.</p>

<p>Version 1.3 arrives on November 6th, and just like in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-12-release-date">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>updates, you can look forward to an expansion of the game's main story. This time around, you'll be working alongside the Hollow Investigative Association to respond to a new threat.</p>

<p>Two major S-level characters will be added to the game in this update as well. The first, Yanagi, is an Electric-Anomaly fighter who can boost Disorder damage for the team and "rapidly deal massive amounts of damage to enemies" with her Ex Special Attack.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-1.3-lighter.jpg?itok=_HtZT77y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-1.3-lighter.jpg?itok=HiD-Oqne 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lighter is one of two fighters being added to&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>in Version 1.3.</figcaption></figure><p>Your other fighter this update is Lighter, a Fire-Stun agent who can buff himself by building up his Morale as well as lowering enemies' resistances to the Ice and Fire elements. Two new A-level Bangboos, Baddieboo and Knightboo, are also coming in Version 1.3.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to two brand new gameplay modes. The first, The Mystery of Arpeggio Fault, is a roguelike mode that offers the chance to battle through "random environments with random Resonia and resources".</p>

<p>The Simulated Battle Trial, meanwhile, is pretty much what you think it is based on the name; it lets you practise your combat skills as you hack through increasingly tough enemies, and you can earn Polychromes and Badges by reaching certain levels in said trial.</p>




<p>In case you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>is, it's the latest action RPG from&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a>&nbsp;</em>studio HoYoverse. Unlike those games,&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>takes place in an urban fantasy world that's not a million miles away from the likes of&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>.</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise, however,&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>takes its cues from games like&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry</em>; it revolves around dealing quick damage, dodging enemy attacks, and racking up combos, although it does still feature HoYoverse's signature gacha mechanics.</p>

<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>is available to play right now for free on <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon%E2%80%99s-like-a-dragon-works-better-as-a-mob-drama-than-a-yakuza-adaptation.1019292/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24278893/amazon-like-a-dragon-yakuza-prime-tv<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>It was late when I watched the first episode of Amazon Prime Video’s <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em>. I bargained with myself to watch one episode before sleep; three episodes later, I finally went to bed. Let’s get this out of the way: if you’re looking for <em>Like a Dragon </em>to be a faithful representation of the<em> Yakuza </em>video game series, you’re going to be disappointed. But that’s what makes it worth watching. <em>Like a Dragon</em>’s unique approach to storytelling blends two different timelines together, making for a show that works on its own merit, without needing all the trappings of a<em> Yakuza </em>video<em> </em>game.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Like a Dragon</em> is Amazon’s second bite at the video game adaptation apple after the surprising success of its <em>Fallout</em> show. It stars Ryoma Takeuchi as Kazuma Kiryu, an orphaned youth who joins the Tojo yakuza clan with dreams of earning the title of Dragon of Dojima.</p><p><em>Like a Dragon</em>’s story is loosely based on the events of the first two <em>Yakuza</em> games and is told across two concurrently running timelines in 1995 and 2005. Each of the series’ six episodes jumps between the two time periods, chronicling Kiryu’s rise and fall as a yakuza member, the shattering of his chosen family, and how those pieces are violently smashed back together 10 years later.</p><div><figcaption><em>Kiryu (far left) and the members of his chosen family.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Amazon MGM Studios</cite></p></div><p>What initially shocked me most about <em>Like a Dragon</em> and what most cleanly separates it from its source material is all the violence. I’m aware of the irony: this is a mob show; people tend to get hurt in those. But the <em>Yakuza </em>series has always been deliberate in how it depicts violence. Guns are rare and murder is rarer, but <em>Like a Dragon</em> has both in abundance. The games also depict their fair share of blood, but those are typically in street brawls fought with fists and the occasional traffic cone. There was one murder in the show, of a civilian no less, so shocking in its casual execution that it actually made me queasy.</p><div><p>Like a Dragon probably won’t do for Yakuza what Fallout did for… well, Fallout</p></div><p>All the time skipping is the most interesting element of the show and the reason I don’t mind that it bears little resemblance to the games. In 1995, Kiryu was surrounded by the love of his chosen family and the respect of his yakuza brothers. By 2005, all of that had rotted away into distant animosity, and it was fun watching how the show reconciled it all. Rather than simply tell the story chronologically, <em>Like a Dragon</em> intentionally created gaps in understanding with one timeline and then filled them in with the other. In 1995, Kiryu has two father figures: the ex-yakuza who raised him in an orphanage and his clan leader. In 2005, both men are absent, and Kiryu has since been branded as an oyagoroshi — or “father killer.” The back and forth created a thrilling tension, compelling me to work alongside the show to piece the plot together like it was a mystery in addition to its basic gangster plot of revenge and betrayal. And I was pleasantly surprised by the resolution.</p><p>Since <em>Like a Dragon</em>’s violence feels antithetical to the spirit of the source material, I’m glad that the show didn’t also try to incorporate the series’ wackier elements. <em>Yakuza</em> is a video game and is therefore not subject to the mundanities of realism. Kiryu fighting grown men in diapers — a regular occurrence in the games — works because you, the player, are in on the joke and are participating in its telling.</p><div><figcaption><em>The show’s set and styling are the most like the </em>Yakuza<em> games rather than the story itself.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Amazon MGM Studio</cite></p></div><p>But while <em>Yakuza</em>’s heartfelt story of redemption and its aesthetics as a Japanese gangster thriller translated well to TV, its over-the-top goofiness doesn’t. The story can’t bear that level of irreverence because there’s no player driving the action. Cutting from a moment of extreme violence to Kiryu at the Kamurocho batting cages, while a totally authentic representation of the games, would have created a tonal whiplash that would have taken even the most diehard <em>Yakuza</em> fan out of the show.&nbsp;</p><p>But dispensing with comedy in exchange for drama does mean the show gets a bit tedious in its later episodes. Paramount’s <em>Halo</em> series also bears no resemblance to its source material, but it was interesting as hell (and canceled far too soon) because it was willing to use familiar characters in totally new narratives. <em>Like a Dragon</em> adds some new characters and remixes familiar story elements, but it’s basically the same story I’ve experienced before in the games.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Kiryu fighting grown men in diapers — a regular occurrence in the games — works because you, the player, are in on the joke</p></div><p>A lot of video game adaptations fail because they seem to operate from the premise that being just like the game is entertainment enough. The story gets twisted to fit all the little details that’ll make a fan sit up and say, “I get that reference,” leading to a boring, annoying mess, like when <em>Doom</em> shoehorned in that nausea-inducing first-person sequence. But <em>Like a Dragon</em> works precisely because it didn’t go for being a straight-up recreation of the games. It probably won’t do for<em> Yakuza</em> what <em>Fallout</em> did for… well, <em>Fallout</em>. But <em>Like a Dragon</em> is made better because it puts being good TV first over being a faithful adaptation.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Rebecca Jones (RPS in peace) really liked <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/10-dead-doves">10 Dead Doves</a> when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/13-great-steam-next-fest-demos-to-get-you-started-this-october">she wrote about it</a> back in 2022, saying it reminded her of why she “loves weird low-budget spooks so much”. Discovering such an interesting project speaks to curiosity and taste on her part, but me? I am simply a pun enjoying buffon who got an email promising that “Dovecraftian horrors await”. The thrust of said electronic mail was that the game now has a release date of this December, but it looked neat, so I doved right in. I coo-dn’t resist. I too love weird low-budget <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a>. I have been pigeonholed.</p>

<p>Distinct from the implied narrative conceit mainly revolving around poisoned chips, 10 Dead Doves opens with Marcus - “the Most Pathetic Man on Earth” - going backpacking on the Appalachian Trail with his buddy Sean, searching for an urban-legendary place called “The Ant Farm”. Presentation is all medium poly papercraft and fixed angles, tank controls and all. It’s very odd and very fun. You can grab the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1564540/10_Dead_Doves/">demo here</a>, by the way.</p>
<p>This is likely part cop-out and part time constraints, but I feel the highest praise I can give what I’ve played of 10 Dead Doves is that I don’t feel I could adequately do it word-justice in anything less than a much longer article. I will say this: while I do not feel it’s attempting to be the indie game equivalent of an A24 film in any way, I do <em>feel</em> that my fellow A24 wankers will likely appreciate it. I’d compare it to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/indika">Indika</a>, almost, in the way it uses the sort of camera techniques, spatial tricks and disorientating artistry that feel like they’re film specific, but are actually implemented in ways only a game could pull off.</p><p>If this sounds overly worthy or highfalutin, I should say that it’s also just very funny. Nothing sums up the scrappy avant-garde approach better than the devs singing the game title acapella over the splash screen. Some of the language used in the more eldritch sections is winkingly baroque, and the way the character’s faces dart jarringly between distinct expressions is brilliant. I actually didn’t finish the entire demo since I plan to grab this on release, but it’s shot right up for me as a must-play for the year. It’s a Columbidae-te, then.

Complete <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/factorio">Factorio</a>'s Space Age DLC and - feelings of acute megalomania aside - you will be able to upload a snapshot of your game to the "Galaxy of Fame", this being a digital night sky from which your cataclysmic industrial exploits shall gaze down eternally, for the instruction and/or disillusionment of tomorrow's factory <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builders</a>. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The star map, which you can check out <a href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-434">here</a>, is developer Wube Software's "last little surprise for Space Age", which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/factorios-space-age-expansion-is-out-now-adding-asteroid-factories-frostpunky-iceworlds-and-rotting-jungles">launched earlier this week</a>. You'll be prompted to upload your game to it once you've reached interstellar space. It lets you save general map info, such as time played, together with a chart view of planets and platforms and your item, energy and kill stats. You can update your solar system once you've enshrined it for posterity, but be aware that each player can only have one star at once.
</p>
<p>
"You can browse around and see other peoples factories and see how they work," the developers continue. "You might notice that some of the maps look a bit suspicious, well at this time we aren't blocking saves that use cheats/commands/editor, as we don't want to be overly restrictive, but we will add some filtering options soon." 
</p>
<p>
I'm posting this partly because a lot of people are playing Factorio right now - the Space Age DLC has gone down a treat on Steam - and partly because I enjoy fanciful attempts at preserving player accomplishments in games. The Galaxy of Fame reminds me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noctis_(video_game)">Noctis</a>, the amazing experimental space exploration sim with some of the loveliest prismatic effects I've ever seen in a game.</p><p>Released over two decades ago, it allowed players to name the planets they discovered and share them in the form of an old-school database. You can still <a href="https://80.style/#/hsp">download those files with the app and visit the worlds in question</a>. I wonder if Factorio's cyclopean assembly lines will command similar nostalgia, in 20 years time.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-ceo-scores-eye-watering-payrise-despite-huge-layoffs.1019259/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella will see his salary increase by an eye-watering amount this fiscal year, despite the fact that Microsoft has laid off thousands of employees over the past twelve months or so.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://microsoft.gcs-web.com/node/33151/html#toc858775_24" rel="noopener" target="_blank">regulatory filing</a> by Microsoft, Nadella's pay will increase to $79.1 million this year, which is a 63% increase on his 2023 pay.</p>

<p>Most of that amount will be awarded in shares, but some of it is also a cash incentive, although Nadella <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-gets-791-mln-pay-2024-63" rel="noopener" target="_blank">did request a reduction</a> in said cash incentive in order to "reflect his personal accountability for the focus and speed required for the changes that today’s cybersecurity threat landscape showed were necessary".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/satya-nadella-microsoft-ceo-payrise.jpg?itok=kUVxtx2p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/satya-nadella-microsoft-ceo-payrise.jpg?itok=r6EV8KSF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella will earn a staggering amount of money this fiscal year.</figcaption></figure><p>News of Nadella's payrise was accompanied by the release of Microsoft's <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar24/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2024 annual fiscal report</a>, which revealed that Xbox revenue is up 50%, "driven by 44 points of net impact from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-activision-blizzard-merger-finalized">Activision Blizzard acquisition</a>".</p>

<p>The report states that this increase mainly reflects "the change of Activision Blizzard content from third-party to first-party", so it's essentially Microsoft incorporating Activision Blizzard's revenue into its own figures.</p>

<p>Additionally, the figure includes not only sales, but also Game Pass subscriptions, Cloud Gaming, and advertising, as well as other miscellaneous services.</p>

<p>Nadella's payrise and Microsoft's relative success this fiscal year come after thousands of layoffs at the company. Back in January, Microsoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report">let almost 2,000 employees go</a> from its gaming divisions, and those layoffs were followed by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-september">hundreds more back in September</a>.</p>

<p>Nadella isn't the only corporate CEO thriving amidst a very <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th">uncertain time for the gaming industry</a>. In June, it was revealed that EA CEO Andrew Wilson <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs">made over $25 million last year</a> despite that company also suffering <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-to-lay-off-5-of-its-workforce-amid-refocus-on-owned-ip-and-sports-games">hundreds of layoffs</a>.</p>

<p>A Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 player has figured out that Tactical Sprint Assist can cause a significant delay while aiming, and changing this setting can make the gameplay much faster for players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://x.com/Lightsfire_/status/1849520566715228207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lightsfire</a> on X (via <a href="https://www.vg247.com/this-one-setting-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-messing-up-players-aim-and-the-community-is-rushing-to-change-it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VG247</a>), enabling Tactical Sprint Assist on Black Ops 6 increases the time it takes for players to pull up their ADS. His video includes gameplay comparisons of when Sprint Assist is toggled as ‘Tactical Sprint Assist’ or set as ‘On’. You can see a visible delay when using the former, while just setting Sprint Assist as ‘On’ makes players pull up their guns much faster.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>*BLACK OPS 6 IMPORTANT SETTINGS* </p><p>Tactical sprint assist is causing a massive delay when aiming down sights this is what you should change it to</p><p>Retweet to help someone out! <a href="https://t.co/6JP6LYRpPl">pic.twitter.com/6JP6LYRpPl</a></p></div>— Lightsfire (@Lightsfire_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Lightsfire_/status/1849520566715228207?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 24, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>To change this setting in Black Ops 6, players should open the ‘Settings’ menu and select the ‘Movement’ tab. Here, they will find a ‘Sprint Assist’ option under ‘Intelligent Movement’. They should open it and select ‘On’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If players still want to use Tactical Sprint while having faster ADS, there’s a way to do that, too. Players should head to ‘Movement Advanced Settings’, and under the ‘Movement Behaviours Tab’, they will find an option called ‘Tactical Sprint Activation’. The player should open it and select ‘Single Tap Run’. Now, players can have faster ADS while using Tactical Sprint.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you’re after a devastating one-hit Sniper Rifle that delivers a single crushing blow to almost anywhere on the body, the best LW3A1 Black Ops 6 Sniper Rifle class is what you’re after, and we have the best way to maximize its strengths.</p>



<p>The LW3A1 Frostline reminds me of many, classic one-hit Sniper Rifles from CoD games down the years: The M40A3 from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, the Intervention from 2009’s Modern Warfare 2, and the KATT-AMR is a recent favorite of mine. Now, it’s the turn of the LW3A1 in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>—designed to honor the legacy of previous Sniper stalwarts.</p>



<p>When you start Black Ops 6, the LW3A1 is probably going to be your main multiplayer Sniper Rifle for a while, so let’s make the most of it, and turn it into your opponent’s living nightmare.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-lw3a1-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best LW3A1 Attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What a beauty. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> Long Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Stock Pad:</strong> Lightweight Pad</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> Extended Mag I</li>



<li><strong>Comb:</strong> Quickdraw Riser</li>



<li><strong>Stock:</strong> Heavy Stock</li>
</ul>



<p>To start the best LW3A1 Sniper Rifle Class in Black Ops 6, I’ve gone for a tasty <strong>Long Barrel</strong> as it gives the LW3A1 a bit more range, allowing the gun a better chance to one-shot from miles away. The <strong>Lightweight Pad</strong> reduces sway, making our stability firmer and aiming tighter, whereas the <strong>Extended Mag I</strong> is a staple of a single-shot class in need of some extra shots in reserve.</p>



<p>The <strong>Quickdraw Riser</strong> Comb drastically decreases ADS speed, allowing us to zap an enemy quicker—which is extremely useful for a big brute such as the LW3A1. Finally, the <strong>Heavy Stoc</strong>k boosts our Flinch Resistance, meaning if we’re lining up a shot and our opponent lands a couple of lucky shots, our aim should be fairly steady, and make it easier to pop their head in the hunt for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-black-ops-6-mastery-camo-in-multiplayer-zombies-warzone-all-camos-listed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Camos</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-lw3a1-frostline">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for LW3A1 Frostline</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1:</strong>&nbsp;Ghost</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2:</strong>&nbsp;Forward Intel</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3:</strong>&nbsp;Vigilance</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard:</strong>&nbsp;Overkill</li>



<li><strong>Lethal:</strong>&nbsp;Blast Trap</li>



<li><strong>Tactical:</strong>&nbsp;Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade:</strong>&nbsp;Spring Mine</li>
</ul>



<p>Recon Perks are the direction we’ve gone for with the LW3A1 Sniper Rifle as you want to be covert and have all the intelligence. <strong>Ghost</strong> naturally keeps you obscured as much as possible—protecting your position—<strong>Forward Intel</strong> makes the minimap bigger and gives us a handy look at where our targets are, and <strong>Vigilance </strong>produces a warning indicator if you are spotted—allowing you a split-second to take action.</p>



<p><strong>Overkill </strong>is the ideal Wildcard as we can pair our LW3A1 with something rapid for close quarters such as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-tanto-22-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tanto .22</a>. The <strong>Blast Trap</strong> is another piece of explosive insurance to fortify our position, the Stim Shot is a perfect pick-me-up to tank a few hits, and I’ve picked the <strong>Spring Mine</strong> to add another layer of defense.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-lw3a1-frostline">Best Secondary for LW3A1 Frostline</h2>



<p>If for some reason you disagree with our Overkill Wildcard pick, that’s fine, we still like you. But if you decide to do this, go for the <strong>Grekhova</strong> fully automatic Pistol because once you unlock it, you’ll never go back. It becomes available at <strong>Level 13</strong> (unlucky for your enemies!) and should become a mainstay in your loadout.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-lw3a1-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock LW3A1 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>Good news, the LW3A1 is unlocked from the beginning of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. It’s the only one of the Sniper Rifles to be available from the get-go, so reach Level 4 to unlock Loadouts, add it to a class, and start accumulating all the attachments I’ve listed in our best setup.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-lw3a1-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the LW3A1 any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p><strong>The LW3A1 is most certainly a very good gun</strong> as its one-hit-kill potential means it’s an extremely deadly weapon in even the most <em>average </em>of hands—and I mean this respectfully. If you can get to grips with the LW3A1, learn to keep your distance, and pick your shots, decent Killstreaks are mere fingertips away.</p>



<p>You have to be <strong>Level 25 to unlock the Dragunov</strong> as the next Sniper Rifle anyway, so you have plenty of time to become intimately acquainted with the LW3A1.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-lw3a1-frostline-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the LW3A1 Frostline in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>Currently, Black Ops 6 only has three Sniper Rifles—with more likely to arrive as part of seasonal updates. That being said, once you unlock them, the <strong>SVD Dragunov</strong> and <strong>LR 7.62</strong> need to be on your radar if you love engaging at long-range, or desire one-shot one-kill firepower.</p>

<p>Black Ops 6 has plenty to keep you busy: The&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-safe-code-and-complete-every-safehouse-puzzle-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Safehouse Puzzle Safe</a> in need of cracking, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-open-liberty-falls-vault-black-ops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Liberty Falls Vault</a> are big standouts.

    <p><span>Join Section 6 in testing new technology and confidential equipment.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 1.3 update for <em><a title="Games > Zenless Zone Zero [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a></em>, dubbed “Virtual Revenge,” will launch on November 6, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [176 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-923899"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>Besides working with Tsukishiro Yanagi from Section 6 to complete a special mission, Proxies will also be able to join Lighter from the Sons of Calydon to celebrate the Settlement Days at the Outer Ring. New gameplay including “The Mystery of Arpeggio Fault” and “Simulated Battle Trial” will be introduced in Version 1.3. Moreover, with new areas including HAND Headquarters, H.S.O.S. 6 Office, and Sān-Z STUDIO at Lumina Square being open to players, the immersive urban journey in New Eridu will be further enriched.</p><p>Led by Hoshimi Miyabi, H.S.O.S. 6 (Section 6) is an elite frontline operational unit dedicated to responding to Hollow disasters. In Version 1.3, Proxies will execute the commission requested by the Hollow Investigative Association (HIA) with Yanagi and other Section 6 members. In the meantime, following the conclusion of “Tour de Inferno,” the celebration of Settlement Days at the Outer Ring is about to begin. Proxies will be immersed in the vibrant atmosphere while savoring persistent victories with Lighter. On top of the main story, Special Episodes of Yanagi and Lighter will also be available, in which Proxies will know more about Yanagi and be able to control Lighter in a side-scrolling mode.</p><p>The new main story will feature new characters. Yanagi, the Deputy Chief of Section 6, is an S-level Electric – Anomaly Agent who can rapidly accumulate Anomaly Buildup and increase the whole team’s Disorder damage. Wielding her Naginata, Yanagi’s Ex Special Attack triggers extra Polarity Disorder which can rapidly deal massive amounts of damage to enemies. The other powerful S-level character is Lighter, known as “The Champion” of the Sons of Calydon. He is a Fire – Stun Agent who racks up Morale and stuns enemies with a flurry of punches while lowering their Ice and Fire Resistances. Once his Morale reaches a certain level, his combat strength and skills will be reinforced. In addition, 2 new A-level Bangboo Baddieboo and Knightboo will be introduced in this new update.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_923900"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->

            <p>DreadXP's second Indie Horror Showcase 2024 was broadcast last night, ushering in a flood of new spooky game announcements, including a new trailer for the upcoming remaster of 2002 third-person survival shooter The Thing.</p>
<p>At less than two minutes long, it doesn't give away much, admittedly, but it's our first glimpse at The Thing: Remastered's gameplay. You can check out the teaser below, which shows off how the team at Nightdive is handling the remaster:</p>

<p>The Thing: Remastered takes place in a frozen arctic tundra where "a mysterious shape-shifting alien has wiped out the crew of the US Outpost #31 research facility". You play as Captain J.F. Blake (no relation), the leader of a United States Army Special Forces rescue team sent to "investigate the blood-curdling events that transpired in the original The Thing film".</p><p>"Trapped by the elements and at risk of infection by a horrific entity, Blake must keep his squad together to survive by gaining their trust and ensuring that their fear and paranoia don't get the best of them… or himself," the blurb teases.</p>
<p>The Thing: Remastered is coming to Nintendo Switch, PC, via Steam PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and last-gen consoles in 2024. As yet, there's still no firm release date.</p>

		<p>The firmly current gen remake of Yooka-Laylee – cutely dubbed Yooka-Replaylee – has been confirmed for release on consoles, with Playtonic targeting PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and “Nintendo platforms”, which surely means Nintendo Switch 2 and not the current console, or they’d just say it was for Switch. The game is also coming to PC, as previously confirmed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Yooka-Replaylee | Console Announcement Trailer!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AGfmssnKf1s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>We’re in a very curious spot for remakes and remasters right now, with Yooka-Replaylee a remake of a game that’s just shy of 10 years old. The game was the debut title for Playtonic Games, who<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/05/01/the-banjo-kazooie-spiritual-successor-is-called-yooka-laylee/"> kickstarted the project back in 2015</a>, eventually releasing &nbsp;it in 2017.</p>
<p>Playtonic’s desire to return to this game instead of making a sequel is to take on various things they’ve learned in the time since and reapply them to the original. Yooka-Replaylee, then, will feature improved graphics, more dynamic worlds, new and improved challenges, new collectibles, new characters, and a bunch of quality of life improvements too – of course, the original game had a major <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/08/10/the-yooka-laylee-spit-n-polish-update-has-landed-on-consoles/">Spit ‘n’ Polish update</a> to make early improvements of its own.</p>
<p>It does look rather pretty, I must say, though I’d hope this is a stepping stone to a full 3D platformer sequel, if it proves to be popular enough. There was also the side-scrolling spin off <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/08/yooka-laylee-and-the-impossible-lair-review/">Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair</a>.</p>

<p>The spiritual successor to Banjo-Kazooie, Yooka-Laylee was a love letter to the early heyday of the collectathon 3D platformer. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review/">Looking back at the original review</a>, Jim said,&nbsp;“Of all the potential hurdles to snag on in creating a 3D platformers in the style of the late nineties classics, Playtonic deftly avoids the most egregious ones by far. At its very core, Yooka-Laylee succeeds in reviving a format long forgotten and does so with such vigor and passion. However, players shouldn’t expect it to reinvent the genre.”</p>

			<p>Liquid Swords, a Swedish studio established by former <a href="https://wccftech.com/avalanche-studio-founder-opens-up-on-2015s-mad-max-development-blames-warner-bros-for-canceled-dlc-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avalanche Studios founder Christofer Sundberg</a>, has <a href="https://x.com/LiquidSwords/status/1849727432904872311" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the first in-game screenshots of its GTA-like open-world game, and they look stunning. When asked whether these were actual images, the official X account confirmed they were real.</p>
<p>The game is being developed with Unreal Engine 5, whereas Avalanche has historically used its own Apex engine for Just Cause, Mad Max, and Rage 2. Tech Director Fredrik Lönn explained the engine choice with the following statement:</p>
<p><em>Custom engines were historically the way forward, and that's what my former team at Avalanche did over 18 years ago when development started on Just Cause 1. The landscape has changed since then, and now it's quite the opposite. </em><em>We decided to go with Unreal Engine 5. Unreal has been proven for high-quality AAA games, both by Epic themselves in the case of Fortnite and by other game studios worldwide shipping amazing games on Unreal. With Epic making improvements toward open-world development, we get full access to the source code, and the integrations with other software and pipelines are excellent.</em></p>

<p>Liquid Swords was founded in December 2020. Sundberg recalled why he created this new studio:</p>
<p><em>In December 2020, I set out on a journey to make a difference in the world of game development– which has been my professional and entertainment world since the early 90s. I want to make a difference to how games are made, how the teams work, and how the creative process evolves. Liquid Swords is the realization of an ambition to refocus the game-development process.</em></p>
<p>Around two years later, the studio announced it had received an investment from NetEase Games. Sundberg said at the time:</p>
<p><em>NetEase Games has been exceptionally supportive from the very get-go, believing in our high ambitions and quality-focused approach to game development. We are very pleased to have them as our partners on this adventure and with their support, we can begin to realize the vision for our studio.</em></p>
<p>While those screenshots are indeed very reminiscent of a photorealistic version of Rockstar's GTA series, Liquid Swords is making a single player open world, narrative driven action RPG. We still don't know anything else, but hopefully that will change soon following these first screenshots.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-accessible/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-will-be-a-very-accessible-game-for-newcomers-traversal-improvements-detailed.1019220/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-accessible/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds will be a very accessible game for newcomers, thanks to the implementation of some new features.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GamerBraves">GamerBraves</a>, producer Ryozo Tsujimoto commented on some of the new game mechanics, including those that are meant to ease newcomers into the experience, such as tutorials. These tutorials, which teach the basics of the experience, come with some options that allow players to tweak them to show as little or as much as they want. These tweaking options are certainly quite welcome, as they will not only help newcomers but will also allow more experienced players to hide them so that they can play without any hindrance right from the start. Tsujimoto-san also mentioned that players can get some help from Alma the handler to pick the weapon best suited for their play styles by replying to some questions. This feature was also available in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gamescom-preview/">Gamescom demo</a> I had the chance to try out earlier this year, so it is likely it will be in next week's <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta/">open beta</a>, which seems to be based on the public demos, and in the final game as well.</p>
<p>Not every new feature in Monster Hunter Wilds was implemented just to help newcomers, however. The introduction of weapon switching, for example, is meant to provide players with more options and not break the gameplay action loop too much. As for why players can only bring two weapons, Tsujimoto-san confirmed it was to make things realistic, as being able to switch between all 14 types wouldn't have been so. Palicoes now being able to talk was also a change that was made to help the flow of action, as auditory cues are just better than visual ones in this regard. If players want, however, they can revert the Palicoes' voices to the meows of the previous entries in the series. Speaking of characters talking, Tsujimoto-san also confirmed that the hunter talking was a change made to help immersion, but players shouldn't expect them to speak a lot, as the team wanted to keep the tone of the series intact in Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p>Thanks to feedback from Monster Hunter World, traversal has been improved considerably in the new entry in the series. The introduction of bigger, seamless maps proved to be somewhat of an issue for some players in the 2018 game, and with the bigger maps of Monster Hunter Wilds, Scoutflies wouldn't have been enough. With the technological advancements made in the past few years, the development team not only was able to implement the Seikret, but also to improve their AI so much that they can bring the player to the target monster by pressing a single button.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ryozo Tsujimoto Making Monster Hunter Wilds EASIER for Newcomers | GCA 2024 Interview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lezi2Pwx5zw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launches on February 28th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. Thanks to the aforementioned open beta, players on all formats will be able to try out the game next week.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/shadows-of-damned-hella-remastered-review-seventh-gen-all-stars</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-review-seventh-gen-all-stars.1019217/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/shadows-of-damned-hella-remastered-review-seventh-gen-all-stars<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The original&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>has an impressive credits screen if nothing else.</p>

<p>It boasts the involvement of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/classic-adventure-thriller-killer7-makes-its-way-to-steam"><em>Killer7</em></a>&nbsp;creator Suda51,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a>&nbsp;</em>mastermind Shinji Mikami, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/akira-yamaoka-would-love-to-return-to-silent-hill"><em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>composer Akira Yamaoka</a>, as well as legendary cult manga artist Q Hayashida, and that's a pretty darn big sell.</p>

<p>Released in 2011,&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>didn't do much sales-wise, but it did garner a cult following in the years after its arrival, so here's Suda's company Grasshopper Manufacture, along with new owner NetEase, to give demon hunter Garcia Hotspur's journey through hell <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shadows-of-damned-remaster-announced-by-grasshopper-manufacture-grasshopper-direct">a new coat of paint</a>.</p>

<p>Lo and behold,&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>(very funny, Suda) is exactly what you think it is: a lovable, flawed relic of the seventh console generation. This is the kind of remaster that preserves all of the original's warts and selling points; it's just as fun, just as janky, and just as unfinished as it ever was.</p>

<h2><em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>Is Good Old-Fashioned Fun</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-review-boss.jpg?itok=hi4GmvRu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-review-boss.jpg?itok=Lq2aVBgb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you like the simple, no-frills fun offered by old-school seventh-gen gaming, you're in for a treat here.</figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly given Mikami's involvement,&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>plays like a sort of grungy heavy metal-inflected&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4</em>, complete with over-the-shoulder third-person shooting and a slightly insane smorgasbord of gameplay styles thrown into the mix.</p>

<p>Over the course of&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered</em>'s eight-hour running time, you'll explore&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4</em>-style villages, solve what could generously be described as "puzzles", and even take part in side-scrolling shooter stages apropos of nothing.</p>

<p>All of this adds up to create a package that feels pleasingly old-school.&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>feels concerned not with wringing every last drop of dopamine out of your exhausted brain, but with showing you all of its many toys and letting you play with each one for just enough time that it never feels boring.</p>

<p>Unlike many of its contemporaries,&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>is split into stages rather than being one continuous journey.</p>

<p>Each stage has something unique and interesting about it, whether that's a gameplay style switch-up, a new puzzle mechanic, or a boss fight that asks you to demonstrate some of the tools you've been amassing over the past few levels.</p>

<p>Blessedly for our bloated modern age,&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>doesn't outstay its welcome, either. As soon as it runs out of ideas (and some may say sooner than that), it makes its exit, so you won't have time to grow restless or bored while you're experiencing this Suda51 trip.</p>

<p>The core combat feels great in&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned</em>, too. Each weapon has a pleasing kick to it, and the upgrades you receive over the course of Garcia's journey feel meaningful, making slaughtering demons a consistent delight throughout.</p>


<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-review-big-boner.jpg?itok=tCC4ia3R 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-review-big-boner.jpg?itok=ZwxPUWSA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is very much still the same&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>it was back in 2011.</figcaption></figure><p>If you feel like I've only talked about the original&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>so far in this&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>review, there's a very good reason for that.</p>

<p>NetEase and Grasshopper Manufacture haven't exactly gone above and beyond to show&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>how much they love it. This is very much a barebones remaster; it's a resolution increase, a few extra costumes, and a slightly half-hearted New Game Plus mode, and that's it.</p>

<p>You won't find a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-release-date-and-gameplay-info-revealed"><em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</em></a>-esque visual overhaul here, nor will you see the kind of attention to detail that Aspyr has shown its&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tomb-raider-1-3-remastered"><em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>remasters</a>.</p>

<p>In essence,&nbsp;<em>Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>is a "hella" lot like playing the original&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned</em>, and the visual upgrade isn't particularly great at hiding some of the original's ugly Xbox 360-style sharp edges, curves, and low-quality texture work.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong. I'm not a graphics fiend; I honestly don't care how good something looks as long as it plays well, and so I'm willing to give&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>a pass on this front.</p>

<p>Just be aware that if you passed on the original when it launched back in 2011 and you're hoping that this remaster will somehow transform the core experience for you, that's very much not the goal here.</p>

<p>That also means that some of the original&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned</em>'s more questionable moments make it in unchanged, too. If the original put you off with its casual objectification and borderline xenophobic stereotypes, you might want to apply elsewhere.</p>

<p>On the plus side, the fact that&nbsp;<em>Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>is effectively still a seventh-gen game means it works great on Steam Deck (at least in my testing, anyway), so it's not all awkward moments and leftover jank.</p>

<h2>All of&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned</em>'s Jank Is Still in <i>Hella Remastered</i></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-review-sidescroller.jpg?itok=6Ni9FWYH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-review-sidescroller.jpg?itok=M9RotXkv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sometimes,&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>is flat-out weird, and not in the ways it wants to be.</figcaption></figure><p>Yes, that's right: for all its superstar names,&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>often felt like a fairly uneven and janky game, and&nbsp;hey,&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>still feels like a fairly uneven and janky game.</p>

<p>On the whole, the difficulty here is pretty low. I died once or twice during some of the hairier moments, but I managed to breeze through most of the game on normal difficulty without trouble. You might say that's my fault for not bumping it up to hard, but normal does not provide a particularly balanced challenge.</p>

<p><em>Shadows of the Damned</em>'s inconsistent enemy design makes up for some of that lack of challenge, although not quite in the way that I would like.</p>

<p>Some enemies (I'm looking at you, psycho-Paula) can kill Garcia in a single hit, and others feel infuriatingly annoying to pin down and deal damage to, making some engagements frustratingly drawn out with the promise of disproportionate punishment for failure.</p>

<p>It's also worth mentioning that&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>felt unfinished in places (the side-scrolling shooter stages and abrupt ending spring to mind) and that hasn't changed in this remaster.</p>

<p>Happily, there were times when the original&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned</em>'s jank worked in its favor, and that's the case here, too. Although&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>feels a touch creaky, that's often the price you pay for the level of variation you'll find here.</p>

<p>This is also still a charmingly, gleefully stupid experience. Any game in which the main character can fire a giant-barreled gun from between his legs while screaming "taste my big boner" legally cannot be bad. It's in the Constitution, I think.</p>

<h2><em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-review-sewer.jpg?itok=SYqIaAPG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-review-sewer.jpg?itok=zW2Vqm9F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It isn't really more than the sum of its parts, but&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>is a good time anyway.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>is a fascinating relic of the seventh console generation. Despite Suda51's presence as a writer and Akira Yamaoka's score, this feels like a Shinji Mikami production through and through (although he didn't serve as a director on the project).</p>

<p>If you can imagine a jankier, grungier&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>- perhaps one birthed from the B-movie-loving brain of Robert Rodriguez - then you're not a million miles away from what&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>can offer you.</p>

<p>You won't find a dramatic overhaul here, but&nbsp;<em>Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>offers just enough nostalgic thrills to overcome its almost lovably abundant jank.</p>

            <p>The creators of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review">"beautifully designed yet imprecise platforming adventure"</a> Tales Of Kenzera: Zau are working on an Afrofuturist gothic-horror <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> with isometric visuals and a body-sharing dual character premise. Currently known as Project Uso - the Swahili word for 'face', 'appearance' or 'surface' - it'll take place in the same world as Kenzera, and will take inspiration from Surgent Studio founder Abubakar Salim's experiences of parenthood. Providing, that is, the developers can find enough money to make it.</p><!--more-->
<p>"As soon as my daughter was born I knew what I wanted to cook," Salim (who is otherwise known as the voice of Bayek from Assassin's Creed: Origins) told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-kenzera-developers-next-game-will-be-an-afrofuturist-gothic-horror-rpg-as-the-studio-fights-to-survive">Eurogamer</a>'s Ed Nightingale yesterday. "This idea stems from this question of 'who am I?' Zau was a question of 'who am I without a parent?' This is essentially looking at 'who am I now as a parent?' I really wanted to make this very dark and visceral, a cross between an RPG and a beat 'em up power fantasy." </p>
<p>In Project Uso, you play a kind of android vampire called the Solost, who exists to hold the souls of the deceased, but who is also the vessel for Eshu, a trickster god from Banshu mythology. You'll get access to the powers of both the android and its divine passenger, but they'll sometimes disagree. When this happens, you'll have to carry out a Crucible Check - a dice roll battle, seemingly - to decide who gets control of the Solost's body. According to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">Eurogamer</a>'s report, the overall experience is redolent of Disco Elysium, the Batman Arkham games and Resident Evil.</p>
<p>I've never played Tales Of Kenzera, but the shift away from platforming and into the more writing-led RPG genre makes sense, based on Alice B's (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review">review</a>. "Tales Of Kenzera shows great precision in its character and world design, in the writing, in the voice acting, even down to individual animations," she wrote. "But it lacks precision in some areas of the combat, in particular the platforming, which arguably is the bit that matters more in a platformer." Still, Alice B went on, "I'd like to see what other tales can be told in Kenzera".</p>
<p>It sounds like Salim has plenty more to tell. "Where else can we pluck from and play that could be really exciting within this space?" he comments in the Eurogamer story. "I designed it that way as a whole." </p>
<p>If there's room for the setting to grow, however, there isn't necessarily the means. Surgent are pretty hard up at the minute. Kenzera doesn't appear to have sold well, prompting Surgent to make layoffs in July. With Project Uso still early on in development, the company's games division is "on hiatus" while they try to rustle up some funding. It's an especially bitter predicament given the racism Surgent Studios had to face down from some quarters over Kenzera's protagonist and setting.</p><p>I hope Surgent can pull things together. Characters who share bodies are always entertaining, and I'd love to play more RPGs inspired by Afrofuturism. I'm a bit less convinced by Salim making a game about fatherhood, simply because this is an emotive gambit I associate with triple-A dudes who no longer wish to be associated with their previous gory action games, but that's mostly just me being cynical.

<h2 id="h-best-tanto-22-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best Tanto .22 loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Compensator</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Short Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Under Barrel</strong>: Ranger Foregrip</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: CQB Grip</li>



<li><strong>Stock</strong>: Balanced Stock</li>
</ul>



<p>The mentioned attachments will give you the best mobility while using the Tanto .22 in multiplayer lobbies. The <strong>Compensator</strong> will reduce the vertical recoil to improve accuracy while the <strong>Short Barrel</strong> will enhance in-air handling by improving Jumping Aim Down Sight and Jumping Sprint to Fire speeds.</p>



<p><strong>Ranger Foregrip</strong> will greatly improve Horizontal Recoil Control and slightly improve Sprinting Movement Speed. Use the <strong>CQB Grip</strong> to dominate in close-range combat as it significantly boosts Dive To Fire, Slide to Fire, and Sprint to Fire Speeds, making it a perfect attachment to use Omnimovement in the best way possible.</p>



<p>Lastly, use the <strong>Balanced Stock</strong> for maximum mobility as it will improve Aim Walking, Hipfire, and Strafing Movement speeds.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-tanto-22">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for Tanto .22</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Dexterity</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Assassin</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Double Time</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4</strong>: Enforcer</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Spring Mine</li>
</ul>



<p>Use <strong>Dexterity</strong> to reduce weapon motion while jumping, sliding, and diving while taking less fall damage. The <strong>Assassin</strong> perk will mark enemies with kill streaks on the minimap.</p>



<p><strong>Double Time</strong> significantly increases the Tactical Sprint, which is essential when multiple enemies are nearby. These three perks will activate the <strong>Enforcer</strong> specialty which grants a temporary buff to your movement speed and health regeneration rate upon killing enemies.</p>



<p>Coming to the Wildcard, during the initial levels you can use Tactical Expert (it gives you two <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-game-modes-maps-equipment-field-upgrades/#h-all-equipment-in-black-ops-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tactical equi</a>pment) but once you level up, get the <strong>Perk Greed</strong> to equip an extra Perk.</p>



<p><strong>Semtex</strong> and <strong>Stim Shots</strong> are a must when you’re running the Tanto .22 for quick damage and heal-up. I’d say the Field Upgrade is a personal choice. For me, I find the <strong>Spring Mine</strong> useful as it grants me free kills from time to time.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-tanto-22">Best Secondary for Tanto .22</h2>



<p>The <strong>Stryder .22</strong> is one of the best secondary weapons for the submachine gun. Want to finish off enemies when they are at one HP, use the Stryder to get the job done.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-tanto-22-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock Tanto .22 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>Reach <strong>player level 16</strong> to unlock the Tanto .22 SMG in Black Ops 6. This is easy to achieve – all you need to do is play the game. You can <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-up-fast-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">level up fast</a> by playing some multiplayer matches and fulfilling all the objectives.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-tanto-22-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the Tanto .22 any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>Yes, despite being an SMG with a slow rate of fire, it’s an excellent choice for close and medium-range combat. You don’t have empty half of its magazine on a single enemy and is easy to control as well.</p>



<p>With the attachments mentioned above, you can achieve great mobility with the Tanto .22, making it hard for the enemies to knock you down.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-tanto-22-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the Tanto .22 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>If the slow fire rate bothers you, go with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-jackal-pdw-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jackal PDW</a> SMG. It dominated lobbies during the beta and is equally impressive after the full release of the game.</p>



<p>And if you want to ditch the SMG route and choose hard-hitting Assault Rifles instead, then the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-best-ak-74-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AK-74</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xm4-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/">XMR</a> are two of the best guns to use.</p>

<h2>‘Ello, what’s all this, then?</h2>
<p><em>Fallout: London</em> takes place 160 years after the global nuclear war, 40 years before&nbsp;<em>Fallout 3</em>, and in a part of the world that is both remote and didn't really have official Fallout lore. That means a lot of the typical&nbsp;Fallout fare—Deathclaws, Super Mutants, the Pip-Boy 3000—is left out.</p>
<p>Or, rather, replaced with scores of new enemies, lore, companions, factions, and even some mechanics picked up from the modding scene (ladders!). It's a kick to see the across-the-pond variants of wasteland stuff: tinned beans, medieval weapons, the Atta-Boy personal computer. There is at least one dog, a bulldog, and his name is Churchill.</p>
<p>As for the story, stop me if you've heard this one before: You, newly awakened from an underground chamber (not a Vault, though), enter a ruined London, one riven by factions with deep disagreements about how to move things forward. You'll take up quests, pick sides, befriend or blast people, and do a lot of peeking into abandoned buildings, hoping to find that last screw you need for a shotgun modification.</p>



<h2>London falling</h2>
<p>When you first start&nbsp;<em>Fallout: London</em>, you'll see a London that looks like, honestly, crap. Whatever London did to anger the nuke-having powers of the world, it got them good and mad, and parts of the city are very busted. The city's disposition to underground spaces has done it well, though, and you can often find yesteryear's glory in a Tube tunnel, a bunker, or a basement.</p>
<p>As you move on, you'll get the surge of seeing a part of London you remember, either from a visit or from media, and how it looks with a bit of char to it. The post-war inhabitants have also made their own spaces inside the ruins, some more sophisticated and welcoming than others. Everywhere you look, you can see that familiar&nbsp;Fallout aesthetic—1950s atomic-minded culture persisting until its downfall—shifted into Greenwich Mean Time.</p>

		<p>Nightdive Studios has shared a gameplay trailer for their latest retro remaster, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-thing">The Thing: Remastered</a>. The remaster of the 2002 psychological action horror is coming to PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Switch and PC later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Thing: Remastered Gameplay Trailer | Nightdive Studios" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IXaWScbsF6Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>One of the more modern games that Nightdive is remastering, the team is able to bring some of the biggest visual upgrades to The Thing yet. There will be improved models, textures and environments, but there’s also new dynamic lighting and 4K resolutions at up to 144 FPS, depending on the platform.</p>
<p>The team has also worked with the original developers to bring some gameplay improvements. One key area is with the interface for the fear/trust system that determines whether an AI will cooperate with you or defy you, depending on their psychological state. It’s well known that Computer Artworks had to make a few… creative decisions to get things to work and fit with the game’s technical limitations in the early 2000s, and just designing an open-ended structure like this to work with the story. It will be interesting to see if any of that has been adapted as well.</p>
<p>While fear and suspicion are core to the experience, there’s also a lot of action, fighting against horrific monstrosities that The Thing has morphed into.</p>

<p>2002’s The Thing is as close as we’ll (hopefully) get to a sequel to the best film ever made – not an opinion, just a fact. Speaking of facts, John Carpenter endorsed this game as a continuation of his movie, with various story beats that remain dangling at the end. Sadly, Computer Artworks never got the opportunity for a sequel to their game, despite the largely positive reception. It’s great to see their legacy continue with this remaster.</p>

		<p>The tradition of horror gaming through October has been something that’s largely passed me by, but I’ve indulged a little this year. My gaming this past week has featured non-horror stalwarts like Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun (unless you consider retro mid-90s FPS graphics to be horror), but I’ve also continued on with my playthrough of Until Dawn, rather appreciating its episodic structure for concise play sessions. There’s also been a little bit of Phasmo in my life, as I try to make head or tail of how the ghost hunting game works.</p>

<p>Joining me for some ghost hunting shenanigans (and similarly perplexed by how uncooperative each spectre is to be figured out) were <strong>Nic B</strong> and <strong>Gamoc</strong>. Nic complemented that with some more Metaphor ReFantazio (as a palate cleanser from Unknown 9 last week), while Gamoc wrapped up our review of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/25/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-dlc-review/">Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred</a>, had a great time with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/23/vendetta-forever-review/">Vendetta Forever</a>, and a little bit of Baldur’s Gate 3 and some real world D&amp;D, where he was “basically a werewolf”.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> has been playing Final Fantasy XVI and will be grabbing the DLC soon before he heads off to do the final boss fight – as a nice bonus, that will be a bit cheaper because he discovered some PlayStation Stars points.</p>
<p>Ade’s been playing the “delightfully ridiculous and bombastic” EDF 6, alongside some Metroid Dread. He’s pretty close to the end of Dread, which is just a little bit shy of Metroid Fusion’s greatness – a stone cold classic, is Fusion.</p>


<p>Heading off to the frontiers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/24/new-world-aeternum-mmo-relaunch-makes-strong-first-impression/">New World: Aeternum</a>, <strong>Jim</strong> has enjoyed his time with Amazon’s revamped MMO, now that it’s on console – “I’ve had the itch to play an MMORPG for some time now though the options haven’t been all that inviting. I’ve heard good things about the latest expansions for World of Warcraft, Guild Wars 2, and Final Fantasy XIV but I wanted to try something a little different and more accessible. New World fit the bill perfectly, and was all the more appealing thanks to its one-time purchase instead of adopting a monthly recurring subscription.”</p>
<p>He’s also got emulators up and running on his Steam Deck for the PS2 nostalgia of The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, while the weekend ahead will feature plenty of Black Ops 6.</p>

<p>And we’ll round out this week with <strong>Steve</strong>, who’s play the surprise retro horror of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/24/tormenture-review-retro-scares/">Tormenture</a>, the surprisingly enjoyable The Smurfs – Dreams, and Nikoderiko. He also had the chance to play through the Shadows of the Damned Hella Remastered. Keep an eye out for reviews soon!.</p>

Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s so special about it, and why does it cost an eye-watering $90? It comes with a 20th Anniversary themed harness encrusted with gems representing World of Warcraft’s expansions. But beyond that, it features actually useful systems not normally found on mounts: it lets you check the in-game auction house and the mail while riding it out and about the world of Azeroth via characters Morten and Killia riding alongside the beast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fueling the mount’s popularity is Blizzard’s decision to make it only temporarily available for purchase. It plans to pull it from the World of Warcraft store on January 6, 2025, so players know they only have a few months before it’s (potentially) gone forever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To put the cost of this mount into context, it’s the same price as the deluxe edition of World of Warcraft’s latest expansion, The War Within, or about half a year’s subscription to the long-running MMO.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/25/screenshot-2024-10-25-114038-1729852849941.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The mount lets you check the auction house and the mail on the go. Image credit: Blizzard Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, some players are saying the Trader’s Gilded Brutosaur is a bargain at $90, and that’s because its value in WoW Tokens compares favorably to the five million in-game gold people paid for the original version of this mount when it was sold for a limited time back in 2018.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">WoW Tokens can be exchanged for Battle.net Balance, not just game time, which means players can indirectly buy anything Blizzard sells for real-world money with in-game gold. Here’s how it works: players can buy a WoW Token from Blizzard for $20 and either keep it for later or put it on the in-game auction house. Another player will then buy that token from the auction house for in-game gold, then exchange it for $15 of Battle.net Balance (Blizzard effectively takes a $5 tax from the transaction). Battle.net Balance can then be used to buy anything Blizzard sells for World of Warcraft for real-world money, including $90 mounts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This method relies on players selling WoW Tokens in the game’s auction house, and right now they’re scarce because so many players are snapping them up to use to buy this mount. Because of that, WoW Tokens are selling out and their price in gold has skyrocketed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The auction house's WoW Token right now is out of WoW Token supplies since you need suppliers to supply the demand, and currently skyrocketing given the 3% price cap per 20 minutes," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1gbd2ap/comment/ltkslpe/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">redditor arasitar explained</a>. "WoW Token was 200k on NA. Probably going to go to 400k in a short bit."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of this article's publication, a WoW Token costs 335,171 gold on U.S. servers. You need six WoW Tokens bought from the auction house to exchange for enough Battle.net Balance to afford this $90 mount (6 x $15), which means, at the current rate, paying just over two million gold. The original Brutosaur cost five million gold.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What does this all tell us? Not much that we didn’t know about the World of Warcraft community, anyway. Mounts have, over the years, proved incredibly popular no matter how much money they cost to buy. The original Brutosaur, released in 2018 alongside the Battle for Azeroth expansion, sold like hot cakes, too. World of Warcraft players love their mounts!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Blizzard, it’s laughing all the way to the bank. Or, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1gbd2ap/comment/ltlo56c/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as redditor Chuckieshere put it</a>: “This mount probably just made more money than StarCraft 2 for 1/1000th of the effort.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Note: This review specifically covers the single-player campaign of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. For our thoughts on the other modes, see our </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-review"><u><em>multiplayer review in progress</em></u></a><em> – and for Zombies, stand by!</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">A spy thriller worthy of the name, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's campaign is a hugely welcome reinvigoration of the long-running first-person shooter series. It looks back at what has historically made the best CoD single-player modes so great and throws its own exciting and novel ideas into the mix, to fantastic effect. Telling one of the most engaging stories the series has ever seen, Black Ops 6’s enticing variety and impressive scale provide a stellar return to form.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ever since the 2003 original, CoD campaigns have been heavily influenced by military action movies – starting in a logical place with classic WW2 cinema like The Longest Day and Saving Private Ryan before moving on to more contemporary influences, in particular the panoramic yet still claustrophobic camerawork of Ridley Scott's Black Hawk Down.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Call of Duty Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But the lens shifted focus away from theatres of full-scale war and onto spy thrillers in the mold of the Mission: Impossible and Bourne series, beginning with 2010’s Black Ops and evolving into a refined, enthralling form with Black Ops 6. It’s in this distinctive direction that the returning Adler and Woods team up with a new team of skilled operators, this time in 1991, to combat an emerging new threat called The Pantheon, amid rumors of the creation of a potentially history-changing bioweapon. Sure, 2020's Cold War had its fair share of espionage action, but the majority of Black Ops 6's missions don't take place on the flashes and bangs of the frontline, but in the shadows that lie deep behind it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two missions in particular showcase this brilliantly: the infiltration of a political gala in Most Wanted, and the casino heist of High Rollers. The former presents three different options for how you want to go about completing your objective - I had a great time tinkering with a silent auction, but other paths are available that will test your spy skills  - and while your choice has no lasting impact on the story, it does add an element of replayability to otherwise linear levels. The heist, by contrast, has you swapping between multiple members of your blacklisted team, spread across lavish slot machine-filled surroundings and the dank underground waterways beneath. You don't get to swap freely, but the slick character baton-passes add another dash of cinematic flair.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There's an enjoyable amount of flexibility to how you can approach missions.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There's an enjoyable amount of flexibility to how you can approach other missions as well. Stealth is often encouraged, but going loud is almost always an option (with insta-fail stealth thankfully only rearing its ugly head on one or two occasions). Keeping to the shadows or hidden underwater made me feel like a silent assassin, but when I let that slip I had to swiftly switch to a more combative style. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gunplay, crucially, delivers in both areas, with suppressed headshots satisfyingly pinging brains out of heads in one trigger pull and rattling SMGs and punchy shotguns feeling great when manically dashing in and out of cover thanks to the exciting new “omnimovement” system. This completely revamped movement mechanic allows you to sprint in any direction, as well as leap into the air sideways while firing to pull off your best gun-fu-esque stunts.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Simon Cardy Ranks Every COD Campaign He's Played</h3><p>A ranking of all of the Call of Duty campaigns that I've played.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a great sense of improvisation as well. Weapons need to be constantly discarded and replaced with whatever gun is within grasp due to ammo sometimes being kept cleverly sparse. That also applies to the more DIY methods of dispatching enemies that are available, such as grabbing knives from chopping boards to then send them flying into skulls. Again, it evokes that espionage action movie feel, letting me briefly cosplay as John David Washington brutalising his way through a restaurant kitchen in Tenet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The variety of its levels and top-tier presentation makes sure that it's never once dull, but this is a feat of stamina as well: By the historical standards of Call of Duty campaigns Black Ops 6 is one of the longest, clocking in at just around eight hours for me (roughly twice the length of Modern Warfare 3’s dud of a mission chain). It’s no Baldur’s Gate 3, certainly, but that’s a respectable runtime for a shooter campaign.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>By the historical standards of Call of Duty campaigns Black Ops 6 is one of the longest.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I do wish, though, that Call of Duty had more tricks up its sleeve by now when it comes to adding difficulty and differences to enemy encounters. Even now, after so many games, it’s still resorting to simply chucking a juggernaut or two your way to unload full magazines into when it wants to ramp up the stakes, but this time these challenges are occasionally solved via more interesting means thanks to a range of spy gadgets handed out at regular intervals. A throwing knife that can home in on targets adds a welcome dose of Batman energy to proceedings, and the trusty explosive remote control RC-XD cars make a fun return. Naturally, if all goes wrong, you can always rely on the more rustic C4 option to blow up anything you need it to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When downtime is had between outings, the writing hits a fun sweet spot between cliché and self-awareness and is supported by a cast that fully buys into their roles. Bruce Thomas in particular is in great form as the brazenly enigmatic Russell Adler, and Y’lan Noel and Karen David make a great first impression as Marshall and Sevati, respectively. The latter has a lot of fun in her chameleon-like role as a master-of-disguise assassin, with new personas taken on from mission to mission.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You'll spend more time with them when you return to the safe house, where you can learn more about your teammates' backstories, solve puzzles, and purchase valuable upgrades using cash found on missions. These perks range from standard stuff like explosive damage negation to ones that are more traditionally found in multiplayer modes, such as Last Stand, which gives you a temporary health and speed boost when close to death. It's a further example of the increased flexibility in game design and the way that developer Raven Software is encouraging you to adopt your own playstyle. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your sizeable Bulgarian manor is also home to dormant KGB secrets, which I had a great time uncovering. While none of the puzzles are too brain-testing – usually amounting to just memorising a series of numbers or using trial and error to unlock terminals – they successfully add even further variety to an otherwise (expectedly) gun-heavy time. It's surprisingly involved, and a fantastic improvement on an idea that began as a small abandoned garage in 2020’s Cold War, serving as a great place to plan for heists, undercover operations, and the completely unexpected. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of which… I won't say too much here so as not to spoil it, but perhaps the best mission of the whole campaign riffs off of previous Black Ops hallucinogenic episodes to create something that touches on the likes of BioShock, Prey, and Control in both its aesthetic and level design. It's hard to know which of Black Ops 6's many great missions will ultimately be remembered most fondly, but I have a feeling it might just be the weirdest that cements its place as an all-timer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That isn't to say you're kept completely out of more traditional combat zones. The first Gulf War serves as the backdrop for Black Ops 6's story, and you do spend a couple of missions in the ‘90s Middle East. This allows for the mission design to return to its modern military roots, but does so by innovating on the Call of Duty formula, which is best exemplified in a mid-game mission that is as ambitious in its scale as any I've ever seen from this series of campaigns. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking place over a vast desert map, you're given the task of destroying three SCUD missile sites in any order and by any means of your choosing. Feel like driving straight through the front door in a jeep? Go for it. It may be much more advisable to pick off a few targets from afar and think about things more methodically, though. Points of interest are also dotted around the map, and those can reveal themselves to be anything from special equipment supply drops to SAS scouts who show you enemy locations. These areas are worth exploring, too, as certain side objectives are built into the larger main mission design, such as when I blew up three different enemy SAM encampments to free up the airspace and allow me to take control of a helicopter's buzzsaw of a machine gun later on. This choice and consequence system is further explored in an equally exciting later mission, too, and is one of Black Ops 6’s true masterstrokes.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A mid-game mission is as ambitious in its scale as any I've ever seen from this series.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a fantastic use of everything Call of Duty does at its best, and a ludicrously better example of how it can borrow from its Warzone and multiplayer modes to build something truly exciting in an open space that blows last year’s feeble attempt out of the water. It frankly puts Modern Warfare 3's "open" mission design to shame, and shows the worth of granting a development team more than a handful of months to cobble together a campaign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although enthralling to play, the fact that these missions take place during Operation Desert Storm doesn't serve the story in anywhere near as fulfilling a way, making the controversial conflict come across more like window dressing. They don't delve into, or address in a meaningful manner, any of the human issues at play that surrounded the conflict in 1991 Kuwait, Iraq, and the larger Gulf area. Black Ops 6 tries to have its cake and eat it too; you can't “keep politics out of video games” when the game in question painstakingly recreates several real-life world leaders and the wars their governments partook in to set the stage for its ensuing fireworks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, this is a story that’s far more concerned with being a popcorn spy thriller than it is with examining or even reacting to its own subject matter, which in and of itself isn't a fundamental issue – but after Modern Warfare’s weak argument against chemical weapons in 2019 and Modern Warfare 3's refusal to use terrorism for anything more than cheap thrills just last year, Black Ops 6 follows an unfortunate trend of recent CoD campaigns declining to offer an emotionally nuanced reading of the settings they take on. It's no doubt entertaining, and I’m not exactly looking for (nor expecting) a deep, forensic examination of the cultural cost of global conflicts here, but it still feels like the latest instalment in a series of missed opportunities. There is room to both entertain and say something real, as so many of the war and spy movies CoD emulates already do, and 2012's Spec Ops: The Line is often praised for (even though its conflict is fictionalised).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What <em>is </em>delivered is a constantly engaging spy thriller story as the exiled Woods, Adler, and a string of new faces go off the record to decipher the links between the CIA, Saddam Hussein, and The Pantheon. What begins as a fairly standard cloak-and-dagger plot really comes alive in the back half, managing to weave in personal stakes and treats for long-time Black Ops fans. The nature of its closing chapter crept up and honestly surprised me, somehow managing to balance a bombastic crescendo with genuine emotive strain. It’s as good as a Call of Duty plot has been in a long, long time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A shout-out must also go to the quality animation on display, a technical area that can sometimes be taken for granted when it comes to Call of Duty. Whether it's intricate gun reloads and the mechanical finesse of your weapons when fired during gameplay, or the sheer fidelity of the cutscenes, it truly is best-in-class work. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

GAME customers are once again facing a familiar wait to play the latest big gaming launch - this time, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> - as the beleagured high street chain has failed, once again, to send out pre-order copies in a timely manner.
</p>
<p>
Customers say the retailer has taken payment but failed to provide their Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 copy on launch day - and with little to no communication on when it will actually arrive. 
</p>
<p>
A note on GAME's support site has acknowledged this latest snafu, and said that affected orders are currently "processing". Eurogamer has contacted GAME parent company Frasers Group for more.
</p>
<p>
"We are aware some customers may have not received their delivery of Call of Duty Black Ops 6 yet," Game's Help <a href="https://help.game.co.uk/support/home?_gl=1*zk2a5c*_gcl_au*NTgwMzQ4MjAzLjE3MjgwNDIyNTY.">website</a> states. "We are currently processing these orders and will keep you updated with further information. We apologise for the delay."
</p>
<p>
GAME previously pushed customers to pre-order Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 with the promise of a Steelbook case and the ability to "pick up and play 10.25.24" - today's date.
</p>
<p>
But affected GAME customers have told Eurogamer that there's no sign of their copy, or the Steelbook, and that customer service representatives have said copies won't be delivered until at least next week.
</p>

<p>
In an email sent by GAME customer support, seen by Eurogamer, a  service advisor acknowledges that the customer's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 order "is part of a group of products that are experiencing delays as part of our website updates". 
</p><p>
This refers to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-acknowledges-website-issues-as-customers-await-missing-pre-orders">ongoing issue Eurogamer reported on previously that results from GAME's systems being merged into those of Frasers Group</a>. This has also blocked GAME customers from seeing older orders - or easily modifying or cancelling them - on GAME's website. 
</p>
<p>It's all left GAME customers once again in limbo - unhappy at having to wait, and unwilling to simply pick up a copy elsewhere due to the difficulties of getting a refund and the loss of GAME's Steelbook.</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-game-pre-order-customers-receive-copies-but-for-wrong-edition">GAME customers faced an anxious wait for copies of Silent Hill 2</a> to arrive - and when they did, they initially did so without the chain's offer of a Steelbook case included. Eurogamer reported previously on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-pre-order-customers-left-in-limbo-as-metaphor-and-silent-hill-2-launches-loom">GAME customers waiting weeks, in and in some cases months</a>, for missing pre-orders to arrive.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/metaphor-refantazio-pc-users-can-now-get-a-stunning-texture-improvement-mod/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio, the new JRPG made by the Persona team, <a href="https://wccftech.com/metaphor-refantazio-becomes-million-seller-on-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is already a million seller</a> and has received widespread critical acclaim, too. On Wccftech, Kai Tatsumoto <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metaphor-refantazio-persona-non-grata/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rated</a> it 9 out of 10:</p>
<p><em>No matter how much I engaged with the core fundamentals of Metaphor: ReFantazio, I couldn’t escape the feeling that this was largely Persona 6 by another name rather than some new IP that could stand on its own merits. That isn’t to say that Hashino’s team hasn’t created another stylish JRPG with broad appeal, but the premise that Metaphor: ReFantazio is a brand-new fantasy is dead. If the Persona series left you wanting more, Metaphor: ReFantazio certainly is a tale worth experiencing for yourself. Those who harbor an innate distaste for the social systems and time limits of modern Persona titles will find no solace here, but those who are willing to embrace what very well could be the sixth Persona title in all but name alone will experience one of the most stylish Japanese roleplaying games of 2024.</em></p>
<p>However, Atlus games have never exactly stood out for their visuals, and this one is no exception. If you're playing it on a 4K display, chances are you will have noticed some really low resolution textures. Luckily, a PC modder has already uploaded a texture improvement mod <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/metaphorrefantazio/mods/25?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Nexus</a>. As you can see in these comparisons, the difference is absolutely massive. According to the modder, some of the original textures were only 128x128 or 256x256.</p>

<p>The mod overhauls Metaphor: ReFantazio textures across all zones, NPCs, monsters, and DLC outfits. However, it is also quite big at 4.4 GB. Not all textures are 4K resolution; as the modder explained, it would have been too costly from a performance point of view. Still, they're all HD textures and higher, which is a big improvement in visual clarity over the original game.</p>
