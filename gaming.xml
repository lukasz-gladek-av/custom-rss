IGN‚Äôs <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/11/15/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-review">Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: ‚ÄúPocket Camp is a true-to-series Animal Crossing adaptation that delivers plenty of reasons to take this camping trip.‚Äù</p><p>The game goes dark on November 29, 2024, a week after its seventh birthday. Since service began on November 21, 2017, for approximately seven years we have been honored to see everyone's lovely, diverse campsites grow and flourish,‚Äù <a href="https://faq.ac-pocketcamp.com/hc/en-us/categories/35735633685657-Notice-Regarding-the-End-of-Service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo said in a statement</a>.</p><p>‚ÄúWe extend our heartfelt thanks to the many users who have loved Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp.‚Äù</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Screens  -  Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</h3></div></output><p>After the online service ends, Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp will no longer be playable, Nintendo warned. There is a silver lining, however. Nintendo said it‚Äôs developing a paid version of the app to which players will be able to transfer their save data. This offline version will be released during the same period as the end of service for Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp, Nintendo said.</p><p>The paid version will have the same basic gameplay and controls as Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp. However, this app will allow the player to use the included features with a one-time purchase, Nintendo said. There will be no in-app purchases or subscription services (like Pocket Camp Club).</p><p>It‚Äôs worth noting that since this app will not require a continuous online connection, some features that require that connection, e.g. Market Boxes, gifts, and visiting other players' campsites will not be available. Similarly, Leaf Tickets will not be usable, and you will not be able to transfer them to the new app. Expect pricing and a release date in October.</p><p>Reaction from fans is mixed, with some expressing sadness that Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp is coming to an end, others seeing the positives in the paid app.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Literally same! this game has been like the sole constant in my life these past 7 years, its gotten me through the end my teen years, my associates and bachelors degrees, and every crazy thing in between.

This way long time players can keep playing. Most mobile games will come to an end eventually, this is just the best case scenario for such an event.</p>‚Äî Gay Bowser (@SoL0ngGayBowser) <a href="https://twitter.com/SoL0ngGayBowser/status/1826507204020613302?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 22, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Nintendo has had mixed results from its mobile game efforts, which include Super Mario Run, Mario Kart Tour, and Pikmin Bloom. In 2020, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-mobile-no-games-in-development">Nintendo was reported to be retreating from the mobile gaming market</a>. That apparent decision came amid the explosive, pandemic-fueled popularity of Switch exclusive <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>. However, there are a number of successful Pok√©mon mobile games, such as <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pok√©mon Go</a>, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-release-date-set-for-october">more in the works</a>.</p><p>Animal Crossing fans are already wondering what's next in the franchise, following Pocket Camp's demise and New Horizons seemingly a distant memory at Nintendo. Perhaps a brand new Animal Crossing for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> is in the works? given the enormous popularity of New Horizons, it feels like an inevitability.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Mafia: The Old Country - the next game in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hangar13">Hangar 13</a>'s Mafia series - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-is-back-and-heading-to-the-old-country-next-year">revealed earlier this week</a>, during Gamescom Opening Night Live. While the developer has still kept many details about the upcoming title under wraps, it has since confirmed the game will include Sicilian voice acting and Italian subtitles on release.</p>
<p>"Authenticity is at the heart of the Mafia franchise," the team shared on social media platform X. "Mafia: The Old Country will offer voice acting in Sicilian, inline with the game's setting in 1900s Sicily. Additionally, Italian language localisation will be available for both in-game UI and via subtitles."</p>

<p>The news was met with plenty of praise from fellow X users, as it had previously been unclear whether these options would be implemented on release.</p>
<p>As you may have already surmised given the game's name and Mafia's post mentioned the 1900s setting, The Old Country is set to take players further back in time than previous Mafia releases. It will feature a "gritty mob story set in the brutal underworld of... Sicily" with players needing to "fight to survive in this dangerous and unforgiving era".</p> <div>

		<p>Tripwire Presents and developer Ice Code Games have revealed that their turn-based tactical roguelite Rogue Waters will launch on 30th September 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rogue Waters Announcement Trailer | Gamescom 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U_1hKVw1ksw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Tripwire Interactive are best known for their Killing Floor series, but their Tripwire Presents publishing label is picking up and promoting indie tiles. Rogue Waters is one of these early publishing partnerships, working with Hard West 2 developer Ice Code Games.</p>
<p>This is a seafaring turn-based roguelike that will have you venture into the supernatural pirate seas, filled with giant sea monsters and enemies to battle. You‚Äôll actually &nbsp;be able to call upon these classic monsters to fight by your side ‚Äì albeit in somewhat limited fashion ‚Äì while also engaging in tactical combat that puts a great deal of emphasis on positioning and controlling the space as your swashbuckling raiders swing onto the decks of enemy ships. There‚Äôs also island-based battles and turn-based ship combat with targeted cannon fire.</p>
<p>‚ÄúBringing Rogue Waters to life has been a real adventure,‚Äù said Mateusz Pilski, Ice Code‚Äôs VP of Development. ‚ÄúOur goal in creating games is always to contribute to the genre in ways that bring players more satisfaction and fun in tackling tactical challenges. Dynamic melee combat which recreates the dance-like fencing bouts of boarding actions, combines immersion with thoughtful planning.‚Äù</p>

<p>We‚Äôve just been hands on with the game at Gamescom ‚Äì we‚Äôve also played Killing Floor 3, by the way ‚Äì and there‚Äôs a really interesting blend of precise tactical options at play. Look out for our preview in the next week or so!</p>
<p>Looking back on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/04/hard-west-2-review/">Hard West 2</a>, we said in our review, ‚ÄúHard West 2 comes with an enjoyably aggressive twist on XCOM-like turn-based combat, and with a fun way of upgrading your characters alongside, but it‚Äôs wrapped up in world exploration and characterisation that just leaves me wanting to get back in the fight. There‚Äôs a lot of fun to be had in Hard West 2, even if it‚Äôs not blowing minds as a complete package.‚Äù</p>

            <p>A member of Firewalk's development team has revealed Concord - PlayStation's new 5v5 sci-fi shooter - was in development for "around" eight years.</p>
<p>A post on social media platform X by Concord lead character designer Jon Weisnewski celebrating the game's launch confirmed this little titbit, with the developer stating he had been working on it personally for about five of those years.</p>
<p>"We don't get a lot of Launch Days in our careers so today is special for a ton of reasons," Weisnewski wrote. "Oblige me some good vibes today." The developer went on to state the entire team was "strapped in and ready to push it for years to come".</p>

<p>Prior to its release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-lays-out-concord-live-service-roadmap-commits-to-at-least-three-seasons">Firewalk laid out a roadmap for Concord</a>, sharing plans to keep the game fresh for at least three seasons. In July, the studio also revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-next-live-service-sci-fi-shooter-concord-wont-have-a-battle-pass">the game won't have a battle pass</a>, stating: "You own Concord, Concord doesn't own you."</p>
<p>"Concord feels like a load of brilliant games combined - but is that enough?" Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-feels-like-a-load-of-brilliant-games-combined-but-is-that-enough">Eurogamer's Concord preview</a>. "The true hook with Concord, I suspect, will reveal itself once it's in the hands of its audience, as they wrestle with optimal combinations and strategies and the meta begins to congeal."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-concord-is-a-technically-solid-well-made-hero-shooter-with-much-potential">Digital Foundry, meanwhile</a>, has dubbed Concord a "technically solid, well-made hero shooter" with "potential".</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">A big reason is being invited into a position of creative trust on a new experience. Obviously it‚Äôs a group effort, and having a seat at the table with others who inspire you and push you to do your best is a tremendous privilege. That trust gave the game so much identity.</p>‚Äî NEWSK (@sharkeatsman) <a href="https://twitter.com/sharkeatsman/status/1826122886689731027?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>This week's release of Concord, along with its development time and post-launch commitment, made me think of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">Naughty Dog's cancelled standalone The Last of Us multiplayer</a>.</p>
<p>On its cancellation, the studio - which had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-multiplayer-cancellation-reportedly-wasnt-a-bloodless-endeavour">reportedly been working on the game for four years</a> - said when faced with the choice to become a "solely live service games studio" or continuing "to focus on single-player narrative games" it chose the latter.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-we-finally-played-obsidians-first-person-rpg-and-its-fantastic<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Avowed was a surprising delight to play for the first time. After a lot of questions about the shift in art direction from the teaser trailer, questions about the length, and a combat demo on the Xbox stage that had many asking if the game was earlier in development than expected, I‚Äôm happy to report that Avowed is feeling great, looking great, and offering a compelling story based on the early slice I played at an event.</p><p>My journey began just after the opening main mission in Avowed, and we‚Äôve been sent on a task to find an Aedyran Expedition team. It turns out, as it often does with RPGs, that fate had other plans for them. Kai, our green-skinned companion who just happens to be voiced by Mass Effect‚Äôs Garrus Vakarian actor Brandon Keener, keeps things light-hearted with quips and remarks about this new area we‚Äôre exploring. The banter is welcome and sparse, only chiming in occasionally to make a quip, like when I paused to admire the view.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Avowed - Gamescom 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>And the view is very pretty. Avowed has done a great job leaning into the art style the larger Pillars of Eternity series is known for and had me stopping to admire waterfalls in the distance and moss-covered structures that set the aesthetic tone for this mysterious cavern we are diving deeper into. Avowed‚Äôs world design is shaping up nicely too, and as I dove deeper I would discover walls that could be blown up to traverse a new path, or puzzles that would open a secret new area with a large chest if I threw my shock explosives at a few tucked away circuits I found by exploring off the beaten path, only to find a hole in the wall. These puzzles have the added bonus of revealing coveted loot like a powerful ring that would offer some choice stat bonuses for my character.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Avowed has done a great job leaning into the art style the larger Pillars of Eternity series is known for.</p></div><p>When I wasn‚Äôt exploring the depths of the oceanic cave I had to swim through it only to find myself facing off against a Xaurip. These are Lizard-like creatures with your standard human weapons like swords, shields, and bows, and they make for good fodder as you learn your beginning attacks. Combat in Avowed is much better than I had anticipated. You quickly become accustomed to using flasks to regenerate not just your health, but more importantly your essence, which allows the execution of your most powerful attacks. As the barbarian, I found myself stalking spiders in the caverns and plotting my attack. To begin, I use Kai‚Äôs ability Fire and Ice via the radial wheel you access by holding down the left bumper (if you‚Äôre playing with a gamepad, obviously). Fire and Ice sees Kai Teleport to the target and then unload a powerful bullet into the spider‚Äôs Chelicerae, aka its face. Then I command him to use his area of effect attack, Leap of Daring, that has him slam into the ground and briefly stun everyone around him. During that time I‚Äôd been closing the gap, and using the two weapons I first charged up my right-handed axe which offers a powerful attack that inflicts frost damage accumulation to nearby enemies. After holding the right trigger to empower this attack I manage to freeze my opponents for just a moment. Then I unleash my more powerful essence abilities. First I shout to push back the smaller spiders who are also surrounding me, and while stunned, I then select charge and ram my body with force into the biggest guy in the room. Then, I follow it up with a flurry of blows with the left trigger, which holds my nimble sword for a small flurry of strikes that results in the dispatch of the last spider standing in the room.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Later, I would return as a mage, which was described as the most difficult of the three classes available to use. Abilities for this character included an ethereal staff that you could materialize with essence, orb projectiles that would track your target, and standard attacks that had you flicking your wand to and fro while smaller spells did damage to your target. Additional Essense abilities included a spear that was a bit faster than the staff (as you‚Äôd expect), and several different protection or buff spells to help your hits land with a bit harder thud. My personal favorite, however, was an ability that had you snap your book of magic shut to send a wave of damage-dealing aura at everything around you. It just looked cool seeing a book wreck everything in the immediate vicinity.</p><p>Make no mistake though, combat was also challenging. I was chugging potions with recklessness as I knew this was just a demo, but it was clear that you‚Äôll need to master the balance between your spell casting, defense, and gear options for maximum efficiency. Digging into the menus, I found that you could spec out your character with a 2nd weapon set that would be accessed with the press of the Y button on the controller. The potential that something so simple offers had me excited because with one press you could access a significantly different playstyle. Combat felt clean, intuitive, and had a depth I didn‚Äôt expect. I can‚Äôt wait to dive into it more. And fortunately, the oomph of your attack animations that many felt were missing from a demo on the Xbox stage earlier this year have seemingly been implemented; enemies react how you‚Äôd expect them to when you slash them with a sword or blast them with a spell.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Eventually, on our journey, Kai and I would run into Caedmon, a young explorer who had managed to survive the Xaurip assault. His friends from the expedition team weren‚Äôt so lucky, however. After lamenting that he‚Äôs ‚Äúnever touched a girl‚Äù and his looming fate wasn‚Äôt fair, we were given several conversation options:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>‚ÄúKai, we can‚Äôt let this kid die a virgin. Can you help him?‚Äù</li><li>‚ÄúGive Caedmon a healing option. Let‚Äôs get you back on your feet!‚Äù</li><li>‚ÄúToughen up kid. I‚Äôm not wasting my supplies on you.‚Äù</li></ul><p>I, of course, picked the top one.</p><p>Kai responded: ‚ÄúNot with that‚Ä¶ OH you mean with healing him.‚Äù He would then go on to make me offer my potion instead. Caedmon was back on his feet and offered us some advice that would help us continue our journey.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But because I also wanted to try out combat as a Mage, I got to see what happened if you always picked the bottom option. ‚ÄúToughen up Kid!‚Äù my character shouted. Caedmon said something Kai called nonsense, and pleaded with me to help him. I however refused to offer him the life saving potion, resulting in his immediate death. Did I loot his corpse? You‚Äôre damn right I did.</p><p>It‚Äôs situations like this that will make Avowed really stand out if they are plentiful enough. Can you really be that evil? Apparently so, and I look forward to doing a sane-person playthrough where I don‚Äôt murder everyone if I can avoid it, and a playthrough where I‚Äôm the biggest jerk possible because‚Ä¶ well, that‚Äôs where the fun lies now, isn‚Äôt it?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The demo ended with an encounter where we met Sargamis. Sargamis is a gold-skinned deity-like creature who sent us to find an item and return it. But like our explorer friends from earlier in the demo, there were other plans afoot and it wasn‚Äôt long until we came face-to-face with the Skeleton boss and a pesky Skeleton priest that would heal the large group of enemies we were facing off against. This was all triggered immediately after getting to the object Sargamis sent us to retrieve, to which Kai quipped, ‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt be this easy‚Ä¶ can it?‚Äù No, Kai, it apparently cannot be.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Can you really be that evil in Avowed? Apparently so.</p></div><p>Once in battle and realizing I was greatly outnumbered, I ran out of the room to survey the battlefield. After taking out a few of the lower rank-and-file skeletons just outside of the priest‚Äôs healing aura, I identified the one thwarting my plans of murder (can you murder a skeleton?) and I turned his bones to ice and dust. Just as I had cleared the grunts, I was finally ready to take on the Skeleton boss with Kai, but just as I had him on the ropes‚Ä¶. The power in the building went out for everyone playing the demo.</p><p>It‚Äôs OK, though, because Avowed had made its impression. My doubts about it have faded away, and I‚Äôm left excited for its release in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-delayed-to-february-2025-to-give-players-backlogs-some-breathing-room">February</a>. This small slice Obsidian gave us the opportunity to play was a treat, and while it‚Äôs a tiny glimpse, our 50-minute demo session flew by in the blink of an eye. And that‚Äôs always a good sign.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warcraft-story-gives-players-personalized-video-ahead-of-war-within<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Marketing is coming at players in full force with <em>World of Warcraft: The War Within</em>'s impending launch. This brand new expansion for the undying MMORPG might give you a hankering to jump back in, but before doing so, you should check out this neat website -- <a href="https://warcraftstory.com/">Warcraft Story </a>-- Blizzard made to welcome players back.</p>
<p><a href="https://warcraftstory.com/">Warcraft Story</a> is an official <em>World of Warcraft</em> website that searches "over 20 years of game data" and creates a personalized video chronicling some neat stats on your character. It takes several minutes to load, and while you're waiting for the video to conjure up, a loading screen chronicles some other miscellaneous stats like quests completed and total deaths.</p>
<p>My main since <em>Warlords of Draenor</em>, for instance, has completed a whopping 7,000 quests. It also talks about critters killed, number of deaths, et cetera, but let's not talk about those too much so as not to embarrass myself.</p>

<p>As a result of the loading, players are met with a video narrated by <em>The War Within</em>'s villain, Xal'atath. She narrates a short clip featuring your character's achievements (or failures). In one video for my Mag'har Hunter, she commended me for the amount of raid bosses I defeated. And apparently, I've cheered 83 times on this character. I definitely need to bump up those numbers!</p>
<p>From what I can tell, videos can vary, even for the same character as I got two different ones for my Troll Mage. Though Xal'atath made note of my class in both videos, I was met with different stats like how many kills I had on the prior expansion's first major boss, Raszageth, as well as how many times I've died to gravity.</p>
<p>While your own, personalized Warcraft Story could definitely merit being longer, it's a fun little tool to have in the background and see what it comes up with. If you're the type of player who has stuck around with <em>World of Warcraft</em> since the early days, it's a nice little incentive to jump back into things.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new expansion is less than a week away, too<em>: World of Warcraft: The War Within</em> launches on August 26, 2024.</p>

Survive an undead plague in a painstakingly recreated medieval market town. <a title="Series > Mana [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ge your needs, master physics-based mechanics, and evade the horde for as long as you can.</p><p><em>God Save Birmingham</em> is a zombie apocalypse survival game set in 14th century Birmingham, England.

The full town will be available at official release, with a campaign mode coming later to complete the experience.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>The End Has Come</strong> ‚Äì A strange plague sweeps the countryside, transforming men into monsters, and cities into slaughterhouses. You are one of the last survivors of Birmingham, alone against the shambling corpses of your former friends and neighbors, with only your wits to protect you.</li><li><strong>Nourish Thy Body</strong> ‚Äì Even after the end of the world, life goes on. Forage for supplies, craft tools and weapons, then set out on the hunt for food, water, and shelter. The clock is always ticking, and the horde is always near.</li><li><strong>Master Medieval Physics</strong> ‚Äì Wriggle your way out of harrowing situations with physics-based mechanics that reward quick wits and skill. Stack furniture to barricade doors, leap low fences to trip your clumsy foes, and sever limbs to reduce the undead to angry, wriggling torsos. Just be careful not to stumble over a bucket while fleeing for your life.</li><li><strong>Take a Bite Out of History</strong> ‚Äì Explore a carefully reconstructed 14th century Birmingham, in all its bucolic, bubonic glory. Stop by the Markets or the Burgage Plots to forage for resources. Raid boarded-up smithies for tools, grab a drink at the nearest tavern, and explore historic architecture at the Church of St. Martin in the Bull Ring.</li></ul><p>The Early Access version of the game will contain about one-quarter of the entire town, with the rest coming between the Early Access and full releases.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="God Save Birmingham - Official Game Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jmeG7DHhcTk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/nobody-needs-to-know-how-many-people-are-playing-a-singleplayer-video-game-nobody<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the worst aspects of current, toxic video game discourse has been the idea that, at any given moment, every single video game can and must have its playerbase statistically scrutinised. If the number of people playing a game is ever found to be an unacceptable number, then I'm afraid that's it. That game is in trouble. Maybe even dead.</p><p>Whether it's the press or an irate group of fans making the call, the process involved in this kangaroo court is normally the same: people take a look on Steam and console charts, see how many folks are playing a game, then report on their findings, usually as some kind of proof that the game is "dead".</p><p>Here is a prominent example from November 2023:</p><p>Aside from other issues with this headline--what do you mean "Could be", who's making the call here?--let's break this down. <em>Starfield </em>was released on September 6, means it had been out for almost three months at the time of that tweet. It's a singleplayer video game, one with huge preorder/launch week interest that subsequently reviewed...not poorly, but not what Bethesda would have been expecting or hoping for, either. It would have taken most players around 20-30 hours to finish up, and while a few obsessives will always play longer trying to rinse it, and there will always be a trickle of new players, for the vast majority of people taking part in online discourse about video games in November 2023, <em>Starfield </em>was done.</p><p>So of course its player numbers plummeted. It's not a live service or multiplayer game! If we were tracking the number of people playing <em>Destiny </em>or <em>Fortnite</em>, games specifically reliant on the number of people playing them, then sure, surges and drops in that count are important. But <em>Starfield </em>is a singleplayer video game! Most people who bought it are done with it. This is normal, and the fact it has been turned into <em>something </em>here is weird and gross.</p><p>Anyone concerned with a singleplayer video game's player count has been live service-pilled. The AAA video game industry's insistence that every major video game must now be played forever--<a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-valhalla-is-too-damn-long-1846138833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">look at the death march <em>Assassin's Creed Odyssey</em> and <em>Valhalla </em>subjected players to</a>--has begun soaking into the wider consciousness, and so when a game fails to hold our interest for months on end, it's somehow--for the live service-pilled among us, anyway--now seen as a failure.</p><p>Speaking of <em>Assassin's Creed</em>, its latest release, <em>Mirage</em>, is another game I've seen subjected to the same kind of scrutiny, and for the same deranged reasons.<a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/n24527/assassins-creed-mirage-one-month-player-count" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Here's a story with the headline "Assassin's Creed Mirage has big 68% drop in PS5 players in first month"</a>, which then goes onto...spell out the exact reason for this, namely that it's a singleplayer game in a busy time of the year for video game releases. And here's GameSpot<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-phantom-liberty-launch-cyberpunk-2077s-player-count-leaves-starfield-in-the-dust/1100-6517999/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> not just talking about <em>Cyberpunk 2077's</em> player count, but using that number as a stick to beat <em>Starfield </em>with</a>. Two different games, unrelated to each other except for the fact they're singleplayer video releases.</p><p>More recently, here's PCGamesN making note of what looks like a huge drop in <em>Black Myth: Wukong's</em> playerbase, a game that has only been out<em> for a few days</em>:</p><p>If you're a games writer, you don't need to be worrying about this shit! If you're a normal person taking part in video game discussions, you <em>definitely </em>do not need to be worrying about this shit. At best you're doing a AAA publisher's work in helping condition people to the idea all games must be played forever, and at worst you're doing your part in propagating toxic tribalism in video game fandom.</p><p>What you could be doing instead of scrutinizing numbers is enjoying a singleplayer video game for what it is, then getting on with your lives. Indeed, that's the best way to enjoy them!</p><p><em>This article was originally published in November 2023. It has been updated with more recent examples. </em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Located in the Pyrenees, this time-worn Jesuit monastery is home to a madhouse and an inquisitorial prison. Five prisoners‚Äîplagued by cruel punishment, madness, and despair‚Äîpool their skills and resources to face their phobias, stave off insanity, uncover the mysteries of the Monastery, and find a way to escape.</p><p><strong>Escape the Monastery</strong></p><p>Escaping such a well-guarded monastery is no easy task, but Agnes, Leonora, Eduardo, Amelia, and Alfredo are determined to see it through. Alternate control of all five characters and use their unique upgradable skills to cast spells, assassinate targets, distract enemies, stun evil spirits, explore hard-to-reach areas, and more.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Explore your surroundings and combine the characters‚Äô abilities to find clues and tools scattered throughout the monastery. Be careful though, if you‚Äôre caught being somewhere you shouldn‚Äôt be, the guards will not be kind.</p><p><strong><a title="Series > Mana [14 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ge the Madness</strong></p><p>To effectively navigate the monastery, you must be mindful of the characters‚Äô mental health.</p><p>Each playable character possesses a fully realized set of traumas and phobias. Triggering these traits depletes a character‚Äôs sanity, ultimately triggering a traumatic event with negative effects such as paranoia, dementia, or bouts of violence; fundamentally changing how the afflicted character is played.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_908846"><ul><li><span>‚ùÆ</span></li><li><span>‚ùØ</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Discover the Secrets Within</strong></p><p>Choose from two different escape plans to execute, each with its own stories, objectives, special characters, and other surprises.</p><p>Time is continuous in <em>The Stone of Madness</em>. <a title="Genres > Action [2,105 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">Action</a>s have consequences, and players must consider their time of day as they make decisions.</p><p>Sneaking, exploring, and gathering materials are all ideal tasks to complete during the day when security guards are easily distracted. But as morning gives way to evening, the paranormal inhabitants of the Monastery will start to reveal themselves; posing a threat to the characters‚Äô sanity.</p><p>Nighttime is most wisely spent planning and managing the escape plan. Any player who explores the monastery after curfew will be met with an extra challenge. Security is tighter, and guards will not take kindly to any prisoners wandering about.

<p>Bethesda's <em>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</em> is the latest game from a Microsoft subsidiary that will make its way to the PlayStation 5. The game will hit Sony's console in the spring of 2025, Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/the-great-circle-is-indiana-jones-for-a-post-uncharted-world/">announced yesterday</a>, months after a planned December launch on Xbox Series S/X and Windows.
</p><p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_o61DN93ik">an interview with YouTube channel Xbox On</a>, Microsoft's Phil Spencer expanded on that decision, implying that multiplatform releases for Microsoft gaming properties were important to the Xbox division's bottom line. "We run a business," he said, "It's definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery that we have to give back to the company, because we get a level of support from the company that's just amazing in what we're able to go do."</p>

<p>Amid massive layoffs that have hit <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/microsoft-cancels-blizzard-survival-game-lays-off-1900/">Xbox</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/report-embracers-ongoing-layoffs-kill-a-new-deus-ex-game-after-2-years-work/">other</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/unity-cuts-25-percent-of-workforce-as-it-refocuses-on-game-engine-business/">gaming companies</a> in recent months, Spencer noted that there's "a lot of pressure on the [game] industry" these days. "[The industry] has been growing for a long, long time and now people are looking for ways to grow," he said. "And I think that us, as fans, as players of games, we just have to anticipate there's going to be more change in how some of the traditional ways that games were built and distributed [ars] going to change... for all of us."</p>
<h2>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just going to be a strategy that works for us‚Äù</h2>
<p>Although Microsoft <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/microsoft-confirms-which-xbox-games-are-going-to-switch-playstation/">released four former Xbox exclusives on other platforms</a> months ago, Spencer suggested that there hasn't been any commensurate dip in total Xbox usage. "What I see when I look is our franchises are getting stronger; our Xbox console players are as high this year as they've ever been," he said.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>"So I look at it, and I say, 'Okay, our player numbers are going up for the console platform, our franchises are as strong as they've ever been... So I look at this [as] 'How can we make our games as strong as possible?'" our platform continues to grow both on console on PC and on cloud and I think it's just going to be a strategy that works for us."</p>

<p>Microsoft has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/xbox-chief-we-want-to-regain-trust-more-than-we-want-to-beat-sony/">long prioritized maintaining a healthy number of overall Xbox players</a> over selling more raw consoles than competitors like Sony. Still, the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/xbox-console-sales-continue-to-crater-with-massive-42-revenue-drop/">continuing cratering of sales revenue from Xbox hardware</a> likely contributes heavily to Microsoft's decision to release its games on competing platforms.
</p><p>A big-budget, big-name Bethesda release like <em>Indiana Jones</em> could act as more of an Xbox system seller than <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/microsoft-confirms-which-xbox-games-are-going-to-switch-playstation/">the four older, smaller games</a> that Microsoft recently let go multiplatform. Then again, <em>The Great Circle</em>'s multiple months of Xbox exclusivity‚Äîwhich include the 2024 holiday buying season‚Äîcould still provide a bit of a relative advantage for Microsoft's consoles.</p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</em>'s PS5 availability may come as a particular surprise to readers who remember Spencer <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/microsoft-says-its-taking-four-unnamed-xbox-games-to-the-other-consoles/">saying in February</a> that neither <em>The Great Circle</em> nor <em>Starfield</em> were a part of the company's current multiplatform plans. But a careful parsing of Spencer's words at the time shows that he only promised those titles were not among the four multiplatform titles they were announcing at that time.
</p><p>Back then, Spencer said that those four multiplatform releases didn't represent "a change to our fundamental exclusive strategy." But he added that there was a desire to "use what some of the other platforms have right now to help grow our franchises" to help "the long-term health of Xbox."</p>
<p>"[I have] a fundamental belief that over the next five or ten years... games that are exclusive to one piece of hardware are going to be a smaller and smaller part of the game industry," Spencer said in February.</p>
