			<p>Senior combat designer at Obsidian Rob Donovan and lead systems designer Kyle Koenig dove into the combat systems and changes to combat and gameplay in<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gets-first-gameplay-video-and-info/"> The Outer Worlds 2</a> in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahPlPgane1E">IGN</a>.</p>
<p>They talked a bit about some new changes to player movement, like how you can parkour now in The Outer Worlds 2, meaning that you can grab up onto new areas, slide into cover, and you can even spec your character to be better at things like shooting while sliding.</p>
<p>What they mostly talked about was the design philosophy the team had with combat in The Outer Worlds 2. For example, while you'll have plenty more options regarding how you want to handle a combat encounter, the enemies you'll face have also been designed to try and surprise you, and be more challenging to deal with.</p>
<p>A key aspect of that is the removal of level scaling for The Outer Worlds 2. Donovan described enemies as being classed in "<em>tiers</em>" this time around. So while you'll face a few enemies meant to be a little more difficult for newbies in the game's opening areas, by the time you've explored quite a bit and leveled up, you can return to those opening areas and crush anything in your path.</p>
<p>There was also a lot of thought put into making every path viable in combat, so there's no one playstyle that players feel like they should use, even if it goes against how they want to play the game. That said, Donovan did also state later in the video that the team considers The Outer Worlds 2 to be a "<em>ranged-first</em>" game with&nbsp;"<em>melee in the mix</em>," so players wanting a more melee-focused experience might be let down.</p>
<p>Another interesting point both Donovan and Koenig made was how the team looked at games like Destiny 2 and Call of Duty to try and improve gunplay in The Outer Worlds 2, to ensure that even if you're not creating a character that is going to be the most adept gunslinger, using any gun in your arsenal still feels good.</p>

<p>The Outer Worlds 2 is currently set to arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC sometime later this year, with more information coming on <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-set-for-june-8-the-outer-worlds-2-gets-direct-presentation-immediately-after/">June 8</a>, after Xbox has its big summer showcase for the year. Hopefully we'll learn the exact release date by then.</p>

While not officially announced, it’s all but a slam dunk now that <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> will arrive on Switch 2, likely some time before the end of 2025. </p><p>The game came to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC last fall with fun cinematic tag-team fights that mostly made up for its lackluster single-player  offerings. Especially notable was that local couch co-op battles were limited to a single stage. There was also a fair amount of debate around the character balancing for online competitive play, something the series hasn’t traditionally been known for but which more players expect in the modern world of ranked leaderboards. </p><p>While <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> is currently playable on Steam Deck, it remains to be seen how much performance it can squeeze out of the Switch 2. I have a hard time imagining it will  push beyond 30fps, but the cel-shaded art style might hold up surprisingly well in handheld mode. It would be extra neat if the Switch 2 version had special motion control options, harkening back to <em>Tenkaichi 3</em> on Wii, though I’m not holding my breath.</p><p>The game has been getting a steady stream of DLC since it released, with its first set of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut2y8gAv3aY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut2y8gAv3aY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daima characters joining the fighting roster last week</a></span>.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Indiana Jones and the Great Circle - Official Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Despite being the No. 1 overall best-selling game of the week that ended on April 19, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle did not crack the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lnv3kg5fek2k" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">top 15 most-played charts for the US in the same week</a>. What's the reason for that? Circana's Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lnvatx4bgk2v" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> it may come down to the "modern console environment" being dominated by live-service games.</p><p>"The big live-service games are sucking the air out of the market," Piscatella said.</p><p>On PlayStation and Xbox, Call of Duty: HQ was the No. 1 most popular game of the week based on weekly active users. In terms of Steam games, Marvel Rivals was No. 1 in the US, Counter-Strike 2 was No. 1 in Canada, and REPO was No. 1 in Mexico for the week.</p><p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was developed by Wolfenstein studio Machine Games. The Swedish studio doesn't have any confirmed upcoming games, but Lucasfilm has said it would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lucasfilm-says-it-would-be-super-interesting-to-make-more-indiana-jones-games/1100-6528369/" data-ref-id="1100-6528369">"super interesting" to see more Indiana Jones games.</a> Fans are also interested in seeing a new Wolfenstein.</p>

The icon looked like it would be the icon for a hypothetical mobile version of the game, the listing had screenshots that looked like they were indeed from <em>Blue Prince</em>, and the description for the game matched the description on Steam.</p><p>But on the iOS clone’s listing, the game’s seller was listed as “Samet Altinay,” and I can’t find any connection between this person and <em>Blue Prince</em> outside of this app. The copyright was also attributed to “DogBomb” — notice the missing “u.”</p><p>I purchased the now-removed, unofficial version of <em>Blue Prince</em>, which cost $9.99, and installed it on my iPhone 16 Pro to test it out. In a few minutes of playing, it appeared to be a barely modified version of the actual <em>Blue Prince</em> game, though with a few tweaks to make it better-suited for mobile, like a virtual joystick. I also quickly ran into a major bug: when I tried to walk through one of the doors from the Entrance Hall, I fell through the floor.</p><p>Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. Before the listing was pulled, the unofficial mobile port was the #8 paid app in the Entertainment category on iOS. When I published the article, it only had one three-star review, with the writer saying they also hit a bug that caused them to fall through the floor.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</strong><span><figcaption><em>Notice the mobile-friendly virtual joystick and map icon?</em></figcaption> <cite>Screenshot by Jay Peters / The Verge</cite></span></p></section><p>If you, like me, bought this clone version of the game, you might want to try to get a refund.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/8k-120hz-gaming-world-first-powered-by-amd-and-featuring-horizon-forbidden-west/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this month, during NAB (National Association of Broadcasters) Show 2025 in Las Vegas, the 8K Association demonstrated a 'world first' for 8K@120Hz gaming on HDMI 2.1. The spec is notoriously <a href="https://wccftech.com/hdmi-2-1-detailed-8k60hz-4k120hz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limited to 8K@60Hz</a>, but Display Stream Compression allowed them to overcome that limitation. The PC was entirely powered by AMD hardware and ran Guerrilla's Horizon Forbidden West game, which is known to be well-optimized.</p>
<p>Here's the excerpt from the <a href="https://8kassociation.com/industry-info/nab-2025-buzzes-and-a-world-first/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official 8K Association website</a>:</p>
<p><em>At one end of the booth, there was a demonstration of real time gaming using an AMD-based gaming PC and a special 65″ TV flown in from Korea by 8K Association member, Samsung, that supported 120fps display. The game was Horizon Forbidden West and the TV was a modified Neo QLED 8K set with</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM)</em></li>
<li><em>Variable Refresh Rate (VRR)</em></li>
<li><em>FreeSync Premium Pro</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>The PC was from Maingear and used an AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU and an AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT GPU. The game supports the Steam platform which allows analytics to be shown and confirming the 120Hz operation. The game was rendered at 5K and was then internally upscaled using AMD ML-based FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 technology.</em></p>
<p><em>The signal was sent to the TV using HDMI 2.1b with DSC support and the impressive smooth visuals attracted a lot of attention from visitors, especially those that were already aware of the game, which is visually very impressive.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="NAB Show 2025: 8K Association Talks About 8K 120Hz Gaming Over HDMI" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w5mUeSZJOs0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>8K gaming certainly still feels a little overkill, especially when some PC games have performance issues even at far lower resolutions. However, the latest GPUs from NVIDIA and AMD make it more manageable than ever with NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and AMD FSR 4 Frame Generation. Actually, Warhorse's Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-16-k-resolution-rtx-5090/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shown running at playable frame rates even at 16K resolution on the GeForce RTX 5090</a>, and that's without Frame Generation, which is not supported in that game.</p>
<p>With the HDMI 2.2 spec <a href="https://wccftech.com/hdmi-2-2-now-confirmed-to-debut-at-ces-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at CES 2025 and its official release scheduled for later this year, 8K displays will likely become more common thanks to the doubled (96 Gbps) bandwidth. At the same time, it may well take a few years - we'll probably get a new generation of GPUs before 8K gaming really becomes widely attainable with both hardware and software.</p>

Some of my favorite games are included here, most notably <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxXveP?object_uuid=1400d27b-fb11-40fe-886d-013dcab0ab3b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Legends: Arceus</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m currently playing through it again to calm my hype for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Legends: Z-A</a> when it drops for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide">Switch 2</a>.

Some games might require specific patches or paid upgrades to fully take advantage of the new hardware. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, based on how Nintendo has handled generational shifts in the past, it is likely that most titles will at least see smoother frame rates, better resolutions, and stronger stability even without official patches. In my opinion, it is a smart time to grab a few favorites while they are discounted.</p><p id="pokmon-legends-arceus"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon Legends: Arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</h2></p><div catalogid="252c07cb-0977-4973-b680-164f7818c39e" id="219594"><div id="219594" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-arceus-review">Legends: Arceus</a> threw out the traditional gym system and gave us something a lot more interesting: open-world (kind of) exploration and real-time catching mechanics. You're not just battling wild Pokémon, you're sneaking up on them, throwing Poké Balls by hand, and dodging attacks yourself. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It is a refreshing change of pace, and it still feels ahead of its time compared to some other entries. If you are like me and counting down the days until Legends: Z-A on Switch 2, playing Arceus again is honestly the best way to pass the time.</p></div><p id="pokmon-sword"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon Sword">Pokémon Sword</h2></p><div catalogid="252c07cb-0977-4973-b680-164f7818c39e" id="219595"><div id="219595" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon Sword</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sword was one half of Pokémon's first fully 3D mainline entries on Switch (Yes, we know it was Let's Go Pikachu and Eevee, but this is the first fully-ledged new generation game).<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/13/pokemon-sword-and-shield-review"> Sword and Shield</a> introduces the Galar region, Dynamax battles, and the Wild Area. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latter is a semi-open world filled with high-level monsters and weather changes. Sword-specific content includes exclusive Pokémon like Zacian (the sword-wielding legendary) and gym leaders like Bea. In my opinion, Sword leans a little more into offense-focused exclusives, making it a solid choice if you like fast, aggressive teams.</p></div><p id="pokmon-shield"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon Shield">Pokémon Shield</h2></p><div catalogid="252c07cb-0977-4973-b680-164f7818c39e" id="219596"><div id="219596" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon Shield</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Shield is the companion to Sword, but it is not just a reskin. You get different gym leaders like Allister, exclusive Pokémon like Zamazenta (who basically turns into a shield), and a slightly different emphasis on defensive strategies. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also think Shield players tend to get access to a few more bulkier, tankier monsters earlier on. Otherwise, it is the same story and exploration structure. Choosing between Sword and Shield is really just about what kind of team you want to build.</p></div><p id="pokmon-brilliant-diamond"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Pokémon Brilliant Diamond">Pokémon Brilliant Diamond</h2></p><div catalogid="252c07cb-0977-4973-b680-164f7818c39e" id="219597"><div id="219597" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Pokémon Brilliant Diamond</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-brilliant-diamond-shining-pearl-review">Brilliant Diamond</a> is a modern remake of the 2006 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-ds-games">Nintendo DS</a> game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-diamond-version">Pokémon Diamond</a>.

He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The GitHub repository for The Homebrew Channel (HBC), a popular piece of software used on hacked Nintendo Wiis, has been archived. Its maintainers are accusing the creators of “libogc,” a software toolkit HBC relies on, of stealing both Nintendo-made and open-source code and presenting it as their own, according to a <a href="https://github.com/fail0verflow/hbc?tab=readme-ov-file">ReadMe posted to the repository yesterday</a> by <a href="https://github.com/fail0verflow">hacking group fail0verflow</a>. (Hat tip to <a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1916557212509478946">X user OatmealDome</a>.)</p><p>HBC is a central piece of the Wii homebrew community, serving as a launcher for non-Nintendo-approved software without needing to re-run an exploit. Through it, you can do things like load GameCube and Wii game files, run older console emulators, and more from a USB-connected hard drive or the Wii’s SD card slot. HBC is also one of the cleanest ways to back up your own Wii or GameCube collection, as you can copy files from game discs using Nintendo’s own hardware.</p><p>In its ReadMe, fail0verflow, which owns the HBC repository, writes that although they knew early on that libogc used some stolen Nintendo code, they thought much of the rest of it was original code and decided to “reluctantly” continue using it. However, they say that after <a href="https://github.com/derek57/libogc">another developer</a> claimed the code was actually lifted from the open-source RTEMS without attribution, they filed an issue that libogc’s developers closed and replied to with “verbal abuse” before deleting it. HBC’s developers say they now “consider it impossible to legally and legitimately compile this software at this point, and cannot encourage any further development.”</p><p>WiiHacks, one of the most well-made guides for hacking a Wii, still seems to offer all of the file downloads needed to hack a Wii. But as <a href="https://gamerant.com/wii-homebrew-copyright-infringement-stolen-nintendo-code-accusations/"><em>GameRant</em> notes</a>, that could change, particularly with the HBC developers admitting that some Nintendo code was used in the tooling it relies on. Nintendo has been known to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/4/24090357/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settlement">go after emulation projects</a> in the past, after all. If you’ve already hacked a Wii, none of this will matter much. HBC itself hasn’t had any major updates for years — just don’t count on any persistent bugs going away anytime soon, if ever.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In its first weekend in theaters, the R-rated original horror film brought in more than $55 million over Easter weekend. And that’s just in the United States. It was an impressive haul, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.salon.com/2025/04/26/the-smash-success-of-sinners-could-shift-hollywoods-power-balance/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.salon.com/2025/04/26/the-smash-success-of-sinners-could-shift-hollywoods-power-balance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even if some tried to downplay it</a></span>. <em>Sinners</em> cost around $90 million to make, not counting marketing, so some worried that the pricey horror film wouldn’t be able to break even or make a profit. But given its continued success, I think those concerns are gone now. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2153611265/weekend/?ref_=bo_rl_tab#tabs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2153611265/weekend/?ref_=bo_rl_tab#tabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On April 28, <em>Box Office Mojo</em> reported</a></span> that during its second weekend in theaters, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/film/news/sinners-box-office-massive-second-weekend-star-wars-revenge-of-the-sith-rerelease-scores-1236379466/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/sinners-box-office-massive-second-weekend-star-wars-revenge-of-the-sith-rerelease-scores-1236379466/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Sinners</em> earned $45 million</a></span>. That’s just a six percent drop from its opening weekend returns. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/smallest_second_weekend_gross_drop/?by_release_scale=super_saturated&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/smallest_second_weekend_gross_drop/?by_release_scale=super_saturated" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">That kind of small drop is really rare these days</a></span>, especially for a live-action original film. And it’s nearly unheard for horror movies, which tend to lose momentum after the first weekend. </p><p>In comparison, <em>Megan</em> in 2023—which was a very popular horror movie—dropped nearly 40 percent in its second weekend. 2018's massively popular <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1342342657/weekend/?ref_=bo_rl_tab#tabs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1342342657/weekend/?ref_=bo_rl_tab#tabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Halloween</em> reboot/sequel dropped 58 percent</a></span> in its second weekend. So yeah, live-action horror hits rarely drop so little. It’s a good sign for WB and Coogler that <em>Sinners</em> will likely have some long legs going into May. Currently, the movie’s total worldwide box office score is $161 million. </p><p>Meanwhile, <em>Revenge of the Sith</em> was re-released in theaters over the weekend and shocked everyone,<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2905833473/weekend/?ref_=bo_rl_tab#tabs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl2905833473/weekend/?ref_=bo_rl_tab#tabs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> earning an astounding $42 million globally</a></span>, with more than half that coming from the US alone. That’s wild for a movie that has been easily accessible via streaming for over a decade now. The 20-year-old <em>Star Wars</em> sequel was the second-biggest movie in the United States, behind <em>Sinners</em>, and just in front of Ben Affleck’s newly released <em>The Accountant 2</em>. </p><h2 id="h18159"><a id=""></a>Do people want new ideas or nostalgic rereleases? Yes</h2><p>Why I find this weekend’s box office results so weird is that you can easily use the same numbers to argue to very different ideas. </p><p>You can point to <em>Revenge of the Sith</em>’s big haul and suggest that audiences are less hungry for new movies than ever before, and are willing to pay theater ticket prices to watch something from 20 years ago. However, you could also point to <em>Sinners</em> having a record-breaking second weekend and suggest that audiences demand new ideas and movies. Honestly, I’d say that both takes are correct. I think people are more likely to watch comfort food over something new, but there is a demand for fresh movies from famous directors with proven track records. </p><p>I think people—as always—want good movies, or to have fun at the theater, or both. And it doesn’t matter if the film is old, new, unique, or a sequel. The secret really is: Make good movies people like. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-review-bad-jack-black-kids-movie-steve-1851775345&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-review-bad-jack-black-kids-movie-steve-1851775345">But then again, <em>Minecraft</em> crossed $800 million at the box office this weekend and that movie sucks</a></span>. </p><p>So actually, I have no idea what people want. Never mind. </p><p>&nbsp;.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In December 2021, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splinter-cell-remake-officially-in-development-at-ubisoft-toronto/1100-6499011/">Ubisoft revealed a Splinter Cell remake</a> starring Sam Fisher. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-splinter-cell-remake-details-shared/1100-6499038/">Ubisoft Toronto was tasked with reviving the franchise</a>, previously making Blacklist as well as 2021's Far Cry 6. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-celebrates-splinter-cell-20th-anniversary-shares-remake-concept-art/1100-6509255/">For the Splinter Cell 20th anniversary</a> in 2022, a few new details were shared for the Splinter Cell remake, such as concept art and new AI behaviors for enemies. However, since then, info has been relatively sparse. GameSpot's Gabe Gurwin <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-a-splinter-cell-devotee-wants-from-the-remake/1100-6499075/">shared a wish list of things for the Splinter Cell remake</a> as a huge fan of the franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">At one point, there was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-four-games-including-splinter-cell-vr-and-ghost-recon-frontline/1100-6505722/" data-ref-id="1100-6505722">a Splinter Cell VR title in the works, but that got canned</a> in 2022. Later that year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splinter-cell-audio-series-premieres-today/1100-6509680/" data-ref-id="1100-6509680">a Splinter Cell audio series did come out</a> with eight episodes. Additionally, there's a Splinter Cell faction in the free-to-play shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xdefiant-shuts-down-in-june-2025-ubisoft-closes-two-offices/1100-6528210/" data-ref-id="1100-6528210">XDefiant, but it's shutting down in June</a>. </p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splinter-cell-movie-sneaks-back-to-the-shadows-after-being-canceled/1100-6527785/">A Splinter Cell movie was canceled</a> last year, which could have seen Venom's Tom Hardy wearing the goggles and becoming Sam Fisher. The stealth franchise will come to TV screens, though, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-debuts-trailers-for-splinter-cell-tomb-raider-dmc-and-more/1100-6526599/">an upcoming Netflix series called Splinter Cell: Deathwatch</a>. Liev Schrieber will voice Fisher instead of Michael Ironside.</p>

It also surprised other games released on the same day.</p><p dir="ltr">That's the case with developer Red Soul's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/post-trauma/" data-ref-id="5000-542161">Post Trauma</a>, an indie survival horror title inspired by early PlayStation classics like Silent Hill and Resident Evil that was also released on April 22. The game's publisher, Raw Fury, is now going with a "when life gives you lemons, make lemonade" approach to the situation, announcing Post Trauma will jokingly be getting a "spiritual re-release" in the wake of Oblivion Remastered stealing its thunder.</p><p dir="ltr">In a video <a href="https://x.com/RawFury/status/1915784451440681375" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post on X</a>, Raw Fury said the game's re-release event will be called Post Trauma: The Re-Release Except We're Not Un-Releasing It First, And It's Pretty Much the Same, promoted by the hashtag "PleaseNoShadowDropThisTime." It will "re-release" on June 23, a "completely random number that we chose" that just so happens to coincide with how long it takes to finish Oblivion Remastered.</p><p dir="ltr">"There'll be giveaways, streams, and celebrations on this spiritual re-release day, so make sure you're there," a Raw Fury employee says in the video. "Once you've finished playing Oblivion, obviously."</p><p dir="ltr">Post Trauma sees players step into the shoes of Roman, a train conductor transported to a strange dimension following a panic attack. It is filled with Resident Evil-style puzzles, save rooms, and fixed camera angles, as players navigate its surreal world filled with nightmarish monsters and eerie environments. Post Trauma is available on Steam, as well as Xbox and PlayStation.</p><p dir="ltr">Raw Fury isn't the only to be caught off guard by Oblivion Remastered's sudden release. Another indie game, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-case-you-missed-it-this-lovecraft-meets-battlestar-galactica-game-is-out-right-now/1100-6531120/" data-ref-id="1100-6531120">Lovecraft-inspired roguelike Starless Abyss, released on April 25</a> to little fanfare. Some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-couldnt-come-at-a-worse-time-for-some-games/1100-6531025/" data-ref-id="1100-6531025">worried Oblivion Remastered would overshadow a different day-one Game Pass RPG</a> released April 24, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" data-ref-id="5000-631965">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, although those worries seem to have been overblown. One of the game's stars said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2025s-best-reviewed-game-can-exist-alongside-oblivion-remastered-clair-obscur-star-says/1100-6531070/" data-ref-id="1100-6531070">both RPGs can exist alongside each other</a>, and Clair Obsur: Expedition 33 has gone on to sell more than one million copies in three days, with Bethesda announcing 4 million players had played Oblivion Remastered.</p>

			<p>Embark Studios, the studio behind the multiplayer shooter hit <a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-announces-the-finals-season-5-coming-december-12/">The Finals,</a> is set to have a playtest for its next release, Arc Raiders, which is due out sometime later in 2025.</p>
<p>Beginning this coming Wednesday, April 30, Embark will host its second playtest for Arc Raiders. The first playtest for the game happened last October and was only open to PC players. This time, it'll be open to players on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S alongside PC players, and it will run from Wednesday to next Sunday, May 4.</p>
<p>Embark showed off a new trailer for Arc Raiders today, ahead of the playtest kicking off on Wednesday, showing a bit more gameplay, including some shots of players battling giant robots.</p>
<p><iframe title="ARC Raiders | Tech Test 2 Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dTRRb7ODhjA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Arc Raiders is a third-person shooter, rather than another FPS, and is a PvPvE extraction shooter. Back in 2021, it was initially meant to be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-a-free-to-play-coop-shooter-is-embarks-debut-game/">debut game</a> for Embark Studios, before it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-is-now-a-pvpve-extraction-shooter-closed-alpha-test-starts-this-summer/">delayed</a> several times, due in part to it changing from its original vision, since it wasn't always meant to be a PvPvE third-person extraction shooter.</p>
<p>Even with the delays and changes to what the game was originally meant to be, Arc Raiders is shaping up to be a game to watch out for. Embark Studios has proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that it can make a game with legs, even in an overcrowded shooter space, with its success with The Finals.</p>
<p>There's no reason to think it couldn't do the same with Arc Raiders, even after what many would consider to be signs of the game having a troubled development. If you're keen on checking out Arc Raiders, there's still time to sign up and potentially be selected for Wednesday's playtest through the game's <a href="https://arcraiders.com/">official website</a>.</p>
