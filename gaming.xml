			<p>Just a day ago, members of the Spiders game studio were speaking out about their experiences at the company in a <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2024/08/open-letter-from-spiders-workers-to-their-employer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20-page open letter</a>. This isn't the first time <a href="https://wccftech.com/members-of-spiders-go-on-strike-due-to-issues-within-the-company/">Spiders employees</a> have spoken out, as they spoke out in January and were met with silence. Today, Spiders management posted a public response to the allegations made by STJV (Syndicat des Travailleurs (ses) du Jeu Video), one of the unions representing the studio members. In the response, they said the following:</p>
<p>"The false and even defamatory accusations made by STJV in no way reflect the day-to-day working life of the company's employees and are an attack on the reputation of the studio, whose teams are fully mobilized to produce quality games and enthusiastically ensure the Early Access release of Greedfall 2."</p>
<p>The statement also says that they have made unsuccessful attempts to reach out to a delegation of employees but will try again in the following week to contact them. Spiders management has stated that they are "committed to open and constructive social dialogue," to try and meet the demands or to negotiate terms that suit both parties.</p>
<p>For those who missed the open letter, members of the Spiders game company, responsible for games such as Greedfall and Steelrising, have written the open letter to try and make the environment healthier for those working at the company. They have been allegedly facing a myriad of issues while working at the company.</p>
<p>These issues include gender inequality and no job or financial security. There is no possibility of climbing the ladder within the company to get into senior roles, with people stuck in stagnant junior roles. Equally, plenty of those working at the company are now struggling to maintain their lives in Paris, as the city is increasingly expensive, and their wages are insufficient.</p>
<p>Spiders management's statement is signed off with, "Spiders' employees are at the heart of the studio, and we are determined to maintain an inclusive and stimulating work environment in which every talent can flourish and of which we can all be proud."</p>
<p>Spiders is working on Greedfall 2: The Dying World, intending to release an Early Access version of the game in September. However, with the strikes starting shortly, it's uncertain whether they will meet the goal should negotiations not be successful for the employees developing the game. For now, Greedfall 2: The Dying World will be released in Early Access on 24 September 2024.</p>

The program was built off the back of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-store-shutdown-offline-july-2024-1851587402&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-store-shutdown-offline-july-2024-1851587402">Xbox 360’s marketplace</a></span>, which famously <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-tribute-retrospective-halo-3-red-ring-e3-1851609358&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-tribute-retrospective-halo-3-red-ring-e3-1851609358">became a haven for indie games</a></span> in the late ‘00s and early ‘10s, such as <em>Bastion </em>and the original <em>Geometry Wars</em>. Xbox remains a powerhouse for indies, thanks in no small part to their frequent releases on the platform’s Game Pass subscription service, which provides access to hundreds of games (many of them indies) on a rolling basis. Now, Xbox is holding a sale on a number of its ID@Xbox titles, and we’ve gone to the liberty of picking out a few games you should pick up. Alternatively, a few of these are available on Game Pass but, in my opinion, the last year has borne out that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866">subscriptions are theft and ownership is the way forward</a></span>. Without further ado, comrades, the highlights of Xbox’s ongoing sale. </p></div><div><p><em>Deep Rock Galactic </em>Is one of my favorite games of the last several years. In the middle of the dreaded pandemic, I <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/left-4-dead/left-4-dead&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/left-4-dead/left-4-dead" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rekindled my relationship with my closest friends</a></span> in the world over games like this and <em>Left 4 Dead</em>. Cooperative first-person shooters in which you face endless onslaughts of enemies are just a wondrous recipe for the most fun imaginable in games, and <em>Deep Rock Galactic </em>taps that vein for all its worth. You are dwarves who are sent on hellish expeditions to mine resources for a blatantly awful corporation and I love how much <em>Deep Rock Galactic </em>feels built to facilitate a workplace sitcom. You have a nightmare day in the mines, but when you come back to your base, there’s a bar that you can all drink and dance at, and there are small secrets and games hidden around for you to engage with you as you engage in idle late-night banter with your pals.</p><p>Besides that, <em>Deep Rock Galactic</em> is one of the most accessible live-service games, with a deeply welcoming and dorky community that yell “Rock and stone” at each other in passing. It has a seasonal model but every season is completely free, and the developers have even made it possible to go back and unlock every battle pass that has come and gone. The game’s also wildly deep, offering four distinct classes of character with their own weapons, tools, skill trees, and customization options. And if you want to be especially hardcore, you can always amp up the difficulty of your missions, or jump into endgame dives. <em><strong>Deep Rock </strong></em><strong>has something for everyone, and it’s a steal for just about $10, though it’s also available on Game Pass.</strong></p></div><div><p><em>Desert Child </em>is just plain old-school cool. Clearly developed by folks who love <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>, it’s a game in which you vibe out to lo-fi hip hop, race people on hoverbikes in slickly animated sequences, and stop into ramen shops to refuel between bouts. Along the way, you also pick up odd jobs and bounties because despite your skill as a racer, you’re also flat broke.<strong> If you want relaxing meditations on the future of the gig economy in an anime-inspired pixel art game that’s short and sweet, you can’t go wrong picking up </strong><em><strong>Desert Child</strong></em><strong> for just $3.</strong></p></div><div><p><em>Amnesia: The Dark Descent </em>is probably the single most important horror game of the 2010s. Inspiring a handful of imitators that have seemed to lap it ever since, like the <em>Outlast </em>games, <em>Amnesia </em>gave rise to the genre of horror titles that disempowered the player character. Rather than provide tools or weapons to combat the terrors with, <em>Amnesia </em>has always leaned into the notion that these nightmares are absolutely terrifying things that we’re better served running away from. <em>Amnesia</em> plunged players into darkness, asking them to take care of their sanity and flee from things that dare lurk in the dark.</p><p>Since the first game was released, <em>Amnesia </em>has spawned a series of increasingly weird and experimental games, including <em>Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs </em>and the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/new-amnesia-the-bunker-review-release-date-ps5-xbox-1850507768&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/new-amnesia-the-bunker-review-release-date-ps5-xbox-1850507768">immersive sim <em>Amnesia: The Bunker</em></a></span>. <strong>Though <em>The Bunker</em> is available on Game Pass, it is also on sale for $10 bucks right now. <em>Amnesia: Collection </em>(compiling <em>The Dark Descent, A Machine for Pigs, </em>and<em> Justine</em>) is going for $4.49. Another sequel, titled </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/amnesia-rebirth-makes-motherhood-scary-1845513177&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/amnesia-rebirth-makes-motherhood-scary-1845513177"><em><strong>Amnesia: Rebirth</strong></em></a></span><strong><em>, </em>is also available for the same price.</strong></p></div><div><p><em>Gang Beasts </em>has been a staple of game nights forever. A party game all about flopping around while duking it out with your friends, <em>Gang Beasts </em>is a certifiable good time, especially if y’all are already feeling a little silly. The joy of <em>Gang Beasts, </em>as well as similar games like <em>Party Animals</em>, is in how messy it is. They’re games built to be taken as jokes, and because of that, they are the easiest to get into. Seriously, suggest this to your game night friends, or throw it on if you’re having a party, and I’m sure it’ll have its fans by the end of the night. <strong>You can pick up </strong><em><strong>Gang Beasts </strong></em><strong>for $8 or alternatively check it out on Game Pass. </strong></p></div><div><p>Do not let <em>Overland</em>’s cute polygonal look fool you, this tactics game is <em>tough</em>. But therein lies the satisfying feeling of triumph that <em>Overland</em>’s so good at producing. Part strategy game, part roadtrip survival sim, <em>Overland </em>is a grueling trek across post-apocalyptic America where subterranean aliens threaten your ability to simply refuel your car, which you need to maneuver to the end of every stage in order to succeed and live to see another day. Because there is such a scarcity of things in the apocalypse, <em>Overland </em>is much more about making the best of a constantly shitty hand than ever growing into some all-powerful brute that wipes the floor with any challenge. <strong>It’s a different take on a strategy game that I don’t think got a fair shake when it first came out, but you can fix that by picking up </strong><em><strong>Overland </strong></em><strong>for $8.</strong></p></div><div><p><em>Paradise Killer </em>is the only game I’m recommending purely based on the praise of everyone around me. I’ve heard time and time again that this visual novel features some of the best writing of the last few years, and wraps it up in gorgeous character art and a wonderful premise about unraveling the mystery of a serial killer on an island dubbed a paradise. <strong>If vaporwave aesthetics and a game I’ve heard is more or less like “if </strong><em><strong>Ace Attorney </strong></em><strong>fucked” rings any amount of bells for you, you might want to get in on </strong><em><strong>Paradise Killer </strong></em><strong>for $6. </strong></p></div><div><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>Sable </em>is one of the most gorgeous games I’ve played. Rendered in a completely arresting visual style, <em>Sable </em>is like a pacifist’s 3D <em>Zelda </em>game. You are the young Sable as she embarks on her Gliding, a kind of coming-of-age ritual that members of her nomadic tribe must make at a certain point in their lifetimes. In practice, you spend the game piloting her hoverbike over the most beautiful desert, going from town to town sifting through people’s troubles, and trying to piece together the person that Sable wants to be. At the end of the game, you must pick a mask that’ll communicate to the world what that is. It is one of the most overlooked games of the last few years, it’s endlessly charming, and you can look at it all day and still constantly find new things to be in awe of. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sable-the-kotaku-review-1847762599&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sable-the-kotaku-review-1847762599"><strong><em>Sable </em>is an absolute must-have game</strong></a></span><strong> and you can pick it up for $8.74.</strong><br></p></div><div><p>The <em>Warhammer </em>games have been around forever, but it does feel like they’ve been enjoying a bit of a renaissance of late. A lot of folks are looking forward to the upcoming release of <em>Space Marine 2</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/warhammer-w40k-space-marine-2-pvp-co-op-reveal-trailer-1851497076&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/warhammer-w40k-space-marine-2-pvp-co-op-reveal-trailer-1851497076">which looks great</a></span>, but if you’re looking for a different speed of game to enjoy with friends, perhaps consider <em>Vermintide 2 </em>and/or <em>Darktide</em>. These cooperative first-person shooters are similar in style to <em>Deep Rock Galactic </em>and <em>Left 4 Dead</em>, though they hew closer to the latter thanks to their mission-based gameplay. <em>Vermintide 2 </em>is a perennial favorite, having been supported for a number of years with free and paid DLC that added new missions and character classes to the dark-fantasy game. If <em>Warhammer</em>’s traditional sci-fi trappings are more your speed like they are mine, <em>Darktide, </em>which released just about two years ago, should be up your alley. Though it started out in a rough spot, <em>Darktide </em>is doing better these days, and the developer behind both has shifted the bulk of its resources to supporting <em>Darktide </em>well into the future. <strong>You can pick up </strong><em><strong>Darktide</strong></em><strong>’s imperial edition for $24 and the ultimate edition of </strong><em><strong>Vermintide 2 </strong></em><strong>(packing some hefty paid expansions) for $11.</strong></p></div><div><p><em>Enter the Gungeon </em>is just a blisteringly ludicrous game. If you need the elevator pitch beyond that incredible name, here it is: you are a Gungeoneer who must plumb the depths of procedurally generated dungeons filled with enemies themed after guns and bullets—all the while picking up increasingly exotic weapons yourself—in order to find a gun to kill the past. Need I say much more? I will anyways. <em>Enter The Gungeon </em>is a game I’ve never beaten, but one that I’ve frequently enjoyed watching, especially at charity speedrunning events like Awesome Games Done Quick. Seeing everything the game has to offer, including content across numerous free updates, always leaves me craving a return to the gungeon, which has some of the most dynamic gameplay ever seen in a roguelike. It feels good to play and features hilarious gun puns, I don’t know what more you could want from a game. <strong>You, too, can become a pun-spewing gungeoneer by picking up </strong><em><strong>Enter the Gungeon </strong></em><strong>for $4.49. </strong></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Razer's console controller line has expanded with its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Wolverine-Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Console/dp/B0DB6S6R89?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Wolverine-Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Console/dp/B0DB6S6R89?tag=gamespot-promos-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">first wireless model for Xbox</a>, and it's easily the best Wolverine controller yet.

Razer has also launched a <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Frazer.a9yw.net%2Fc%2F1804712%2F642901%2F10229%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fconsole-controllers%2Frazer-wolverine-v3-tournament-edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Frazer-wolverine-v3-pro-xbox-pc-controller-review%2F1100-6526158%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/1804712/642901/10229?subId1=subid_value&amp;u=https://www.razer.com/console-controllers/razer-wolverine-v3-tournament-edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wired-only V3 Tournament Edition</a> for $100.</p><hr><h3>Wolverine V3 Pro is the latest Xbox Elite Series 2 challenger</h3><p>The Wolverine V3 Pro is the latest controller to take advantage of Xbox's recent decision to open its wireless protocol to third-party manufacturers. At the end of the day, every pro-style controller for Xbox ultimately competes with Xbox's Elite Series 2 controller, which has been the gold standard in the premium controller market for years. Each of its main competitors so far have excelled in their own ways, with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Remappable-Customizable-Console/dp/B0CQ3NL4QG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Remappable-Customizable-Console/dp/B0CQ3NL4QG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Victrix Pro BFG</a> offering a unique modular design and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Wireless-Controller-Licensed-Xbox-X/dp/B0CJVQFZ1S?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/High-Performance-Wireless-Controller-Licensed-Xbox-X/dp/B0CJVQFZ1S?tag=gamespot-promos-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Turtle Beach Stealth Ultra</a> sporting the most robust internal customization features. The Wolverine V3 Pro is an all-around success that surpasses its third-party competitors and stands toe-to-toe with the Elite Series 2.</p><h3>Wolverine V3 Pro's most impactful changes</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4358722-razerwolverinev3pro.png" data-ref-id="1300-4358722" data-ratio="0.562" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4358722-razerwolverinev3pro.png" data-ref-id="1300-4358722"></a><figcaption>Razer Wolverine V3 Pro wireless controller for Xbox and PC</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4358722-razerwolverinev3pro.png"></figure><p>Naturally, the biggest surface-level change with the V3 Pro is its wireless connection. Razer has released several Wolverine controllers for Xbox over the years, all of which were restricted to a wired connection. The manufacturer often mentioned latency as a reason why wired was better for a pro-style style controller, but it also wasn't able to make one due to Microsoft's in-house wireless protocols. Wireless connections have come a long way in recent years, and while wired controllers still <em>technically </em>offer the fastest response times, technologies such as Razer's HyperSpeed wireless make latency with a good wireless controller, synced with a good protocol, virtually impossible to notice.</p><p>Razer utilized its HyperSpeed wireless connection with the V2 Pro, a PS5 and PC controller, and the V3 Pro communicates the same way with the 2.4GHz USB dongle. I tested the controller for over 30 hours the last few weeks and didn't notice any input latency. But for discerning players who take competition seriously, you can still use a wired connection with the braided 10-foot USB-C cable. On PC, there's a dedicated feature for wired play called Tournament Mode. Once enabled, the V3 Pro has a 1000Hz polling rate. I didn't notice a performance difference, but maybe you will. Regardless, if you're used to wireless controllers on Xbox, you won't be disappointed with the wireless connection here. I maxed out at around 20 hours of battery life on a full charge.</p><p>The lack of a wireless connection has always been the biggest downside with Razer's Xbox controllers, but the V3 Pro also addresses a few other important issues. Though Hall Effect analog sticks are quickly becoming a routine feature in pro-style and even budget controllers, this is the first Wolverine controller to make use of the technology that prevents analog stick drift. Sticks that activate via Hall Effect sensors aren't the same quality from controller to controller; the V3 Pro's lightweight sticks have the smoothest range of motion I've tried. They have just the right amount of resistance for precise movements. It's not really a fair comparison since the technology is different, but the difference between these sticks and those of the Wolverine V2 Pro is quite noticeable.</p><p>It's not a new feature, but you can swap out the default sticks with two other styles: one taller stick that's typically used for first-person shooters and a dome stick. It would've been nice to get two dome sticks, but it only comes with one of each.</p><p>My longstanding complaint with the Wolverine line has been the back triggers. Simply put, they never made sense. Up until now, Razer arranged the four triggers in two columns close to the center of the controller, forcing many players like myself to tweak their grip to rest our fingers on the triggers. Razer has finally ditched that design, completely retooling the shape and location of the four back triggers to follow standard conventions. The four built-in triggers are shaped like paddles and curve across the handles. This design combined with an excellent form factor and textured handles--it's very similar to the V2 Chroma in shape and chassis feel--makes holding the V3 Pro for hours a consistently comfortable experience.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4358682-razerwolverinev3proback.png" data-ref-id="1300-4358682" data-ratio="0.562" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4358682-razerwolverinev3proback.png" data-ref-id="1300-4358682"></a><figcaption>The V3 Pro revamps the Wolverine's back button design.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4358682-razerwolverinev3proback.png"></figure><p>When Razer released the V2 Pro for PS5, I was quite surprised it didn't come with a hardshell carrying case, especially since it was the priciest officially licensed PS5 controller at $250. Thankfully, the Wolverine V3 Pro does come with a hardshell carrying case with a formfitting recess for the controller, snug compartments for the extra sticks and dongle, and a mesh pocket for the USB-C cable.</p><h3>The return of the microswitch king</h3><p>Microswitch inputs might soon become a trend. Turtle Beach featured them in its Stealth Ultra, and PowerA used them in its upcoming <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-Gaming-Lumectra-Charging-Console/dp/B0D8TB5MM8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-Gaming-Lumectra-Charging-Console/dp/B0D8TB5MM8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">OPS V3 Pro</a>--the prolific manufacturer's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/poweras-new-ops-v3-pro-controller-punches-above-its-price/1100-6525934/" data-ref-id="1100-6525934" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/poweras-new-ops-v3-pro-controller-punches-above-its-price/1100-6525934/">best and most premium PC controller</a>. But if microswitches over membranes becomes a trend, Razer would be the pioneer of that shift.</p><p>The Wolverine V3 Pro retains Razer's "mecha-tactile" face buttons, D-pad, and bumpers--RB and LB as well as the small M1 and M2 bonus bumpers next to them. They feel great and offer a speediness you won't find in controllers with traditional buttons. I know some people who can't stand the mouse-click sound of these buttons, but if you enjoy them, it could be hard to return to membrane inputs. Razer's microswitches are still the best I've used in a controller. A long history creating some of the best gaming mice certainly gives Razer an edge with this technology.</p><p>Though I really enjoy the eight-way D-pad, which has a "loose" feel to it--Razer calls it a "floating D-pad"--it does take some time getting used to. And unlike many other pro-style controllers, you can't swap the D-pad for a different style. This is one of the areas where the Elite Series 2 still wins. The two extra analog sticks are the only swappable components, so physical customization is very limited with the Wolverine V3 Pro. It does have built-in trigger locks, though with only two pull settings, full or instant (essentially turns RT and LT into bumpers).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4358724-razercarryingcase.png" data-ref-id="1300-4358724" data-ratio="0.562" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4358724-razercarryingcase.png" data-ref-id="1300-4358724"></a><figcaption>The Wolverine V3 Pro comes with a nice hardshell carrying case.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4358724-razercarryingcase.png"></figure><p>Most of the customization is done inside the Razer Controller App for Windows and Xbox. The software suite has an easy-to-navigate interface and lets you make tweaks to a variety of settings, including stick sensitivity, haptics strength, and RGB lighting effects for the Razer logo. This is also where you remap the six extra buttons and create custom profiles that can be cycled through on the fly with the controller's multi-function settings button.</p><h3>The bottom line</h3><p>The Razer Wolverine V3 Pro is a competitive controller that's difficult to knock in any area. The Elite Series 2 has more physical customization options, Bluetooth support, better battery life, and remains unrivaled when it comes to general feel--there's just something about the weightiness of the Elite Series 2 that makes it hard to beat. That said, the V3 Pro has superior analog sticks, buttons, remappable rear triggers, and comparable software customization features.</p><p>Compared to previous Wolverine Xbox controllers, it's really no contest. The V3 Pro is vastly superior to the V2 Chroma and V2 Pro. Even if you want a wired controller, you should probably opt for the Razer Wolverine V3 Tournament Edition. We didn't test this other new model, but it has the same general design with a wired-only connection for $100. The V3 Tournament Edition is compatible with Xbox and PC, too.</p><div title="[Various] Razer Wolverine V3 Pro Controller" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2626" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Various] Razer Wolverine V3 Pro Controller" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Wolverine-Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Console/dp/B0DB6S6R89?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Razer-Wolverine-Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Console\/dp\/B0DB6S6R89?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Wolverine-Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Console/dp/B0DB6S6R89?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Razer Wolverine V3 Pro Wireless Controller</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Wolverine-Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Console/dp/B0DB6S6R89?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Razer-Wolverine-Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Console\/dp\/B0DB6S6R89?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Wolverine-Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Console/dp/B0DB6S6R89?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$200 | For Xbox and PC</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><ul><li>2.4GHz Wireless on Xbox and PC</li><li>Wired Tournament Mode with 1000Hz polling rate on PC</li><li>Four remappable back triggers</li><li>Two remappable claw bumpers</li><li>Swappable Hall Effect analog sticks (Two extra styles)</li><li>Mecha-tactile face buttons and D-pad</li><li>Hardshell carrying case</li><li>10-foot braided USB-C charging cable</li></ul></div>                      </div><hr><p><em>Disclosure: Razer provided GameSpot with a sample unit for testing.</em></p>

                <p>Metal Gear Solid 4 remains solely available on PlayStation 3, but that situation might finally be changing. Fans have long called for the game to be ported to other platforms, and those voices only became louder with the Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection being dubbed "Volume 1." Although Volume 2 has not yet been announced, Konami has teased that MGS4 could be a part of such a release.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-about-metal-gear-solid-4-in-metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-stay-tuned-konami-says" rel="nofollow ">While speaking to IGN in an interview</a>, Konami producer Noriaki Okamura was asked if Metal Gear Solid 4 would ever come to modern consoles.

Right now, we still are internally concerned about what we should be doing for the future of the series. So sorry, we can't really reveal anything at the moment.

			<p>The early access period for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is approaching. To get fans excited, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-showcased-in-codnext-showcase/">CODNEXT showcase</a> is currently taking place in Washington, D.C. In this showcase, they are giving content creators the chance to try out the multiplayer aspects of the game and showcase them live on stream, while the devs discuss some of the main features appearing in the new game. Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 plans to feature <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/blog/2024/06/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-worldwide-reveal-announcement#Carry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">carry-forward</a> content first introduced in Modern Warfare 3.</p>
<p>Black Ops 6 is said to feature carry-forward content, but it won't be used the same way it was used with Modern Warfare and Modern Warfare 2. In a blog post by Activision, it's been confirmed that any premium content from Modern Warfare 2 or Modern Warfare 3 won't be carried over to Black Ops 6 except for the Woods Operator Pack, which is available for purchase in both Modern Warfare 3 and Black Ops 6.</p>
<p>However, the main carry forward content will be for Warzone, which is a separate entity from the rest of the Call of Duty games. Previously, Warzone was a part of Modern Warfare 2 and 3 as well as Black Ops 6, but it won't require any purchases of the other premium games, and will remain completely free to play. In the blog post, Activision have promised the Call of Duty fans that all content from Modern Warfare and Modern Warfare 3 will remain available to players even after Black Ops 6 is released. Upon release, Black Ops 6 will be integrated into Season 1 and previous game content.</p>
<p>Having this content carried forward into the new season of Warzone means players can expect to be able to access all of their Operator Skins, Camos, Weapon Blueprints, and more. The weapons from Modern Warfare 2 and Modern Warfare 3 will also remain present in the new season of Warzone, as well as the new Black Ops 6 content being available.</p>
<p>One of Warzone's biggest announcements is the addition of the Area 99 Resurgence map, which was showcased today during COD Next. This map will get a full reveal compared to the small glimpse Warzone players got earlier in the week.</p>

While it's unconfirmed how many kills it takes to reach a nuke in Black Ops 6, nukes can typically be achieved after gaining 25 kills without dying. </p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Tridzo (@Tridzo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Tridzo/status/1828837628059554213?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 28, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>The imagery of the nuke is as intense as you'd expect, with even the player character catching fire and burning up, Terminator 2-style, in a brand new animation ahead of a massive fireball. You can watch the video of Black Ops 6's first nuke in the video embedded above.</p><p>Treyard Studios acknowledge the achievement on its own social media account, congratulating JustHazzardous on getting Black Ops 6's first nuke.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Treyarch Studios (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1828847893761142939?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 28, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>It's all part of Call of Duty NEXT, which has seen Activision fully take the wraps off Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's multiplayer mode ahead of the beta.

            <p>
Beloved 1997 3D platformer Croc: Legend of the Gobbos is being remastered for PC and consoles, and it's coming from a newly revived version of originaly developer Argonaut Games.
</p>
<p>
Argonaut was founded by Jez San in 1982 and would go on to release the likes of Starglider and Birds of Prey before teaming up with Nintendo to create 1993's classic on-rails space shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-fox">Star Fox</a>. A second Nintendo partnership resulted in 1994's Stunt Race FX, and the studio would go on to release games for another decade before it closed amid financial troubles in 2004 - with many of the team ending up at Batman Arkham developer Rocksteady Studios.
</p>
<p>
20 years later, Argonaut Games is being resurrected as a "boutique publisher" by new co-CEOs Gary Sheinwald and Mike Arkin. And while San doesn't appear to be involved with the revival, he does pop up in the announcement press release to say, "Argonaut was always about pushing the boundaries of what's possible in gaming, and I'm excited to see how the relaunched Argonaut Games builds on that legacy, starting with the Croc: Legend of the Gobbos remaster."

<p>
Argonaut originally released Croc: Legend of the Gobbos for PlayStation in 1997, taking players - as the titular crocodile - on a platforming adventure through the polygonal Gobbo Valley in a bid to free their friends from the evil magician Baron Dante. 
</p>
<p>
Croc's newly announced 2024 remaster promises enhanced high-definition graphics, updated modern control mechanics, and a "nostalgic, fun, and authentic gameplay experience". It'll also feature the Crocipedia, an "extensive and meticulously curated digital museum" incorporated the likes of game design documents, concept art, animation tests, and team member interviews.
</p>
<p>
Croc: Legend of the Gobbos' remaster doesn't have a release date yet, but it'll be launching for PC and "all the current consoles" later this year. After that, Argonaut says it has a "planned slate of classic Argonaut IP and exciting original titles for both current and retro-gaming platforms."

			<p>Gamescom 2024 was a crucial step for Dune Awakening. Funcom finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-to-be-released-in-early-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the early 2025 release window (for PC, with consoles to come later) and showed off the first solid chunk of gameplay in a presentation posted on YouTube.</p>
<p>The developer also allowed the press to get their hands on the game for the first time, and I couldn't pass up the opportunity, having been waiting for Dune Awakening since its announcement.</p>
<p>The first impact was harsh in the sense that Arrakis showed its teeth right away. The demo didn't have a tutorial, so we were basically dropped into the desert without much guidance. Even so, it didn't take long to figure out that the player character doesn't last long without water. Initially, you need to extract water from plants, although that only works up to a point. You also have to be mindful of not staying too long in the sun, lest you gain a rebuff called sunstroke, which accelerates the rate at which your water level depletes.</p>
<p>As with any survival game, harvesting is very important in Dune Awakening, too. To spice things up, Funcom has added a sort of mini-game to cutting metals. The cutter analyzes a structure to find its weak points, and you'll then have to aim the cutter accordingly to get the best mining efficiency.</p>
<p>It wasn't long until I stumbled into an NPC outpost. At this point, the developer who was overseeing demo stations 'cheated' to unlock certain skills on our characters, such as the Shigawire grappling hook and the suspension belt. Between this and the freeform climbing, it is possible to approach an enemy base from various angles.</p>
<p>Combat felt pretty good, although there is room for improvement in the next few months. Graphically, I was expecting a bit more from the game. While Lumen's lighting prowess was on full display, the sharpness wasn't great. However, I quickly learned from the graphics settings that the display resolution was set to 1080p, which would have explained my perception. The low resolution may have been picked for the demo due to ongoing performance optimization. The full game will <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-3-will-be-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard-avowed-and-final-fantasy-xvi-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">support</a> NVIDIA DLSS 3, by the way.</p>
<p>Overall, I enjoyed my brief time with Dune Awakening, even though many questions lingered in my mind. Thankfully, to answer some of those, I subsequently interviewed Chief Product Officer Scott Junior. You can read the full transcript below.</p>

<p><strong>Let us start with the announcement of the release window. Why did you choose to lead with PC and delay the console launch?</strong></p>
<p>So, PC development is right within our wheelhouse, given our background. We wanted to make sure that we gave the console platforms the timing it takes to do optimizations, making sure that the controller is working properly, the interface and all that. So, we're starting with Steam right there and PC, and then we will add more content and prepare for the launch of the other platforms.</p>
<p><strong>But it's not going to be an early access launch, right?</strong></p>
<p>That is not the plan.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of the other platforms like consoles, can you share whether you plan to have crossplay eventually when Dune Awakening launches on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X?</strong></p>
<p>A lot of that has to do with the actual platforms themselves and our discussions with them. We have not come through it on that yet so I can't say for sure.</p>
<p><strong>When I played the game at the Funcom booth, no controller was available. Will that be supported for the PC launch?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. If you see there on the screen right now, we have controller onscreen prompts. We just had a keyboard and mouse for the Gamescom demo to streamline the experience. However, the game is already fully playable with a controller. We designed all the UIs with the controller in mind, we designed the interactions and the player's abilities accordingly. Unlike in some games where you have an infinite amount of keys to pressure, we designed everything to fit with the controller as well.</p>
<p><strong>I believe there are three active abilities in total, correct?</strong></p>
<p>You have attack, parry, dodge, sprint, and all those things. In addition to that, you can map the three active abilities from the different archetypes in the game. You start out Dune Awakening with one archetype, and then you need to go out and meet other masters who can teach you the other archetypes. The player creates their own class by selecting abilities and techniques from those archetypes.</p>
<p><strong>So you can mix any skill from any class in any way, right?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Whether it's the Bene Gesserit, Swordmasters, Mentats, or Troopers, you can unlock those and mix them however you want to do to create your own kit, if you will.</p>
<p><strong>The Gamescom demo dropped us right in the middle of the action with no tutorial, making it confusing at first, but then it was fairly easy to pick up what you needed to do. Of course, the survival focus is strong initially, but I'm wondering how much emphasis you plan to keep on survival elements later on. Will those be important even after 30 hours of gameplay?</strong></p>
<p>For the initial survival experience, we're really focused on water. It's Dune; it's Arrakis. Water is an incredibly rare and valuable resource there and you need it when you're starting out just to survive. That survival pressure will lessen with water specifically when you start getting a stillsuit and better tools.</p>
<p>However, you will be introduced to new mechanics like adding a sandbike or an ornithopter. Those are some of the more advanced things that you can build, and they put different pressures on you. Eventually, as you are on Arrakis, you will be introduced to spice pressure, whether it's from using it to pay out the guild, using it to bolster your abilities, or simply to counteract your addiction. That pressure will continue to increase. So, when you get more tools, you can gather things quicker, but there will be new types of pressure in the late game.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We have a couple of different party-type systems. Your normal group would be a party of four, and then you can have a larger group, a party of sixteen or four groups, which would be like a raid or a strike group. I don't think we have come out and set the exact term on that yet.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>I noticed that on the map, I could see another party listed as having four players. How big is the party size in Dune Awakening?</strong></p>
<p>We have a couple of different party-type systems. Your normal group would be a party of four, and then you can have a larger group, a party of sixteen or four groups, which would be like a raid or a strike group. I don't think we have come out and set the exact term on that yet.</p>
<p>We have different content for solo players and party players. Large groups could be doing a big spice harvesting operation, using several vehicles and coordinating in planning out logistics and building bases.</p>
<p><strong>How do you plan to balance it so that very large guilds don't completely dominate the field?</strong></p>
<p>Large guilds will require large amounts of resources to do what they need to do, while solo players will require way less. While a solo player cannot do the exact activity in the same way as a larger group, they're still going to be able to interact in those activities in different ways, whether it's sneaking onto a harvester and stealing spice out of that and then running away or trying to steal ships or ornithopters from players. It will be hard, but we want to make sure that this is accessible whether you're solo or not.</p>
<p><strong>I'm thinking especially of small guilds. Lots of players tend to have a small guild with five to ten friends. Will they still be able to join these PvP fights and have a chance?</strong></p>
<p>Of course. We expect, especially late-game interactions, to often be in an unfair amount of numbers given that you're in an uncontrolled environment, right? We're not a session-based game where you're always 16 versus 16; it's a sandbox where you're going to have a group of one or a group of sixteen, so we've tried to make ways where people can deploy techniques or tools to alert them when other players are coming. There are also ways for people to get out of the fight and disengage in a fight they don't want to participate in.</p>
<p><strong>There is a penalty for dying in the Deep Desert, right?</strong></p>
<p>We're still working on the balance for that, but generally, when you die, you lose some credits and then the spice that you have on you.</p>
<p><strong>What about PvE content? I know you've talked about the underground laboratories.</strong></p>
<p>Yep, the Eco Labs. Our survival map and the Deep Desert have a couple of different types of PvE content. The first one is what you said, the Eco Labs. These are ecological testing stations where the environment is very different from the normal sand and rocks that you have on Dune, so there'll be different plants, different animals, and things like that down there.</p>
<p>And each of them tells a different story when you're going down into something that hasn't been explored in quite a long time. We also have shipwrecks, both dynamic and static shipwrecks of these large, massive crashed ships that create a dungeon-like experience.</p>
<p><strong>Usually, in most MMOs, you gather a group for a specific boss fight to get specific loot. Can players have that kind of experience in Dune Awakening?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the Eco Labs are that kind of experience. I mean, comparing it to a dungeon, an MMORPG dungeon, it's not a one-to-one like copy or instance of that, but there will be NPCs that you're encountering, encounters that you're fighting throughout it, and then there'll be a culmination, whether it's a boss fight or something that you need to do at the end of it to get some rewards.</p>
<p><strong>Does the game support different roles for players, like support builds, for instance?</strong></p>
<p>It is not concretely defined like that. However, there are abilities that are more damaging and others that are more supportive. It won't be exactly like a dedicated healer, but yeah, there are ways to prevent some damage from being dealt to your teammates.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a concept of aggro or threat in PvE?</strong></p>
<p>In some ways, yeah. Not as clear as in a traditional MMORPG where you have like taunting, but there will be ways to have NPCs attack you.</p>
<p><strong>Is there some loot exclusive to Eco Labs, or do you plan to allow all loot to be craftable?</strong></p>
<p>Each Eco Lab will have its own loot table. One of the differences is that a lot of these are going to be limited-run schematics that you use to craft unique versions of things that you have. These will be items that, again, are unique with unique effects compared to what you can craft regularly.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'When we launch, we have a story and a journey that the player goes through. It comes to a conclusion in our first post-launch update, which will have new story content and an extension to the storyline between the Atreides and the Harkonnen, the introduction of new NPCs, new contracts, and new journeys for the player.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Dune Awakening seems like a live service type of game. Moving to the future, post-launch, what kind of post-release content can players expect?</strong></p>
<p>When we launch, we have a story and a journey that the player goes through. It comes to a conclusion in our first post-launch update, which will have new story content and an extension to the storyline between the Atreides and the Harkonnen, the introduction of new NPCs, new contracts, and new journeys for the player to go through. We'll also be adding new Eco Labs, new vehicles, and new mechanics for the survival regions of the map.</p>
<p><strong>Your game director, Joel Bylos, said that the way you structured the world makes it easier to add more zones in the future.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, exactly. Once you get an ornithopter, you're able to leave the survival map, the Hagga Basin, and there you can go and explore the overland map, which is all of Arrakis. Post-launch, we will be adding new exploration spots and new maps that you can go into, which will offer new survival experiences and new story content.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think the game will favor ranged combat, or will it be fully balanced with melee?</strong></p>
<p>The goal is to support both. We use the shield mechanic that's famous in the lore, which is that slow bullets penetrate the shield. There will be times when the player needs to combine both melee and ranged with their abilities to win, so you can make a well-rounded character that covers everything.</p>
<p><strong>I know that when you create your character, you can select your background and stuff like that. How will it play into the story?</strong></p>
<p>Exactly. When you're interacting with the NPCs, they will react to you on what your background is. Whether you're coming from a noble house or whether you were a slave. It's not every single NPC, but there will be quite a few branching paths based on your background.</p>
<p>It's not going to have any impact on the gameplay, combat, or anything like that. That is mostly based on the trainer you select from the background and then those you unlock throughout the game.</p>
<p><strong>In the endgame, you have the Landsraad system, right? With your guild, you side with either the Atreides or the Harkonnen. How does it work?</strong></p>
<p>The Landsraad system, from a high level, is the endgame where guilds fight against other guilds sworn to the other faction across the entire game world. They will be fighting for the same objectives and then at the end, whichever faction wins, it's a server-wide reward for everybody that participated in.</p>
<p><strong>Okay, so the battle between Atreides and Harkonnen resets at some point.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, there's different phases that happen, whether once every week or once every month, but yeah, there would be the battle phase where you're not fighting, but you're fighting over objectives to complete those. Then, for whoever wins, there will be a council meeting, and you're selecting what the rewards will be for the victor, whether it's access to unique content or something else.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'For whoever wins between Atreides and Harkonnen, there will be a council meeting, and you're selecting what the rewards will be for the victor, whether it's access to unique content or something else. Then it resets.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>I believe you said previously that even PvE players can participate.</strong></p>
<p>Indeed, everybody will be on it.</p>
<p><strong>I know you're starting with these two factions, but do you plan to add more factions from the lore at some point?</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps. We're not ready to talk about that yet.</p>
<p><strong>Are you going to have a larger Dune Awakening Beta later this year?</strong></p>
<p>We're in a relatively small closed beta right now. We expect to expand that over the next couple of months with more people, so the beta will grow exponentially. We're continuing to invite more people who signed up for the beta from our official website.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think there will be a full open Beta before the early 2025 launch?</strong></p>
<p>We're not ready to talk about that yet.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

<p>Spiders, <a href="https://www.spiders-games.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the studio behind</a> GreedFall, has responded to the public allegations made by the Union of Video Game Workers (Syndicat des<br>Travailleurs (ses) du Jeu Vidéo (STJV)) and employees at Spiders.</p>



<p>In a statement to Insider Gaming, the studio says that the accusations made by the STJV are “false and even defamatory”. They go on to say that they don’t “reflect the reality” of working for the company.</p>



<p>“The false and even defamatory accusations made by the STJV in no way reflect the reality of the day-to-day working life of the company’s employees and are an attack on the reputation of the studio, whose teams are fully mobilized to produce quality games and enthusiastically ensure the Early Access release of GreedFall 2,” a spokesperson for the studio said.</p>



<p>The statement continues to say that there were “unsuccessful attempts” to meet with employees, but a meeting has been proposed for the end of the week.</p>



<p>“Spiders’ management is committed to open and constructive social dialogue,” the company said. “After unsuccessful attempts over the last few days to meet with a delegation of employees, they have proposed a meeting again by the end of the week. </p>



<p>“Spiders’ employees are the heart of the studio, and we are determined to maintain an inclusive and stimulating working environment in which every talent can flourish and of which we can all be proud.”</p>



<p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/spiders-developers-to-strike-over-mismanagement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 20-page letter was made public</a> by the STJV outlining multiple complaints against the studio. Some of those complaints included allegations of employee mismanagement, delays in gender equality, employment instability, and more. </p>



<p>The developers within the union have announced plans to strike on September 2-3.</p>

<p>Activision held its CODNext event on Wednesday afternoon, giving players the full reveal of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone. For Warzone, specifically, the new map Area 99 was revealed for the first time ahead of its debut later this year along with new features for the mode.</p>

<p>Area 99 features 10 main areas. The main area in the center is the Reactor area while nine others circle around it. According</p>



<p>Aside from the new map, Warzone will get a number of new features later this year. Those features start with the addition of Onmimovement with Season 1. </p>

<p>Other things to know about the mode this year are the lack of backpacks, tactical sprint being available when wielding knives, wildcards such as Gunfighter and Overkill, and the removal of the Guardian and Mosquito Drone.</p>



<p>Regarding perks, there’s a new perk system for players that features a new “Pick 3” perk with 18 perks in total. There will also be six available in ground loot with season 1. Those six perks include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Veteran </li>



<li>Dexterity </li>



<li>Tracker</li>



<li>Cold Blooded </li>



<li>Tempered</li>



<li>Alertness</li>



<li>Specialist</li>
</ul>



<p>It was also confirmed that, starting with Season 1, players will be able to use weapons from Black Ops 6, Modern Warfare 3, and Modern Warfare 2 in Warzone. </p>

                <p>The new Resurgence map coming to Call of Duty: Warzone in time for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/" data-ref-id="1100-6523361">Black Ops 6</a>--Area 99--just might be the coolest concept for a Call of Duty map in years. This is where Nuketown was born, quite literally, as the map is set on a remote testing facility that acts as a manufacturing center for Nuketowns--yes, plural--as well as some more nefarious products.</p><p>Area 99 is designed to tell the origin story of Nuketown, and in keeping with the tradition of that map, it's meant to encourage faster engagements. Alongside a manufacturing facility for the houses, there is a nuclear reactor, a mannequin-assembly center, a pod dormitory for workers, and an underground bunker. That bunker is of particular interest, as it is connected to every other POI and should lead to some unexpected ambushes. There is also a "sneaky zipline" in the Nuketown manufacturing area, though Treyarch didn't let slip where that is.</p>

<p>The retro-futuristic aesthetic of Nuketown translates to the entirety of Area 99, which also bears some resemblance to Fallout with its morbid sense of humor, and you will hear a character named Archie all over the map spouting <del>propaganda</del> advice.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-ultimate-wireless-esports-controller-the-razer-wolverine-v3-pro-revealed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, <a href="https://wccftech.com/razer-launches-blade-18-intel-core-i9-14900hx-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-thunderbolt-5/">Razer</a> unveiled its latest controller, the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro, which is slated as the "ultimate wireless Esports controller. " Made using cutting-edge technology, this controller is officially licensed by Xbox, with extensive play testing and feedback from Eric "Snip3down" Wrona, a 2-time X Games medalist and 24-time Halo champion. With Wrona's approval and feedback, the controller is set to aid those who play games competitively with advanced customization, fast, responsive inputs, and ergonomics.</p>
<p>The controller features four mouse click-back paddles, two claw grip bumpers, Razer Pro HyperTriggers, Hall Effect precision thumbsticks, and Razer HyperSpeed Wireless connectivity to give gamers a seamless, comfortable experience.</p>
<p>Team Razer is already expansive, but it now includes Eric Wrona, the first controller-using esports competitor to join the team. His feedback is vital to the creation of the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro. "The Wolverine V3 Pro's intuitive design and customizable features provide a significant competitive edge. It's the undeniable choice for anyone serious about winning," says Eric Wrona.</p>
<p>The controller utilizes Hall Effect Thumbsticks, which are similar to traditional thumbsticks but come with advanced technology such as Anti-friction rings and top-tier materials to ensure that they don't wear down quickly and have long-lasting durability.</p>
<p>In addition, the Razer Wolverine V3 Pro also comes with the Razer Controller app, which allows users to customize their experience further. By using this app, players can find the precision filters that work for them and customize their Dead Zones to fit the needs of the game they're playing.</p>
<p>The Wireless Razer Wolverine V3 Pro uses a USB Type-A Dongle which you can fit into a USB slot on your device, allowing you to play with a seamless connection using a 2.4 Ghz connection on either your Xbox or PC. If you're worried about your controller getting dirty, the accessory comes with its very own carrying case which holds the controller, two replacement thumbstick caps, the wireless dongle and a 10ft cable, making the controller as portable as needs be so you can take it to tournaments and competitions without worrying about it getting scuffed or dirty in your bag.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>If the wireless version isn't for you, Razer has also announced the wired version of the Wolverine V3 Tournament Edition, which has all of the same features as this controller but allows you to have a consistent wired connection.</p>
<p>If you're interested in this professional eSports controller, you can purchase it on the <a href="https://www.razer.com/console-controllers/razer-wolverine-v3-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Razer store</a> for $199.99. Alternatively, if you'd like the wired version, the price is $99.99.</p>

<p>Treyarch has revealed additional details about the Black Ops 6 Zombies through the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brzOBsdEAf8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CODNext</a> Showcase.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-2-black-ops-6-zombies-maps-available-at-launch">2 Black Ops 6 Zombies Maps Available at Launch</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 Zombies will launch with two maps, Liberty Falls and Terminus Island, featuring the return of round-based gameplay. In the West Virginian town of Liberty Falls, players will find a “built-out world” that highlights stories of people who once lived there. Moreover, there will be some side quests as well across both maps.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Black Ops 6 Zombies devs embraced the 90s and the nostalgia in Liberty Falls, bringing elements such as a comic shop, a video store, a bowling alley, and more to this world. Additionally, the vibes of Liberty Falls and Terminus are very different, with the former feeling deceptively safe at first and the latter being dark and gloomy throughout.&nbsp;</p>







<p>The developers unveiled some new toys players can play with in Black Ops 6 Zombies. First is&nbsp;the Thrustodyne M23, which will help you quickly mow down the undead. Another addition is the Zombies Wunderwaffe DG-2, ready to shock anyone that comes your way. Players can also supercharge their Dedicated Melee option with the new Melee Macchiato, available at Perk Machines around the map.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Players will also find unique traps on each map, so you should “Trigger the Aetherella Trap in the Liberty Falls Comic Shop or Dark Aether Field Trap to leave a special surprise for our decaying friends”.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-additional-update-and-quality-of-life-improvements-in-black-ops-6-zombies">Additional Update and Quality of Life Improvements in Black Ops 6 Zombies</h2>



<p>As mentioned earlier, improvements such as save and quit in solo matches, joining a friend’s match progress at any time, and pausing solo matches will be available for Black Ops 6 Zombies. Also, the developers revealed that Door costs can now be shared between players, armour can be purchased through Wall Buys in Terminus Island and Liberty Falls, player-specific drops will be introduced, and self-revive will be limited to 3.&nbsp;</p>

In the galactic street food minigame, players can even share a meal with Nix by following the on-screen button prompts.
