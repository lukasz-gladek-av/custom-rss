			<p>This will be a massive relief for many, as not many people will have the finances to be able to purchase a new handheld every year, especially if the upgrades aren't that significant. Luckily, most consoles nowadays don't do yearly releases, and people don't have to worry about trying to fork out for the newest console so that they fit in with everyone else. The Steam Deck is no different. In an <a href="https://www.reviews.org/au/games/valve-steam-deck-australia-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview with reviews.org,</a> Lawrence Yang and Yazan Aldehayyat, two Steam Deck Designers, confirmed that they won't be releasing the console or console updates on a yearly cadence. While most of the world has had access to the Steam Deck and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-software-impact/">other handheld competitors</a> for quite a while, Australia is now just about getting its hands on the device, with pre-orders opening up in November of this year. For many, this is likely a surprise as the world has had the Steam Deck since 2022, with the OLED being released worldwide as of November 2023. However, Australia is just now getting both the LCD and OLED versions of the device.</p>
<p>We all know that there will be a second Steam Deck in the future, which will add new features and build on the hardware of the Steam Deck to make it more accessible, as well as allowing a more extensive game library to be played. As it is, people have found ways to mod their Steam Deck, and have even found ways to play games like World of Warcraft on their Steam Deck, so it begs the question of what opportunities a new device would hold.</p>
<p>When it comes to the release date of the Steam Deck 2, it seems that the release date is still quite a way off. When speaking about other competitors doing yearly refreshes to the hardware, Valve instantly expressed that they won't be taking that approach for the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>"It is important to us, and we've tried to be really clear, we are not doing the yearly cadence. We're not going to do a bump every year. There's no reason to do that. From our perspective, that's kind of not really fair to your customers to come out with something so soon that's only incrementally better," says Yang. With this statement, they clarified that they are waiting for there to be a "generational leap in compute" before they start working on the next prototype, and want to make sure that there is no sacrifice in battery life before they start shipping the next console.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-vault-13-mod-development-suspended</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-vault-13-mod-development-suspended-due-to-a-combination-of-factors.1015185/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-vault-13-mod-development-suspended<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The creators of ambitious&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4&nbsp;</em>mod&nbsp;<em>Fallout: Vault 13&nbsp;</em>have announced that they're indefinitely suspending development on the project owing to "a combination of factors".</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/FalloutVault13/status/1848149475132375468" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, the mod's developers say that the decision to suspend development was "not an easy decision", but that it was "the right step at this stage of our journey".</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, the developers say they'll "release a full build of&nbsp;<em>Fallout: Vault 13</em>" that shows off the work they've done on the project so far, as well as unfinished content, so that anyone else "interested in continuing or building upon it in the future" can have access to it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallout-vault-13-mod-khans-house.jpg?itok=BZinYN1j 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallout-vault-13-mod-khans-house.jpg?itok=l_Bh1uqz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fallout: Vault 13&nbsp;</em>is no more, unfortunately.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Fallout: Vault 13</em>'s creators also say they're going to release a "retrospective" at some point in the future that will take a look at "the highs, the lessons learned, and the passion that drove this project".</p>
<p>As for the reason for the mod's cancellation, the devs explain their motivation (or lack thereof) in <a href="https://x.com/FalloutVault13/status/1848149475132375468" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a followup message</a>, attributing the suspension of development to a number of factors including burnout, recruitment issues, and "personal life changes among core team members".</p>
<p>Unlike other <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yoko-taro-fan-archive-cease-and-desist-square-enix">prominent</a> fan <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/team-fortress-source-2-fan-project-ceases-development-after-dmca-from-valve">endeavors</a>, the mod's developers say there was no cease and desist from the IP owner (in this case Bethesda), nor was there any "infighting" between project developers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, the mods rather even-handedly say that the mod was "an ambitious project being made with limited resources by volunteers", and that in order to preserve "the well-being of project members", the suspension decision was made.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Fallout: Vault 13</em>, it was an ambitious attempt to recreate the entirety of&nbsp;the original&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>in the engine of&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4</em>, complete with the more recent game's emphasis on real-time gameplay rather than turn-based combat.</p>
<p>It's one of a number of ambitious&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>fan projects; others include&nbsp;<em>Fallout: London</em>, another&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4&nbsp;</em>mod that lets players <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-london-out-now">explore post-apocalyptic London</a>, and a major&nbsp;<em>Fallout: New Vegas&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-new-vegas-gun-animation-mod">gun mod pack</a> that aims to overhaul the game's animations.</p>

<div>



<div>
<div><p>As The Twenty-Sided Tavern continues to make a big name for itself off-broadway at Stage 42 in New York City. After having confirmed guests such as <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="69be1d21-ed08-4802-903c-bde55c08c3c8" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/felicia-day-is-new-guest-at-twenty-sided-tavern-key-to-improv-and-dungeons">Aabria Iyengar, Erika Ishii, and Felicia Day</a> today another special guest was announced.&nbsp;Travis McElroy, of 'The Adventure Zone' and 'My Brother, My Brother and Me', will be appearing at the Twenty-Sided Tavern for seven "special Thanksgiving performances."</p>
<p>The Twenty-Sided Tavern is a Dungeons &amp; Dragons stage production that sees <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="05539938-70ba-4cd6-98cf-b51345d15acc" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/twenty-sided-tavern-is-bringing-interactivity-to-dd-stage-theater">Dungeon Master,&nbsp;David Andrew Greener Law (DAGL), and Tavern Keeper, Sarah Davis Reynolds,</a> work with experienced improvisational actors and plenty of crowd input to make their way through a one-shot every night. The crowd gets to decide what types of characters make up the party, what path the party should take, and are even able to assist them with completing skill contests through the use of mobile app integration. Even from your seat your voice can make a difference.</p>
<p>On the announcement of Travis McElroy joining for a week David Carpenter, Executive Producer and Creator, had the following to say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are so excited that we are getting the opportunity to play with the amazing Travis McElroy. His incredible storytelling and larger-than-life personality bring a whole new energy to our show.&nbsp;We can't wait to see how his The Adventure Zone spirit and passion for D&amp;D blend into the world we’ve built on stage. It’s going to be something truly special.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Travis McElroy's <a href="https://thetwentysidedtavern.com/">run will be from November 27th until December 1st</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24273397/amd-ryzen-x3d-processor-zen-5-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>AMD is officially announcing its first next-generation X3D desktop processors today, based on its latest Zen 5 architecture. I’d love to tell you which Ryzen 9000-series X3D chips are arriving next month, but AMD is strangely only teasing a release date of November 7th and providing no pricing or further details.</p><p>AMD has only provided a single slide about this X3D announcement, ahead of Intel’s Core Ultra 200-series launch on October 24th. Rumors <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-rumored-to-debut-on-october-25th-a-day-after-intel-core-ultra-200k-launch">had suggested</a> AMD would announce its highly anticipated Zen 5 X3D chips a day after Intel’s performance embargo for the Ultra 9 285K, but AMD has decided to tease the existence of next-gen X3D processors a little earlier than expected.</p><p>Thanks to other leaks, we’re expecting to hear more about the 9800X3D soon, which will likely be the first next-gen X3D processor to launch on November 7th, with eight cores. <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-teased-with-5-2-ghz-all-core-clock">Rumors suggest</a> it will include a 4.7GHz base clock, with a boost clock of 5.2GHz or higher. </p><p>Some recently leaked <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/11/24268219/amd-ryzen-9000-x3d-leak">MSI slides also suggest</a> the 9000X3D series will be much better at productivity and creator workloads than the 7000X3D series. If MSI’s slides are accurate, it should mean the 9000X3D chips will provide similar performance in benchmarks like Cinebench R23 to the non-X3D Ryzen 9000-series chips.</p><p>These upcoming X3D chips might not give much of a boost in gaming over the 7000-series X3D parts, though. They should still easily beat <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24265928/intel-core-ultra-200s-series-specs-release-date-pricing">Intel’s Core Ultra 200S chips</a> in gaming, particularly because Intel has already admitted that its latest desktop CPUs will be around 5 percent behind AMD’s existing 7800X3D chip.</p><p>Alongside this X3D announcement, AMD is also launching an early holiday promotion for its latest Ryzen 9000-series processors. The Ryzen 9 9950X is now discounted by up to $50, while the Ryzen 9 9900X, Ryzen 7 9700X, and Ryzen 5 9600X will all see up to $30 off.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Back in the protean stink of 2013, the beast we call <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/factorio">Factorio</a> sprouted in lowercase early access form and began its meticulous, ravenous conquest of the emerging factory sim genre. Some say that Factorio gave that genre life, though I'd point at Dwarf Fortress as one among many notable forebears. Today, the terrain of factory simming is hotly contested by rival piles of conveyor belt spaghetti. I'm not just talking about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/satisfactory">Satisfactory</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shapez-2">Shapez</a> - they're even making <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sixty-four-is-a-very-elegant-abstract-factory-sim-with-sinister-depths">philosophical factory sims</a> these days. They have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/premature-evaluation-good-company"><em>cosy</em> factory sims</a> now.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the immense, smoke-rimmed cyborg eye of Factorio has turned from the exhausted soil to the relatively untapped heavens. Somewhere up there, there is unspoilt territory. Somewhere, there is land that has never known the roar of a smelter - and in Factorio's behemothic Space Age DLC, out today, you will find it.</p><!--more-->

<p>Factorio Space Age - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/645390/Factorio_Space_Age/">Steam page here</a> - is being described as an effective sequel, which seems pretty fair given that it adds five new world types with their own mass of variables to the game. The first of these world types are space platforms, "flying factories that act as the means of transportation between planets", which need to be equipped with turrets and thrusters. Sounds hazardous, but perhaps not as much as Vulcanus, a world blanketed in ash where you'll craft unbreakable tungsten and dip your pipes in magma. Or Fulgora, a world of ancient technology where you'll have to worry about nightly lightning storms (which can be harnessed to power your buildings).</p><p>On Gleba, meanwhile, there's the opportunity to do a little biomechanical engineering by harvesting weird flora. Be sure to "cook, crush, and process your produce before they rot and turn to spoilage". On Aquilo, finally, freezing conditions oblige you to build a monstrous central heating system to keep machines functioning. Those who do so successfully will "unlock the power of cryogenic technologies and fusion power". As with base Factorio, each planet has its particular menagerie of indigenous species who won't take kindly to your attempts to strip the habitat bare.</p>
<p>All this in addition to: over an hour of new orchestral music from Czech composer Petr Wajsar! Elevated railways, which let you lay tracks across oceans and set up finicky multi-level intersections! An appropriately hefty price tag! I don't know exactly what the plan is for a Factorio Space Age review, but Ollie has been conspicuously absent this afternoon. Behind his door, I hear the screech and thunder of pistons. Through his keyhole spills a mad, dancing light, like the passage of comets. Either he's working on a review for us or he's having trouble with his crimping iron again.</p>
<p>If you don't have the pocket money for Space Age right now, the good news is that it's landing alongside a major overhaul for the base game, which adds a new fluid system and improvements for train controls and worker robot AI, amongst much else.

But in the top right corner of my inventory, I see Vivian’s pink lungs, too, which blink with either green, yellow, or red light depending on her health state. Vivian has asthma, so unless I pick up one of the many inhalers hidden throughout the game, I need to be careful with her heart.<br></p><p>First, I just need to get through the night.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s the exact same story—with the same puzzles and resolution—that <em>Fear the Spotlight</em> had in 2023, when Cozy Game Pals initially released it. People who have already completed the game a year ago may not want to play through its (perfectly paced) two-hour-long campaign again, though <em>Fear the Spotlight</em>’s Blumhouse edition also offers console ports, additional language translations, and new story content players can access after finishing the base game once.<br></p><p>Anyway, <em>Fear the Spotlight</em>’s horror is the kind that slowly pools — like blood around a scraped knee — so there’s still value in revisiting the game and allowing its more distressing aspects to gradually tear you open. Like its low-poly graphics, which give the game the same muddy quality as a lost teddy bear, left out in the rain. Admittedly, these PS1 graphics make Amy and Vivian look like extras from <em>The Lego Movie</em>, but they also enhance <em>Fear the Spotlight</em>’s surreal environmental details, which include flayed love birds and burnt roses.<br></p><p>Though it’s more romantic than the games that inspire it, <em>Fear the Spotlight</em> clearly pays homage to 90s and 2000s horror, and I especially see elements of <em>Silent Hill</em> and the high school survival horror game <em>ObsCure</em> in it. Like the former, <em>Fear the Spotlight</em> is stocked with cryptic poems and puzzles — including one that requires you tap bloody piano keys in the right order, like you had to do <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://silenthill.fandom.com/wiki/Piano_Puzzle&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://silenthill.fandom.com/wiki/Piano_Puzzle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in Konami’s 1999 game</a></span>. Like the latter, <em>Fear the Spotlight</em> turns its scholastic setting into the hell some kids and <em>Carrie</em> think it is. Shortly after Amy disappears, the library Vivian was sitting in turns as black and crumbly as an Oreo when fire breaks out and pushes her through a crack in the wall. There was a fatal fire at the school decades ago, too, though the one I experience as Vivian seems more supernatural. Before it started, I noticed dark figures with white eyes staring at me from between the bookshelves.<br></p><p>Once I emerge from the wall and see that the school is now dirty, empty, and outfitted with pay phones, I’m more sure of it: I’ve been transported into the past, and pieces of spiral notebook paper with scribbled notes from students offer insight into why I’m here. It seems like the historic fire wasn’t an accident, and Amy, with her psychic connection to the spirit world, could be a victim of it, too.</p><p>In reaching her, I’m forced to avoid an eerie recurring enemy: a man, seemingly, with a bloodied shirt and a spotlight for a head. As he wanders down hallways and around rooms hissing that he knows I’m in there, the orange beam of his skull searches for me and burns my whole body if it finds me. “<em>Fear the Spotlight</em>,” you know.</p><figure id="" data-id="d21455513c80a70211d039739087bb4b" data-recommend-id="image://d21455513c80a70211d039739087bb4b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A humanoid figure with a spotlight for a head glares.

Text reads, Spotlight: You are not taking her away from me!" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Inhalers, like I mentioned, cure Vivian of damage, but since she’s unequipped for combat — she was prepared for confessing her feelings, not taking on the Underworld like Orpheus — I deal with the spotlight enemy by running and hiding under things like desks. I get in a comfortable habit with this, though avoiding the spotlight is sometimes impossible and often makes me yelp with frustration. If only a millimeter of unlucky Vivian’s body sticks out from between lockers or debris, the spotlight zaps her entire body in a way that feels unintentional, not scary. To make <em>Fear the Spotlight</em>’s occasionally unfair enemy encounters even more tiresome, the game’s final battle totally does away with the sneaky self-preservation I’m forced to use throughout the game. It instead requires I assume an offensive position in an awkwardly telegraphed fight, and I couldn’t wait for it to be over so that I could go back to appreciating <em>Fear the Spotlight</em>’s much more compelling interpersonal drama.<br></p><p>After the credits roll, though, I enjoy <em>Fear the Spotlight</em>’s bonus content, which allows me to play the same story from Amy’s perspective. Since Amy spends nearly all of <em>Fear the Spotlight</em>’s base game in psychic purgatory, her perspective is interesting and conceptual.</p><p>After she vanishes from the ouija board table, she feels as if she is locked away in a dilapidated version of her childhood home, which is shuttered and guarded by puzzles — I must find the painting of Jesus to place on the candlelit table, use the hammer I found to rip plywood off of a door frame, etc.<br></p><p>Through it all, I receive eerie voice recordings of Vivian on my phone, which suggest someone has been listening to us get closer to one another for a long time. Sometimes, I get to peek through my locked front door’s peephole and see what Vivian’s enduring to find me, which only makes me more eager to get out. It doesn’t help that I’m being stalked by my childhood fear — a giant, soaking wet demoness from a movie I saw. When my stealthing inevitably fails and she tries ripping my guts out with her hand, I have to sniff the incense sticks I pick up around the house to ease my mind and restore my health.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="76fdbcff07645c9cecd71dc795c4ff20" data-recommend-id="image://76fdbcff07645c9cecd71dc795c4ff20" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A small candlelit altar holds a cross, a stylized representation of a religious figure, and a book." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A small candlelit altar holds a cross, a stylized representation of a religious figure, and a book." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blumhouse Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="76fdbcff07645c9cecd71dc795c4ff20" data-recommend-id="image://76fdbcff07645c9cecd71dc795c4ff20" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A small candlelit altar holds a cross, a stylized representation of a religious figure, and a book." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But, for Amy, it’s worth getting impaled by mythical creatures to reunite with Vivian, much like Vivian is willing to get zapped by a hundred demonic spotlights in order to find Amy. This devotion, even more than <em>Fear the Spotlight</em>’s fantastic, hallucinatory setting, is what kept me with my face stuck to my Switch screen.<br></p><p>That’s unusual for me. I mostly play horror games for the scares, to distract myself from what I believe is the horror of my life — <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ocd-horror-video-games-mental-health-outlast-bloodborne-1849711413&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ocd-horror-video-games-mental-health-outlast-bloodborne-1849711413">my anxiety disorder</a></span> and a new round of insomnia, which can keep me up for days. On the most terrible occasions, I get too exhausted to do anything other than cry with the lights out. But <em>Fear the Spotlight</em> offers me solace over escapism. It tells me that love is everywhere, especially in the dark. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Crimson Desert won’t be a PlayStation 5 (PS5) exclusive, but its not because of Sony’s lack of trying. According to new information from an <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/pearl-abyss-at-kiwoom-securities-corporate-day-event-we-were-offered-an-exclusive-contract-for-crimson-desert-by-sony-but-refused-and-more.1014846/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">investor meeting</a> in September, it was revealed that Sony tried to convince developer Pearl Abyss to bring the action-adventure game exclusively to the PS5.</p>



<p>With the agreement, like most, Sony would’ve required Crimson Desert not be released on Xbox for a “certain period of time”. However, Pearl Abyss said that they decided to move forward with self-publishing the game because “it was judged that self-publishing would be highly profitable”.</p>







<p>In addition to trying to bring the game to PS5 exclusively, Sony reportedly had high praise for Crimson Desert as a whole. In terms of its story and atmosphere, it was compared it to the successful Ghost of Tsushima.</p>



<p>Despite no final systems being confirmed, this news almost guarantees that the game will be available on PS5, Xbox, and PC at launch. There’s also no set release date just yet, but the game is expected to release in Q2 2025. More information should be announced over the next few months.</p>



<p>What do you think of Pearl Abyss declining Sony’s offer to make Crimson Desert a PS5 exclusive? Let us know down below, or in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1054/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

<p>It has just been announced that Rebel Wolves, the new studio made up of CDPR veterans, has partnered with Bandai Namco to publish Dawnwalkers, the team’s first AAA RPG. It’s a ‘brand-new IP aimed at mature audiences and is powered by Unreal Engine 5.’ Not much is known about Dawnwalker, other than the fact that it’s a sandbox-based title set in a dark fantasy universe.</p>



<p>This will be Rebel Wolves’ first outing, and it’s now being backed by the publishing power of Bandai Namco, a titan of the industry that’s no stranger to RPG titles like this. Historically, Bandai Namco worked with CDPR to distribute The Witcher series of games in some markets.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-new-universe">A New Universe</h2>



<p>Per a recent press release, it was reiterated that Dawnwalker is an action-RPG game that’ll have players explore ‘medieval Europe’, with a few twists. In the first and only piece of concept art shared to showcase the game, we see what could be explained as a typical medical landscape, but there are a few core differences.</p>



<p>For instance, a bannerman dressed in medieval garb is some kind of grotesque creature, and he’s preparing to face off against what must be a vampire of some kind. It’s a lithe, muscular character sliding down a cliff face while being swarmed by bats, and he’s slowing his descent by digging strong claws into the cliff. </p>



<p>It sounds compelling enough, I just can’t wait to see more.</p>



<p>In a statement, Rebel Wolves’ CPO, Tomasz Tinc, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Rebel Wolves is a new studio built upon solid foundations: a combination of experience and fresh energy. Bandai Namco Entertainment Europe, a company known for its dedication to the role-playing genre and willingness to engage with new IPs, is a perfect match for our Wolfpack. Not only does it share our values, but also its track record in publishing narrative-driven RPGs speaks for itself.</em> <em>We’re looking forward to working with them to bring the first chapter of the Dawnwalker saga to gamers worldwide.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>‘The first chapter of the Dawnwalker saga’ is another nod to this being the first in a series of games. I’m hoping it ends up being as engaging as The Witcher, pulling across the team’s experience from working on <em>those </em>games.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - PC Features Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>While the overall Black Ops 6 narrative has one ending, some of the game's missions will allow players to pick and choose how they want to complete objectives. Lead narrative producer Natalie Pohorski said, "Some of the missions have those options of like, 'Okay, these are the objectives,' and then you can kind of get the lay of the land and choose which one you want to tackle first."</p><p>Pohorski added: "If you want to go in hot or stealthy, there's options for that too. So it kind of depends on the mission, but I think that's where some of the replayability comes in with the political gala. This time you want to blackmail the senator, or this time you want to hack into a silent auction."</p><p>In terms of the campaign length for Black Ops 6, Activision previously said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-campaign-length-revealed-as-dev-discusses-impact-of-launching-on-game-pass/1100-6524149/" data-ref-id="1100-6524149">should be as long as you'd expect from a Call of Duty campaign.</a> IGN reported that that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-ops-6-is-set-to-be-the-most-varied-call-of-duty-campaign-ever" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6's campaign is longer than Black Ops Cold War's</a>, but as usual, your mileage may vary since everyone plays games differently.</p><p>Black Ops 6 launches on October 25, and it'll be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-works-on-game-pass/1100-6524136/" data-ref-id="1100-6524136">available on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass right out of the gate</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-anniversary-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy has announced the&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>Anniversary Update, which is being released tomorrow to commemorate the game's upcoming first anniversary. The update will bring a number of new quality-of-life improvements and accessibility options to the survival horror game.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.alanwake.com/story/the-anniversary-update-explained/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>website, the Anniversary Update will be completely free for all players and is intended to address some of the most "frequently requested" changes on behalf of the game's community.</p>
<p>Each of the improvements is relatively small by itself, but they should all add up to a smoother and more satisfying gameplay experience in&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2</em>, while the accessibility features should help you out if you're having a rough time with the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/alan-wake-2-anniversary-update-saga.jpg?itok=0DPd-kz3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/alan-wake-2-anniversary-update-saga.jpg?itok=P2ErPtjS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>is getting an anniversary update tomorrow.</figcaption></figure><p>Changes include the ability to invert the X axis on both mouse and controller, as well as new gyro aiming support and extra haptic feedback for healing items and throwables for the DualSense on PS5.</p>
<p>A new Gameplay Assist menu is also being introduced as part of&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2</em>'s Anniversary Update, and it will, per Remedy, introduce the following features to the game.</p>
<ul><li>Quick turn</li>
<li>Auto complete QTE</li>
<li>Button tapping to single tap</li>
<li>Weapon charging with taps</li>
<li>Healing items with taps</li>
<li>Lightshifter with taps</li>
<li>Player invulnerability</li>
<li>Player immortality</li>
<li>One shot kill</li>
<li>Infinite ammo</li>
<li>Infinite flashlight batteries</li>
</ul><p>Of course, you'll be able to turn any of these on and off as you see fit, so if you want to mix and match your accessibility features, you can do so.</p>

<p>The announcement of this update comes just a few days after the reveal of&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2</em>'s second DLC pack&nbsp;<em>The Lake House</em>&nbsp;during last week's Xbox Partner Preview show, which is also when Remedy <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-control-spinoff-announced">unveiled its multiplayer&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>spinoff&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em></a>.</p>
<p>If you happen to be in the Finnish cities of Helsinki or Vantaa tomorrow and you fancy picking up a phsyical copy of the&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>Deluxe Edition, you might want to get to Konsolinet or VPD Pelikauppa quickly, because if you're one of the first 50 buyers, you'll get a free&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/1848333518671126698" rel="noopener" target="_blank">bucket</a>.</p>
<p><em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/alan-wake-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/alan-wake-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/alan-wake-2/9pnzh065x7pv" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

These things always are.</p><p>Still, Nintendo making an MMO some 15 years after anyone cared about them is at least interesting in and of itself. And we’re not talking about fighting orcs and buying mounts here, but rather something that looks like a fever dream Peter Molyneux might have after playing too much <em>Minecraft</em>.</p><p>“In this game,” the text beneath a section titled “The Game’s Purpose” reads, “the goal is to work with others to fully ‘develop’ a massive, expansive planet by utilizing creativity and farmed resources.” The accompanying picture (which we won’t be posting) showed a large sphere covered in an expansive grid, some of its  squares filled in with various amounts of blue. The description continues, “As you progress across the planet, you’ll discover new lands, enemies, and resources that will be come essential to your journey.”</p><p>A second screenshot showed what looked like tiny <em>Minecraft </em>worlds in bell-jars, with the words,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Throughout your adventure, players will be granted special tools known as Beacons. These Beacons emit a healing light that purifies and develops the land. The higher your Beacon is placed, the wider its Beacon Zone becomes. Within your Beacon Zone, your best work can be done.</p><p>Players will repeat the process until their current Planetary Block is considered fully developed.</p></blockquote><p>The final leaked piece of information is entitled “The Dev Core,” and shows a large room made of blocks, in which <em>Fall Guys-</em>esque characters run around, one carrying a block above his head. It says that this is “a separate space from the planet you’ll be developing. Think of it as a social hub to gather with other players.” It’ll also be the location where you can level up your character, get items, “commune with others, and more.”</p><p>Beyond what we’ve seen ourselves, <em>The Verge</em> adds that there’s a description of “UGC (User Generated Content) features,” but fascinatingly people will only be able to share these with others after passing some sort of in-game test “to show that you understand the importance of respectful communication.” Oh, poor, sweet Nintendo.</p><p>This all seems to add up to some sort of vast, collaborative version of something like <em>Minecraft</em>, with presumably each sphere its own 10,000-person server, but any more details beyond that would be wild speculation.</p><p>It’s interesting that “communing with others” seems to be a key part of this game, since that’s certainly something Nintendo games tend to go out of their way to prevent in order to maintain kid-safe environments. It’ll be interesting to see if this is restricted to emojis and the like, or if Nintendo’s about to discover just how much you never want open chat in <em>anything</em>.</p><p>Another thing that seems worth noting is that the character art in the Dev Core image looks <em>awful</em>. If it’s not placeholder, then...erk.</p><p>This is, of course, only the first leak of what will likely be many. Apparently the software isn’t even available to play until Wednesday, at which point Nintendo will have to pull out all the stops, copyright striking the squillions of screenshots and videos that will emerge. Although, given that taking part means you’ve given Nintendo your Switch Online details, it’s likely there will be harsh repercussions for anyone who isn’t careful. This is Nintendo we’re talking about, after all.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-says-it-wants-to-catch-and-remove-call-of-duty-cheaters-within-1-hour-of-them-being-in-their-first-match<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Ahead of the launch of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a>, Activision has said it’s using AI in its ongoing battle against Call of Duty cheaters, and hopes to kick cheaters out of the game within one hour of them being in their first match.</p><p>Call of Duty has had a cheating problem for years, with free-to-download battle royale Warzone on PC suffering in particular. Activision has spent millions of dollars developing its anti-cheat technology as well as pursuing cheat makers in the courts, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-cheat-maker-ordered-to-pay-activision-over-14-million-in-damages-and-hand-over-domain-name">a number of recent high-profile successes stemming the tide</a>.</p><p>But video game publishers face an uphill battle in the war against the increasingly sophisticated cheat makers, so Activision has announced plans to draft in AI to help.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“Fighting cheats today – on the client where illicit programs are activated – is a little like battling on a bad guy’s home turf: it is their machine and their code,” <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/10/call-of-duty-ricochet-anti-cheat-progress-report-black-ops-6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Activision said in a blog post</a>.</p><p>“Kernel-level drivers on PC have enhanced anti-cheat’s reach, but cheaters are already offering cheats that go beyond the kernel, even going as far to utilize special PC hardware that is designed entirely for attacking games and enabling cheating.</p><p>“What our team has been working on for the future is a suite of tools that use AI to find and fight cheaters.”</p><p>So, what does this mean in practice? Activision said that “cheaters can run and hide but a trail exists,” but what if that trail disappears? That’s where AI-powered behavioral models come into play.</p><p>“Cheat developers can’t hide player behavior. How people play – the legit, the phony, the good, and the bad – gives us information and we use that to build ways to pick those bad folks out of a lineup,” Activision explained.</p><p>“We already have data from cheaters but to help build out profiles for those God-tier players we examine the data from the Call of Duty League – where every match is recorded, and every stat is preserved. </p><p>“There’s more in progress around what we’re doing with AI beyond behavioral models and as work continues, we’ll share what we can.”</p><p>As we near Black Ops 6’s release on October 25, Activision has made an ambitious commitment to players: it's targeting booting cheaters out of Call of Duty within one hour.</p><p>“A lot has been put into Black Ops 6 to upgrade security, but here is the goal we’re targeting: we want to catch and remove cheaters within one hour of them being in their first match,” Activision said.</p><p>Activision calls this metric ‘Time to Action,’ which it saw (eventually) make a positive impact during Black Ops 6’s beta weekends. It saw that cheaters were able to complete just five matches before being booted out of the game, with 25% of all Weekend Two bans happening during the first match a cheater ever played.</p><p>Meanwhile, 12,000 confirmed cheating accounts were stopped before they “ever saw the inside of a match” in the beta, Activision said.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Cheat developers are flawed (clearly – they have to pretend to be good at video games).</p></div><p>With this in mind, Black Ops 6 launches with an updated version of the kernel-level driver (this also applies to Warzone), with new machine-learning behavioral systems focused on speed of detection and the analysis of gameplay to combat aim bots in place. Upgrades are set to launch alongside Ranked Play.</p><p>"The people behind cheats are organized, illegal groups that pick apart every piece of data within our games to look for some way to make cheating possible," Activision said. "These bad guys are not just some script kiddies poking around with code they found online. They are a collective who profit from exploiting the hard work of game developers across the industry.</p><p>But cheat developers are flawed (clearly – they have to pretend to be good at video games). Every time they cheat, they leave breadcrumbs behind.</p><p>“We’re always looking for those breadcrumbs to find the bad actors and get them out of the game."</p><p>For more, we've got confirmation of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launch-multiplayer-maps-modes-and-operators-confirmed"><u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's launch Multiplayer maps, modes, and Operators</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-preload-and-global-launch-times-pc-system-requirements-and-102-gb-storage-requirement"><u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's preload and global launch times</u></a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

"It was like, 'let's end the chapter of the adventure games.' Layers of Fear, Observer, and The Medium, [games that were] strange, experimental, with fixed camera tools. 'Okay, let's finish with that.'</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>"We also want to evolve, so let's go into survival horror, let's create something of our own, something different than other games in the genre in terms of world, story, and also gameplay. Let's create another game of our dreams."</p><p>The Silent Hill 2 remake was somewhat of a coming out party for Bloober Team to show it could make a big budget survival horror adventure. It arrived October 8 to glowing critical reception <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-sells-1-million-copies-in-less-than-a-week">and strong sales</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-dev-bloober-team-open-to-making-more-silent-hill-games">Bloober Team is open to making more Silent Hill games too</a>, either remakes or something completely fresh.</p><p>But the "game of our dreams" mentioned by Zieba is Cronos, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloober-teams-silent-hill-2-remake-cronos-the-new-dawn">a sci-fi survival horror set in an unforgiving post-apocalyptic future in 1980s Poland</a>. This will be the true test for Bloober Team as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-dev-bloober-team-giving-up-psychological-horror-for-mass-market">it looks to solidify itself as a developer capable of mainstream releases</a> without having the framework of Silent Hill 2, one of the most beloved horror games of all time, to build upon.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-2024-review">In our 8/10 review of the Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, IGN said: "Silent Hill 2 is a great way to visit – or revisit – one of the most dread-inducing destinations in the history of survival horror."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

But fans had hoped that story DLC would give them more of a reason to return to Insomniac's wonderful recreation of New York that the addition of new features. Now, those hopes have been dashed.</p><p>But fans hadn’t just hoped for Spider-Man 2 story DLC, they expected it after the game itself left a number of threads that Insomniac might have pulled on for additional content, including the introduction of Carnage.</p><p>Beyond that, though, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/insomniac-hackers-release-stolen-data-leak-wolverine-videos-future-projects-and-more">the devastating Insomniac data breach of December 2023</a>, which revealed the studio’s upcoming slate of releases, and the accidental release of Spider-Man 2’s development game menu earlier this year, all pointed to planned DLC. Indeed, the development game menu included <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-2-update-appears-to-have-accidentally-revealed-an-upcoming-dlc">what looked like the entire arc of a DLC called the ‘Beetle Villain Arc.’</a></p><p>Throughout the turbulence caused by the Insomniac data breach, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-significant-playstation-layoffs-affecting-900-staff-london-studio-to-close">Sony made a significant round of layoffs affecting around 900 staff</a>, or about 8% of its global PlayStation workforce. Insomniac was one of a number of PlayStation studios hit by the cuts. Alongside the layoffs, a number of in-development games were canceled, Sony said at the time.</p><p>Now, a year after Spider-Man 2’s release and over 11 million sales, fans are waving goodbye to the game, issuing their verdict now they know there’s no more story content to come. IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-review">Spider-Man 2 review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: “Marvel's Spider-Man 2 delivers Insomniac's best tale yet, and despite its open world falling short, is a reliably fun superhero power trip.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The forced hate for this game is coming back now that the DLC got "canceled" even tho they have never officially announced it</p><p>No matter what anyone says Spider Man 2 will always be a Outstanding game. <a href="https://t.co/l2Z058LakA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/l2Z058LakA</a></p></div>— James ⚡️ (@YoshinoLover08) <a href="https://twitter.com/YoshinoLover08/status/1847693374880453048?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 19, 2024</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Today, one year ago, we join Peter and Miles on their journey to be greater together.

While Insomniac has a <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvels-wolverine"><u>Wolverine game</u></a> in the works, fans are hoping the developer will also release a Marvel’s Spider-Man spinoff similar in scope to the hugely successful <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/spider-man-miles-morales"><u>Miles Morales standalone</u></a>, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-todd-tells-fans-insomniac-used-only-10-of-his-venom-dialogue-in-marvels-spider-man-2"><u>Venom the potential focus</u></a>.

Perhaps PC modders will get Venom fully playable, as PS5 players found a way to do last year <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/insomniacs-latest-spider-man-2-patch-removes-popular-venom-free-roam-glitch">before Insomniac patched the exploit out</a>.</p><p>Let us know in the comments what you thought of Spider-Man 2, now we know there’s no more story DLC, and tell us what you hope to see from the potential Venom standalone game and Spider-Man 3 next.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/21/silent-hill-2-update-1-04-patch-notes-nurses-skirts/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Bloober Team has released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> patch 1.04, an update that aims to sort out some pesky crash bugs, round off some DLSS issues, prevent James from getting stuck quite so much and, weirdly enough, make nurses’ skirts more deformable…</p>
<p>It’s a fairly healthy patch in terms of fixing problems with Bloober Team’s horror classic remake. On PS5 they have targeted a number of rare crashes in the game, while the PC specific improvements are mainly about optimising around DLSS upscaling, adding the latest version of FSR, improving Steam Deck performance, and the like.</p>
<p>The universal improvements for both platforms stamp out a bunch of glitches through the game. Things like james being teleported through a door’s peephole, getting stuck on window frames, falling through the map in Brookhaven Hospital, and that sort of thing. There’s also the amusing “Improved the deformation of Nurses’ skirts,” which I think will be the subject of some YouTube deep dive sooner or later.</p>


<p>Silent Hill 2 Patch 1.04 is out now. To check that you’ve updated, the version number in the bottom right of corner of the main menu will read&nbsp;v.1.1.242,185.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/21/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review.1015080/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/21/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The quality of Sonic games has varied wildly since the 2D glory days, ranging from the depths of Sonic ’06 all the way up to the delights of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/11/07/sonic-generations-review/">Sonic Generations</a> – a game which came out thirteen years ago now. Updating and reimagining classic Sonic levels in both 2D side-scrolling style and 3D, Generations was a bit of a surprise after Unleashed, which featured a werewolf for some reason. Sonic X Shadow Generations is both a remaster of Sonic Generations and a whole new game alongside with Shadow Generations. This does the same thing, but for Shadow the Hedgehog and his whole broody oeuvre.</p>
<p><iframe title="SONIC X SHADOW GENERATIONS - Doom Powers Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7N-64Uzx2ac?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Sonic Generations has Sonic characters from different times teaming up together. Specifically, you play as the old school, voiceless Sonic in the 2D side-scrolling levels and switch to the newer, unfortunately less silent surfer dude-voiced Sonic for the 3D levels. The remaster here is good, I haven’t seen any frame rate drops – not even on Chemical Plant – and it looks about as good as you’d expect from a remastered Sonic game from the PS3 and Xbox 360 era. It’s much better than previously, but not as good as you’d expect a new game to look. Standard. Outside of that, the game is just Sonic Generations – it’s great, and worth it even if it’s just to play Spinball again, which is just great.</p>



<p>With the remaster out of the way, we can move onto the whole new game that comes with it: Shadow Generations, which is actually <em>better</em> that Sonic Generations in my opinion. It looks better because it’s a new creation, of course, but most importantly there is an extra layer of polish here that helps iron out a few minor wrinkles in Sonic’s gameplay.</p>

<p>Specifically the level design is improved and has a better flow through each stage. They each have multiple paths for you to discover for yourself – usually by falling out of the one that you’re on – and that fluid design goes hand-in-hand with the ridiculous high speeds.</p>
<p>This is all helped by Shadow’s unique abilities, such as a ranged attack called the Doom Spear and the Chaos Control ability to slow down time, giving you more possibilities so it isn’t all just dashing into things and running. This includes jumping off moving objects that are in slo-mo, which is always outrageously cool even when you’re an overly broody hedgehog.</p>
<p>On top of that there’s also Shadow’s chaos abilities, which allow him to change his body and style of movement by, for example, creating a manta ray to surf across water.</p>

<p>You might expect Shadow to stick with 3D gameplay – he’s a child of Sonic Adventure 2, after all – but he really isn’t picky and is able to dip into 2D as well. He handles both the classic and modern gameplay styles in this game, and I honestly am having a hard time picking a favourite.</p>
<p>Traditionally, 2D was always the best because Sonic in 3D is exceptionally hard to get right and, when it isn’t right, it’s particularly frustrating. Even in the remaster, I prefer the 2D levels to the 3D ones, but in Shadow I think the 3D ones are my favourite. They’re just a delight from beginning to end, with a surprising amount of missable areas for a game about going fast.</p>
<p>And then there’s the bosses, which are absurd and over the top in all the right ways. The first one is The Biolizard, which is obviously a gigantic lizard that has some kind of bubble-based armour to protect its arms that you keep hitting – it’s mental and a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Perhaps the only problem is that the game is still quite short, even with a second game built into it. They also rely on having you unlock keys to fight bosses by completing challenge levels on levels you’ve already done. Some of these are fun but I can also see them being frustrating, especially if the main reason you like Sonic is going fast.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/factorio-player-count-space-age-20-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Factorio</em>'s long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Space Age&nbsp;</em>DLC launches today, as does its 2.0 update, and the two releases together appear to have resulted in a massive player count spike for the factory-building sim.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Space Age&nbsp;</em>DLC was first announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/factorio-expansion-pack-announced-coming-in-2022">all the way back in 2021</a>, although it didn't have a name at that point. Details were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-details-about-factorio-expansion-revealed-by-wube-software">drip-fed</a> by developer Wube Software throughout the next couple of years, until&nbsp;<em>Space Age&nbsp;</em>was officially <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/factorio-expansion-space-age">unveiled in August last year</a>.</p>
<p>The DLC's release date, along with the date for&nbsp;<em>Factorio</em>'s 2.0 update, was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/factorio-space-age-expansion-release-date">revealed in summer</a>, and now that it's upon us, it looks like&nbsp;<em>Factorio&nbsp;</em>is about to go...well, into the stratosphere.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/factorio-space-age-dlc-mechanism.jpg?itok=G_M5ye2B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/factorio-space-age-dlc-mechanism.jpg?itok=Lh1T7kVx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Factorio</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Space Age&nbsp;</em>DLC, along with its 2.0 update, has resulted in a player count surge.</figcaption></figure><p>At time of writing,&nbsp;<em>Factorio</em>&nbsp;is <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/427520/charts/#3y" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sitting at a princely 55,694 players on Steam</a>, which also happens to be the game's all-time player count peak, handily beating its previous best of 34,700 (which it achieved around the time of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/factorio-10-release-date-announced-for-2020">its 1.0 release</a>).</p>
<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Space Age&nbsp;</em>and the 2.0 update were only released today, that number may well increase in the coming hours and days; it had already jumped by a few thousand to its current total when I refreshed the page just a few minutes after initially opening it.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Space Age</em>, it's the first major&nbsp;<em>Factorio&nbsp;</em>expansion to be released since the game's 1.0 launch back in 2020. "Major" really is the word, too; it introduces a ton of new features, options, and mechanics to&nbsp;<em>Factorio</em>, expanding its already-dizzying depth even further.</p>

<p>Even if you're not planning to pick up&nbsp;<em>Space Age</em>, though, today is a great day to be a&nbsp;<em>Factorio&nbsp;</em>fan, since it also heralds the release of the 2.0 update, a <a href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-418#2-0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">massive patch</a> that brings a ton of changes and improvements for free.</p>
<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Factorio&nbsp;</em>right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, and its&nbsp;<em>Space Age&nbsp;</em>DLC is also available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/645390/Factorio_Space_Age/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via that platform</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> was our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rps-game-of-the-year-2022">best game of 2022</a> and one of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">best roguelikes</a>, period. And over the years it's received a slew of updates that make it a bit bigger and a bit better, but nothing that's been <em>mega</em> substantial. That is, until today's announcement that it's getting an Ode To Castlevania expansion, classed by developers Poncle as the game's biggest DLC yet. More characters, more weapons, a weapon selector, an enormous stage. I simply can't wait to devour more packets of crisps as I play this.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First on the agenda: more characters. 20+ to be precise, all of them from Castlevania's universe. Having never played Castlevania (sorry) they mean nothing to me, but they may mean something to you. We've got the Belmonts with their whips, the Belnades being all witchy, and "Other Heroes", like Jonathan, Charlotte, Shanoa, and Eric Lecarde who I'm sure are all very pleasant individuals.</p>

<p>Over 40 weapons are being added, too. Eight whips, more elemental magic, more magic weapons like Alucard's sword and spear, "projectiles" like javelins, and lots of Glyphs. Again, I have no reference point here, but I am sure they are all very nice. I like that there's no need to get the references. I'm just happy I'll get to carve up some more demons with a bunch of new stuff. Ignorance is bliss.</p><p>There's a new weapon selector, meaning that you'll eventually be able to decide what weapon you'd like characters to start with. On their Steam page, they say "the Morning Star will let you choose any whip as a starting weapon for your friendly neighbourhood-Belmont". </p>
<p>The final highlight? "The largest map Vampire Survivors has ever seen", which looks like a real hodgepodge of, presumably, Castlevania's most iconic locations.</p>
<p>The Ode To Castlevania DLC is out on the 31st October and will cost $3.99/€3.99/£2.99, which is an absolute steal. Here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3210350/Vampire_Survivors_Ode_to_Castlevania/">Steam page</a>. </p>
<p>And in other Vampire Survivors news, there's also going to be some quality of life changes. These will be announced over on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@poncle_Games">Poncle YouTube broadcast</a>, although timing hasn't been confirmed yet. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But as a person who grew up seeing the black-and-red hedgehog as the emotional center of the franchise, it feels more like an apology. Sega has not been kind to Shadow over the years. Where once he was a complex, playable mainstay in the series, the Ultimate Lifeform has become a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flanderization&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flanderization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flanderized</a></span> background character defined almost entirely by not liking other people and wanting to beat the blue blur in any competition that will have him. <em>Shadow Generations</em>, a hefty pack-in alongside a full remaster of 2011’s <em>Sonic Generations</em>, delivers a wonderful course-correction for Sega’s mistreatment of Shadow over the years, reminding fans that he was once the deepest well of emotional storytelling the series has to draw from. The best part is that it’s also a thrill to play, feeling better than maybe any <em>Sonic </em>game has in, well, generations. That’s right, Sega is releasing one of the best <em>Sonic </em>games it’s ever made as a pack-in for a remaster.</p><figure id="" data-id="dc707f5cbed9abc1ee5891e173e1023c" data-recommend-id="image://dc707f5cbed9abc1ee5891e173e1023c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shadow skates toward Black Doom's eye." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shadow skates toward Black Doom's eye." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dc707f5cbed9abc1ee5891e173e1023c" data-recommend-id="image://dc707f5cbed9abc1ee5891e173e1023c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shadow skates toward Black Doom's eye." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Shadow Generations</em> takes place alongside the original <em>Generations</em> and shows what Shadow was up to while Sonic was living his past lives. <em>Sonic Generations</em>, originally released in 2011,<em> </em>had the speedster running around remade versions of old levels that were re-tuned for both the 2D sidescrolling approach of the older games and the 3D platforming action of the modern era. <em>Shadow Generations </em>takes the same idea but applies it to Shadow, and given that he’s got a much more tragic past than Sonic, revisiting previous levels and games means retreading some old wounds once thought healed, while cleverly working his journey into <em>Sonic Generations</em>’ 13-year-old story. However, Shadow has been sidelined for so long that there aren’t as many levels to draw from. So <em>Shadow Generations</em> breaks the old rules in which characters revisit their own past, instead pulling some levels from future games like <em>Sonic Forces </em>and <em>Sonic Frontiers </em>(which Shadow was notably absent from), but even if it has to contort around its premise, it pays off because <em>Shadow Generations </em>is probably the tightest, most rewarding <em>Sonic </em>game in recent memory.</p><p>As I skated through Shadow’s past, I was constantly surprised at how Sega modernized decades-old levels into something new and thrilling, blending the fast-paced running and jumping fans that have come to expect with plenty of action-oriented setpieces that kept levels I had run through hundreds of times while growing up fresh. Despite his speed, Shadow controls with a precision that makes every level feel like a tight roller coaster ride, with different pathways to explore, collectibles to find, and stunts to pull as you barrel toward a goal ring or fight an old nemesis.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="fc49ff6f6b09308af17226d74719ff44" data-recommend-id="image://fc49ff6f6b09308af17226d74719ff44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shadow surfs next to Metal Overlord." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shadow surfs next to Metal Overlord." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fc49ff6f6b09308af17226d74719ff44" data-recommend-id="image://fc49ff6f6b09308af17226d74719ff44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shadow surfs next to Metal Overlord." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>With a relatively short campaign of six stages with two levels each, <em>Shadow Generations </em>is able to meaningfully riff on old ideas and bring in new ones, all without overstaying its welcome. Shadow’s past comes back to haunt him in the form of lost friends and enemies, including his alien creator Black Doom from Shadow’s self-titled game. Interacting with the extraterrestrial race known as the Black Arms once again gives Shadow a chance to explore his own inner alien, gaining new abilities that fundamentally change how he moves through what could otherwise be a mundane <em>Sonic </em>level. </p><p>Shadow can now transform into a squid-like creature that can move along corrupted terrain like a <em>Splatoon</em> character, or summon an alien that can surf atop water. Shadow even grows giant, sludge-like wings that can let you fly over gaps, or even whole chunks of difficult levels. The last of those is so transformative that <em>Shadow Generations </em>gives you two high score counters depending on whether you use them or not. Sometimes these abilities can be finicky, the aforementioned squid transformation especially, but they’re meaningfully woven into old levels to shake them up, while also giving you tools to run around the game’s White Space hub world. <em>Sonic Generations </em>uses this void-like world in the form of a mostly uninvolving sidescroller between different levels. Conversely, <em>Shadow Generations </em>has a reasonably sized open-zone area that you can freely move around hunting for collectibles, meeting up with old friends, and reaching new levels.</p><p>If the stages themselves weren’t enough to make me appreciate how good <em>Shadow Generations </em>felt to play, the White Space’s open world solidified for me that Sega cooked with traversal this time around. The zone is covered in rings to collect, bumpers to send you flying across the world, and collectible art, background music, and lore drops all tied to Shadow’s history. In other words, <em>Shadow Generations </em>is practically a museum for its antihero. Though I spent only around four hours playing through its story, I spent over 20 hours running around the White Space and playing through remixed challenge levels to fill out the archive of Shadow’s life. I would not have done that if <em>Shadow Generations </em>hadn’t nailed its movement, offered interesting challenges, and made the most of its open world. As I searched for the final chests filled with concept art and songs (some of which I’ve listened to on repeat for the past 20 years), I lost sense of how much time I’d spent inspecting every nook and cranny because it was enjoyable just to run around, grind on rails, andr fly over the world trying to complete my collection.<br></p><p>If there’s a downside to just how good it feels to play <em>Shadow Generations</em>,<em> </em>it’s that the direct comparison with <em>Sonic Generations </em>is deeply, deeply unflattering for the earlier game. A lot has happened since the original was released, and more recent entries like <em>Forces </em>and <em>Frontiers</em> have fine-tuned Sonic’s speed and control to reach what <em>Shadow Generations </em>pulls off. As a result, <em>Sonic Generations </em>doesn’t hold up as well and feels frozen in time. Sonic moves a little awkwardly, the steering feels less exact, and some of the remixed levels don’t feel as intentional. It’s still a fun tribute to the blue guy’s past, but it feels like a new <em>Generations </em>game with all the modern trappings of Shadow’s would do him good.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="abc85b8597f4d4502268489d74ceedde" data-recommend-id="image://abc85b8597f4d4502268489d74ceedde" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rouge and Shadow talk on the Space Colony Ark." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rouge and Shadow talk on the Space Colony Ark." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="abc85b8597f4d4502268489d74ceedde" data-recommend-id="image://abc85b8597f4d4502268489d74ceedde" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rouge and Shadow talk on the Space Colony Ark." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As nice as it is to look back at old concept art, listen to Shadow’s edgy, dramatic butt rock themes from the early 2000s games, and experience levels I played on repeat as a kid, <em>Shadow Generations </em>feels bittersweet. When you look at the release dates of most of the games it draws from, you realize how many years we lost with Shadow as a centerpiece for the franchise in pursuit of something more streamlined and focused almost solely on Sonic. Sega has made a lot of mistakes with the franchise, like sanding away its AMV-bait edges in favor of a more brand-safe image, and Shadow was one of the biggest casualties of that pivot. Sega even made attempts to erase that past by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-06-sega-xbox-360-digital-cult-classic-wo-1848971197&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-hedgehog-06-sega-xbox-360-digital-cult-classic-wo-1848971197">delisting games from that era</a></span> when they were critically panned. </p><p>My hope is that Sega going back and reflecting on what Shadow has lost in the past 20 years will make the company think about what it can reclaim. What better time to realize this than during the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/shadow-the-hedgehog-fearless-sonic-movie-3-generations-1851398367&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/shadow-the-hedgehog-fearless-sonic-movie-3-generations-1851398367">Year of Shadow</a></span>, just as a new generation of <em>Sonic </em>fans is about to learn all about him when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/shadow-hedgehog-sonic-3-explained-adventure-2-gun-movie-1851639981&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/shadow-hedgehog-sonic-3-explained-adventure-2-gun-movie-1851639981"><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em></a></span><em> </em>premieres in December?

<p>The Thunderpick World Championship is live now in the Counter-Strike 2 world, and it’s an event that marks the return of Oleksandr ‘s1mple’ Kostyliev. After a lengthy hiatus, the Ukrainian legend has returned to the esports scene, but his very first match back was marred by a loss against 3DMAX. </p>



<p>As the Group Stage of the Thunderpick World Championship went live, 3DMAX handed Team Falcons an 0 – 2 loss, but there’s plenty of road left ahead, and s1mple remains resilient.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-unfazed">Unfazed</h2>



<p>Following the 0 – 2 loss against 3DMAX, s1mple took to social media to express his thoughts, but by all accounts, he was relatively unbothered by the initial shortfall:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Bad start, but don’t forget that we trained for about 10 days. A lot of mistakes in the majority, but nothing new, the process of preparation and correct of mistakes takes time, we play the second official in a couple of hours, thanks to everyone for the support.</p>



<p><em><a href="https://x.com/Ozzny_CS2/status/1848337693576401212/photo/2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Translation by Ozzny_CS2 on X</a></em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>This was s1mple’s first pro match in more than ten months, so it’s understandable that he’ll have a brief adjustment period before he’s back in the saddle. Fans of the 27-year-old competitor remain hopeful, though. It’s not like he’s playing badly – he secured an ADR of 125 and picked up a KD of 27 – 16 in that opening series.</p>



<p>The Thunderpick World Championship went live today and will run until November 3. There’s an $850,000 prize pool on the line, and 16 of the best CS2 teams on Earth are vying for the lion’s share of the prize – a whopping $500,000.</p>



<p>Last year’s tournament was claimed by FaZe Clan, with Virtus.pro coming in second place. It was around the time that FaZe Clan went on a dominating streak – in the space of just three weeks, the squad won IEM Sydney, Thunderpick, and the CS Asia Championships. </p>

                <p>A "large percentage" of Call of Duty players have never seen the original version of one of the franchise's most famous maps, Nuketown, according to level designer Adam Hoggatt. That's part of the reason why Hoggatt is excited to bring it back for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/" data-ref-id="1100-6523361">Black Ops 6</a> this November.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUeKKzUYp2U&amp;embeds_widget_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Fphoenix-cms%2Farticles%2Fform&amp;embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com%2F&amp;embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.embedly.com&amp;source_ve_path=MjM4NTE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN</a>, Hoggatt revealed that Black Ops 6's version of Nuketown will be "the original Nuketown" but with better visuals. The Black Ops 6 series has featured all manner of different iterations of Black Ops 6 over the years--including a futuristic take from Black Ops III--but Black Ops 6 will go back to the map's roots.</p><p>"I think the original has a kind of special place in my heart. Recently it started occurring to me that probably a large percentage of our players had never actually experienced the original one," he said. "So I am really excited that with Black Ops 6 can now get to basically revisit the original Nuketown and exactly the magic that was the original one but looking better than it has ever looked."</p><p>Hoggatt also talked about how Nuketown was not a "production map" for the 2010 original Black Ops. Instead, it was an experiment of sorts within the studio about what a small-sized map might look like set in a nuclear test town. The team loved it and it's become one of Call of Duty's most enduringly popular maps across all of the sub-brands.</p><p>Nuketown is not one of the 16 launch maps for Black Ops 6, but will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6s-nuketown-release-date-revealed-plus-liberty-falls-map-changes/1100-6527099/" data-ref-id="1100-6527099">come to the game as free DLC on November 1.</a> Some had theorized that Black Ops 6's version of Nuketown could take place in the '90s like the game's campaign, but that won't be the case. This is the original, 1950s-style Nuketown. And if the layout is similar, players can expect fast and chaotic action.</p><p>Black Ops 6 also has a Strike map called Warhead that takes place in the Nuketown neighborhood, but a key difference is that it's set in the aftermath of a bomb test. As such, the buildings have been reclaimed by the sands of the desert, with debris scattered throughout.</p><p>The Nuketown connections extend to Warzone, as well, as the battle royale game's new map is called Area 99--that's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-cod-warzone-map-area-99-is-where-nuketown-was-born/1100-6526171/" data-ref-id="1100-6526171">where Nuketown was born.</a></p><p>Black Ops 6 launches on October 25, and it'll be available on Game Pass at launch (at least for the most expensive subscription package). </p>

I love the world of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn/" data-ref-id="5000-438540">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west/" data-ref-id="5000-513799">Horizon Forbidden West</a>, but the opening hour of Lego Horizon often feels like its setting and characters are clashing with the comedic creativity and gameplay loop that so many Lego games excel at. The opening hour of Lego Horizon feels like a pretty decent start to what's hopefully a good game--at the very least, it's shaping up to be my favorite Lego game in terms of visuals--but there are moments where I could see the kid-friendly vibe of the Lego games conflicting with the more adult-oriented storylines of Horizon.</p><p dir="ltr">Lego Horizon is a loose retelling of Aloy's first adventure, in which the bow-wielding protagonist utilizes an assortment of hunting tools and high-tech gadgetry to fight mechanical dinosaurs, mammals, and birds in a world that feels both like a forgotten past and unforeseen future of our own. Aloy, mysteriously birthed from a mountain and subsequently made an outcast, desires to prove herself capable of joining the tribe that cast her out and returning to the mountain to uncover the truth about her origins.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> I'm Not Convinced Horizon Makes Sense As A Lego Game | Hands-On Preview</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">"From the beginning when we started the conversations with [Guerrilla Games], they were very clear," Studio Gobo animation director Luismi Herrera told me. "They wanted to bring the Horizon series to a broader audience, and they thought that the best way was to retell the story of the original game, the Horizon Zero Dawn game. But obviously we started to go as a fairy tale, a light-hearted version of it, because obviously there are a bit more mature things for that game. It was like, 'Okay, how can we retell this story, keeping all the core values and everything, with this Lego universe?' And that's been the goal. That being said, the core story is the same, it's [just a retelling] in a light-hearted way."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/horizon-zero-dawn-review/1900-6416620/">Horizon Zero Dawn is a good story</a>, but not one that seems to translate well to the structure of a Lego game. Each Lego game is built on a backbone composed of beloved characters, well-remembered locations, and memorable scenes that fans of the original IPs have talked, argued, and joked about for years. Horizon Zero Dawn doesn't have that. As much as I enjoyed the game, I can't really remember any of the characters beyond Aloy, can't point to any specific locations in the game as being especially memorable, and despite how cool some of the late-game reveals are, there aren't too many moments in the story that stand out with the same cultural milestones seen in Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, or Marvel and DC Comics.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387202-ss_5c3a955c7028893c34cc67d97a5e53869403bcf1.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387202" data-ratio="0.56275579809004" data-width="1466" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387202-ss_5c3a955c7028893c34cc67d97a5e53869403bcf1.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387202"></a><figcaption>You can customize the village that acts as a hub area.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387202-ss_5c3a955c7028893c34cc67d97a5e53869403bcf1.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As a result, Lego Horizon's jokes don't pack the same level of cheekiness I've come to love in other Lego games, nor did the first hour of the story include any moments that had some of the incredible self-referential humor that the Lego games have excelled at since 2005's Lego Star Wars: The Video Game. And again, I only played about an hour of Lego Horizon, which covered the opening moments of Horizon Zero Dawn, arguably the weakest part of that game. Much in the same way Horizon Zero Dawn gets a lot better after its opening, it's quite possible that Lego Horizon does as well--many of the past Lego games get better after their opening levels once more of their mechanics become available to you. There were moments in that first hour that made me chuckle, and although I want to fully laugh out loud when playing a Lego game, the brief chuckles could be a good indication that Lego Horizon will surprise me in the same way past Lego games have. Still, I'm a tad worried for the ending of Lego Horizon, as it will be building on the emotional gut-punches that occur in the final hours of Horizon Zero Dawn. Horizon Zero Dawn is a lot of things, but funny it is not.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's been very challenging [to include those emotional moments] for sure," Herrera said. "But I would say, without giving any spoilers, there are some cinema narrative points that you can 'break' a bit, right? I think it's in a very light-hearted way--I think the core values [are still there] but it's about this journey for Aloy and to discover what she is and I think that's really relatable. It doesn't matter if you're six years old or 60 years old. So the whole story is there, but when things get very serious, we try to make it fun. It's not heavy, but we are trying not to lose any of the core message."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387203-ss_8fea9d1a851cfcf98de22825aeb149e8acf89279.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387203" data-ratio="0.56220258327668" data-width="1471" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387203-ss_8fea9d1a851cfcf98de22825aeb149e8acf89279.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387203"></a><figcaption>Different characters fight in different ways.

Up to this point, the Lego games have primarily only made their characters Lego. Aspects of the environment (like bushes or doors) or weapon effects have sometimes also been made of Lego bricks, but the floor your character walks on and the walls of buildings typically aren't--they're the worlds of the IP filled with Lego creations. Not so for Lego Horizon. The entire in-game world is composed of Lego pieces, making Lego Horizon look like a Lego set brought to life. It's incredible and visually stunning, setting a new standard that I hope all future Lego games follow.</p><p dir="ltr">That [idea] actually came from when we met with Guerrilla," Herrera said. "They had an idea of what they wanted to do--they had already had conversations with Lego and they had a pretty strong idea of what they wanted. And obviously you know Guerrilla; they aim for excellence in everything they do. So they--all of us, really--wanted to make the best Lego game ever. One of the ideas was to try to make the player feel that they were playing with a real Lego set."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387204-ss_e32d040f31e5768a904c68d1bd1ef33bcd7d07ba.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387204" data-ratio="0.56245779878461" data-width="1481" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387204-ss_e32d040f31e5768a904c68d1bd1ef33bcd7d07ba.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387204"></a><figcaption>Everything in Lego Horizon Adventures is made of Lego.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387204-ss_e32d040f31e5768a904c68d1bd1ef33bcd7d07ba.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Herrera continued: "And to do that, we had to build the whole world out of Legos. And in fact, we have a team of Master Builders--they're not working on the video games, they're experts on Lego to help us to build every single thing in the game to the degree that anything that you see in the game can be built with real-life Lego. [They had a lot of] overview on things, like 'Okay, now that's an illegal brick, so [we] can't use that anymore.' We were just replacing things. We really spent lots and lots of time investment on making it as real as possible. Even the amount of colors [is realistic], as the palettes have to be the same colors that you can [find with real] Lego [bricks] and can build physically. So everything is being built from the beginning with that in mind, to try to make you feel like you're playing a real Lego set."</p><p dir="ltr">If we ignore comparisons to other Lego games, Lego Horizon feels like a decent-enough experience. The game attempts to combine the stealth mechanics of Horizon Zero Dawn with the arcade-y action of the Lego games for middling results. Aloy and her allies can hide in tall grass to sneak about a space and aim shots at specific weak points on the mechanical monstrosities that populate each stage, carving off parts of each enemy until it ultimately has no leg to stand on (sometimes literally) and collapses into lifeless Lego pieces. It's fine. There's no real strategy to it even on the hardest of the game's five difficulty settings (at least of what I played) and so each fight seems to play out exactly the same again and again. Clearly, Lego Horizon is aimed at a younger audience than me (just like previous Lego games), so I'm probably not going to get the depth of strategy and difficulty found in Horizon Zero Dawn. That does beg the question, of course, as to who Lego Horizon is for. It seems too easy and simple for adults hoping to relive Horizon Zero Dawn, unless you're a parent desperate to share that experience with your child.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387205-ss_03a9e4d717a44496dae6e753e9f92de6a384b550.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387205" data-ratio="0.5626269465132" data-width="1477" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387205-ss_03a9e4d717a44496dae6e753e9f92de6a384b550.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387205"></a><figcaption>Like past Lego games, you can go it alone or fight in two-player co-op.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387205-ss_03a9e4d717a44496dae6e753e9f92de6a384b550.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"There is a desire to broaden the Horizon franchise to a broader audience," Guerrilla Games design director Stephane Varrault told me. "[Lego Horizon Adventures] is a perfect opportunity to make [Horizon Zero Dawn] available to all people, but that doesn't mean that it's only available to kids. We have done several things. There's this layer to the narrative so that things are focused for a younger audience, but the humor can be more mature humor."</p><p dir="ltr">There's a longer conversation to be had about this that is beyond the scope of this preview, but Lego Horizon is an odd combination of ideas. The Horizon franchise feels too adult for Lego Horizon to be a gateway for children into the franchise (I just can't see an eight-year-old immediately jumping from Lego Horizon to Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West) but at the same time, the established format of gameplay found in many past Lego games doesn't feel like something that fans of the Horizon franchise are looking for. It's completely plausible that this all comes together in a great way in the full game, but based on what I played through in the first hour, I just don't see it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387206-ss_f4f81149920cb05574696e02b362cd9eeabdf69a.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387206" data-ratio="0.56236786469345" data-width="1419" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387206-ss_f4f81149920cb05574696e02b362cd9eeabdf69a.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387206"></a><figcaption>Lego Horizon Adventures only has a few playable characters, but each has a ton of costumes.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387206-ss_f4f81149920cb05574696e02b362cd9eeabdf69a.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Regardless, I hope that later levels of Lego Horizon feature a wider variety of enemies to spice up combat, and that the structure of the game evolves beyond what I played in the first hour, in which I kept returning to a village that acted as a hub area where I didn't have much to do between missions. And those missions saw me venturing out in levels that aesthetically looked very similar and featured pretty much the same handful of enemies and puzzles but in a slightly different order each time. It's tough to judge a game's variety based on its opening hour, but if Lego Horizon doesn't change beyond what I played, I could see it growing stale quite quickly.</p><p dir="ltr">"There is a lot to discover," Varrault clarified. "An essential part of the game is to rebuild the village, narratively, but also in terms of features that you will discover and you can go through really great lengths to customizing every decoration, every building, you can even change the color palette of each item. You can build individual [buildings], you can change the outfits of every NPC. You can also change the outfits of your main characters and those outfits, they stay during the cutscenes. You can have those funny moments where you have those outfits totally contrasting with the events. So there are a lot of tiny surprises in a lot of the buildings and much you can build. They also have specific animations. Again, we won't spoil [anything] because the fun is in experimenting. I don't want to spoil too much because I think [surprise] is also part of the joy of discovery, but the village and the rebuilding of the village will have opportunities for growth."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387207-ss_850cfddd63e0f76f0a5be65e66394ace4e5ccc0b.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387207" data-ratio="0.56254225828262" data-width="1479" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387207-ss_850cfddd63e0f76f0a5be65e66394ace4e5ccc0b.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387207"></a><figcaption>You can shoot off parts of the machine enemies to make them easier to fight.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387207-ss_850cfddd63e0f76f0a5be65e66394ace4e5ccc0b.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Varrault continued: "And in terms of activities, a lot of the focus was also [on how] you're going to go through different biomes. And the idea is that each biome, they have their own set of machines. So again, new things for you to discover. So I think our expectations are that, yes, players experiment, players try to discover as much as they can, because we really put a lot of attention to all the tiny details and the surprises."</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike other Lego games that feature dozens (and sometimes hundreds) of playable characters from their respective brands, Lego Horizon only has a handful of playable options. Each character features tons of costumes that you can dress them up in, but, again, you can see how Horizon isn't a typical IP for a Lego game--the original Horizon games don't have a huge roster of memorable characters. To account for that, Lego Horizon gives each playable character a different attack and unique skill tree that can be unlocked. Aloy specializes in a bow that can hit targets from afar, for example, while Varl uses a spear that he can use to dash forward for a more close-range fighting style. I didn't really see how these two different characters could evolve over the course of the game or if there were meaningful differences between the two, but it's possible a bit more strategy could pop up there.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387208-ss_685c00546e52a98f8f210c72683ecb690c221529.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387208" data-ratio="0.56275303643725" data-width="1482" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387208-ss_685c00546e52a98f8f210c72683ecb690c221529.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4387208"></a><figcaption>Lego Horizon Adventures is a really pretty game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4387208-ss_685c00546e52a98f8f210c72683ecb690c221529.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"The intention, right from the beginning, was [thinking], 'If we consider those characters in the Horizon universe, they are, of course, different narratively speaking so they also represent different ways to experience the world as [the player] progresses through it,'" Varrault said. "So we spent a lot of time interacting on this--each character has a different weapon and they also have a dedicated set of power-ups that can make their weapon more powerful or have a different effect. They all have their own progression track as well. Aloy, she can get, let's say, additional life or boosters on the damage, for instance, or she's able to prepare her shots faster. And the same goes for the other characters too. So the idea was if you stick with one character, there's room for you to progress and room for you to expand. Of course, you are welcome to try different characters, but it's also okay if you find a play style that suits you and you just want to develop that. The game is supporting both approaches. So it was really a clear intention right from the beginning that we offer this palette of possibilities."</p><p dir="ltr">Based on my conversation with Herrera and Varrault, there seems to be a lot to Lego Horizon Adventures that I just didn't get to see because it exists beyond the opening hour. I'm hopeful my first impression of the game isn't one that continues when I get to play the full experience. As someone who has loved the Lego games since the mid-2000s and has a soft spot for Aloy and the Horizon series, a game like Lego Horizon Adventures should be a slam dunk for me. I'm still worried that the nature of Horizon Zero Dawn doesn't lend itself well to translating to the formula used in Lego games, but I'm hopeful Guerrilla Games and Studio Gobo manage to find a way to make it all come together after the bumpy opening hour. A more kid-friendly property like Insomniac's Spider-Man and Ratchet and Clank, or Team Asobi's Astro Bot would have likely made for a better Lego game, but if Lego Horizon Adventures works out, this could be a method PlayStation uses to help its more adult-oriented franchise be more approachable for younger audiences.</p><p dir="ltr">Lego Horizon Adventures is scheduled to launch for PS5, PC, and Switch on November 14.</p>
