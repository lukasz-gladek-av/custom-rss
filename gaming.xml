            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/27/dustborn-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Dustborn is a unique little game. It’s a narrative heavy road trip with audio-based superpowers, combat with a throwable baseball bat that can be recalled Mjollnir-style, and some light ghostbusting. It’s an eclectic mix of ideas that might seem difficult to balance.</p>
<p><iframe title="DUSTBORN | LAUNCH TRAILER" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TiBhYBG6bEE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The highlight here is definitely the story and the characters. Set in the pseudo-dystopian hellscape known as America – an alternate history one, I mean, that’s now called the American Republic. You play as a woman called Pax who is tasked with delivering a package to Nova Scotia and has a small team to help her out. Pax and two of this team are Anomals – individuals with superpowers stemming from a mysterious cataclysmic event – and are planning to use this trip to Nova Scotia to escape their lives to a country more accepting of them. So in order to smuggle themselves and the mysterious package across the country, they start a band and go on tour. It’s the perfect cover…. band.</p>


<p>The characters and their dialogue is phenomenal throughout, and there’s absolutely tonnes of it. Most of the time, the game plays like a Telltale adventure or, more fittingly as it’s published by Quantic Dream, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/24/detroit-become-human-review/">Detroit: Become Human</a>, just without the silly quicktime events for opening doors and stuff. You’ll be having a lot of conversations, walking around an location for some light puzzling or adventuring, sending one of your crew in to pick a lock or just knock a door down, and so on. I absolutely love this part of the game, I found myself quickly becoming attached to the characters thanks in no small part by the excellent voice acting, which is handy when you can’t skip a single line of dialogue.</p>


<p>What’s also superb is the attention to detail, sometimes to a fault. Dustborn keeps tracks of an awful lot of things you say or do and often brings it up later. At one point, Sai was having a bit of an episode in a bathroom and I was trying to convince her to come out so we could continue. Having exhausted all of my non-magic options, I tried to give her some beef jerky I’d picked up earlier – something that would definitely have worked in a LucasArts point &amp; click – and boy, was she offended.&nbsp;Later I offered it to her again when she was a little more calm, and she actually commented “is this what you tried to give to me earlier? I’m not a dog, Pax!” which really made me laugh.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of little elements like this that make everyone feel more convincing as characters. One quirk that doesn’t, though, is when you can check in with everyone at the end of the day, butting into the conversations they were having between themselves. Those chats then pause and resume after you’re done with an “as I was saying” type line. After a while, I found it ruined my immersion to hear that after a serious conversation.</p>
<p>Dustborn isn’t exactly subtle with its themes or intentions. From “Anomals” sounding almost exactly like “a-normals” to the “ghosts” which are actually echoes of misinformation that turn people into hateful and paranoid people, it’s all very much on the nose and outside of the accurate statement “misinformation makes people bad,” it doesn’t really say any more than that. Even the people that’s aimed at would agree, but just argue they’re not the ones who are misinformed. Some of these ideas don’t play out to satisfying conclusions, the game establishing a few interesting topics and then leaving them behind as you move onto the next one. It would have been great to tie them back together more cohesively.</p>

<p>While the characters and story are the main focus of the game, there’s a few other genres thrown in alongside. The occasional combat sequences play like a ropey arena brawler. It’s a bit too imprecise and chaotic feeling, but it’s also too easy and gets repetitive despite having some fun abilities, like Pax’s voice turning enemies on each other or convincing them they’re on fire. You can skip some of these encounters… but a one-off instance where I was able to sneak past a gang of bikers broke down when one of the other crew members failed to follow me to the bus, forcing me to fight anyway. Another one-off flashback took the form of turn-based RPG combat, which is rough but deep enough to be satisfying for its brief appearance.</p>
<p>Then there’s the music. You’re in a band, so you need to “write” some songs that you can perform whilst on tour. There’s a rhythm mini-game for both writing and playing the songs, not too dissimilar to Guitar Hero, but while some of these original songs are catchy in places, I wouldn’t expect them to end up in your daily playlist. The rhythm game itself is also just serviceable, button prompts flying in from all sides of the screen in a way that can make the timing more difficult to judge than it should be.</p>

<p>Variety is nice, but all these elements undercut the game’s focus and pacing. You can have a road trip across America smuggling a mysterious package that deals with weighty topics like discrimination and misinformation, but when the main story is combined with long conversations on other topics, it can feel disjointed. Add to that the funny subversions and absurdities between the serious stuff, and there’s a bit of tonal whiplash.&nbsp;It builds toward an ending that leaves a few too many threads without a satisfying resolution.</p>
<p>The presentation on the whole looks good, with pleasing character designs and models and a good art direction, but with environments that often feel a bit sparse and bare.</p>
<p>Now this all sounds like doom and gloom, but it really isn’t. I really enjoyed Dustborn. Mechanically, it doesn’t quite hit the targets perfectly, but I’m a sucker for a character driven story and the characters here are remarkably well realised, which is more than enough to keep me going through some mediocre gameplay and unrealised potential. The world might be a touch heavy handed in how it’s set up, but I think that we can collectively agree that the time for subtlety has passed when people are unironically cheering on Homelander whilst watching The Boys.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/day-before-developer-fntastic-returning<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fntastic, whose name you might remember from the disaster that was&nbsp;<em>The Day Before</em>, is once again asking for your money, this time in the form of a Kickstarter campaign to revive the studio and help it make its latest game.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/FntasticHQ/status/1839404741841047686" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Fntastic implores those who "helped us create Fntastic through Kickstarter" to pledge their "help again to bring Fntastic back".</p>
<p>The studio has <a href="https://www.fntastic.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">created a new official website</a> to herald its return, and it comes complete with a step-by-step plan explaining how you can help Fntastic if you want to, as well as a "Fntastic 2.0" outline in which the studio details how it's going to do things better this time around.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fntastic-the-day-before-return-escape-factory.jpg?itok=tgOZpuhA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fntastic-the-day-before-return-escape-factory.jpg?itok=aSgVG07o 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Day Before&nbsp;</em>developer Fntastic is working on a new game, and it wants your help.</figcaption></figure><p>In its <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/66cf2872c641a645890f1c5d/t/66e3f77eace4a55f13841699/1726216072958/Fntastic-2-0.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">plan for recovery</a>, Fntastic pledges to run its business on the three core principles of "honesty", "transparency", and "professionalism", pledging to build trust within its community, actively engage with said community via social media, and end the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/day-before-devs-ask-for-volunteers-to-help-finish-their-game">practice of relying on "volunteers"</a>.</p>
<p>The studio says its new mission is to deliver "high-quality gaming experiences, combining innovation, creativity, integrity, and transparency". One rather wonders why that wasn't the plan to start with, but hey.</p>
<p>As well as its plan, Fntastic has also released <a href="https://www.fntastic.com/faq" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an FAQ</a> anticipating some of the questions people might have about its return. The studio says that after its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/day-before-developer-shuts-down-as-controversial-game-flops">initial closure</a>, its staffers "reflected on our past mistakes and initiated significant internal changes".</p>
<p>Fntastic's return this time around hinges on a game called&nbsp;<em>Escape Factory</em>, which looks to be a sort of multiplayer&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>-esque platformer with "physics-based challenges". It looks like the studio's Kickstarter campaign covers both the game's development and the company's return.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, Fntastic is the company that created&nbsp;<em>The Day Before</em>, a zombie survival game with a marketing campaign Fntastic itself describes as "embellished" (which is certainly one way to put it).</p>
<p>On release, the game was quickly and widely panned for its lack of similarity to the game trailers and marketing hype promised it would be, and just a few weeks after its launch,&nbsp;<em>The Day Before&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/day-before-will-completely-shut-down-in-janhuary-as-steam-will-refund-all-players">shut down for good</a>, with Fntastic refunding everyone who bought it.</p>
<p>Fntastic may want everyone reading its new plan to think it's turned over a new leaf, but back in January this year, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fntastic-the-day-before-social-media">blamed what it called a "hate campaign"</a> for&nbsp;<em>The Day Before</em>'s failure.</p>
<p>In the aforementioned FAQ, Fntastic admits that its team "still consists of the same people who created all of our previous games". Despite pledging not to use volunteers, the studio also says that "some team members are helping out on a goodwill basis".</p>
<p>I'll leave it to you to decide whether or not bringing back Fntastic is a good idea, but if you want to, you can support the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fntasticgames/escape-factory/description" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Escape Factory&nbsp;</em>Kickstarter campaign here</a>.</p>

    <p><span>Storyline progression, Xilonen, Nahida's birthday, and more.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 5.1 update for <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [118 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, dubbed “The Rainbow Destined to Burn,” will launch on October 9, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [174 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-918151"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>The main storyline will continue in the newly unveiled region of Natlan, where Xilonen will join as a master forger and a dependable ally in combat and exploration. Meanwhile, Sumeru will celebrate the return of the Sabzeruz Festival, filled with joy, festivities, and a special birthday surprise for Nahida.</p><p>Following the previous Archon Quest, Natlan is in urgent need of help to save herself from destruction and the looming threat of the Abyss. While players and Xilonen work together to forge an Ancient Name for the Traveler, Citlali, a member of the Masters of the Night-Wind, will finally appear to lend a hand. Meanwhile, her fellow tribe member, Ororon, is devising a secret plan. Players’ efforts to rescue Natlan will be rewarded, as they can claim an additional 500 Primogems by completing the two new acts of the Archon Quest in Version 5.1. Additionally, up to 400 Primogems can be obtained by completing specific World Quests and gaining Natlan Exploration Progress.</p><p>Xilonen, renowned for crafting legendary items like the Pyro Archon’s sunglasses, is not only a talented smith but also an agile and reliable warrior. Unlike traditional climbers, this five-star Geo Sword wielder can skate effortlessly and execute agile leaps along cliff walls. In combat, Xilonen demonstrates versatile support skills by reducing enemies’ Elemental RES or healing her teammates, thanks to her unique combat equipment: Samplers. All three Samplers initially record Geo Source Samples, which Xilonen can instantly activate using her Elemental Skill to reduce enemies’ Geo Elemental RES while enhancing her Normal and Plunging Attack DMG. When she teams up with Hydro, Pyro, Cryo, or Electro characters, the Source Samples will undergo Elemental Conversion and change colors, but they can only be activated after maxing out her Nightsoul Points through Normal Attacks, allowing her to reduce the corresponding Elemental RES of enemies. If at least two Source Samples change color, Xilonen can activate them more rapidly, shifting her Elemental Burst from dealing Geo AoE DMG to healing nearby active teammates. Additionally, she can help the team regain a certain amount of Phlogiston by triggering a Nightsoul Transmission.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_918152"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>In the Version 5.1 Event Wishes, Xilonen will feature in the first half alongside the rerun of Chiori, while the second half brings back Nahida and Hu Tao. As more allies join the team, Natlan introduces a new Enemy Boss: the “Secret Source Constructor,” an ancient construction machine with a lethal nature that awaits challengers in a long-forgotten cave.</p><p>Back in Sumeru, the streets come alive with joyful rhythms during the Sabzeruz Festival, honoring the birthday of Lesser Lord Kusanali. This year, players will reunite with Dehya, Tighnari, and Collei to prepare a heartwarming birthday surprise for Nahida, taking on the special role of Knight of Flowers to escort her carriage through the festival parade. In Port Ormos, the festivities feature a series of mini-games, including “Rocking Carriage,” where players control a carriage to collect flowers and dodge obstacles; “Interreflection of Reality and Dreams,” which challenges players to spot anomalies in the dream world; and a combat challenge where participants fight as the Knight of Flowers. By earning enough Festive Fervor through these activities, players can claim various rewards, including a chance to recruit Candace for free.</p><p>Version 5.1 also introduces several quality-of-life improvements for the Spiral Abyss, character ascension, Artifacts, and Echo Cosmetics. In the Spiral Abyss, a new skip feature allows players to bypass Floor 9 if they achieved full stars on Floor 11 in the previous update. Similarly, players who completed Floor 12 with full stars can skip both Floors 9 and 10. Character ascension has become more intuitive, with inventory updates displaying the quantities of craftable materials. A new formula filter at the Crafting Bench will also simplify crafting management. Additionally, in the character Artifact interface, Artifact Set filters and affix sorting preferences for individual slots will now be saved, eliminating the need to reset them after each session. Lastly, Zhongli and Keqing’s Echoes can now be obtained by completing new Envisaged Echoes challenges introduced in the latest update.</p></blockquote><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,067 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,260 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [21,350 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://ys-api-os.mihoyo.com/event/download_porter/link/ys_global/genshinimpactpc/default" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">client</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/genshin-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genshin-impact/id1517783697" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Play</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24255778/lg-razer-ultra-low-latency-bluetooth-ull-gaming-controller<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>LG has teamed up with Razer and MediaTek to develop <a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2024/09/lg-teams-up-with-razer-and-mediatek-to-present-first-ever-bluetooth-ultra-low-latency-technology/">a new Bluetooth gaming controller</a> that could greatly reduce the input lag for cloud-based gaming. According to LG, it’s the first controller to utilize Ultra-Low Latency (ULL) Bluetooth technology — an <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/specifications-in-development/#:~:text=Ultra%20Low%20Latency%20HID">in-development standard</a> that aims to make wireless controllers as responsive as their wired counterparts.</p><p>The BT ULL-enabled controller was compared against a non-specified “standard controller” at&nbsp;LG’s webOS Summit event on Friday. “The demonstration highlighted the superior responsiveness, reduced input lag and control precision of the BT ULL technology across various cloud-based games, including FPS, fighting and racing titles,” LG said in its newsroom post.</p><div><figcaption><em>There’s no close-up shot of the new controller, but the design may be subject to change before it officially launches.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: LG</cite></p></div><p>Input lag on Bluetooth controllers can vary by model and environmental factors, but anything below 10-20 milliseconds is preferred. Wired controllers typically have a lower input latency which makes them appealing to competitive gamers. Razer’s new ULL Bluetooth gaming controller was supposedly demonstrated with a “game-changing 1ms input lag.”</p><p>Google once tried to solve controller input latency issues with its Stadia service, enabling the controller to connect directly over Wi-Fi to Google’s datacenters. This allowed Google to avoid the added Bluetooth latency. After Google <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/29/23378713/google-stadia-shutting-down-game-streaming-january-2023">shuttered its Stadia service</a> last year the company released an update to enable <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23559284/google-stadia-controller-bluetooth-mode-how-to">Bluetooth on its Stadia controllers</a> for use on PCs, Macs, phones, and other devices.</p><p>Bluetooth ULL support is being built into select LG 120Hz OLED and mini-LED TVs that use MediaTek’s MT7921 WiFi chipset, which are scheduled to launch in 2025. LG is also planning to introduce a certification for third-party ULL-supported controllers to ensure they “work seamlessly with LG webOS smart TVs,” with Razer being the first company to qualify.</p><p>There’s no price, release date, or even an official name associated with the new Razer controller yet, so it may take some time before it’s actually available for consumers to buy. We may get some additional details on both the controller and LG’s ULL-supported TVs at the upcoming CES, which is taking place between January 7th-10th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Alan Wake and Control developer Remedy has entered into a €15m convertible loan agreement with technology conglomerate <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>. This type of loan is an agreement that can be converted into a predetermined number of equity shares at a later date.</p>
<p>Tencent's loan is still to be approved by Remedy's Extraordinary General Meeting, which is scheduled to be held by 24th October. Following its approval, Tencent will "have the right to convert the loan into new Remedy shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the convertible rights" three years after the drawdown.</p>

<p>"Part of Remedy's long-term strategy has been to strengthen our position in the value chain, to have more control over how our games are commercialised, and to grow our share of the value these games can create," Remedy CEO Tero Virtala said today, in a <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/inside-information-remedy-enters-into-a-eur-15-million-convertible-loan-agreement-with-tencent/">press release</a> detailing the loan.</p>
<p>"As we move towards self-publishing, this financing will support us in developing and fully realising the potential of the games we have in development and successfully carrying out the commercial activities of our next self-published games."</p>
<p>The studio exec said Tencent's investment in the company "demonstrates strong confidence in Remedy's long-term vision and strategy".</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-developer-cancels-premium-co-op-multiplayer-codename-kestrel-despite-early-promise">Remedy cancelled a premium co-op multiplayer game</a> it had in the pipeline with Tencent. This project started life as codename Vanguard, before it was<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedy-reboots-free-to-play-co-op-multiplayer-project-vanguard-as-premium-release"> rebooted last year</a>, and was being developed by the studio, with Tencent set to handle the publishing side of things.</p>
<p>At the time of this announcement, Remedy said the cancellation would allow the studio to focus on other games in its portfolio. Upcoming games include the self-published <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedy-officially-announces-sequel-to-control">Control 2</a>, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/max-payne">Max Payne</a> 1 &amp; 2 remakes and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-multiplayer-promises-a-unique-remedy-angle-on-the-genre">Control multiplayer spin-off which the company said will give players a "unique Remedy angle" on the genre</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, Remedy also recently entered a partnership which will see <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-and-control-film-and-television-rights-acquired-by-annapurna">Annapurna Pictures financing half of Control 2</a> in exchange for the film and TV rights to Control and Alan Wake. Earlier this month, Thomas Puha from Remedy moved to assure his followers that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-sees-exodus-of-entire-staff-as-negotiations-break-down">mass exodus of staff at indie video game publisher Annapurna Interactive</a> would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/developers-rush-to-reassure-players-of-forthcoming-releases-following-annapurna-interactive-mass-exodus">not affect the studio's partnership with Annapurna going forward</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ibuypowers-rdy-y70-pre-built-pc-is-the-ultimate-dream-for-console-users/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PC gaming experience for new players can be particularly overwhelming when setting up and optimizing PCs for their best use. The renowned system integrator <a href="https://www.ibuypower.com/?utm_campaign=wccftech-vctay70&amp;utm_source=wccftech.com&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank">iBUYPOWER</a> has presented a fantastic solution to this problem, making the whole journey seamless by utilizing Windows 11.</p>
<p>For those not in the know, iBUYPOWER is one of the longest-running system integrators in North America that deals in high-quality and high-performance prebuilt and custom gaming PCs designed with utter perfection, allowing consumers the ultimate "plug-in-play" experience. Opting for them is an excellent choice for those fresh to <a href="https://www.ibuypower.com/gaming-pcs?utm_campaign=wccftech-vctay70&amp;utm_source=wccftech.com&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank">gaming PCs</a>, especially those who grew up playing console games and are determined to avoid common issues when setting up their new system.</p>
<p>iBUYPOWER’s <a href="https://www.ibuypower.com/store/rdy-y70-valorant-vcta-b003?utm_campaign=wccftech-vctay70&amp;utm_source=wccftech.com&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank">RDY Y70 VALORANT VCTA B003</a> pre-built system, equipped with Windows 11, is one of the more impressive choices to consider. Not only does this PC tick all the boxes when it comes to performance, features, and aesthetics, but iBUYPOWER takes robust checks to ensure high-performance gaming out of the box, making it a viable choice for console players, especially as there are only a few steps to get the system up and running, which we'll go through step-by-step.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>This specific iBUYPOWER system celebrates <a href="https://www.ibuypower.com/valorant-champions-tour-americas?utm_campaign=wccftech-vctay70&amp;utm_source=wccftech.com&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank">iBUYPOWER’s collaboration with VALORANT’s VCT Americas competition</a> as their Official PC Partner, which was announced during their <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ibuypower?utm_campaign=wccftech-vctay70&amp;utm_source=wccftech.com&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank">25th anniversary</a>. With curated components chosen for the build, this is not only one of the best PCs on the market, but iBUYPOWER nailed the PC’s ultimate use-case – to create tournament-ready systems that are tuned for competitive play, making this system a compelling option.</p>
<p>Moving onto the PC specs, the iBUYPOWER RDY Y70 VCTA B003 features Intel's Core i7-14700KF CPU, 32GB of DDR5-6000MHz RAM, and 2TB of M.2 NVMe Gen4 SSD. It is also equipped with NVIDIA's RTX 4070 Ti SUPER GPU, which is perfect for 1080p / 1440p gaming and makes this PC a fantastic all-around option for regular users and gamers alike.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The setup process isn't that complicated, especially when you have an iBUYPOWER system that is already tuned with optimal settings out of the box. Once you have unboxed the computer, the first thing to do is to connect the graphics card to your PC since, under the iBUYPOWER "SafeGuard Packaging," the manufacturer ships out the system without the GPU mounted inside. The best way to do this is by following the steps advised by iBUYPOWER themselves.</p>
<p>Next is powering on the system by plugging in the computer with the included power cable. Make sure to keep an eye on wattage recommendations in the manual, before proceeding with this step. Once the PC's power port, located on the back of the power supply, is connected, the next thing is to set up your monitor to the system. Connect the pre-included set of display cables, either HDMI and/or DisplayPort cables, from your monitor to the GPU, and you’ll have a system up and ready to go.</p>
<p>The interesting thing to note here is the iBUYPOWER RDY Y70 pre-built PC is one of the more solid options on the market when it comes to opting for a system that caters to regular consumer needs while offering high-performance gaming for several years. The company has indeed created a remarkable product tied to their VALORANT VCT Americas collaboration, which shows the level of quality, value, and performance often found in iBUYPOWER’s product lineup.</p>
<p>Not to mention the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ibuypower?utm_campaign=wccftech-vctay70&amp;utm_source=wccftech.com&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank">extensive warranty coverage</a> you get out of any new iBUYPOWER system which offers 3-Year Standard (3 YR Labor + 2 YR Parts) servicing. If you’re in the market to upgrade your gaming PC, iBUYPOWER has the builds that will handle both gaming and productivity tasks with ease. Make sure to keep an eye on their <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ibuypower?utm_campaign=wccftech-vctay70&amp;utm_source=wccftech.com&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank">coupons</a> page or <a href="https://discord.com/invite/ibuypower?utm_campaign=wccftech-vctay70&amp;utm_source=wccftech.com&amp;utm_medium=referral" target="_blank">daily deals</a> page for the newest discounts.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-this-a-reference-guide-tarkov-quest/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98is-this-a-reference-%E2%80%99-tarkov-quest-guide.994161/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-this-a-reference-guide-tarkov-quest/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlestate Games has added a super-size, monumental Fence quest into Escape from Tarkov called ‘Is This a Reference?’ It’s a bizarre task that requires you to place dozens of Wi-Fi Camera devices across almost every map in the game, specifically at locations that are references to other games, movies, and television shows, amongst other things.</p>



<p>It’s a sizeable beast of a quest that’s confusing many players. If you’re one of them, check out our ‘Is This a Reference’ quest guide below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-stock-up-on-wi-fi-cameras">Stock Up on Wi-Fi Cameras</h2>



<p>You’ll need <strong>27 Wi-Fi Cameras </strong>to complete Is This a Reference in Escape from Tarkov – that’s the first blocker.</p>



<p>Presently, they’re being sold on the Flea for around €900 – or around 140,000 roubles. If you’re not investing in the Flea Market, you can head over to Mechanic’s storefront and barter for Wi-Fi Cameras. They’ll cost you 1 x Electronic Components and 1 x Powerbank, but this isn’t exactly the best way to go given that you’ll have to spend around 200,000 roubles per barter.</p>



<p>Also, you can only get four devices per restock, and you’ll need to wait a couple of hours between each reset.</p>



<p>Given that Wi-Fi Cameras are very rare, you’re not likely to find them on your adventures around Escape from Tarkov, which means you’re going to spend <strong>a long time trying </strong>to complete Is This a Reference.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-complete-is-this-a-reference-in-tarkov">How to  Complete Is This a Reference in Tarkov</h2>



<p>Firstly, you’ll need to have at least 1.0 Fence rep to unlock the task in the first place. Once you’ve ticked that box, it’s time to equip some Wi-Fi Cameras and head out into the world of Tarkov. </p>



<p>This task will take you across Streets of Tarkov, Reserve, Woods, Shoreline, Ground Zero, Lighthouse, and Factory.</p>



<p>Presently, the information available to pad out an Is This a Reference guide is thin because so few players have managed to find the spots alluded to in the task. Per the typical operating model, players have been given little guidance to find the spots required for Is This a Reference, and only vague clues have been offered by Battlestate Games.</p>



<p>With that in mind, here’s our full location guide for Is This a Reference:</p>



<h3 id="h-customs">Customs</h3>



<ul>
<li>‘Bucket-head villain’ – In the bathroom opposite the ‘streamer room’, where the mannequin stands</li>



<li>‘Crew member’s execution site’ – ‘Streamer’ or ‘Green Screen’ room</li>



<li>‘Indie developer’s worst nightmare’ – Dorms 212</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-factory">Factory</h3>

He then hears a voice that says: "Rise, son of Guilliman."</p><p>According to the game’s subtitles, that line — again, pre-patch — was attributed to Marneus Calgar, Chapter Master of the Ultramarines. Fans took it as an odd thing for Calgar to say to Titus, given he also is a son of Roboute Guilliman, the primarch from which all Ultramarines are based. (Check out the cutscene in the video below.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Now, onto patch 3.0. Here’s the change in question:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Fixed an unidentified voice at the end of the story that was assigned to the wrong character.</li></ul><p>Assigned to the wrong character, you say? So, who is the <em>right </em>character? The same cutscene now attributes the line to [Voice], which is ambiguous, but Warhammer 40,000 lore fans have a clear idea who this voice belongs to: the Emperor himself.</p><p>If true, this has big implications for Space Marine 2’s story, the nature of Titus’ abilities not just in this game but the first, and any role he might play in the ongoing narrative. But given Titus is now part of the Warhammer 40,000 canon (he has his own model you can play on Games Workshop’s tabletop game and the company has even released an official lore video delving into Titus’ backstory on Warhammer TV), fans are taking this as further evidence of the Emperor’s resurgence across the galaxy.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/sm2-recruit-sep24-image2-1727204000-1727434922614.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The official Titus model for Warhammer 40,000. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p>For the uninitiated, the Emperor of Mankind is the reigning monarch of the Imperium of Man whose slowly decaying body has sat immobile within the Golden Throne of Terra for over 10,000 years. But that hasn’t stopped the Emperor, the most powerful psyker to have ever existed, from seemingly stepping in every now and then to help humanity out in its darkest hours.</p><p>At this point in the ongoing (and slow moving!) Warhammer 40,000 storyline, there is growing evidence to suggest the Emperor is finally stirring, with some convinced his return proper is coming sooner rather than later. Indeed, in Warhammer 40,000 novel Godblight, the Emperor uses Guilliman as a vessel to burn down the Garden of Nurgle from within the Warp, miraculously reviving his son in the process.</p><p>Warhammer 40,000 fans now believe the Emperor is doing something similar with Titus. Titus’ unexplained immunity to the corrupting influence of Chaos during the Space Marine games may have been the Emperor’s doing all along. Indeed Titus’ ability to interact with the Chaos artifact and destroy it might be because he is blessed by the Emperor. As the ending of Space Marine 2 makes clear, the Inquisition’s suspicion of Titus and his abilities continues despite his heroics. But perhaps in the inevitable Space Marine 3 we’ll see the truth of the Emperor’s involvement, and Titus finally clear of the Inquisition's attention.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/emperor-upon-throne-1727435118566.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Emperor of Mankind in the 41st millennium. Image credit: Games Workshop.</figcaption></figure></output><p>For now, Space Marine 2 and Warhammer 40,000 lore fans are simply enjoying the debate this change has sparked, and have pointed to a <a href="https://x.com/MocapVeteran/status/1835234473882894538" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tease</a> by creative director Oliver Hollis-Leick about whether the line of dialogue in question does indeed come from the Emperor. Here’s his response:</p><p>“That is open to individual interpretation. It could be in Titus's mind, could be Calgar, or it could be the Emperor (though GW might disagree on that). I know who I meant it to be when I wrote it but I'll keep that to myself ;)”</p><p>IGN recently interviewed Saber chief creative officer Tim Willits about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-will-hopefully-automatically-make-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-performance-mode-look-better-than-quality-mode-does-now-dev-says"><u>the boost he expects the PS5 Pro will give the game</u></a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3"><u>how the breakout success of Space Marine 2 has “changed everything” for the studio</u></a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yes-warhammer-40000-superfan-henry-cavill-is-playing-space-marine-2-no-he-wont-reveal-his-username"><u>Warhammer 40,000 superfan Henry Cavill has been playing Space Marine 2 and delivered his verdict</u></a>, and we also have details on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-post-launch-roadmap-includes-new-maps-a-horde-mode-and-more"><u>what fans can expect from Space Marine 2’s seasonal post-launch content model</u></a>.

                <p>Because of the deep lore and the giant creatures of Capcom's Monster Hunter franchise, it may be intimidating for inexperienced gamers who haven't played the titles before. However, the latest preview for the next installment, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-launching-in-february/1100-6526679/" data-ref-id="1100-6526679">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, is laser-focused on setting up the game for new players and veterans alike. Think of it as Monster Hunter 101, as related by the in-game handler, Alma.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxSlVspp1cI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="99">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jxSlVspp1cI?start=99" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The player character is a Hunter who is on an expedition to the Forbidden Lands. The Hunter's expedition team includes Alma, a female smith named Gemma, and a Palico--a feline-like companion who aids the player in battle and was also seen in World. Multiple teams are also on this journey to reunite a young boy, Nata, with his people and vanquish the monster who scattered them: Arkveld, the White Wraith.</p><p>The creatures in the game will adapt to the presence of the expedition team over time, which means that the players will have to shift their tactics as needed. It's also explained that the different terrain of the Forbidden Lands will play a role in how the battles are fought. But surviving in the wild also means that the Hunter has to secure food with the help of their Palico.</p><p>Another aspect of the game is the Hunter's relationship with their Seikret, a bird-like two-legged beast that can be ridden like a horse. The Seikfret can spirit the player out of harm's way when things go wrong in battle with the monsters. Similarly, the Hunter can signal for help in battle to avoid getting overwhelmed or even killed. Some threats in this game are simply too much to handle without backup.</p><p>Monster Hunter Wilds will be released on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on February 28, 2025.</p>

            <p>A website unveiled to mark <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>'s anniversary earlier this week has given us our best clue as to what unannounced Silent Hill game may be on the way: either a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-4-the-room">Silent Hill 4: The Room</a> Remake or even Silent Hill 4: Part 2.</p>
<p>At first, the <a href="https://www.silenthill-historicalsociety.com/">Silent Hill Historical Society website</a> looks little more than a bit of fan service thrown up to celebrate Silent Hill 2's 23rd anniversary and the upcoming release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>. But fans have been poking around the site and using its clues to piece together a new mystery.</p>
<p>This post will include light spoilers about the alternate reality game (ARG), so if you'd prefer not to be spoiled, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/"><strong>please retreat now</strong></a><strong>!</strong></p>

<p>With several references to Silent Hill's own serial killer, Walter Sullivan, the website offers loads of information about the town, including confirmation that despite its, uh, troubling past, people still "live" there today (at least, in ARG form).</p>
<p>However, Sullivan and his victims are mentioned in Silent Hill 2, too, leading some to think the Silent Hill 4 references are a red herring, not least because the website includes several screenshots seemingly taken from the upcoming remake.</p>
<p>After solving the site's dozens of puzzles, fans then discovered an all-new email-based story.</p>
<p>"From this point forward, the line between reality and fiction will begin to blur," reads a hidden page on the website. "To establish communications with the world of Silent Hill, you will need to use this email software." It then links to what appears to be an email client.</p>
<p>As the statement outlines, these "blurring" of the lines and interactive elements sound a lot like the rumours we heard about the defunct Silent Hills, which at some point, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hills-reportedly-would-have-sent-players-real-life-emails-or-text-messages">was reportedly going to send players real-life emails and text messages</a>.</p>
<p>Fans were then invited to share their email and, in some instances, physical addresses, and warned that it would likely "take a few days" to resolve the story. They were then asked not to share URLs (presumably not to spoil anyone's fun).</p>
<p>Later, players were told to send an anonymous email account a video of them burning a leaflet - the same leaflet that Bubble Head Nurses have been giving out at the Silent Hill stand at the Tokyo Game Show this week.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>As for what's next? Who knows. Fans are still busy deciphering the clues.</p>
<p>However, the story that unfolds through the website, puzzles, and emails hint at a strong connection to Silent Hill 4: The Room. Right now, we're still unsure if this suggests a remake is on the way or - given that the ARG talks of murders still happening in 2024 - a brand new game extending The Room's grim storyline is in the works. A Silent Hill: The Room - Part 2, perhaps.</p>
<p>Given NoCode is working on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-townfall">Silent Hill: Townfall</a> and NeoBards is working on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, it's thought this is an entirely different, unannounced project, most likely developed by an internal team at Konami or an external Japanese studio.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, it's certainly keeping fans occupied as we wait for Silent Hill 2 Remake to launch on 8th October (or 6th, for those forking out for the deluxe edition).</p>
<p>Sony recently confirmed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-will-be-a-ps5-console-exclusive-for-one-year">Silent Hill 2 Remake will be exclusive to PlayStation 5 for one year</a>. According to a new trailer released this time last week, Bloober Team's highly-anticipated remake will become available on "other formats" on 8th October, 2025.</p>
<p>"In rebuilding such a beloved classic with upgraded visuals and controls, the new combat style fits in surprisingly well," Tom wrote in Eurogamer's excellent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2s-remake-dares-to-modernise-a-classic-and-is-largely-succeeding">Silent Hill 2 Remake preview</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Konami have delivered a new look at Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and once again it’s all cut scenes and no gameplay, but we do get a look at The Boss, Colonel Volgin, and Revolver Ocelot.&nbsp; We also get our first look at Eva, the KGB agent who will provide support throughout the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater TGS 2024 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p66fcP-u0NM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>A Metal Gear game remake had long been rumoured before Metal Gear Delta: Snake Eater was eventually confirmed and announced back in May. At the same time, Konami confirmed a remastered Master Collection featuring Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, and the original Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater remakes the PS2 classic in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>As for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, very little is known about it, especially when it comes to gameplay. We don’t know if Konami has modernised anything, but we do know that Hideo Kojima’s name has been wiped from the title.</p>
<p>The story is as follows:</p>

<p><em>In the middle of the Cold War, Naked Snake, the man who would later be known as Big Boss, infiltrates the Soviet Union to help a scientist named Sokolov defect. However, the mission ends in failure when Snake’s mentor—The Boss, a soldier known as the mother of special forces—betrays him, and Sokolov is captured by Colonel Volgin of the GRU.</em></p>
<p><em>One week later, Snake returns to the same Soviet territory to rescue Sokolov and eliminate The Boss—a mission that will mark the start of a new legend, amid the backdrop of an ever-changing scene, the game’s central theme.</em></p>
<p><em>This epic installment tells the story of the birth of the hero known as Big Boss, the very start of the Metal Gear Saga.</em></p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater does not have a release date but it is expected to launch sometime next year.</p>

The update also enabled Bluetooth connectivity for DualSense and DualShock controllers, fixes character graphics not displaying properly on certain screens, some UI issues, incorrect text display, errors in the ending credits, and unexpected crashing issues under certain conditions.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy XVI finally launched this month on PC, complete with the DLC expansions released on PlayStation 5. Even without them, the latest main entry in the long-running series is more than worth anyone's time, as highlighted by Kai in his<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/"> review</a> of the PlayStation 5 release.</p>
<p><em>Final Fantasy XVI heralds in a new standard for Japanese role-playing games and while the RPG components themselves are limited by Square-Enix standards, it's the narrative and gameplay that exceed all expectations. What begins with kingdom-wide subterfuge and destruction ends with a world forever changed and the player, as Clive Rosfield and Ifrit together, are the driving force to see it all through until the end.</em></p>
<p>Final Fantasy XVI is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. It is <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-xbox-rumors-intensify-ahead-of-tgs-2024/">rumored</a> that the game will eventually be released on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, but no official announcement has been made to date.</p>

			<p>PlayStation 6 backward compatibility will greatly benefit from the existence of the PlayStation 5 Pro, just as the base model benefited from the existence of the PlayStation 4 Pro.</p>
<p>Speaking during their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qnv4lEawr6g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weekly podcast</a>, the tech experts at Digital Foundry clearly highlighted how the existence of the soon-to-be-released mid-generation refresh console is a victory even for those who are not going to buy it. Much like it was with the base model, backward compatibility benefited greatly from the PlayStation 4 Pro, as not only does the current generation console run previous generation games in Pro mode but also enhances them in certain instances. Games that have shaky performance on PS4 Pro, for example, run much smoother on the current generation system, while games using dynamic resolution scaling benefit from the increased power of the current system by pushing towards the upper bound of the resolution range. The same is likely going to happen with the PlayStation 6, considering there's a very good chance some games will still run at 30 FPS on PlayStation 5 Pro, which will likely be bumped up to 60 FPS on the next-generation system.</p>
<p><iframe title="How PS5 Pro Improves PlayStation 6 Backwards Compatibility" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qnv4lEawr6g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Not a whole lot is known about the PlayStation 6 other than the fact that it is in the works and will be powered once again by AMD. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-powered-amd/">Earlier this month</a>, we learned that Intel bid hard to design the console but eventually lost to AMD due to a few reasons, including backward compatibility concerns. The next-gen system from Sony may also launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-playstation-6-socs-affordable/">in two different SKUs</a>, one of them said to be more affordable than the other. If this is am Xbox Series S scenario, or a home console or a handheld, no one can say at the moment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/27/transformers-x-monster-hunter-cross-over-revealed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Over the years Transformers has crossed over with some big franchise such as Knight Rider, with a robot based on KITT, and Back to the Future, with a robot that transforms in to the DeLorean. Also, Hasbro are still releasing figures in the “Gamer Edition” line based on the Activision ‘Cybertron’ games. Transformers have also appeared in many games such as Fortnite and World of Warships but I do not recall their ever being a&nbsp; Transformers toy based on a non Transformers video game.</p>
<p>That is about to change with the upcoming release of Transformers X Monster Hunter, behold Liolaeous Prime!<br>
</p>



<p>These are pictures of the prototype so the design may change but as you can see Optimus Prime now transforms in to a Rathalos from Monster Hunter World. Prime seems to based on a sort of Japanese Samurai design but I do like his nifty Monster Hunter style goggles on the top of his head.</p>
<p>The figure has a tentative release date of July 2025 and if you are in the UK you can <a href="https://www.kapowtoys.co.uk/product/transformers-x-monster-hunter-liolaeous-prime-rathalos-crossover.html?fbclid=IwY2xjawFjbCVleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHZRwUWTrHnVjzOz7V41WGU6l6k3-pFdnoITjhkrAPHr8xHOExKvOuxKeUw_aem_j1FUjxuGWjjbUj0dKe3dpw">pre-order one here.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has a release date, and it’s set for 28th February 2025, the long-awaited monster hunting sequel coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds - Release Date Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0dJpKRWYNkE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As always, there’s plenty of new ideas being added into the mix with a new Monster Hunter game, even if the main point remains the same.&nbsp;Players will have access to new gadgets and companions like the Seikret, a new creature that you can mount and ride across the open world. The Seikret can also automatically follow the trail to get you to the target monster, and give you time to heal, sharpen your weapons and grab useful items and materials that you meander past. It also has a holster to let you swap between primary and secondary weapons.</p>
<p>Then there’s the Slinger, which is standard gear for hunters in Monster Hunter Wilds and will replace the Wirebug from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a>. It can shoot out ammo gathered in the environment, and can grapple to draw in distant items (even while riding the Seikret), or interact with certain parts of the environment.</p>
<p>We got to go hands on with the game recently, sharing impressions in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/10/monster-hunter-wilds-preview-a-seikret-ride-on-the-wild-side/">our Monster Hunter Wilds preview</a>. Nic said, “Time will tell how Wilds eventually plays out, but I must say — I am more excited than ever to get my hands on the final game. Just like at the Meowscular Chef’s kitchen, this small taste of a gorgeous offering from Capcom has me desperately wanting more.”</p>

		<p>Tokyo Game Show has brought with it a few new streams and presentations to get your juices flowing, but did they manage it this week? What highlights stood out for you from State of Play and (to a much lesser degree) the Xbox show?</p>
<p>My gaming this week has been all about the third man, though (after wrapping up my review of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/23/ara-history-untold-review/">Ara: History Untold</a>). Nintendo’s just released the charming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/25/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review/">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, and I very much enjoyed its fresh perspective on a Zelda adventure (now with more Zelda!). It’s the start of a busy time for Switch fans, with a Mario Party and a Mario &amp; Luigi in the next couple months as well. Who needs a Switch 2, eh? Well…. it would help with Zelda’s frame rate….</p>

<p><strong>Nick P</strong> is off on holiday soon, so he’s been trying to wrap up loose ends before he goes. He snagged the platinum for Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth and played a little bit of Dead by Daylight.</p>
<p>For <strong>Jim</strong>, meanwhile, he’s continued on with Astro Bot and TimeSplitters. For the former, he’s been rationing his time with the game to not overdose on joyful gaming, while for the latter he grabbed the platinum trophy for the first game and is now playing through TimeSplitters 2 – aided by the emulator’s rewind function on PS5.</p>

<p>Humming the Match of the Day theme tune while he plays, <strong>Aran</strong> has branded <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/ea-sports-fc-25-review/">FC 25 as “okay”</a>. Final Fantasy XVI has been more engaging for him – “The presentation is great and the story is getting very interesting.”</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> is having to revise his opinion of Star Wars: Outlaws, because the stealth missions suck – “Who thought that was a good idea? It’s definitely taken the shine off my experience with the game.” So he’s got back to work on finishing up reviews of Bloomtown: A Different Story and Enotria: The Last Song.</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has been playing Everspace 2, which he bought after forgetting he’s played a bit of it on Game Pass, and then realised why it’s so forgettable. More memorable is his returning jolly through Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag, though he bounced off Chernobylite.</p>
<p>The ever-so-secretive <strong>Nic B</strong> put dozens of hours into [embargoed]. He’d love to tell you more about it, but then he’d have to kill you. Metaphorically.</p>

<p><strong>Miguel</strong> has been playing lots of UFO 50 and Space Marine 2, with little sprinkles of&nbsp;Zenless Zone Zero between, and we’ll round out this week with <strong>Tuffcub</strong>, who played Astro Bot – “GOTY no question.”</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you played?</em></p>

            <p>Alice Bee (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tfi-friday-three-new-indie-games-where-youll-plan-every-move">wrote about</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-platform-games-on-pc">platformer</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-purge">System Purge</a> a while back, saying it starred a witch with a nice hop. So I tried out the demo for its sequel, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/system-purge-hollow-point">System Purge: Hollow Point</a>, and can confirm that the witch still has a nice hop. I'm thankful for this, because if the witch did not have a nice hop, the game would be maddening in a bad way. Don't get me wrong, it's still maddening. Just in a good way. The hop is good.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>System Purge: Hollow Point is a tricky platformer where you play as a witch, who looks a bit like a two-legged My Little Pony. Right at the start of the story, your lover seems to explode into a horrifying mass of tendrils - as is so often the case. You, the pony witch, rock up at a mysterious facility and decide to find out why this happened. And you do so by hopping through its grungy, metallic innards and avoiding the many, many traps it brings.</p>
<p>We're talking floors that flash red and then snap upwards, like jaws. Or floating red orbs that dangle from the ceiling and explode upon contact. A gust of green wind might then blow these orbs around, turning them into the equivalent of swinging chandeliers where the bulbs are mines. There are underwater sections, too, where you've got to swim and scramble for air bubbles when you can. Die to any of these things and you'll restart that level from scratch.</p>
<p>It's a horrible time. But in a good way if you're into difficult platformers which are all about precision. Yes, there are times when the emphasis on trial and error is a bit frustrating. And yet, I thought the demo's levels cultivated a nice progression from small hops to larger, riskier hops.</p>
<p>You can find the demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2009160/System_Purge_Hollow_Point/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Hay’s StarCraft shooter is mentioned in the book, and IGN’s Ryan McCaffrey asked Schreier if it’s likely to actually come out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“If it’s not canceled!” Schreier replied. “This is Blizzard after all. Their history with StarCraft shooters is not good.</p><p>“Yes, that is a project that as far as I know is in development, or at least as of the time that I wrote this book was in development. They are working on a StarCraft shooter, StarCraft is not dead at Blizzard.</p><p>“The goal of the book isn’t to get a bunch of scoops about upcoming things. That wasn’t the purpose of this book at all, it was very much to tell a story and focus on stuff that had happened. But this felt like such an interesting and useful nugget to include because it really just shows you that Blizzard cannot quit StarCraft shooters.”</p><p>That’s a reference to Blizzard’s infamous attempt to release a StarCraft shooter in the past as part of a bid to expand the StarCraft franchise beyond its real-time strategy origins. <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/starcraft-ghost">StarCraft Ghost</a>, announced in 2002, was going to be a tactical-action console game in which you played as a deadly Ghost operative in the employ of the Dominion, but it was canceled in 2006 after a series of delays.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/screenshot-2024-09-27-104543-1727430359418.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Microsoft Gaming boss Phil Spencer wearing a StarCraft t-shirt during Xbox's Tokyo Game Show 2024 broadcast.</figcaption></figure></output><p>A second attempt to make a StarCraft shooter, codenamed Ares, was canceled in 2019 so Blizzard could focus on <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>. Ares was reportedly “like Battlefield in the StarCraft universe,” but, like Ghost, fell by the wayside.</p><p>Now, it’s a case of third time lucky for Blizzard, with this new StarCraft shooter in development. We don’t have any details at this time, but perhaps Phil Spencer’s StarCraft t-shirt he wore during <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-xbox-tokyo-game-show-2024-broadcast-everything-announced">Microsoft’s Tokyo Game Show 2024 broadcast</a> was more than a simple reference to StarCraft hitting Game Pass.</p><p>As for Hay, he joined Ubisoft in 2011 to work on Far Cry 3, then became executive producer for the Far Cry brand, shipping Far Cry Blood Dragon, Far Cry 4 , and Far Cry Primal. Hay was creative director and executive producer on Far Cry 5, and executive director for Far Cry New Dawn and Far Cry 6, before joining Blizzard in 2022 as GM/VP.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>The Day Before developer Fntastic has come out of the woodwork to announce its return.</p>
<p>The Day Before launched in December 2023, after a rocky road to release which included delays, the developer being forced to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-day-before-dev-insists-zombie-mmo-is-not-a-scam-following-latest-delay">state its game wasn't a scam</a>, and criticism for its use of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/delayed-steam-pre-order-hit-the-day-before-developer-defends-use-of-unpaid-volunteers">unpaid volunteers</a>. It even got tied up in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/calendar-app-company-confirms-the-day-before-trademark-dispute">bizarre trademark dispute with a calendar app</a> also called The Day Before.</p>
<p>In the end, The Day Before didn't last long. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-day-befores-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-seem-deserved">Its debut was a mess</a>, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-day-before-developer-fntastic-suddenly-announces-its-shut-down">studio shut down a mere matter of days after the game's release</a>, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-day-before-publisher-apologises-for-game-as-steam-refunds-open">players' receiving refunds for the product</a>. And to be honest, I thought that was that. But, I was wrong, because the studio is now back... and it wants your money again.</p>

<p>Fntastic has a new mission as part of its comeback effort: "To create games that will be loved for decades." The company's vision, meanwhile, is now "to become one of the most loved game companies by creating fantastic, innovative, and emotionally engaging experiences".</p>
<p>The studio has also revealed its next game - a physics-based multiplayer co-op escape game for 4-8 players called Escape Factory, which seems a far cry from what it initially showed The Day Before to be (see images below).</p>

<p>"You play as life-weary workers trying to escape the vicious cycle of deadly factories from which there's no easy way out. Legend has it that only one great and mysterious individual has ever escaped," reads the blurb for Escape Factory.</p>
<p>The developer has set up a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fntasticgames/escape-factory/">kickstarter campaign</a> as part of its Fntastic 2.0 push, which at the time of writing has £309 pledged of £11,623 goal, with 15 backers. If someone chooses to support this comeback by pledging $12,000, they will get an "unforgettable dinner" with Fntastic's founders.</p>
<p>"However, if we're unable to reach our initial funding goal, we won’t be able to release Escape Factory or make our return as Fntastic," it wrote. "Your support is crucial in helping us bring this vision to life."</p>

            <p>
In the grim darkness of the far future you will no longer get quite so violently annoyed with your Spiced Margerine battle-bros Chairon and Gadriel, because they will actually finish off flickering, near-dead Tyranids rather than waiting for you to clean up. Sometimes when I'm playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a>'s campaign, I feel like I'm trying to direct untrained child actors from the orchestra pit. No, don't look at <em>me</em>, Gadriel - look at the Tyranid. He can only act concussed for so long. Hit him with your chainsword now, there's a dear.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
I get that the thinking behind Gadriel and Charion's reluctance to carry out the finishing blow is that  they're saving the associated armour restoration for you, the player, but still, it don't suspend ma disbelief, so I'm happy that they've tweaked the bot behaviour and much besides in the latest Space Marine 2 update.</p>
<p>"Various inhibiting restrictions were lifted, allowing bots to be more helpful and effective, while still not beating the game for the player," explain the patch notes. In particular, restrictions on bots finishing enemies have been "heavily eased", and bots are now allowed to help with Gargoyle objectives (e.g. stopping them swamping the antennae in that mission with the planetary defence guns). They'll also help out focus-firing on zoanthropes - the flying psychic vermin with the shields who buff the regular nids and batter you with mind bullets. I really hate zoanthropes so colour me appeased by all this.
</p>
<p>
Bots aside, the update is a pretty copious overhaul of the game's campaign, Operations mode, PvP offerings, and enemy behaviour at large. As regards the balancing, it's a mixture of nerfs and boosts that seems healthy enough on paper. Enemies are less aggressive in the campaign on Veteran difficulty, for example, but player health has also been reduced a little to compensate for this and some armour management updates. It's harder to stunlock all enemies with ranged attacks, but the accuracy of ranged enemies has also been reduced when attacking from off-screen, or when shooting at players in melee.
</p>
<p>
Spawn-killing in PvP will allegedly be "more difficult" thanks to tweaked spawn patterns, and what's this, they've defanged the Vanguard's grapple launcher a bit - it'll now stagger and slow the target rather than inflicting a full stun. I haven't played Vanguard in PvP but I remember how narked James got when I used the grapple to steal executions in co-op. I'm sure the class has its fair share of haters in the competitive modes.
</p>
<p>
It's not all tweaks and fixes. The update also adds a sparring arena to the game's Battle Barge, allowing rivalrous Battle-Brothers to rip chunks out of each other without entering a mission. It's accessible directly from the Launch Bay. I like the idea of Saber expanding the small world of the Battle Barge, a meticulously lore-filled hub space full of crenelated background chatter. It's a good place in which to mull over my on-going, slightly impromptu wider investigation of the Warhammer 40K universe, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/would-you-play-a-warhammer-40k-factory-game-because-zachtronics-almost-made-one">possibilities for Warhammer 40K factory games</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the game now has the long-demanded ultrawide support on PC, together with some fresh visual customisation options, and there's a new private Operation mode that lets you play alone with bots or with a single friend, without being matchmade with randos during the mission.

            <p>Valve instituted a fairytale punishment for cheaters in its unreleased laney shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a> yesterday. Cheaters will now be turned into frogs, provided the other players in the match vote for it. A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a> modder proved the effect in <a href="https://x.com/poggu__/status/1839438568110031076">a post on Xitter</a> after the change was mentioned in some out-of-the-way patch notes by a Valve developer. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Added an initial Anti-Cheat detection system," said developer "Yoshi" in the changelog posted on the game's <a href="https://forums.playdeadlock.com/threads/09-26-2024-update.33015/">official-but-kinda-half-hidden-behind-the-bins forum</a>. "When a user is detected as cheating, during the game session the opponents will be given a choice between banning the user immediately and ending the match or turning the cheater into a frog for the rest of the game and then banning them afterwards. </p>
<p>"The system is set to conservative detection levels as we work on a v2 anti-cheat system that is more extensive. We will turn on the banning of users in a couple of days after the update is out."</p>

<p>Deadlock is still in heavy development, yet it was being played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/thousands-are-playing-valves-unrevealed-shooter-deadlock-a-blend-of-team-fortress-2-and-dota-with-bioshocky-skyrails">in the tens of thousands</a> before it was ever officially announced. Valve have since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deadlock-valves-new-multiplayer-shooter-now-has-a-barebones-steam-page">recognised it as extant</a>, which is nice of them. </p>
<p>Part of me wonders if a froggy punishment isn't a little <em>too</em> funny. I suspect some cheaters will just get a memey kick out of this, then double down their workaround efforts to rejoin the game. But there's hope some will be annoyed when that brief moment of novelty wears off. Valve is also likely making a push to show they are capable of dealing with cheaters, especially following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-finally-respond-to-team-fortress-2s-bot-problem">years of complaints about rampant cheating</a> in Team Fortress 2, which have started to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/team-fortress-2-players-report-that-valve-have-carried-out-a-ban-wave-against-aimbots">also be addressed</a>. </p>
<p>On top of the first volleys of anti-cheat, there are many other tweaks in this update, as you might expect from a game that is still being slapped together even as thousands of people violently tear each other apart on its streets. There are some changes to map layout, for example. And plenty of the playable heroes get altered. Bebop's hook range has been reduced from 30m to 25m. Dynamo's "Singularity" radius has been lowered from 8m to 7m. Look, I'll be honest, I haven't played the game. I don't know what these words mean. But they're probably important to some absolute Dynamo freak out there. </p>
<p>You can play Deadlock yourself, though. But only if you're invited to playtest by someone who already has access. Don't worry about me, I know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy. I'll sort myself out.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There isn't an ounce of excess fat on the barnstorming, bloody, breakneck shooter—and lord knows it's absolutely dripping with flavor. That is very much by design.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developer Strange Scaffold has made a name for itself as one of the most efficient studios in the game industry. The company, led by creative director Xalavier Nelson Jr., styles itself as a "human-centric" operation that strives to build video games in ways that are "better, faster, cheaper, and healthier."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a philosophy that has enabled the studio to release 15 projects in five years, with four of those (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>I Am Your Beast</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Clickolding</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Life Eater</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>El Paso, Elsewhere</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">) debuting over the past year. Nelson Jr. has spoken at length about how the company leverages a "constellation" model to deliver results by working with a rotating group of contractors that can hop between projects.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For outsiders looking in, the notion of wrapping a single project in 12 months—let alone bringing four to market in that time—might seem impossible, but Nelson Jr. claims Strange Scaffold consistently delivers by shunning the "culture of hope" that permeates the game industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to Game Developer shortly after the launch of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>I Am Your Beast</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Nelson Jr. says the constellation model imbues Strange Scaffold with the "basis of a studio that is fluid but feels solid outside of me as the single consistent piece." It's about championing "decentralization and modularity," he explains.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Denying that aforementioned 'culture of hope has resulted in Strange Scaffold becoming increasingly strict when defining the boundaries of each project. Nelson Jr. says it was a "surprising" evolution given how regimented the studio had already become, but absolutely necessary to the company's survival.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Take </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>I Am Your Beast</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The project has existed in some form for years but struggled to find its feet due to team members moving on and other issues that stifled momentum. Eventually, the finished version was developed in nine months at a production cost in the "low six figures," which Nelson Jr. explains was identified as a "recoup point that's a lot easier to hit." That is the result of rigorous, hardline planning.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"By the time we did find funding [for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>I Am Your Beast</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">] we had to start from scratch, so we built that [version] in around nine-and-a-half months. From the beginning of development, rather than saying 'let's give this garden the space to exist indefinitely,' we said 'this is a nine month project,'" he explains. "The idea is just, with every project, to be very upfront and very rigorous as a team about saying exactly how much space this project will be allowed to consume."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nelson Jr. says Strange Scaffold adheres to those timeframes and budgets by treating them as non-negotiables. He feels that rarely happens in the modern era of game development. "Everything is a flexible race towards the best possible end," he says, offering his take on how the vast majority of studios are currently approaching production.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We have not built a sensation of production rigor. We have almost created a culture of hope whereby we always hope we can get a little bit more time to polish a feature. We always hope we can get a bit more time to localize to another language, or to add another animation here or there.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It has added to an impression from our players—which is not entirely inaccurate—that games are things to be worked on indefinitely, and the more time and money you have to work on a thing, the higher the quality bar raises in a linear manner."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nelson feels developers have become "increasingly good at making games," but "terrible at producing them." He says that's why so many projects are being scrapped pre-launch: because studios and publishers simply aren't equipped to get them out of the door.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"No one knows when anything is going to come out, what quality it will be—including our players—and it terrifies everyone," he adds. "When every game is a&nbsp; Schrodinger's Box, why not over invest into a few titles and hope for the very best? It's something that we have become very used to doing. It is not how the industry existed forever. It is where we are now."</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UR5swbsAtbo?si=i7jAAzNj5Fs_bJIv" height="100%px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He feels developers are still triumphing. Still landing their moonshots. But the bar for what the industry perceives as "success" continues to rise exponentially, creating the sense that anything other than meteoritic returns for publishers, investors, and developers is tantamount to failure.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a mindset that has everybody chasing a honking golden goose rather than working to mitigate risk and deliver sensible, sustainable returns. For those in the development trenches, it's now even harder to see the forest through the trees because producing games has become "gambling by another name."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We aren't shipping projects. We are gambling," he continues. "We are gambling all the time, and I don't want to gamble on the lives of my collaborators. I don't want to gamble on the quality of the projects that we're bringing to our players either."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nelson Jr. wants Strange Scaffold to exist in "stark contrast" to that environment and is adamant the studio will continue pursuing projects with explicit limitations. "Even if a game is successful, if we don't hit our timeline and budget then a part of that project has failed and is a point to improve in the future," he adds. "I was told before I started my studio that this was not a route to shipping successful games, and now we have this portfolio of 15 titles that we've shipped in five years."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He says it's vital the company continues making titles it can survive shipping regardless of their commercial success. It's a pitch that has resulted in the studio shying away from traditional publishers, who perhaps don't want to hear developers admit that upfront, but it's also the secret behind Strange Scaffold's endurance.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"People want to hear 'heart,' 'passion,' 'this is my last hope' and to benefit from the inherent exploitation that comes from that," he says. "Because when it's you and your three best friends making the coolest indie game of all time and your entire livelihoods rest on that one bet, you will burn yourself to a crisp to give it even 1 percent more chance of success. It's a shame we encourage that environment instead of delivering reasonably scoped games that do a really fucking cool thing."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another bonus of actually bringing rad video games to market at wildly different price points is that you begin to cultivate a community. Right now, Nelson Jr. explains Strange Scaffold isn't just selling </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>I Am Your Beast</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It's selling the studio as a creative and commercial entity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[We're selling] that portfolio of creativity. I'm not looking at a single project. I'm looking at how the sales of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>I Am Your Beast</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> go on to inevitably impact every single other game we've launched," he says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, Nelson Jr. admits an older title called </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sunshine Shuffle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> initially failed to turn a profit but that sales have now "greatly improved." That's purely because the studio has survived long enough to allow other people to discover it. That's a clear win, but it's not the only metric for success. Nelson Jr. emphasizes that even if sales never picked up, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sunshine Shuffle</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is still a project that "deserves to exist." That in itself is worth celebrating.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One thing that struck me very early in my career was how often I'd meet people behind legendary games, and because those games hadn't sold well commercially they couldn't look at those dev cycles as positive things," he says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Among the many things that Strange Scaffold seeks to challenge by simply staying alive [is the idea that] every game you ship should in some way be worth existing.

            <p>
California will soon require storefronts to make clear that purchasing digital content, including games, movies and music, does not mean you actually own it.
</p>
<p>
As of next year, Californian customers will be informed that buying a game on Steam, for example, means they are simply acquiring a license for the content. Terms such as "buy" and "purchase" will be banned from the sale process unless sufficient caveats are added. 
</p>
<p>
The new legislation, AB 2426 - signed into law by Californian governer Gavin Newsom and first reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/26/24254922/california-digital-purchase-disclosure-law-ab-2426">The Verge</a> - is designed to make consumers more aware of the sometimes-temporary nature of digital ownership. 
</p>
<p>
Over the past few months, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-killing-the-crew-ubisoft-says-the-crew-2-and-motorfest-will-get-offline-modes">Ubisoft sparked headlines after it switched off its racer The Crew</a> and subsequently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-revoking-the-crew-from-owners-libraries-following-server-shutdown">removed it from players' accounts</a>. We've also seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">the swift deletion of Concord by PlayStation</a> following the failure of that game (though refunds were provided.) And while free-to-play, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-mobile-hit-the-simpsons-tapped-out-is-closing-down-after-12-years">EA announced last night it was switching off its veteran mobile hit The Simpsons: Tapped Out</a>, after 12 years of people playing - and paying into - the app.
</p>
<p>
"As retailers continue to pivot away from selling physical media, the need for consumer protections on the purchase of digital media has become increasingly more important," said California Assembly member Jacqui Irwin. 
</p>
<p>
"I thank the Governor for signing AB 2426, ensuring the false and deceptive advertising from sellers of digital media incorrectly telling consumers they own their purchases becomes a thing of the past."
</p>
<p>
It remains to be seen how storefronts will adapt to the law coming into force - and whether we might see those changes reflected more widely, outside of California.

			<p>Ubisoft, one of the biggest third-party publishers in the games industry, is forced to navigate troublesome waters. Following several less-than-successful game releases, such as the long-delayed Skull &amp; Bones, Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, and more recently, Star Wars Outlaws, the company's stock <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-drop-another-7-shareholders-concerned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">crashed hard</a>.</p>
<p>To turn the tide around, Ubisoft made some sweeping changes to its strategy. First, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-pulls-out-of-tokyo-game-show-cancels-press-previews-of-assassins-creed-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled</a> its Tokyo Game Show 2024 appearance and planned Assassin's Creed Shadows, a prelude to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game's delay</a> from November 2024 to February 2025. The additional time is meant to help avoid the same fate of Star Wars Outlaws, allowing for more polish, even though the new Assassin's Creed game will debut in the middle of an absolutely stacked month (Civilization VII and Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 on the 11th, Avowed and the first episode of Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage on the 18th, Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii and Monster Hunter Wilds on the 28th).</p>
<p>Ubisoft is also bringing its games back to Valve's Steam on day one, starting with Assassin's Creed Shadows. Despite all these changes, there is one small investor in the game publisher who's pushing hard for the sale of the company. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/ubisoft-activist-investor-says-it-has-support-10-shareholders-management-tussle-2024-09-26/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters</a> got in touch with AJ Investments and saw a letter that includes the following excerpt:</p>
<p><em>We call on the management of Ubisoft to allow the sale of the company to third parties or private equity firms at a fair price.</em></p>
<p>AJ Investments owns less than one percent of the game publisher. However, it claimed to have gathered support for its initiative from 10% of Ubisoft's shareholders.</p>
<p>The subject of a Ubisoft sale is a recurring one in the industry. A few years ago, the company had to contend with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-and-vivendi-the-cutain-call/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attempted takeover from Vivendi</a>. Then, in September 2022, Tencent <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-acquires-a-49-economic-stake-at-ubisoft-ubisofts-stock-price-increases-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invested </a>€300 million to raise its stakes in the company up to 49%. The most obvious buyer would, therefore, be Tencent itself.</p>

            <p>A new shooter set in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starcraft">StarCraft</a> universe is in the works at Blizzard, according to Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier's book Play Nice, via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-far-cry-boss-dan-hay-reportedly-working-on-new-starcraft-shooter-at-blizzard">Eurogamer</a>. The project is headed up by Dan Hay, who worked various leading roles on Ubisoft’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a> series, and also a 1999 CGI film starring Jim Belushi named “<a href="https://www.danhay.net/#/nutty/">The Nuttiest Nutcracker”</a>. The real-time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> spinoff was also mentioned during an IGN podcast that <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/crazy-blizzard-stories-with-jason-schreier-unlocked-661">aired yesterday</a>.</p>

<p>This’ll be Blizzard’s third attempt at a Starcraft shooter. Nihilistic Software’s Ghost was announced in 2002, put on indefinite hold in 2006, then officially cancelled 8 years later in 2014. Ghost’s protagonist, Nova, eventually showed up in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty">Starcraft 2</a> as part of Project: Nova, a story expansion containing several single-player missions taking place after Legacy Of The Void.</p>
<p>More recently, another shooter named codenamed Ares was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blizzard-cancelled-starcraft-fps">rumoured to have been cancelled</a> in 2019. It was “"like Battlefield in the StarCraft universe,” one source <a href="https://kotaku.com/sources-blizzard-cancels-starcraft-first-person-shoote-1835285125">told Kotaku</a> at the time. “The team had built prototypes in which the player, as a Terran marine, could gun down Zerg aliens, and there were plans to experiment with playable Zerg as well."</p>
<p>As for this new shooter, details seem fairly scant at the moment. It's not Hay's first game for Blizzard - he also worked on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blizzard-announce-survival-game-set-in-new-universe">Odyssey</a>, a survival project that was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blizzard-have-cancelled-their-in-development-survival-game-alongside-todays-layoffs">cancelled this January</a>. The cancellation coincided with nearly 2000 people across Activision Blizzard, ZeniMax and Xbox teams being laid off.</p>
<p>StarCraft: Remastered and StarCraft 2: Campaign Collection arrived on game pass this week, if you somehow haven’t played the greatest RTS campaign in history, and also Starcraft 2.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
