            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-6-sells-five-million-copies-on-track-to-be-best-selling-street-fighter-ever<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Capcom has announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> has sold over five million copies, just as the game has been released on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. At this pass, the game is on track to be the best-selling game in the series.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/StreetFighter/status/1932603814827180338">Celebrating the achievement on social media</a> with a lovely bit of custom art, the company wrote: "Street Fighter 6 has now sold over five million copies! What a way to celebrate our 2nd anniversary! Thanks to all our fans out there around the world and to all the prospective fans in the future!"</p>
<p>Street Fighter 6, released on 2nd June 2023, is catching up the series sales leader at a faster pace than its predecessors. According to the <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html#tab2">Capcom Platinum Titles page</a>, which tracks the company's best-selling games, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-v">Street Fighter 5</a> is holding the top spot for now. It's sitting pretty at 7.8m units sold since its release on 16th February, 2016. By comparison, Street Fighter 6 has sold five million copies in just over two years.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-2">Street Fighter 2</a>, which you may have assumed was the best-selling game in the series due to its prevalence in popular culture and influence on the genre, has sold 6.3m. It is worth noting that this Capcom list only tracks console sales, we also know that over 200,000 Street Fighter 2 arcade cabinets were sold during the golden era of arcades.</p>
<p>Okay, so why is Street Fighter 6 on track to surpass Street Fighter 5 in sales? Well, it's still receiving plenty of updates and has a flourishing global community of players. <a href="https://x.com/StreetFighter/status/1931118961846038736">Its third season of DLC characters was just announced at Summer Game Fest</a>, and includes plenty of returning favourites like Sagat and Alex. These, plus a recent port to the Switch 2 will help tempt older fans back into the fray.</p>
<p>The game has also had a far faster start in terms of sales than Street Fighter 5. If you don't remember, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-street-fighter-5-will-and-wont-have-at-launch">the launch of Street Fighter 5 was a disaster</a>. The PC version was a technical mess, online netcode was poor making it hard to play matches online. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yoshinori-ono-discusses-street-fighter-5s-launch-problems">Yoshinori Ono came forward and discussed all its issues candidly too</a>, explaining that the team underestimated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-5-review">the appetite for single player content in a barebones release</a>.</p>
<p>Street Fighter 5 rose up the ranks of Capcom's best-sellers due in large part to continuous support over the years. The game was tied heavily to the game's competitive scene, promoting FGC events and Capcom Pro Tour tournaments through in-game stage advertisements and purchasable cosmetics. The game essentially regained the love of fans over time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-6-review-social-silly-spectacular">Street Fighter 6 never had this problem</a>. It launched in a great state, with good online infrastructure and a sizable amount of single player content with the World Tour mode. What's left is ongoing support for the game on Capcom's part. Funnily enough, here the game has the opposite problem to Street Fighter 5. While previously there was no shortage in character cosmetics to buy, Street Fighter 6's community has been frustrated at the lack of character packs released during its life cycle.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the game has a popular competitive scene that continues to encourage new players to hop in, it has been supported heavily by community efforts like the Sajam Slam and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> Rivals, and popular content creators continue to dip their toes into the waters of Street Fighter 6 to entertain their fans.</p>
<p>Street Fighter 6 may not be around during the height of esports like Street Fighter 5 was, largely due to many of the speculative investors running away with empty pockets upon realising esports is a burning money pyre, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-sends-fighting-game-community-into-overdrive-with-whopping-1m-first-prize-street-fighter-6-tournament">Capcom continues to offer a million dollar top prize for its annual Capcom Cup finals event</a>. This has kept top players interested, and an aura of excitement alive.</p>
<p>How long will it take for Street Fighter 6 to surpass Street Fighter 6? Who can say. If I may make a prediction, I believe it'll pass the milestone around the end of 2026. Sales will slow down due to a deluge of newer fighting games releasing and snatching interest, like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/project-l">2XKO</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</a>. Regardless, it's safe to say the game has proven quite the success for Capcom.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"The most technically impressive game of the launch line-up"</p>
</section><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJUn7Kc3W3A">Digital Foundry</a> has provided its tech review for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fast-fusion">Fast Fusion</a> on the Switch 2, calling it "the most technically impressive game of the launch line-up" and a "must-have" for early adopters.</p>
<p>Starting off on a bit of a downer, however, DF notes that the overall image quality isn't quite up to scratch, with gameplay looking like "a mess of pixels with a lot of temporal blur". Essentially, Shin'en is making heavy use of DLSS, with the 1080p mode actually rendering at a base resolution of 540p, 1440p mode at 504p, 4K/60 mode at around 648p, and 4K/30 at 720p.</p><p><figure data-videoid="NK1xJVeVTDM" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NK1xJVeVTDM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK1xJVeVTDM"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK1xJVeVTDM">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>Basically, with the fast-paced nature of the game, the heavy use of DLSS causes some serious image issues. Now, the good news is that, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/fast-fusions-first-content-update-includes-a-remade-fast-rmx-track">as we'd reported recently</a>, Shin'en will be implementing a new graphics mode called 'PURE' in a future update, which essentially gets rid of anti-aliasing and reprojection for a cleaner image more in line with the technology seen in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fast_rmx">Fast RMX</a>.</p>
<p>Onto the more positive stuff, then. DF praises the frame rate across most of the game's performance modes, but understandably states that the 30fps ultra quality mode probably isn't worth it for most people. Although very minor frame rate hiccups were noticed, DF could not replicate them for the actual frame rate test in the video. Meanwhile, the basic quality mode uses real-time shadows over baked shadows, but it's noted that the difference between the two is pretty minor.</p>
<p>GameShare is also tested, and thanks to the streaming technology involved, the image quality for player two isn't quite up to par. This is understandable, and again, the fast-paced gameplay makes this much more obvious.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, DF heaps praise on the lighting effects in the game along with the actual design of the tracks themselves. Compared to Fast RMX, which used quite basic track designs with a few environmental assets added in here and there, Fast Fusion's tracks feel like they're part of a much bigger world, and this is quite the feat given just how few people are on the development team.</p>
<p>Pretty good stuff then! We absolutely loved the game too, and gave it a well-deserved score of 9/10 in our review. If you've not tried this one yet, then we highly recommend giving it a shot.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-and-battlefield-2042-headline-june-2025s-ps-plus-extra-and-premium-game-catalog-additions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>PlayStation has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/11/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-june-fbc-firebreak-battlefield-2042-five-nights-at-freddys-help-wanted-2-and-more/">announced</a> the nine games that are being added to the PS Plus Extra and Premium game catalogs for June 2025, with the two biggest titles being Battlefield 2042 and FBC: Firebreak, the latter of which is launching into the service on June 17, 2025.</p>
<p>Along with Battlefield 2042 and FBC: Firebreak, other notable titles PS Plus Extra and Premium subscribers can play beginning on June 17, 2025, include Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted 2, and We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie. PS Plus Premium subscribers will also be able to dive back into the world of Deus Ex, with Deus Ex: The Conspiracy being the lone addition to the PS Plus Premium Classic's Catalog for June 2025.</p>
<p>Here's the full list for all nine games that'll be available to subscribers on June 17:</p>
<ul>
<li>FBC: Firebreak (PS5)</li>
<li>Battlefield 2042 (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted 2 (PS5)</li>
<li>theHunter: Call of the Wilds (PS4)</li>
<li>We Love Katamari Reroll + Royal Reverie (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Eiyuden Chronicles: Hundred Heroes (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Train Sim World 5 (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Endless Dungeon (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Deus Ex: The Conspiracy (PS5, PS4) - <strong>PS Plus Premium subscribers only</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>While Battlefield 2042 and FBC: Firebreak are arguably the two major games added to the PS Plus Extra and Premium game catalogs this month, having Battlefield in this month's batch of games won't feel like much of anything for subscribers.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-march-2023-battlefield-2042-extra-premium-uncharted-ghostwire/">In March 2023,</a> Battlefield 2042 was the headlining game for the PS Plus Essential's tier three monthly games. Anyone who is subscribed to PS Plus at all, without needing to go to the higher tiers, likely already has Battlefield 2042 in their library of games they got through PlayStation Plus.</p>
<p>This also makes for two straight months of Battlefield games being added to the PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium game catalog, because<a href="https://wccftech.com/sandland-battlefield-v-and-stalker-legends-of-the-zone-trilogy-included-in-ps-plus-extra-and-premium-games-for-may-2025/"> May 2025's additions included Battlefield V</a>. Another game which had <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-may-2021-games-godfall-disco-elysium-battlefield-v/">previously been one of the three free games offered for Essential tier subscribers</a>, even before PlayStation officially switched to its new tiered PlayStation Plus structure.</p>
<p>At least FBC: Firebreak is an entirely new addition for subscribers to enjoy this month. <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-details-two-major-updates-coming-in-fbc-firebreaks-post-launch-roadmap/">Remedy also just detailed</a> what Firebreak players will be getting in two major free updates coming to the game post-launch.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warframe-to-get-isleweaver-update-on-june-25.1215768/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warframe-to-get-isleweaver-update-on-june-25/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Digital Extremes revealed that the next large Warframe update called Isleweaver will be released on all platforms on June 25.</p>
<p>Players who have completed the <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-1999-is-available-everywhere-today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warframe: 1999</a> quest 'The Hex' will have access to an expanded Kingdom of Duviri. They will face Major Rusalka once again in the emotionally turbulent Kingdom of Duviri, alongside new threats to this region such as The Murmur and the looming presence of The Indifference. Activities include collecting lore fragments to reveal narrative secrets, discovering the new island of Scholar’s Landing and unraveling the mystery behind Rusalka’s reign, before facing off against the latest Warframe, Oraxia, in a new mini-boss battle.</p>
<p>Moreover, Isleweaver introduces Operation: Eight Claw. Here, players partner with Dominus Thrax to earn exclusive event rewards by reclaiming Scholar’s Landing and Duviri’s throne from Major Rusalka and the Murmur in a new Clan Operation. Search the area for lore fragments to learn more about Rusalka's story and the current state of Duviri's kingdom. During Operation: Eight Claw, previous Clan Operation rewards will be available to earn again until Wednesday, 16 July.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warframe | Isleweaver Official Teaser - Coming in June!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TBsQROfuf0Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>All players will have access to Oraxia, the 61st Warframe, known as the mistress of fear. Oraxia can isolate and execute weakened foes, poison enemies, imbibe marked enemies for buffs and summon spiderling swarms like a good broodmother would from the corpses of the fallen. Two new weapons will be added to the Warframe arsenal alongside Oraxia: the Scyotid barb cluster throwing weapon and the Spinnerex poison whip.</p>
<p>There are also new Deluxe Cosmetics and TennoGen. Explore new facets of Citrine with the latest Deluxe Collection, including the Citrine Aphrodita Skin, the Corazon Syandana and other bejewelled cosmetics, all of which have been given a new look. Players can also take their Fashion Frame game to the next level and collect new TennoGen cosmetics to adorn their Warframes, weapons and operators with new, community-designed customisations when Isleweaver launches.</p>
<p>Digital Extremes also reiterated its commitment to refining Warframe's first impressions for new players this year with the launch of Isleweaver. A revamped onboarding tutorial has been introduced in one of the first quests, Vor's Prize, which modernizes the boss fight. Players may also experiment with a rework of Valkyr’s gameplay, which changes her ability kit to allow for a faster, more aggressive playstyle that caters to her melee-focused kit.</p>
<p>More announcements will be made during <a href="https://www.warframe.com/tennocon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TennoCon</a>, which will take place on July 18-19 in London, Ontario, Canada. It should be a special event, given that it's the tenth year of the fan-focused Warframe convention.</p>

            <p>A fresh report has shed a bit more light on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>'s famously difficult time in development, offering info on culture clashes between BioWare's different teams, and revealing that the game was re-written due to concerns about its banter being too snarky.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-11/inside-the-dragon-age-debacle-that-gutted-ea-s-bioware-studio">report</a>, from Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, goes through the whole sordid story of Veilguard's journey from in-the-works single player game, to in-the-works online thing, back to in-the-works single player thing, parts of which you're likely familiar with at this point. There's also a bunch of context as to how wider events across the studio and publisher EA influenced the game that ended up hitting shelves after a decade or so of development.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The new revelations tell how the tone of the game's dialogue, as well as the choices and consequences, had to be revamped following the switch from multiplayer back to single player in 2020.</p>
<p>Schreier emphasises that this shift didn't come with a full reset of the project, which meant developers had to work on something with lots of vestigial features intended for an entirely different type of game.</p>
<p>An alpha build at the end of 2022 flagged that testers believed Veilguard didn't have satisfying or meaty enough choices and consequences to live up to BioWare's previous works, another problem attributed to the game having been designed for multiplayer, according to the devs Schreier spoke to. Cue extra work to add in more choices, including an important choice between saving two cities, and a struggle to ensure these decisions played into the narrative further down the road.</p>
<p>The report also cites concerns about the reception to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/forspoken-patch-adjusts-frequency-and-content-of-banter-ahead-of-dlc-release">the dialogue</a> of Square Enix's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/forspoken">Forspoken</a> as having led to a rewrite for Veilguard's chatter. This was an attempt to drag it away from the "snarky tone" that'd been pencilled in as part of the multiplayer vision, and instead "make it sound more serious". Similarly, the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-very-first-dragon-age-the-veilguard-trailer-makes-it-look-like-a-fornite-heist-movie">June 2024 reveal trailer</a> reportedly raised concerns about EA's ability to market the game in a way that didn't feel a bit Fortnitey.</p>
<p>There's also plenty of detail regarding "internal friction" between <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> tream that were originally working on the game and the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> team EA drafted in for the project's final push around 2023, with cultural differences between the two teams adding to what sounds like it was already a pretty unpleasant mix of pressuresand forces at play.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of Veilguard and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-call-a-job-cut-a-job-cut">layoffs at BioWare</a> that followed its release, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-quietly-lay-off-key-dragon-age-team-members-while-talking-up-the-next-mass-effect">smaller team's left beavering away</a> on on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a>, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-never-grasped-dragon-ages-value-as-an-rpg-says-inquisition-writer">plenty of questions</a> still hanging over the RPG studio's future. It's a sad state of affairs to put it mildly, especially given that while it definitely isn't everyone's cup of tea - I found what I played to be decent fun and you can read <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Nic's verdict here</a> - the version of Veilguard we got was far from a complete trainwreck.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You can’t murder, and the studio said they’d never include such a mechanic. But there are workarounds if you’re feeling nefarious.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195410" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: July 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="169" data-playlist="195410,196299,196903" data-current="195410"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: July 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20876.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h973344"><a id="1"></a>How to kill a Zoi</h2><figure id="" data-id="4a27a314645da7e453ff1e4784879ce5" data-recommend-id="image://4a27a314645da7e453ff1e4784879ce5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two cars on the street in inZOI." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two cars on the street in inZOI." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Krafton</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4a27a314645da7e453ff1e4784879ce5" data-recommend-id="image://4a27a314645da7e453ff1e4784879ce5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two cars on the street in inZOI." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>The easiest way in <em>inZoi </em>to kill another Zoi is to create a second character, add them to your family, and then position them so very precariously in the middle of the street</strong>.

How could I hate on such a precious, friendly little Koopa as he? But you don’t have to play <em>Mario Kart World</em> for long to realize somebody must have pissed in his Cheerios this time around—he is more aggressive than ever, hauling players back onto the race track whenever they put the slightest toe out of line. </p><p>Ram into a barrier along the side of a course? Bam, you’re getting Lakitu’d. Try to cut corners and drive through an open field? There’s a 50/50 chance he’ll be on your ass before you even realize you’re not allowed to go that way. Want to relive that classic shortcut from Mario Circuit 4 dating back to the days of the SNES by hopping that green barrier at the second-to-last bend before the finish line? Get fucked. </p><p>I thought I was alone, but nope, Lakitu is ruining everyone else’s fun too. It’s ironic too, considering <em>Mario Kart World </em>features the series’ most complex and open courses yet, each existing on a full map in which you can drive between the tracks. For a sequel where exploring off the beaten path and grinding on every surface you can find is core to its ethos, <em>Mario Kart World</em> really doesn’t want you living your best, improvised life a lot of the time. It’s especially annoying since Lakitu takes your items and an extra <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-coin-farming-tips-vehicles-unlock-1851784093&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-coin-farming-tips-vehicles-unlock-1851784093">three coins every time he grabs you</a></span>. </p><p> “Lakitu is a bastard in this game,” wrote SkeletronDOTA on the subreddit. “One time I just drifted slightly wide with a golden shroom and he put me back on the track, and took my golden shroom and bullet with him.” User Chrop responded, “Lakitu seems extremely strict in this game, was playing on Boo Cinema and I flew slightly to the right on the glider section and said no. I was fully able to get back on the track but he didn’t like that I flew a little too far away.”</p><p>It’s not all bad. Lakitu won’t mess with you in Free Roam mode where you can complete the Mario Circuit feather jump shortcut in peace, and there are definitely times where his quick interventions are appreciated. For instance, say, if you <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1l7f75b/uhh_excuse_me/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1l7f75b/uhh_excuse_me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">start randomly falling</a></span> through the map.

Still, he could use way more overall chill. Maybe <em>Mario Kart World</em>’s next patch will dial him back a bit. For now, Lakitu is way overtuned. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Build A Rocket Boy said this fix will be the first of a series of updates for MindsEye. Future updates will be aimed at "enhancing your experience," the developer said, promising to keep us up to date with information on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Patches will need to have the internet to load, the team reminded players, asking them to "please ensure [the] game is updated regularly to enjoy the benefits of the latest improvements".</p>
<p>The studio additionally added that Build.MindsEye - that is to say, the game's creation platform designed to help creators share interactive experiences - is now "fully accessible" for those on Steam.</p>
<p>"Thank you again for your incredible support. This is just the start of a long-term vision to make MindsEye the best possible game for you," the team closed.</p>

            <p>Epic Games has announced publicly it has filed a lawsuit against an individual it alleges has developed and sold cheats for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>.</p>
<p>This latest venture in Epic Game's ongoing war against those who create, sell, and use cheats was announced via <a href="https://x.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1932485822445666348">the company's own Twitter account</a>. There, the company posted:</p>
<p>"We filed a new lawsuit against an individual who developed and sold cheating software that helped players see through walls and auto aim. We're also going after people who helped sell this software. Creating and selling software to help others cheat is against the rules and we'll keep fighting to keep it out of Fortnite."</p>

<figcaption>A new Fortnite season was revealed recently. Check it out!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_zzh-g2a4M" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/606086/epic-games-sues-fortnite-cheat-maker">According to Polygon</a>, the lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the eastern district of North Carolina where the company is headquartered. It alleges Ediz Atas, also known as  Sincey Cheats and Vanta Chearts, has been making and selling cheats since "at least January 2023".</p>
<p>Epic alleges in the lawsuit that after DMCA takedowns were issued to YouTube videos featuring these cheats, "Sincey Cheats sent multiple emails to YouTube's designated copyright agent impersonating an Epic employee and falsely claiming that Epic wanted to 'formally reverse [its] claim of copyright infringement'" by using fake Epic Games email addresses.
</p>
<p>Epic also claims its has issued tens of thousands of bans against Fortnite accounts that used cheats from Sincey Cheats since 2022, including over 15,000 bans on US-based Fortnite accounts.
</p>
<p>The lawsuit is also asking for compensation for damages from five unnamed individuals who distributed these cheats over platforms like Discord and Telegram. The amount is unknown.</p>
<p>In case you didn't know, Epic Games has proven especially litigious when it comes to Fortnite cheaters.  In 2022 Epic <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-cheater-forced-to-pay-up-after-epic-lawsuit-damages-will-go-to-charity">forced a cheat creator to pay up in Australian court following a legal victory</a>, donating the winnings to charity.</p>

<p>The company is not alone in its struggle against cheats. Activision has also been fighting against cheats, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-wins-113m-in-lawsuit-against-call-of-duty-cheat-maker">winning £11.3m in court against a Call of Duty cheat maker</a>. Bungie has been in those trenches too, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-wins-44m-lawsuit-against-destiny-cheat-seller-aimjunkies">winning a $4.4m lawsuit against Destiny cheat seller Aimjunkies</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The moon has always been a spot of interest and wonder that humankind has dreamed about reaching and finally setting foot on, if briefly. Establishing moon bases and creating a permanent foothold on the barren landscape is something that humanity still has not completely mastered in this day and age. In science fiction, when you leave Earth and set up a colony elsewhere, there’s probably a good reason for leaving God’s green Earth. In <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-new-trailer-provides-new-look-at-gameplay-confirms-2026-release-window/">PRAGMATA</a>, the journey is about doing the exact opposite: escaping the confines of the lunar stations and returning to Earth, not just by yourself but with a young girl/android named Diana along with you.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/pragmata/en-us/">PRAGMATA</a> is much more than an escort mission. While the playable astronaut controls all of the movement and offensive capabilities, the young Diana riding piggyback along the way has some serious hacking prowess. As players dodge and shoot their way through autonomous death machines and androids, Diana can simultaneously hack through the enemy’s defenses. On paper, this sounds arduous with having to juggle between moving on one analog stick, aiming with another, firing with the shoulder buttons, and trying to navigate through a hacking minigame with Diana on the face buttons. In practice, it all flows very intuitively. The actual hacking minigame is about moving through a grid, bypassing traps, collecting nodes, and targeting the enemy core. In practice, the earlier hacking segments only took a second or two to move your little avatar around and collect the requisite nodes in order to disable the enemy shields.</p>
<p>There is a few weapons at the player’s disposal in PRAGMATA early on, each having its own mechanics and capabilities beyond just shooting and dealing damage. The player’s signature pistol has infinite ammo and takes time to recharge, while other weapons picked up off the ground might only have a clip or two before they’re discarded and replaced with something else. There’s a variety of energy weapons, and I leaned more into the energy shotgun type when it came to blasting my way through the brief demo.</p>
<p>It’s not all linear hallways and shooting gallery corridors in PRAGMATA. The player astronaut can jump and glide about briefly to reach far-off platforms, or shoot security locks and open up new elevators to help traverse the lunar station. Taking a step off the beaten path rewards the players with fresh weapons and even permanently increases the number of healing items they can carry at a given time.</p>
<p><iframe title="PRAGMATA - First Contact Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Idx9z6ke3tc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>PRAGMATA’s demo only ran about fifteen minutes or so after getting an initial introduction to the setting and reintroduction to a game that Capcom has revealed and talked about only briefly since the initial reveal <a href="https://youtu.be/xoxCboik0Is">five years ago today</a>. During my entire session, I kept getting these uncanny Lost Planet vibes through the gunplay and overall technology used in the construction of the world. However, I’m sure this is just a personal take on the world of PRAGMATA.</p>
<p>There’s still some time to go before this adventure is ready for players’ hands as PRAGMATA will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC sometime in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-ceo-lars-wingefors-steps-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Embracer Group has announced that its CEO Lars Wingefors will step down later this year, with current deputy CEO Phil Rogers set to take on the role when Wingefors departs.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/lars-wingefors-proposed-to-be-elected-as-executive-chair-of-the-board-of-embracer-phil-rogers-appointed-new-ceo/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on its official website, Embracer says that Wingefors' departure and Rogers' appointment are both part of the "transformation process", which will see Embracer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-splitting-three-companies" rel="nofollow">becoming three separate entities</a> in charge of different aspects of the current company structure later this year.</p>

<p>That ongoing process also saw Embracer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-fellowship-entertainment-coffee-stain" rel="nofollow">renaming itself to Fellowship Entertainment</a> last month, with current subsidiary Coffee Stain also due to spin off into its own entity sometime later this year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/satisfactory-coffee-stain-embracer-group_0.jpg?itok=l--LqEHi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/satisfactory-coffee-stain-embracer-group_0.jpg?itok=-mrteLVK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Coffee Stain, publisher of games like&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory</em>, will spin off from parent Embracer Group later this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Wingefors says that while Embracer's "road has&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-financials-q2-2024" rel="nofollow">not always been straight</a>", he's "incredibly proud" of the company's achievements under his direction. He then says his move away from the CEO position will allow him to focus on "strategic initiatives, M&amp;A, and capital allocation", which I can't imagine was his response when asked what he wanted to be as a child.</p>

<p>Despite his departure, Wingefors won't be completely absent from Embracer (or Fellowship Entertainment, as it will be known by the end of the 2025 calendar year). He'll take the position of the board's executive chairman, with current chair Kicki Wallje-Lund moving to the deputy chair role.</p>

<p>Changes in Embracer's management come after a fairly turbulent time for the company. As part of a company-wide restructuring effort, Embracer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-has-laid-off-8-of-its-employees-and-it-isnt-done-yet-despite-record-quarter" rel="nofollow">laid off hundreds of employees</a> last year, additionally closing studios like&nbsp;<em>Saints Row&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Agents of Mayhem&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-shuts-down-saints-row-developer-volition" rel="nofollow">Volition</a>.</p>

<p>Despite this, Embracer has enjoyed a couple of recent successes, most notably Warhorse Studios'&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">managed to sell three million copies</a> in its first three months on sale.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-embracer-group-lars.jpg?itok=RUhwzc2p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-embracer-group-lars.jpg?itok=vddaszHx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Medieval RPG&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>was one of Embracer Group's recent successes.</figcaption></figure><p>It remains to be seen whether Wingefors' stepping down will materially affect Embracer's (or Fellowship's) operations.

In 2020, BioWare pivoted back to the single-player RPG that would eventually launch on Halloween 2024, but according to <em>Bloomberg</em>’s story, the developer was forced by EA to restructure the live-service version of the game into a single-player, story-driven RPG, rather than being able to go back to the drawing board and start fresh.</p><p><em>Bloomberg </em>says that early playtesters lamented a lack of distinct choices and consequences in earlier builds, and this led to the late implementation of key moments like choosing between <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-save-minrathous-treviso-choice-1851686168&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-save-minrathous-treviso-choice-1851686168">saving either Minrathous or Treviso</a></span> from a dragon attack, leading to the other metropolis being overtaken by the Darkspawn’s blight for the remainder of the game. Another collection of substantial and consequential choices appeared in<em> The Veilguard</em>’s finale, where the player’s decisions can possibly result in the deaths of their entire party. Apparently, this segment came after BioWare brought in the studio’s <em>Mass Effect </em>team to help get the game across the finish line, which resulted in an “overhaul” of the game’s final missions.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em>As the Mass Effect directors took control, they scoffed that the Dragon Age squad had been doing a shoddy job and began excluding their leaders from pivotal meetings, according to people familiar with the internal friction. Over time, the Mass Effect team went on to overhaul parts of the game and design a number of additional scenes, including a rich, emotional finale that players loved. But even changes that appeared to improve the game stoked the simmering rancor inside BioWare, infuriating Dragon Age leaders who had been told they didn’t have the budget for such big, ambitious swings.</em></p></blockquote><p>This aligns with previous reporting and statements from BioWare veterans, who have stated that the <em>Dragon</em> <em>Age</em> and <em>Mass Effect</em> teams <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-mass-effect-bioware-david-gaider-anthem-1851776055&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-mass-effect-bioware-david-gaider-anthem-1851776055">had a tense relationship,</a></span> and the fantasy team felt it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-anthem-mark-darrah-youtube-bioware-1851779569&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-anthem-mark-darrah-youtube-bioware-1851779569">didn’t receive the same level of support</a></span> as the sci-fi team from BioWare and EA leadership.

                <p dir="ltr">The next game from Stardew Valley creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone will boast a larger world than the one in his farming simulator. But you don't have to take our word for it; Barone himself made this specific comparison for Haunted Chocolatier.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1932705089283895458" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">On X</a>, Barone stated that: "The world of Haunted Chocolatier is larger than Stardew Valley." He would know, since in December, Barone noted he was creating Haunted Chocolatier similar to Stardew Valley. "I'm coding it (mostly from scratch) in C#, and I'm working solo in all areas," Barone said after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-reconfirms-next-task-is-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6528253/">reconfirming he resumed development on Haunted Chocolatier</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1932705089283895458" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The world of haunted chocolatier is larger than stardew valley</p>  — ConcernedApe (@ConcernedApe) <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1932705089283895458?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 11, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">It seems like Barone is slowly but surely opening up more about his next game. Last month, the developer discussed how he wanted to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-wants-to-focus-on-mystery-whimsy-in-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6531252/">focus on mystery and whimsy with Haunted Chocolatier</a>. Barone sounds like he wants players to "let go of your desire to engineer the perfect chocolate" and instead just follow their intuition.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-announces-new-game-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6497292/">Haunted Chocolatier was announced</a> in late 2021 and will see players taking over a chocolate factory. There is no release window for the RPG, with Barone saying earlier this year that he hopes it comes out in the next five years. That would take us through the rest of this decade. Afterward, Barone <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-might-eventually-make-a-stardew-valley-2/1100-6531402/">"might eventually make a Stardew Valley 2."</a></p>

			<p>The yet-to-be-announced PlayStation handheld will feature AI upscaling, and some of its specs will address the lower memory bandwidth compared to the base PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Speaking on the NeoGAF forums, well-known AMD leaker KeplerL2 revealed some additional information about the handheld that's been rumored to be in the works for a while, revealing that the AMD APU that will power the system will be the only one from the company to have <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/rog-xbox-ally-and-rog-xbox-ally-x-announced-coming-this-holiday-2025.1685066/page-5#post-270507134" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI upscaling</a> in the near future. The leaker also added that the handheld will come with <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-5-leak-reveals-new-%E2%80%98low-power%E2%80%99-mode-fueling-handheld-console-reports.1684992/#post-270498839">16 GB LPDDR5X RAM</a> despite launching in a few years, as LPDDR6 is still away, and that it will have <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-5-leak-reveals-new-%E2%80%98low-power%E2%80%99-mode-fueling-handheld-console-reports.1684992/#post-270498604" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1/3 of the base PlayStation 5 memory bandwidth</a>, although with more cache and improved memory compression. Clarifying the cache the system will feature, the leaker <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-5-leak-reveals-new-%E2%80%98low-power%E2%80%99-mode-fueling-handheld-console-reports.1684992/#post-270498917" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> it will come with 4MB of L2 cache and 16 MB of MALL cache, which the current generation systems don't have. Regarding the architecture of the PlayStation handheld, KeplerL2 reiterated that both the handheld and the PlayStation 6 will be based on a fork of the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-5-leak-reveals-new-%E2%80%98low-power%E2%80%99-mode-fueling-handheld-console-reports.1684992/#post-270498940" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gfx13 (RDNA5/UDNA) architecture.</a></p>
<p>While the PlayStation handheld has been rumored to be in the works for a while, Sony has provided no indication that such a system exists. Still, last week, it was revealed that the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro will soon get a&nbsp;<span><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-low-energy-mode-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">low energy mode</a> that will reduce performance to save power, which is believed to be a performance profile for this yet-to-be-detected handheld, so it seems increasingly</span>&nbsp;likely that a handheld system is indeed in development.</p>
<p>While Sony has yet to confirm if the PlayStation handheld is indeed in the works, Microsoft made part of its plans for the handheld market clear during this year's Xbox Game Showcase with the announcement of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/">ROG Xbox Ally</a>, a handheld gaming PC coming in a clear Xbox flavor. The company was reportedly also working on a full-blown handheld system, but plans were reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-plans-reportedly-on-standby/">halted</a> to focus on improving the Windows 11 handheld gaming performance, which is lagging behind the performance offered by SteamOS.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/685296/capcom-summer-game-fest-resident-evil-requiem-pragmata</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom%E2%80%99s-lineup-at-summer-game-fest-was-a-mix-of-bold-and-boring.1215636/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/685296/capcom-summer-game-fest-resident-evil-requiem-pragmata<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Capcom had an interesting showing at Summer Game Fest with three titles that will carry the developer into 2026 and beyond: <em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>, <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, and <em>Pragmata</em>. I got hands-on previews with both <em>Requiem</em> and <em>Pragmata</em>, and a hands-off presentation for <em>Onimusha</em>. Across the three games, I saw a mix of fresh ideas with <em>Onimusha</em>, some stale ones with <em>Requiem</em>, and some weird but interesting choices with <em>Pragmata</em>. </p><p>Of the three games, <em>Pragmata</em> represented the biggest tension between what I liked about it and what I didn’t. In the game, you play as Hugh, an astronaut stranded on the moon who is aided by a small, child-like robot named Diana. To be frank, I’m utterly exhausted by the trope of a big, gruff dude protecting a small, innocent child. Enough! It’s 2025, we have plenty of dad games at home, Capcom, there has to be a more interesting way to do this.</p><p>That said, I was impressed by <em>Pragmata</em>’s combat. What I thought was a straightforward shooter was still mostly that but with a complexity that dramatically changes the calculus of how you fight. Enemies in <em>Pragmata</em> are shielded and take little damage from Hugh’s weapons. To fight effectively, you must use Diana’s hacking skills, represented via a minigame that’s basically a stripped-down version of <a href="https://youtu.be/u7UKP3QN4HA?si=V_ZBIUAMYbpEODfw">the hacking minigame from <em>Bioshock</em></a>. </p><p>What’s most interesting about this is that it all must be done mid-combat. Time doesn’t stop as you’re building a circuit to the end goal in order to stun your enemy. It meant I had to juggle hacking effectively with dodging enemy attacks in a way that felt fresh and exciting for what I thought would be a simple action shooter. I just wish they had applied that innovation to some of the game’s narrative elements.</p><p>For <em>Onimusha</em>, Capcom revived a long-dormant series in a big way, first with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/606269/you-know">a remaster of <em>Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny</em></a> and now with this <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320142/onimusha-is-back-and-very-bloody">new entry</a>, the first in almost 20 years. During the hands-off presentation, all I could think was, “This is Capcom’s take on a soulslike.” Some of that is in the aesthetics. The world is dark, overrun by grotesque-looking demons who brutally cut down fleeing peasants before turning their swords on Musashi, the protagonist. In other ways, it’s the combat. Enemies have stagger bars you deplete through deflecting and parrying attacks. In boss fights, as you slowly wear down your enemy, you can choose which part of the boss to damage to produce a certain effect. I did not get to play <em>Onimusha</em> myself, but I’m intrigued to see if any more soulslike elements are embedded within the game.</p><p>Finally,<em> Requiem </em>stole the Summer Game Fest show as Geoff Keighley closed the keynote event with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/681325/resident-evil-requiem-trailer-date">surprise reveal of the game</a> and its February 2026 release date, after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/682006/and-the-award-for-biggest-tease-of-the-night-goes-to">previously teasing that we wouldn’t see it for a while</a>. Later during Play Days, Summer Game Fest’s in-person media event, I was treated to a short gameplay presentation and demo that offered a brief glimpse into the harrowing experience of Grace Ashcroft as she tries to escape an abandoned hospital. </p><p>During the gameplay presentation, Capcom emphasized that Grace would have to rely on her wits to survive rather than any kind of training as a soldier or law enforcement like the Leons, Adas, or the Chrises of that T-virus infected world. I liked that approach and how it was reflected in both the presentation and the demo. Since Grace had no weapons to protect herself, I had to find clues in the environment that would help me survive. That meant paying attention to my surroundings and reading everything I could find, landing on the one tip that got me through my time with the demo.</p><p>On the other hand, my brief look at <em>Requiem</em> felt like Capcom was tapping into old routines instead of doing something truly innovative for the ninth mainline entry in the <em>Resident Evil</em> series. Yes, the big monster lady was scary, and that delicious tension was heightened by the fact that I had no guns to shoot my way out in case my wits failed me. But there are only so many times I can be chased through hallways by a slowly plodding monster before it gets to be old hat. I’ve seen that not just in other <em>Resident Evil </em>games but in horror games in general, and I’m bored by it.</p><p>I understand that I’ve only seen the tiniest sliver of what the full game represents, but I hope when <em>Requiem</em> comes out in February next year that I see more new ideas than old ones. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A group of prominent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> modders will be livestreaming the creation of a big mod over a single weekend later this month. It's part of a charity drive led by voice actor Wes Johnson, probably most famous for providing the dulcet tones of mad Daedric prince Sheogorath in Oblivion and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>.</p>
<p>The gang - led by Kinggath and the team behind the popular <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21872">Sim Settlements mod</a> - will be letting viewers decide the specifics of the mod via a stream this weekend, with the actual mod creation streams then taking place on Twitch across June 28th and 29th.</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/simsettlements/status/1932626360859820127">The modathon</a> is part of this year's edition of Voiceapalooza, an annual charity drive in aid of the American <a href="https://www.alz.org/">Alzheimer's Association</a> that sees Johnson and community-run charity initiative <a href="https://falloutforhope.com/">Fallout For Hope</a> organise a bunch of streams to raise funds for the cause.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-4-mod-sheogorath-actor-charity-2024">Last year</a>, this time-limited modding element of it saw a similar group of modders create a Fallout 4 questline called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/84389">Shady Motives</a>, raising over $30,000 in the process. In addition to a story starring Johnson, who's also voiced the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a>'s Fawkes and Oblivion's Lucien Lachance, that mod included a player home, custom weapons and armour, and a fully-voiced companion.</p>
<p>So, basically a mini-DLC worth of stuff that was then uploaded to Nexus Mods and <a href="https://mods.bethesda.net/en/fallout4/mod-detail/4364063">Bethesda.net</a> once any kinks were ironed out for anyone on PC or Xbox to give a go. This year looks like it'll produce a fresh mod of a similar size and scope, with modders Kinggath, Elianora, Neeher, Jazzhands, Otellino, Sagittaurus, Niero, Erika Ember Studios, Veta Phoenix, and greenFoxel all set to stream themselves creating and working on different aspects of it.</p>
<p>Interesting to check out if you've ever been curious about how the modding sausage is made, or you can just keep an eye out for the mod going live once it's done. There's also a stream on Kinggath's Twitch that'll see watchers vote to decide the details of the mod that the group'll be building - that takes place this Saturday, June 14th, kicking off at </p>
