			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/blade-soul-neo-a-remaster-of-the-classic-mmorpg-is-coming-soon-to-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blade &amp; Soul NEO</a>&nbsp;<span>will be released on February 25, and we were recently given the opportunity to interview NC America's Andrew Long, Senior Producer, and Andrew Gant, Community Manager, about the upcoming release and what players can expect from the MMORPG&nbsp;Blade &amp; Soul Live will </span>continue to exist at the same time, with updates being released for that title alongside this new and improved version of the game.</p>
<p>Before the interview, I was given an exclusive look at the game in a presentation. This presentation showed off the expansive customization available, where you can tweak characters in any way you can imagine to make them fully yours.</p>
<p>When the game launches, it will be launching with seven of the 14 classes that are currently available in Blade &amp; Soul Live. As you explore the game, there will be many different outfits that you can collect to keep your character fashionable while facing off against bosses or other players in PvP. Additionally, those who purchase the exclusive <a href="https://www.bladeandsoul.com/en-us/news/article/14645/bns-neo-news" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pre-order bundles</a> will also get some special outfits and cosmetics. The graphics are revamped, giving the game a fresh coat of paint. As the developers stated, the story will be the beloved Blade &amp; Soul story that you know and love, with some extra improvements made along the way.</p>
<p>In the interview, I made sure to ask some of the burning questions that the dedicated community had, as well as get some answers to questions of my own.</p>
<p><strong>What went into the decision to remake Blade &amp; Soul now rather than earlier or later?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Long:</strong> A lot of us have this nostalgia where we feel like when the game launched in our time frame, it was the best it's ever been, and so, we really wanted to relive that experience and address it with new audiences, there's a whole new generation of people who weren't even born yet, or old enough to play video games at the time Blade &amp; Soul launched. We want to have that interaction between the old and the new, playing all together in that experience.</p>
<p>Blade &amp; Soul NEO is adding a lot of features to make the game friendlier for new audiences, including the addition of infinite Windwalking. Prior to this, you had an allotted amount of Windwalking that you could do before you ran out of stamina. Now, you can Windwalk as much as you like, which will allow you to scale new buildings, take pictures in new locations that you would have never been able to reach in the previous version of the game, and much more.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/bs_neo_character_creation.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>Will there be ranked systems for PvP or PvE?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Long:</strong> When our 6v6 battlegrounds come out, we'll have the awards attached to those. At the time of launch, there's not going to be any of those systems in the game. But, the battleground 6v6 arena does come very quickly after the launch. We want to monitor how people are going to take the launch, and we're going to enjoy that content, and when we see people getting towards the end of it, we have that content ready to go.</p>
<p><strong>Are there plans to add new classes that didn't exist in the original?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Long:</strong> As far as classes go, in Live we're up to 14 classes. We want to introduce those into NEO as well. We don't have a timeline exactly... As far as new classes, it's something we're going to look into; I don't have anything to share at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be any stories or expansions added to NEO that won't be added to Live and vice versa?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Long:</strong> I don't want to spoil anything, but that is definitely something we want to do.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/bs_neo_boss_battle.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>What is your favorite part of NEO compared to Live?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Gant:</strong> It comes down to what kind of MMO gamer you are, I love adventure and exploration. I'll probably be gobbling up the infinite Windwalking and exploring every single section of the map, looking for hidden places, and probably trying to get my friends to climb a building that you've never been able to get to the top of just to take pictures. I love the new aspects and exploration journal that we've added, these little hidden unlockables that you can find from exploring the world.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Long:</strong> I'm really excited, we've changed how the gear drops in Blade &amp; Soul NEO. In Live, you get all of your weapons and accessories at a base level, and the base level is all the same. You go through a zero to 20 upgrade system, and it's very harsh. I'm not a big fan of that system, personally. What we've done in NEO is more of a traditional style. We've really upped the drop rates of thing,s and the secondary stats are going to be randomized. You're going to be able to get a lot more gear... I'm really excited that I'm not going to have to run a dungeon a thousand times before I even see a piece of gear that is what I want.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be any plans for controller compatibility down the line?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Long:</strong> Currently, we don't have controller compatibility at the moment. We are going to be looking at other platforms, whether it's going to be console or Steam. We're definitely looking at that right now. At the time of launch, we will not have controller support available.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR support?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Gant:</strong> I know we have DLSS available, but I'm not sure about the other. There are an incredible amount of customizations you can do so that your machine can run NEO just fine. The recommended specifications are very similar, if not the same, as the ones for Blade &amp; Soul Live.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>
<p>The team behind Blade &amp; Soul NEO has a lot planned to ensure that the game is friendly and accessible to new audiences. This includes completely optional PvP, gathering systems, and plenty of gear to unlock. The story will be authentically Blade &amp; Soul, with the improved visuals bringing a fresh lick of paint to a game that is beloved by its community. Blade &amp; Soul NEO will be available for <a href="https://www.bladeandsoul.com/en-us/neo/trailer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free on PC</a> on February 25 in North America and Europe.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-record-breaking-financials-2024</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pubg-studio-krafton-reports-record-breaking-sales-and-profits-in-2024.1105965/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-record-breaking-financials-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>PUBG: Battlegrounds&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton has released its financial statement for the 2024 fiscal year, and the company has reported "record-breaking" sales and profits.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Krafton's sales grew by 41.8% in 2024 when compared to the previous year, while its profits grew by a staggering 54%. Both of these figures were, Krafton says, "driven by the continued expansion and sustainability of the&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>IP".</p>

<p>The figures mean that Krafton's average annual sales growth rate for the past five years stands at 20%, which isn't too shabby at all. I'm sure the studio will be happy with these numbers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/krafton-financials-2024-pubg.jpg?itok=EiCaq-fE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/krafton-financials-2024-pubg.jpg?itok=HTOeUEbU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>IP has driven a year of record-breaking highs for Krafton in financial terms.</figcaption></figure><p>Krafton also reported its numbers for the year's fourth quarter along with the full twelve-month span, and that quarter also brought growth for the company, with sales rising 15.5% and profit rising 31.1% year-on-year.</p>

<p>According to Krafton,&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>'s transition to a free-to-play model, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-player-count-doubles-on-steam-after-free-to-play-launch" rel="nofollow">took place in late 2021</a>, "has continued to drive growth", along with the IP's various successful collaborations. As a reminder, those collaborations have historically included the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-pubg-crossover-starbreeze-krafton" rel="nofollow">Payday</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-crossover-adds-dead-by-daylight-for-spooky-frights" rel="nofollow"><em>Dead by Daylight</em></a>, among many others.</p>

<p>With regards to its future, Krafton says it wants to make "significant investments in securing a 'Big Franchise IP'", although it's not clear whether that means the company wants to acquire a new property or transform its&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>IP into a "Big Franchise".</p>

<p>The company's slate of games for this year includes the likes of survival sequel&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-early-access-2025-co-op" rel="nofollow">Subnautica 2</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Sims&nbsp;</em>competitor&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inzoi-release-date-delayed" rel="nofollow"><em>inZoi</em></a>, as well as the global launch of&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker Mobile&nbsp;</em>and multiplayer life sim&nbsp;<em>Dinkum Together</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/krafton-financials-2024-inzoi.jpg?itok=q6pFkDiy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/krafton-financials-2024-inzoi.jpg?itok=RR-wQmRH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Krafton's upcoming slate includes&nbsp;<em>inZoi</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>and more.</figcaption></figure><p>It's been an eventful year for Krafton, to say the least. Not only does the company have a packed slate of upcoming games, but it also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-acquires-tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-ip-with-plans-for-future-expansion" rel="nofollow">acquired Tango Gameworks</a> and the rights to the&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>IP after Microsoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="nofollow">turned its back on the studio</a>.</p>

<p>Krafton is also planning to develop a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton" rel="nofollow">mobile version of global smash hit&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em></a>, although we don't have a release window for that yet. Hopefully, that won't have the rather <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi" rel="nofollow">nightmarish-sounding AI-generated player characters</a> the studio is currently going all-in on.</p>

While <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, the follow-up to <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, and <em>Death Stranding 2</em> are both due for release later in the year, questions remain about the state of multiplayer shooter <em>Fairgame$</em> and other Sony projects like Insomniac Games’ <em>Wolverine</em>. </p><p>It’s also possible that this week’s State of Play could include the announcement of a <em>God of War</em> anthology that brings the older PS2 and PS3 games to the PS5. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1imtu2l/ufeelingexamination6_who_leaked_hell_is_us/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1imtu2l/ufeelingexamination6_who_leaked_hell_is_us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit user Feeling-Examination6</a></span>, who previously leaked the existence of <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, has added to the mounting pile of rumors that the <em>God of War </em>Greek saga is getting a modern re-release. Currently, of the games that preceded 2018's relaunch of the franchise, only <em>God of War III</em> has a version playable on PS5. </p><p>What’s less clear is which other games this rumored collection would feature. In addition to the numbered entries, there’s also <em>Chains of Olympus</em> and <em>Ghost of Sparta </em>for the PSP, as well as <em>God of War: Ascension</em>, the final game before the series went dark until 2018 brought the franchise into Norse mythology. What seems more certain is that if these games really are getting modern ports, they’ll likely  end up on PC as well at some point. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The long-anticipated latest entry in the strategy series went live for Deluxe Edition owners last week and complaints about the game feeling “unfinished” immediately started pouring in.

<p>Split Fiction is the spiritual successor to It Takes Two, and people are hyped. Hazelight Studios has cracked the co-op formula, and Split Fiction’s release can’t come soon enough for those seeking a tandem adventure.</p>



<p>I constantly advocate gaming needing more co-op games. The genre isn’t as dead as people think it is has plenty of titles supporting local and online co-op. You need to check the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/7-major-co-op-games-coming-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biggest co-op games coming in 2025</a> to see this. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-revealed-at-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a> is likely to be the standard-bearer for the genre moving forward.</p>



<p>Director Josef Fares looks to keep the art of co-op alive and further the genre wherever possible.</p>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction-release-date">Split Fiction Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The dynamic duo. Credit to Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Hazelight Studios is launching Split Fiction on March 6.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-winner-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2024</a> hosted an incredible ceremony celebrating all things gaming. Amongst the awards were a large volume of game announcements and trailers. Hazelight Studios director Josef Fares announced the much-anticipated follow-up to It Takes Two—<a href="https://www.ea.com/games/split-fiction/split-fiction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Split Fiction</a>.</p>



<p>It doesn’t have any Early Access or ways to sample the action early. You and I have to wait patiently until March 6 to see what new ideas and innovations come up.</p>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction-platforms">Split Fiction Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>It’s a pure next-gen launch for Split Fiction debuting on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC.</strong></p>



<p>I’m shocked Split Fiction is skipping last-gen formats, to be honest. It Takes Two launched on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC at launch—offering a Switch port one year later.</p>



<p>Whereas Split Fiction is sticking to the most recent generation, and that’s it. I’d argue a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-watch-nintendo-switch-2-direct-reveal-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a> release could happen in the future. Nintendo’s newest console is rumored to be a lot more powerful, so don’t be surprised if the Switch 2 eventually gives Split Fiction a new lease of life.</p>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction-editions-amp-price">Split Fiction Editions &amp; Price</h2>



<p><strong>Split Fiction has an established recommended retail price of $49.99 or £39.99 for the Standard Editon—the only version of Split Fiction.</strong></p>



<p>Physical and digital editions of Split Fiction exist. An interesting note is the Standard Edition is the <strong>only way to play Split Fiction</strong>. There is no Deluxe Edition, Unbelievable Mega Ultra Deluxe Edition, or a Collector’s Edition. This is good news for players unwilling or unable to splash out on constant expensive upgrades.</p>



<hr>



<p>I’ve a huge fan of Hazelight Studios from the A Way Out days. How much are you looking forward to Split Fiction? Does EA have another bonafide success on its hands?</p>



<p>Check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction gameplay</a> to wet your whistle in the meantime.</p>

            <p>Fallout made its bright and bloody TV debut last year, with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-review">critically-acclaimed first season</a> which not only drew in viewers but also led to droves of players venturing into one or many of Fallout's video game wastelands.

<p>It came as no surprise, then, when the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">Amazon series was picked up for a second season</a>, with showrunners Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner later stating the team was "going to be pedal to the metal to get season two out as fast as humanly possible".</p>
<p>And now, Fallout's Ghoul Walton Goggins has provided us all with a little update on the upcoming season, promising that while season one was certainly good, the next one is going to be even better.</p>

<p>"We're in the middle of filming it right now, we've been at it since November, and I can tell you that I thought Season one was extraordinary, personally, I was very pleased with it," Goggins said to Deadline when asked about Fallout's second season.</p>
<p>"This blows it out of the water, what these writers have done and the artisans that have come together to tell this story. It's really gonna be something. I can't wait for people to see it.</p>
<p>"We're working really hard to make that happen."</p> <div>

			<p>As rumored in the past few days, PlayStation State of Play will return this week to provide new information on games coming to PS5 in the future.</p>
<p>As confirmed on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/11/state-of-play-returns-tomorrow-february-12/">Official PlayStation Blog</a>, the 40-plus-minute show that will celebrate <em>"a creative and unique selection of exciting games from studios around the world"</em> will begin on February 12th at 2pm PT / 5pm ET | 11pm CET / February 13th at 7am JST. As usual, the show will be streamed on YouTube and Twitch in English and Japanese.</p>
<p>With games like Ghost of Yotei and <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-gets-korean-rating-hinting-at-imminent-launch/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> scheduled for release this year on PlayStation 5, there's a very good chance we will learn precisely when the two games will be released during tomorrow's State of Play. The show may also feature some surprises, including the announcement of a collection featuring <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-greek-saga-remasters-announced/">remasters of the first three entries in the God of War series</a>. The release date for Rogue Factor's Hell is Us, which was revealed to be September 4th yesterday, is likely going to be confirmed during the show as well. Hopefully, tomorrow's presentation will also hold more surprises, as the previous State of Play did back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-sequel-ghost-of-yotei-showcased-at-state-of-play/">September</a> when the aforementioned Ghost of Yotei was officially revealed.</p>

<p>This title is a player-driven Space Survival MMO created by CCP Games, where you are cast out into a vicious cosmos, lost to time and light.

People are able to access the Closed Alpha by acquiring Founder Access, which will give players access to the Closed Alpha, where they will have persistent access throughout every update and development that is released for the game. Along with this, those with Founder Access will be able to provide feedback for the developers and get special rewards such as cosmetics, access to developer streams, and more. If this sounds like something you would want to purchase, you can obtain Founder Access to the game for $39.99. There are <a href="https://wccftech.com/founder-access-for-eve-frontier-announced-closed-alpha-starts-december-10/">multiple tiers</a> available, with all of them offering different rewards.</p>
<p>It's important to note that if you choose to obtain Founder Access, you will be subject to an NDA during this time.</p>
<p>This MMO will be free-to-play once it launches, with an optional subscription that will be available.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-confirmed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced that a new PlayStation State of Play show will air tomorrow, featuring updates on "exciting games from studios around the world".</p>

<p>Announcing the showcase on its PlayStation&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/11/state-of-play-returns-tomorrow-february-12/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog</a>, Sony says the new State of Play will last for 40-plus minutes and that it'll air at 2pm Pacific (that's 5pm Eastern and around 10pm GMT, so make sure you grab your coffee if you're planning to stay up for it).</p>

<p>The show will be broadcast via Sony's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/PlayStation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Twitch</a> channels, and you'll be able to watch it in either English or Japanese, depending on your whim.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-mgs.jpg?itok=uD0c1482 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-mgs.jpg?itok=ETbep27N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tomorrow's State of Play could bring that&nbsp;<em>MGS Delta&nbsp;</em>release date you've been waiting for.</figcaption></figure><p>So, what are we likely to see during the show? Well, naturally, Sony is remaining tight-lipped about what will be showcased, so we'll have to resort to (educated!) guesswork.</p>

<p>The most likely announcement for tomorrow's State of Play is a release date for&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>. The release date was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">leaked last week</a> via a PlayStation Store listing and new trailer before being hastily removed, so it's almost certainly earmarked for the show.</p>

<p>Upcoming PlayStation-exclusive games (for now, at least!) include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-ghost-of-tsushima-followup-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Ghost of Yotei</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hideo Kojima's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-filming-and-recording-completed" rel="nofollow"><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em></a>, both of which could get new extended gameplay demos or release dates tomorrow.</p>

<p>There's also a non-zero chance that some sort of&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remaster or remake could finally be revealed tomorrow, if Sony's recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodborne-psx-demake-dmca-sony" rel="nofollow">twin DMCA takedowns</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodborne-60fps-patch-dmca" rel="nofollow">fan projects</a> revolving around the game are anything to go by.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-bloodborne-rumor.jpg?itok=mBxsRziX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/playstation-state-of-play-february-2025-bloodborne-rumor.jpg?itok=cvxkO2At 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could that long-awaited&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remaster finally be coming?</figcaption></figure><p>Whatever PlayStation has to show for itself, it's following hot on the heels of January's Xbox Developer Direct, during which we got new looks at&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>,&nbsp;<em>South of Midnight</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, as well as the reveal of a new&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden&nbsp;</em>game.</p>

<p>Whether or not Sony shows anything comparable off remains to be seen, but you can tune in tomorrow at 2pm Pacific (5pm Eastern, 10pm GMT).</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-unity-layoffs-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/unity-reportedly-lays-off-yet-more-staff-including-entire-behavior-division.1105905/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-unity-layoffs-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>New reports have emerged claiming that Unity has laid off a number of employees, with one report suggesting that the company's entire Behavior division has been laid off.</p>

<p>According to Unity Behavior head Shanee Nishry, the whole Behavior team has been "included in [Unity's] latest round of layoffs". Nishry says she's reached out to Unity leadership to ask if "they can open source the project", but that this isn't guaranteed.</p>

<p>Additionally, designer&nbsp;André de Miranda Cardoso <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andre-mc_unfortunately-i-was-affected-by-the-latest-activity-7295024528282288128-4mqz/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">posted on LinkedIn earlier</a> confirming that he's been "affected by the latest Unity layoff[s]". Neither former employee confirmed how many staff members had been laid off across the company.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/unity-layoffs-report-editor.jpg?itok=e85RPOHM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/unity-layoffs-report-editor.jpg?itok=OCWy1rza 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More layoffs have apparently hit Unity.</figcaption></figure><p>Other Unity employees to confirm the layoffs include senior software developer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7294738324894691329/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Coline Turquin</a> and tech lead <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7294815856256049152/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Florence Rolland-Soulier</a>&nbsp;(both courtesy of <a href="https://80.lv/articles/breaking-unity-suddenly-lays-off-numerous-developers-with-a-5-am-email/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">80.lv</a>), the latter of whom refers to the latest round as a "wave of mass layoffs".</p>

<p>Another employee impacted by the layoffs, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7294910467607535616/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Peter Roe</a>, "call[s] out" the way Unity chose to communicate the layoffs to staff, claiming that the company sent "a 5am email" from a "noreply" email address to inform him that his role would be "eliminated".</p>

<p>It's worth noting that Unity itself has yet to publicly announce or confirm these layoffs. However, given how many Unity employees (or former employees) are coming forward to share their stories, it seems unlikely that the reports are false.</p>

<p>Back in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-layoffs-core-business" rel="nofollow">January last year</a>, Unity revealed that it would slash 25% of its workforce in order to "refocus on its core business". It's unclear whether these layoffs are part of that wave or whether they represent a further commitment to cutting staff.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/subnautica-unity.jpg?itok=UthiZiRj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/subnautica-unity.jpg?itok=5HN1eJIi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Subnautica&nbsp;</em>is just one of many games made using Unity.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not the first time Unity has committed to laying off employees, either; in 2023, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-weta-digital-layoffs" rel="nofollow">said it would lay off hundreds of staff members</a> as part of a company-wide "reset" effort.</p>

<p>All of this follows the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-developers-outraged-after-major-pricing-change" rel="nofollow">introduction</a> of a controversial runtime fee policy change in 2023, which was so poorly received that it appears to have led to CEO <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-ceo-john-riccitiello-retiring-after-runtime-fee-controversy" rel="nofollow">John Riccitello retiring</a>. The fee was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unity-runtime-fee-canceled" rel="nofollow">canceled altogether</a> in September last year.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/609973/civilization-7-steam-deck-performance-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/civilization-vii-is-mostly-fine-on-the-steam-deck-which-is-great-news.1105902/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/609973/civilization-7-steam-deck-performance-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There are few things more daunting than attempting to win a game of <em>Civilization</em> by way of cultural victory… except maybe trying to play a complex strategy game on the Steam Deck. And while I’m still struggling on the culture victory aspect, I can say, playing <em>Civilization VII</em> on my Steam Deck was far less difficult than I imagined. </p><p>In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/604489/civilization-7-review">my review of <em>Civilization VII</em></a>, my biggest complaint was not really understanding some of the game’s more complex systems. The controls are a function of that misunderstanding. In playing a game as information-dense as <em>Civilization</em>, every function is mapped to a button, and there are <em>a lot</em> of functions. I tried my best to memorize it all but was grateful for the Deck’s touch-screen functionality, which let me forgo buttons in certain instances.</p><p>However, there were times when I occasionally encountered a bug where I’d click on a selection and nothing happened. It was never anything mission-critical. Sometimes the game didn’t want to register when I wanted to put a unit to sleep or ignored my attempts to establish a trade route I knew I met the criteria for. These complaints blend with my initial problems with the game’s legibility. Maybe those weren’t bugs but, rather, the game refusing an invalid action. If it was the latter, there was nothing in the game’s UI that I noticed communicating that.</p><p>I also had an issue that essentially boiled down to “out of sight, out of mind,” whereby the small size of the Steam Deck’s screen meant I sometimes lost track of my units. It’s nice that when <em>Civilization VII</em> prompts you to issue orders to units each turn, it’ll snap to every unit in question. But sometimes you might issue a unit to go to sleep — you want to keep it around but don’t need to issue orders every turn. With the smaller screen, I can’t see my units on a map all at once and so, embarrassingly, can forget they exist. And that can kinda suck if you need to recall your armies home to defend the motherland against literal Machiavellian assaults. (This is a silly problem, I admit, but it nevertheless happened more than once.)</p><p>I didn’t notice any significant performance issues playing on the Deck except for loading times at the start of a game or jumping back into one feeling a bit lengthy. I remember fondly how <em>Civilization V</em> used to chug even on adequate machines whenever the game swung back around to the top of the turn order, but that seems to have been corrected between then and now. Graphics also weren’t an issue, but I did have some instances of pop-in. I actually recall being impressed by the detail of the new fog of war system. Instead of a literal fog, unexplored portions of the map are obscured by an ornately designed map tile that features black marble inlaid with golden Roman numerals that looked particularly stunning.</p><p>With the advent of all these <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">newfangled</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/17/24344308/asus-rog-flow-acer-nitro-blaze-steam-deck-giant-pc-handheld-experiment">portable games systems</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23578144/age-of-empires-ii-definitive-edition-xbox-controller">previously PC-locked games branching out onto consoles</a>, I have been taken over by what I’m going to call desktop sloth. If I don’t have to play a game at my desk, I’m not going to, and I’m willing to accept a little bit of a degraded experience to do it. Thankfully, playing <em>Civilization VII</em> on my Steam Deck, with certain exceptions, didn’t feel too different from a <em>Civ</em> game at my desktop. Though I’m still getting the hang of game mechanics, I can still set policies, deploy armies and spies, and build up my cities just as easily from my couch as I once could my desk.</p><p>It wasn’t a frictionless experience. But the ability to take my cold war with Machiavelli on the go glossed over those minor hiccups just fine.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>
The latest helping of Firaxis 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> launched in early access to Founder Edition buyers last week. You may have noticed that we don't have a review yet. This is because our Civilization 7 review is the best Civilization 7 review, and much as with Worldly Wonders, the best things take time. It is marinating underground like, I don't know, some kind of exotic resource you can build an absolutely banging library with. It hangs unseen in the air around us, a cloud of purest Schrödingas refusing to condense into anything so trivial and <em>gauche</em> as a concrete verdict. 
</p>
<p>
That verdict's absence may even be for the best, as far as Firaxis and publisher 2K Games concerned. RPS strategy game columnist Sin Vega has already reviewed Sid 7 for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-review">Eurogamer</a> and she wasn't especially wowed. "Its design broadly works, and a certain kind of city-optimising fan may even love it," she wrote. "But its lack of character is endemic, the extent of its annoying habits and oversights shocking for a series of such pedigree." I gather that a lot of the game feels both pointless and characterless, and that "the interface is ashamed that it's a strategy game". I'm disappointed to read that the fancy new Age structure, which breaks your campaign up into more digestible, narrative-driven chunks, is simply a source of irritation.
</p>
<p>
Sin's review is one among many, and there are plenty of positive write-ups - perhaps the RPS review will be among them - but the player mood on Steam is currently Mixed. Firaxis have put together <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1295660/view/508445806184891583?l=english">a patch</a> for launch that suspends cross-play while they implement fixes for various issues with the camera, AI and features or systems such as naval combat and how Age progression works. There's also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/civilization-7s-post-launch-plans-include-free-multiplayer-and-age-features-and-paid-ada-lovelace">a substantial menu of planned seasonal updates</a>, including new civilizations and leaders, which has naturally attracted some accusations that certain features should be part of the game at launch.
</p>
<p>
But you, reader dear - what do you make of Cid 7 so far? I know that a few of you are Founder's Editioners who already have dozens of hours under your belts. If you have complaints, are they the kind that can be addressed with patches, or are they more fundamental issues? Me, I look forward to playing the game six months down the road once the dust has settled. This is Meierbot85, signing off.

Doing so will unlock the second set of rewards, including a new Gold rank costume and a variety of Crests of Honor, featuring distinct designs for Grandmaster, Celestial, Eternity, and One Above All.</p><p>Live-service games are a delicate dance between developers trying to maintain the overall health and longevity of the game while players want to Have Fun, and not feel Screwed Over. Even beloved hits like<em> Helldivers 2</em> have occasionally missed the mark when it comes to this balancing act. Kudos to <em>Marvel Rivals</em> for course correcting so quickly. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sony has officially announced its next PlayStation State of Play event. Confirming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent rumors</a>, the show will take place on Wednesday, February 12 at 5pm ET/11pm CET.</p>



<p>In its announcement on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/11/state-of-play-returns-tomorrow-february-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Blog</a>, the company says that the show will be over 40 minutes long, and will feature “news and updates on great games coming to PS5.” </p>



<p>“The show celebrates a creative and unique selection of exciting games from studios around the world,” Sony said with no other details being given regarding what games will appear.</p>



<p>But aside from the small tease from Sony, Insider Gaming’s Grant Taylor-Hill said on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/6qKJBGGFu6X4hNmi6GQP8C" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest episode of Insider Gaming Weekly</a> that a brand new game from a brand new studio will be shown during the event as well.</p>

<p>As far as what else to expect, it’s unclear. With plans for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-more-xbox-games-multiplatform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more Xbox games</a> to come to the PlayStation 5, the show could see another announcement of the next Xbox game to come to PlayStation. Halo and Gears of War are two of the bigger names making the rounds online, though there is nothing to confirm those being the next games to come. Two games that could also be shown are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Yotei</a> and Death Stranding 2 as both are scheduled to release in 2025.</p>



<p>Like always, Insider Gaming will have full coverage of the show as it airs, including every announcement you need to know.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witchers-doug-cockle-on-becoming-netflixs-latest-geralt</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-witcher%E2%80%99s-doug-cockle-on-becoming-netflix%E2%80%99s-latest-geralt.1105887/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witchers-doug-cockle-on-becoming-netflixs-latest-geralt<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">While Henry Cavill may be the most famous actor to have played Geralt of Rivia, he’s not the first name many will think of when discussing The Witcher. Certainly amongst the gaming community, Doug Cockle — the voice of Geralt in CD Projekt Red’s series of critically acclaimed RPGs — is considered the original and ultimate white wolf. But the paths of Cavill and Cockle’s Geralts have now merged, with Cockle bringing his unmistakable voice to Netflix’s interpretation of the character in the new animated movie, The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While he’s not playing the same version of Geralt who appears in the games, Cockle was not asked to alter his performance to sound more like or include the mannerisms of Henry Cavill or Liam Hemsworth, who replaces Cavill as Geralt in the next season of the live-action show. This creative decision meant Cockle was able to draw upon the same method and approach that created the unmistakably gravelly tones of his Geralt of Rivia. And so you’ll still hear the same voice you’ve known and loved for nearly 20 years.     </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Cockle formulated that voice back in 2005 when recording dialogue for the first Witcher video game. “The thing I found most challenging about recording Witcher 1 was actually the voice itself,” Cockle recalls. “When I first started recording the game, (Geralt’s) voice was very, very far down in my register. It was something I had to push towards.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time there was little guidance as to how long voice actors should spend recording in a single session, and so Cockle was spending eight or nine hours per day delivering that gravelly voice. “I was going back to my hotel just going, ‘Wow, my throat is ripped’,” he recalls. The struggle continued into the recording of The Witcher 2 a few years later, but Cockle’s vocal chords eventually strengthened and began attuned to what was required of them — a process he sheepishly likens to an athlete's muscles getting into shape. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As soon as The Last Wish came out in English, I tore through it.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Cockle’s vocal chords adapting to better support Geralt’s voice wasn’t the only major change that happened during the development of the second game, though. “The books started to come out in English while I was recording Witcher 2,” he explains. “Before that, it was the developers from CD Projekt Red who taught me everything I needed to know about Geralt. So as soon as The Last Wish came out in English, I was down at the bookstore buying it, and I tore through it. And I understood things about Geralt just from reading just that one book that I didn't understand at all before. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The developers kept saying, ‘He's emotionless’,” Cockle says. “And I was like, ‘Okay, I get it, I get it, but I'm an actor. I want to play with emotions.’ But I better understood [when reading] the book why they were pushing for as flat as possible of an emotional life for him.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/07/the-witcher-sirens-of-the-deep-jaskier-geralt-1738945176731.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Doug Cockle's Geralt appears alongside Joey Batey's Jaskier and other members of the Netflix cast. | Image credit: Netflix</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Cockle immediately fell in love with the books, noting that author Andrzej Sapkowski “is such a wonderful writer.” Having grown up on Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings, Cockle quickly forged a connection with this new fantasy universe. Of all Sapkowski’s novels, he most fondly remembers Season of Storms. It’s a story he’d love to be a part of, should Netflix ever need a voice for Geralt again.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's one of those stories that when I read it, I was like, ‘Oh, this is horrible. This is awful.’ [But] it's thrilling at the same time,” he says. “There's some really graphic fight scenes that Sapkowski gives to us, and I think that would be a really fun story to turn into an anime or a TV episode.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I enjoy the gravitas of Geralt when he's all serious and mopey and whatever, but I do also like those moments when he's trying to be light.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe we’ll see that story in the future, but right now Doug’s Geralt can be seen and heard in Sirens of the Deep, Netflix’s latest animated Witcher adventure. Based on the short story A Little Sacrifice from the Sword of Destiny collection, it’s a dark and twisted interpretation of Hans Christian Andersen’s The Little Mermaid. After a mermaid and a human prince fall in love, Geralt finds himself caught up in a conflict between two very different kingdoms. But while there’s plenty of blood-splattering action and serious political drama, it’s the story’s lighter moments that interest Cockle the most. He notes a humorous conversation between Geralt and Jaskier, where both are sitting around a campfire after a long day, as a good example of that lightness. The scene demonstrates Geralt’s softer side, which is often overlooked as an important part of the monster hunter’s personality. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Part of liking acting is liking all those different aspects of a character's personality and the different choices that could be made and how they might approach those choices,” Cockle explains. “I enjoy the gravitas of Geralt when he's all serious and mopey and whatever, but I do also like those moments when he's trying to be light. When he's trying to crack a joke and it just doesn't go very well for him most of the time because he's just not funny.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep Geeked Week 2024 Teaser Stills</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While much of Cockle’s work on Sirens of the Deep simply required him to use a voice that’s become second nature, the anime did pose a unique challenge: learning how to speak mermaid. Yes, for the first time in his career, Cockle had to perform in a fictional language. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I found doing this really difficult,” he confesses. “I got phonetic spellings of the words and things so I could get familiar with it and hopefully be okay on the day. And then I got in front of the mic and… it wasn't like performance anxiety or anything like that, it's just that it was a lot harder than I thought it was going to be.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things should be much easier when Cockle returns to the world of video games in The Witcher 4, which was revealed with an exciting trailer at The Game Awards last year. Returning to his original version of Geralt should be like putting on an old pair of favourite slippers. Even easier, actually, because he won’t have to record anywhere near the amount of dialogue that he did for the previous three games. This time around Geralt is set to be a supporting character in a story that puts Ciri, his adoptive daughter, in the protagonist role.    </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, Cockle has little to say about The Witcher 4. He claims to only know as much about it as we do. But he’s eager to see what happens in CDPR’s next chapter of The Witcher story, and thinks it's already headed in the right direction. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think it's a really good move,” he says of switching the story’s perspective from Geralt to Ciri. “I mean, I always thought that continuing the saga, but shifting to Ciri would be a really, really interesting move for all kinds of reasons, but mostly because of things that happen in the books, which I don't want to give away because people, I want people to go read. So yeah, I think it's really exciting. I can't wait. I can't wait to see what they've done.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To learn more about what CD Projekt Red is planning, take a look at our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inside-the-witcher-4-cd-projekt-reds-plans-for-its-next-big-rpg">in-depth interview with the creators of The Witcher 4</a>.

                <p>Sony has confirmed that its first State of Play livestream for 2025 will kick off on <strong>February 12 </strong>at 2 PM PT / 5 PM ET. As usual, you'll be able to watch it on Sony's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PlayStation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a> channels.</p><p>This looks like it'll be a pretty big livestream, as <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/11/state-of-play-returns-tomorrow-february-12/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony says</a> the event will run for at least 40 minutes and will show "a creative and unique selection of exciting games" from various studios around the world.</p><p>So what else can you expect from the show? Sony is keeping details on it under wraps, but the company does have some big games in development currently. The Last of Us developer Naughty Dog revealed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-the-next-very-different-naughty-dog-game/1100-6528421/" data-ref-id="1100-6528421">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a> last year, Sucker Punch's Ghost of Tsushima sequel--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526691/" data-ref-id="1100-6526691">Ghost of Yotei</a>--is scheduled to release later this year, and it'll be interesting to see if the live-service heist-'em-up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fairgame/" data-ref-id="5000-589427">FairGame$</a> makes an appearance after a long period of radio silence.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</a> director Hideo Kojima has also been sharing a few teases for a new trailer on his social media accounts, so we could get a new look at the post-apocalyptic courier game. Beyond that, there has also been quite a bit of speculation regarding From Software's Bloodborne, as the 10th anniversary of the game is fast approaching.</p><p>Additionally, numerous third-party games are coming out this year from notable studios. February 2025 still has big releases like Monster Hunter Wilds and Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, while March turns up the heat with Assassin's Creed Shadows, Atomfall, and Killing Floor 3.</p>

<p>The news was announced on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/11/state-of-play-returns-tomorrow-february-12/?sf276356214=1">PlayStation Blog</a> but little else is known about what to expect.</p>
<p>So what can we expect to see? Sony doesn't have too many announced first party games on the horizon for 2025, so it'll be exciting to see what they bring.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/11/monster-hunter-wilds-final-preview/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s no Seikret that we love Monster Hunter here at TSA. There probably isn’t a Monster Hunter title that we haven’t poured hundreds of hours into between us, and it’s probably best we don’t think about the upper limit of that number… Much better to think about all the exciting and fun times that await in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p>
<p>And so, when our friends at Capcom offered us a chance to come play the first four hours of the game — completely uninterrupted —&nbsp;along with two special hunts from later in the game, we seized the opportunity with both hands.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds: 6th Trailer | Into the Iceshard Cliffs" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OFoueW07mxQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This, naturally, came with the same kind of caveats that any pre-release game build has. The multiplayer aspect was still a little sticky and the lip sync wasn’t quite, well, synced. They’re minor issues that are sure to be rounded off in the final weeks and months of development, and the amount of polish that is on show throughout the game is already impressive.</p>
<p>We picked up the game after the opening sequence we last played in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/10/monster-hunter-wilds-preview-a-seikret-ride-on-the-wild-side/">our first Monster Hunter Wilds preview</a> last September. We escorted Y’sai back to his Kunafa village, taking in the scenery and meeting some colourful new characters along the way. One of our colleagues at the base asked us to keep an eye out for some honey so Y’sai pointed it out for us along the way.</p>

<p>But, as much as I love honey – and hot honey is, of course, very trendy right now – what I was really waiting for was a mission, and it didn’t take long before we were asked to kill a Quematrice — a Brute Wyvern new to Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>

<p>It’s always exciting to come across new beasties, and the Quematrice did not disappoint. This greenish-brown brute with red and blue scales has a large comb atop its head, and a wattle on its throat, giving it the appearance of a cockatrice — unsurprising perhaps given its name. It also has a very large tail that sprays oil on the ground, which it then strikes to ignite.</p>
<p>Aggressive though it was, we dispatched it and moved on, meeting up with Y’sai to continue the dual mission of reuniting Nata with The Keepers and hunting down the White Wraith.</p>
<p>What was doubly exciting is that, unlike the old days of Monster Hunters past, we weren’t sitting around watching load screens. Instead we could just run out the base and leg it to where the monster waited, battle it and then simply move towards our next target in this large open biome.</p>
<p>We soon wind up in a forest, meet some new characters and stumble across what was easily my favourite monster of the day, a Lala Barina. This temnoceran (a monster type that covers arachnid-likes) is also new to Wilds, and is also pretty cool. Well, so long as you like spiders that are red, white and fluffy all over, and have spikey legs. When enraged, its abdomen opens up into what looks like a large rose, and this is where it gets really cool. It shoots out ‘florets’ — neuroleptics that float in the air ready to ensnare and paralyse you.</p>

<p>Naturally, we killed that and moved on, setting up a pop-up base in the Forest along the way. This is a great new mechanic in that, unlike in Worlds, the base can be destroyed by local monsters. In this case it was ransacked by some Wudwuds. These are basically Monster Hunter’s version of the Ewoks, if they were taught English by a surfer from the 60s. It’s a little jarring at first, but unlike your Felyne’s English voice (I quickly changed the setting to Felyne language), it quickly becomes endearing.</p>
<p>A bout with the farting gorilla monster of a Congalala brought back some misty memories of the first time I battled one back in 2006, but the next treat in this area was another brand-new monster, the Uth Duna.</p>
<p>In testament to its strength, we didn’t have to kill this one, just repel it. This leviathan was impressive, coating itself with a veil of water that repels attacks and moving with incredible speed and agility in terrain that you struggle to just walk in. While it was a nightmare to fight, it was gorgeous to look at.</p>

<p>And that’s where our story preview ended. The opening hours had us facing off against three new monsters — a fire, paralysis and water type — and have a crack at an old favourite that hasn’t been seen in a main-series game since 2014. We got to see a few new biomes, meet some new characters, and see the quality of life updates that will be very exciting for long-term fans, and even just those wanting a true sequel to World.</p>
<p>But that wasn’t where our time with the game ended, with two more new monsters and two more biomes from later in the game to see. First was the Rompopolo in the Oilwell Basin.</p>

<p>This monster has a fascinating design. Rather than the typical Brute Wyvern build, it has an insectile head with a mosquito-like nose, scythe-like hands, a forked tongue and a stinger. It uses these appendages not only to jab and slash, but to either shoot jets of poison or inject it into the ground, causing explosion of oil and tar.</p>
<p>All this made for a pretty exciting fight — despite its aggressive nature, we still took it down inside of 10 minutes, like everything else today.</p>
<p>Which brings us to our final monster — the temnoceran Nerscylla in the Iceshard Cliffs.</p>
<p>It was really exciting to get a chance to try another new temnoceran that attacks in a very different way. Instead of paralysis, this one uses poison to attack. It also flings itself across the room like Spider-Man, occasionally dangling from the ceiling as it watches its tiny spider spawn try to rush you. Fortunately, it can be shot down from its cocky little perch with a well-placed shot.</p>

<p>Perhaps the coolest thing about this monster is that if offers a unique insight into the ecology of Monster Hunter. Look carefully and you’ll see that it is wearing a Gypceros hide. That’s some Silence of the Lambs-level nonsense right there.</p>
<p>Our key takeaways from this final preview hands on are that the game is shaping up incredibly well. Combat is smooth and slick, and feels even better than it did in our first preview. The addition of wound damage in Wilds is excellent, adding another dimension to gameplay.</p>
<p>The new monsters we fought are all unique in their own ways, and the biomes we visited are both vast and exciting, underpinning that sense of adventure that comes with each new game. While the weapons and mechanics are familiar, as are some of the monsters that you fight, Wilds feels like a brand new adventure, and that is incredibly exciting.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds comes out in just a few short weeks, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/monster-hunter-wilds-is-coming-out-in-february-2025/">on 28th February</a>, but I am itching to get my hands on it once again. And if you’re a fan of either the franchise or the genre, you should be too.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-side-quests/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-side-quests-will-feature-flashbacks-for-yasuke-and-naoe.1105857/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-side-quests/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows creative director recently revealed what players should expect from the game’s side quests, and it seems we might get some flashback sequences for Yasuke and Naoe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows creative director Jonathan Dumont recently spoke about the game’s world, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-will-adapt-to-the-character-you-are-playing-with/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dual-protagonist system</a>, side-quests and more during an interview with <a href="https://screenrant.com/assassins-creed-shadows-world-protagonists-jonathan-dumont-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Screenrant</a>. When asked about the content of the side-quests, Dumont explained three different types, “objective board or bandits”, “relationship-oriented”, and ones that are “hidden behind a couple of meditation mechanics”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Assassin’s Creed Shadows side-quests that are hidden behind these meditation mechanics are the ones that let you “experience the past” of Naoe and Yasuke. At the start of the game, players will not know who these characters are exactly, but with the help of these flashbacks, they will understand why they are here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The objective board or bandits side-quests in Assassin’s Creed Shadows will be familiar to players. You need to hunt targets across the world, and they each have different abilities and values. It will be interesting to hunt ninjas and samurais this time around. On the other hand, the relationship ones help players build bonds with different characters, recruit them, and explore romantic options.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is receiving&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-prequel-manga/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a prequel manga</a>. Also, the game&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-game-size/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has the largest file size</a>&nbsp;in the franchise’s history.&nbsp;What are your thoughts on Assassin’s Creed Shadows side-quests?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

Ready at Dawn co-founder Andrea Pessino has detailed some of the issues his company faced during the development of PlayStation 4 exclusive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/order-1886">The Order: 1886</a>.
</p>
<p>
Launched in 2015, Victorian steampunk shooter The Order: 1886 was lauded as a technical marvel and one of the best-looking games on Sony's then-new hardware. But its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-order-1886-review">linear approach and reliance on cinematic sequences rather than gameplay left critics cold</a>.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFmUHo_pJJ0">Minnmax</a>, Pessino said changes within Sony during the game's production had added strain to its development - most notably, the internal PlayStation team reshuffle that saw Shuhei Yoshida - who had been working closely with Ready at Dawn's team - become less hands-on.
</p>

<p>
"When Shu went to Japan - he was promoted - he became in charge of the whole thing [PlayStation], a lot of people followed him," Pessino said. "There was a whole shuffle upwards. 
</p>
<p>
"Leadership is a delicate balance, one person changes, things change. So everything changed for us after that event. The people we'd agreed on things with had gone... they were still up the chain of command, but you can't bypass it. It's like the military - you can't just go 'hey, Shu!'. So the amount of friction... everything started to change at that point."
</p>
<p>
Pessino declined to go into much more detail on the causes of this friction, other than mentioning that the studio had to spend time discussing "contracts".
</p>
<p>
"It wasn't the only issue but it certainly did not help development in any shape or form," Pessino added, "the fact we were constantly fighting them about the dumbest, stupidest shit possible."
</p>
<p>
Founded in 2003, Ready at Dawn had worked closely with Sony for more than a decade on projects such as PSP installments of Daxter and God of War, as well as the God of War: Origins Collection for PS3.
</p>
<p>
The Order: 1886 was seen as the company's attempt to make its own mark, with a new franchise it could originate and hold the reigns for. Alas, after a mixed response, it was not to be.
</p>
<p>
"One of the problems is so much was cut, a lot of the more subtle narrative parts were lost because so much was chopped away," Pessino said. "Things that were supposed to be interactive became a movie... We were desperate, we needed to ship... We needed at least one more year. And we didn't get it, so it was 'cut, cut, cut'."
</p>
<p>
Ready at Dawn had pitched a sequel to Sony, and held discussions over its setting. It would have contained multiplayer gameplay, Pessino said, and could have launched three years later in 2018. 
</p>
<p>
Instead, Sony chose not to move forward with any sequel plans after the first game failed to find a warm reception.
</p>
<p>
"I actually don't think it was the sales, I think it was the critical reception," Pessino said. "Sony is a very proud group, rightfully so. And the critical reception [to the first game] - if it had even been in the 70s, we would have had the sequel, I'm convinced. Just a few points more, it would have been okay. But because it got into the 60s... it was death.
</p>
<p>
"In a way, it's better that they passed," Pessino continued. "Because if we thought we'd have been screwed before... we'd have signed our life away. We were going to do it just because we wanted to deliver to the players, but we would have been... The budget would have been smaller, we would have been completely at the mercy of whatever decisions because we had no leverage whatsoever. We were not in a decision to negotiate a reasonable contract, they could have done whatever. 
</p>
<p>
"But we would have taken it, because we wanted the chance to redeem the franchise, which we thought certainly had a shot. All of the groundwork was really, really good."
</p>
<p>
Ready at Dawn subsequently moved to developing VR games, and in 2020 was bought by Meta - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lone-echo-and-the-order-1886-developer-ready-at-dawn-reportedly-shut-down-by-meta">until August 2024, when Meta shut the studio down</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-will-adapt-to-the-character-you-are-playing-with/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows’s Creative Director has revealed that the game will adapt to the character you are playing with.</p>



<p>Many have wondered how Assassin’s Creed Shadows can be played with two characters with distinct archetypes and backgrounds. What if someone wants to play with only Naoe to be stealthy throughout their experience, or maybe Yasuke to be as aggressive as you can? The developer has now revealed how the game will change according to the player’s preferences while having unique experiences for both characters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://screenrant.com/assassins-creed-shadows-world-protagonists-jonathan-dumont-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Screenrant</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/assassins-creed-shadows-director-on-splitting-time-between-the-two-heroes-the-core-of-the-game-can-be-pick-your-character-and-the-game-adapts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Jonathan Dumont, the game’s creative director, spoke at length about how the dual protagonist system will work for Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Dumont explained that Yasuke and Naoe are distinct in gameplay but “complementary” in narrative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the story and the world are experienced from “two different sides.” Naoe comes from a Shinobi background, and Yasuke is a stranger but nobility at the same time. Dumont said he likes how “both voices sound very different, in the sense that they look at the world a little bit differently.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dumont added that both Assassin’s Creed Shadows characters will receive “individual introductions and then they get their own questline”. This means Yasuke can’t play Naoe’s personal quests and vice versa. However, “the core of the game can be pick your character, and the game adapts”, explained the creative director.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dumont also clarified that there might be “a couple of choices here and there”, which might make players wonder “what would happen with this character”, but he doesn’t think they are “missing out”. The developers don’t want to force players to “try to split the time”; players can decide whether to stick to one or balance it out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Assassin’s Creed Shadows is receiving <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-prequel-manga/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a prequel manga</a>. Also, the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-game-size/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has the largest file size</a> in the franchise’s history. What are your thoughts on Assassin’s Creed Shadows adapting to your chosen character?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>The WWE Universe is once again preparing itself for War (Games). The release of WWE 2K25 continues 2K’s annual take on professional wrestling. With the profession hotter than ever, the developer is looking to deliver a five-star show worthy of headlining any Wrestlemania.</p>



<p>WWE 2K25 welcomes new wrestlers, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-features-revealed-including-new-game-modes-and-match-types/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">match types</a>, and more chaos than ever before. It mirrors real-life WWE in its sense of progression and scope. The Triple H-era of WWE is producing record gates, attendances, and social media numbers and the interest is sky-high. It feels like 2K’s WWE games have been going the same way.</p>



<p>Gameplay footage has already revealed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-cover-officially-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cover star</a> and a gargantuan amount of graps, and we love it. If you’re also looking forward to 2K25, let’s check out everything we know about its key details.</p>



<h2 id="h-wwe-2k25-release-date">WWE 2K25 Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Dirty Dom has had it coming. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>WWE 2K25 releases on March 14 for all players, whereas you can get your name on the card earlier on March 7 via Early Access.</strong></p>



<p>March 14 is the official worldwide launch of <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WWE 2K25</a>. This is when anyone with any edition can jump in. But Early Access is a chance for keen fans to flex their muscles (and wallet) by purchasing the Deadman and The Bloodline Editions. </p>



<p>Doing so entitles you to a lot more content, including special <strong>Early Access or WWE 2K25</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-wwe-2k25-platforms">WWE 2K25 Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Steam AKA PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox X|S are the supported platforms available for WWE 2K25.</strong></p>



<p>2K has a habit of launching new titles on as many platforms as possible. While it probably means more work for the developer and gives it a harder time when it comes to optimization and balancing out what works and what doesn’t on old-gen, it’s an inclusive way to bring in as many new fans as possible.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, like another common trend in 2025, the <strong>Nintendo Switch misses out</strong>. The PS4 and Xbox One editions aren’t as equipped as the PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC releases, but they can still handle a solid version of WWE 2K25. The Switch can’t though. </p>



<p>It remains to be seen if the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a> can handle WWE 2K25 or future releases.</p>



<h2 id="h-wwe-2k25-editions-amp-price">WWE 2K25 Editions &amp; Price</h2>



<p><strong>WWE 2K25 has a Standard Edition, Deadman Edition, and The Bloodline Edition to purchase. In order, you are looking at $69.99 or £64.99, $99.99 or £89.99, and $129.99 or £119.99.</strong></p>



<p>These are the RRP figures for each edition of WWE 2K25. If you’re going physical, you might be able to get the wrestling title cheaper elsewhere. Also, there is no super-duper Collector’s Edition or anything like that here.</p>



<p>Check out every edition and its price right here.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">WWE 2K25 Edition</th><th data-align="center">WWE 2K25 Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Standard Edition</td><td data-align="center">$69.99 or £64.99</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Deadman Edition</td><td data-align="center">$99.99 or £89.99</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">The Bloodline Edition</td><td data-align="center">$129.99 or £119.99</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
