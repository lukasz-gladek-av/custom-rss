            <p>
Pokeverse - a Pokémon convention partnered with the Make-a-Wish foundation and that featured the original voice of Ash Ketchum from the Pokémon TV series - has been labelled as a disaster on a scale with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-someones-made-the-glasgow-willy-wonka-experience-in-fortnite">Glasgow's infamous Willy Wonka rip-off experience</a>.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer today, attendee BintuRina - whose social media posts describing her experience have since gone viral - said the event lacked proper planning and care for its young attendees.
</p>
<p>
Ahead of the convention, held in Mandaluyong, Manila last weekend, Pokeverse had been described by organisers as "the premier Pokémon-themed expo in the Philippines made by fans for fans!" It was advertised to feature "trainer quests", "stellar headliners" and "live musical performances", alongside cosplay contests and game tournaments.

<p>
Pokeverse's main attraction was the oppurtunity to meet Veronica Taylor, Ash's voice for the first eight seasons of the franchise's anime, and Jason Paige, the singer of Pokémon's iconic original theme song. 
</p>
<p>
But even before the expo began there were concerns over its seemingly unlicensed nature, and its partnership with Dubai NFT firm Kaloscope. (Responding to concerns, Taylor has <a href="https://x.com/TheVeronicaT/status/1788614907258384513">stated</a> she was not compensated for her attendance.)
</p>
<p>
At the convention itself, the event's attractions look to have been drastically downsized based on floorplans previously posted by Pokeverse to social media. 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Let's talk about POKEVERSE PH<br>THE POKÉMON THEMED WONKA-DASHCON-FYRE FESTIVAL of the PHILIPPINES</p><p>Let me take you on a day by day journey through the PREMIER POKÉMON EXPO!</p><p>‼️A MEGA THREAD‼️ <a href="https://t.co/H38b4pLL6T">pic.twitter.com/H38b4pLL6T</a></p></div>— Rita WAS @ POKEVERSE (@BintuRita) <a href="https://twitter.com/BintuRita/status/1797928992659628260?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>
Entering the event space, attendees were reportedly greeted by a large booth from another sponsor, Frigga, which sold Chinese lucky charms. An inflatable soft play area featured a row of circus side-show style activities, completely unrelated to Pokémon.
</p>
<p>
More serious questions were raised about a Make-a-Wish panel where terminally-ill children were reportedly brought on stage for a filming oppurtunity, wearing surgical masks but in front of a large crowd. 
</p>
<p>
Another criticism was the event's filming of attendees, including minors and cosplayers changing their outfits, in a lounge area. Some of this footage was then reportedly posted online.
</p>
<p>
"Let's talk about Pokeverse, the Pokémon-themed Wonka-Dashcon-Fyre Festival of the Philippines," BintuRita wrote on social media platform X. "Let me take you on a day-by-day journey through the Premier Pokémon Expo!
</p>
<p>
"The convention center was basically barren... with standees, designs or decorations filling all the empty spaces. The place was littered with empty tables and the promised floor plans on their Facebook page were suddenly changed."
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>There was also an art gallery that was selling pokemon paintings but for some reason their table was like, 5 meters away from art gallery</p><p>The prices of the paintings weren't even on the paintings, they were at the table so you had to walk the stretch to even check <a href="https://t.co/VjICUToSwg">pic.twitter.com/VjICUToSwg</a></p></div>— Rita WAS @ POKEVERSE (@BintuRita) <a href="https://twitter.com/BintuRita/status/1797935027516559734?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>The event's 'quests' amounted to a paper checklist asking visitors to post about certain parts of the convention on social media. And in another bizarre moment, a person covered in ravioli apparently unsettled some guests:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Eventually RAVIOLI MAN was escorted out but only after he took a sponge and started rubbing it on one of the sponsors booths.</p><p>Though later in the EXPO, security still let him back in.</p><p>I thought ticket rates were going into Crowd control and security?</p></div>— Rita WAS @ POKEVERSE (@BintuRita) <a href="https://twitter.com/BintuRita/status/1797932706048995668?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer, BintuRita said she wished "the convention had more time to be planned". 
</p>
<p>
"I wish it was more Pokémon centered. I wish the production team had more emphasis on consent. And I wish they had been more careful with the children in the convention space."
</p>
<p>
Still, Rita said she had enjoyed meeting Veronica Taylor and an oppurtunity to sing with Jason Paige - despite the shambolic nature of various elements' organisation. 
</p>
<p>
"Overall, my experience does not reflect everyone's Pokeverse experience. Some people went to the con and despite the hiccups, had a wonderful time. That wasn't my experience," she concluded.
</p>
<p>
Pokeverse organisers have responded to some of the concerns raised above already, in a <a href="https://x.com/BintuRita/status/1797972103473553689">reply</a> to BintuRita's posts. 
</p>
<p>
"We apologise for the oversight, we are investigating matters with the production team," a Pokeverse spokesperson said. "It's our first event with very little time to prepare but we do agree that a lot of things need to be improved.
</p>
<p>
"We appreciate your participation and will continue [to] take your feedback to do better next time."
</p>
<p>
The Pokémon Company itself is yet to comment on the event. Eurogamer has contacted it and Pokeverse's organisers for more.

			<p>Supergiant Games has just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/4191241567727414432" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the second update following the early access of Hades II. It is a sizable patch that tweaks several core combat mechanics, and most of the changes came directly from community feedback.</p>
<p><em><strong>General Gameplay</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>You now can encounter up to one additional Olympian each night (as in the previous game)</em></li>
<li><em>You now are likely to find one more Boon or other major reward while in Erebus</em></li>
<li><em>Increased invulnerability duration after your Death Defiance effects activate</em></li>
<li><em>Improved rewards of Ash and Psyche can now be found in [spoiler] and the [spoiler]</em></li>
<li><em>You now can press-and-hold to harvest repeatedly from Crescent Pick Outcroppings</em></li>
<li><em>Toula should now stay closer to you in Encounters, especially in the [spoiler]</em></li>
<li><em>[spoiler] no longer offers Death Defiance items if you do not need to refill the effect</em></li>
<li><em>Reduced Gold cost of Selene's Boon and Path of Stars in Charon's Shop</em></li>
<li><em>Minor adjustments to the order in which Olympians may first appear early on</em></li>
<li><em>Normalized chances of finding Fishing Points in various regions</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Nocturnal Arms &amp; Abilities</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Witch's Staff: Special knocks foes away but is slightly slower; Omega Special is faster</em></li>
<li><em>Sister Blades: Special staggers standard foes longer; Attack visual FX better match the hitbox</em></li>
<li><em>Umbral Flames: Attacks are stronger and faster; Omega Attack channels faster and uses less magick; Special gives a speed boost but has reduced damage; Omega Special can be channeled while moving</em></li>
<li><em>Moonstone Axe: reworked Special provides a lingering barrier; Omega Attack channels slightly faster; Omega Special channels faster</em></li>
<li><em>Argent Skull: Omega Attack channels faster and hits a larger area</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Aspects of the Nocturnal Arms</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Witch's Staff (Circe): adjusted activation and duration of Serenity effect; Serenity now adds Omega bonus damage that scales with this Aspect's rank</em></li>
<li><em>Witch's Staff (Momus): reworked; each of your Omega Moves automatically fires several times in succession from where you use them</em></li>
<li><em>Sister Blades (Artemis): you will Block again if the effect recharges while you are channeling; Block now takes priority over Dodge and similar effects</em></li>
<li><em>Umbral Flames (Eos): reworked; Omega Attack now fires a slow shot that occasionally creates damage blasts and also copies your Specials</em></li>
<li><em>Moonstone Axe (Melinoë): reworked; now adds Power and Max Life</em></li>
<li><em>Moonstone Axe (Thanatos): reworked; faster Attack adds Critical chance to Omega moves</em></li>
<li><em>Argent Skull (Medea): improved hit detection on foes near impassable obstacles</em></li>
<li><em>Argent Skull (Persephone): you now earn Glory much faster, but only by using your Omega Cast; improved control responsiveness during Omega Special</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Hades II was suddenly <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-ii-early-access-launch-full-release-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> on early access last month. The game has already attracted around a million players, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1145350/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to SteamDB</a>, despite the full release being around a year away.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24170422/foundry-virtual-tabletop-interview-explainer-immersive<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="2nPUmb">I first got into <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23851111/baldurs-gate-3-dungeons-dragons-dnd-ttrpg-spell-slots">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, which naturally meant that my <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23156407/tabletop-gaming-online-tools-suggestions-maps-systems">group started online</a>. This was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/deals/21294556/dnd-how-to-play-dungeons-dragons-5e-guide-spells-dice-character-sheets-dm">particularly helpful</a> since most of my group members are spread across the world. Every few weeks, we gather on a Discord call instead of around a physical table to roll dice and tell stories. And usually, we do this via a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23352511/digital-tabletop-games-coming-soon">virtual tabletop</a>, a platform that allows us to move character tokens across a map, roll virtual dice, and (maybe most importantly to some of my group members) do basic math. </p>
<p id="KuaAGV">A couple of months ago, my Dungeon Master announced that we’d be trying something a little new for our next arc. Instead of logging in to our regular virtual tabletop, he sent over a strange-looking link and told us that our passwords were simply our first names. </p>
<p id="3y9Yb5">It took a second for us to figure out how to move our character icons and scroll around the screen, but once we did, we started to explore. We quickly realized that depending on where our character icons were on the map, we as players saw different parts of the map unfold. A few characters scouted ahead, while others lingered behind on the docks. A marketplace unfolded for those looking ahead, and the rest of us immediately scrambled to follow.</p>
<p id="7X3sCX">When we eventually entered our first battle on this new platform, and rolled our first attacks, we gleefully realized that there were animations to go along with them. My eldritch blast came out in a dazzling purple, shooting right at the sentient mushroom I was trying to hit. (And then we had a quick detour where we just spammed attacks to see how they came out, because it was all <em>so</em> cool). </p>
<p id="NRTuzp">We were all dazzled by Foundry Virtual Tabletop, as we learned it was called. And our DM seemed pretty jazzed to make the game more interactive. He’s always been passionate about pulling in voice modifiers and queueing up music, but with Foundry VTT, everything leveled up <em>just</em> that much more. </p>

</p>
<p id="of5LT2">Intrigued by the new possibilities on display, I chatted with Foundry VTT creator Andrew Clayton about the up-and-coming <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23156407/tabletop-gaming-online-tools-suggestions-maps-systems">virtual tabletop system</a>, which celebrated its fourth anniversary this month. Like many tabletop players, Clayton took his games online when in-person scheduling became difficult. The virtual tabletop options out there worked decently enough, but he couldn’t help but spot some lost potential. </p>
<p id="gVp9qK">“I found them to be sort of limiting in ways that I personally found frustrating,” explains Clayton. “And so since I was in a position of being between hobbies [and] between little hobby projects at the time, I kind of had the, I guess, hubris, you might say, to sort of ask the question of, like, <em>Well, what if I try to make something?</em>” </p>
<p id="wSU4iD">He never really intended to make Foundry VTT; but after experimenting, Clayton realized that there was something of value in there and he decided to pursue it further. One of his biggest goals was to push the immersivity of the virtual experience as far as possible. The possibilities with Foundry are much much higher than other VTT spaces.</p>
<p id="k5fhCC">On the game master’s side, Foundry VTT<em> </em>is a one-time purchase for DMs that lets them download the software and host a server for an unlimited number of players, who access it via a link. There is only one purchase tier, which includes all existing Foundry VTT<em> </em>features, all future updates, and no subscription fees. And unlike other virtual tabletop experiences, Foundry VTT doesn’t require players to sign up for anything. </p>
<p id="9w8IMH">Foundry VTT has all the basics you need for a virtual tabletop: character sheets, dice rolling (which does all the math for you), maps, and tokens to move around said maps. But the software also offers a chance for DMs to get <em>really </em>immersive, with dynamic lightning, visual and audio effects, and other features that make an adventure come to life. </p>

<p id="FkBElp">It’s all pretty invisible to the players. Now that our group is all in on Foundry VTT, we mostly move around our own icons, exploring the map and uncovering new elements as we go. Battles take on an extra level of cool when attacks bring up animations targeted to the enemies we click on. The basic elements of a virtual tabletop are all there, but just augmented and given more options for immersion.</p>
<p id="D8EvKR">In one particularly climactic moment, for instance, my group watched a snow effect fall across the landscape as a queen made a big announcement. And then, as she spoke, the snow turned gold — indicating a war on the horizon. We all gasped and howled (especially since we, uh, may’ve accidentally caused the war in the first place — whoops!). All of this was done via a particle effect already integrated within<em> </em>Foundry VTT (with the help of a few mods, adds my DM).</p>
<p id="rjwVjX">Mods are a key part of the Foundry experience. Clayton decided very early on that he wanted Foundry VTT to be super developer-focused, so that members of the community could create different mods for the existing software to help integrate their favorite game systems. As a mod developer himself, this was very important to Clayton. And opening the doors for mod developers to use Foundry as a springboard ended up fostering a particularly creative and passionate community — which ended up paving the way for the company’s first big partnership with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/23658946/imperium-maledictum-warhammer-40k-tabletop-rpg-cubicle-7-setting">Cubicle 7</a> for <a href="https://cubicle7games.com/our-games/warhammer-fantasy-roleplay"><em>Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay</em>’s fourth edition</a>.</p>

<p id="ex981F">“Huge IP, huge franchise, huge game system, huge publisher,” says Clayton. “By all rights that should not have been one of our first gets. [...] But part of the reason it did was the community developers who were making the Warhammer Fantasy system for Foundry had just done such a superlative job of making it an absolutely stunning visual game system that really authentically channeled the feeling of Warhammer. It was just such a strong sales pitch that got them excited and got them on board.”</p>
<p id="UXXiex">That first big win, built atop user-generated content, opened the door to other partnerships with publishers, including most recently D&amp;D publisher Wizards of the Coast. It’s a relationship that Clayton wasn’t sure would ever happen. </p>
<p id="iX0jZJ">“I’d actually kind of reached a point where I was comfortable with the fact that it might never happen,” Clayton says. “I guess that [resignation] was what it took for [the partnership] to happen.”</p>

<p id="HVezYy">I didn’t even realize how integral the official D&amp;D integration was until I thought back on how, when I add new spells to my sheet, all I need to do is search for them and click “add.” The information from the sourcebooks my DM owns is already integrated into the server. Since my campaign is mostly homebrew, with a setting concocted by my DM, we don’t heavily use existing reference materials, but Clayton showed me how easy it is to pull up source guides for specific games, campaigns, and settings. He also demonstrated how seamless it is to jump between different written material. It’s also very useful in showing information to just one person at a time (or a handful, depending on who gets to know), which makes the experience all the more immersive.  </p>

<p id="Oo54J5">Foundry VTT<em> </em>has a bit of a learning curve to it, something that Clayton readily admits. Even on the player side, there’s a <em>lot</em> going on with the UI, which makes it a little tricky to get used to.  But Clayton likens it to Photoshop or Canva. Foundry is a tool that ultimately has more freedom and flexibility once you get past the initial hurdle of figuring it out. </p>
<p id="DAnGQk">“I’m very aware of what Foundry can do,” he says. “What surprises me and really blows me away is when a community developer actually leans into that, and really takes advantage of it and pushes the boundary of what’s possible in a really exciting way.”</p>
<p id="ards2S">For instance, Foundry VTT is primarily meant to showcase 2D maps and spaces. But there are some people out there who’ve managed to use it to convey 3D environments. There are also developers who’ve managed to put together complex scripted sequences — way more than just turning some snow a different color — that fully utilizes the software’s audio and visual capabilities. </p>

<p id="QiQPJX">“We know that that [kind of custom work] can be done,” Clayton says. “But knowing it can be done, and then seeing someone actually take the time to make it and have it work that way is really, really inspiring.” </p>
<p id="q4Q9HI">So should your weekly in-person gaming group consider making the switch online? Clayton believes that there’s some aspects of virtual tabletops that actually eclipse in-person play. Maybe there’s a big encounter on the horizon and your DM wants to try and do something special. But even scheduling games between players can be made much easier, especially at a distance, when you’re doing everything online. (“That’s top of the list [of bullet points],” Clayton quips.) </p>
<p id="TXNdgS">But there’s also just the simple fact that mechanically dense games are easier to parse when the material can be readily accessible without having to crack open a sourcebook or pull up a bunch of FAQs and databases on the web. </p>
<p id="SkB7r7">Personally, as a player, what’s really stood out to me over the last several months is just how much Foundry VTT<em> </em>embraces its digital roots, enabling GMs to virtually build out their setting and make it as dynamic as possible. The online space isn’t a limitation; it’s a jumping-off point. </p>
<p id="55dRwQ">“The ceiling [for creative people] is much, much higher,” says Clayton. “I think people probably think of some of the spectacular sets that they have on a show like <em>Critical Role</em>, where it’s this amazing terrain and [custom] miniatures for every creature. [...] The amount of work and production effort that went into that happening is totally impossible for really anyone who’s not a professional company staging that production. But I think having something that’s approaching that level of immersion in a digital environment is much much easier [using a VTT].”</p>
<p id="BQ0Srv">For what the software can do, it’s not terribly demanding on a computer. As a player, it’s all integrated within a browser, so all I have to do is click a link. Of course, it does depend on how complex the GM wants to make the experience, but Clayton absolutely wants to make sure that Foundry VTT’s capabilities balance with its performance, without sacrificing one for the other. </p>
<p id="O2hGnM">“That’s something that I want us to double down on and continue investing in,” says Clayton. “So that that remains an area where we are the superior choice for a group that wants to tell a very visually rich, very immersive, very high-production-value sort of game.” </p>

<p dir="ltr">Escort mode also received a fix that previously caused an inaccurate timer to display when a player joined a match in progress.</p><p dir="ltr">The patch notes include adjustments for two killstreaks. The Cluster Mine streak should now properly contribute towards a player's killstreak earn progress, and the DNA Bomb is earnable by players using scorestreaks when they reach the streak's requirement of a 25 killstreak.</p><p dir="ltr">A small Zombies update addressed an exploit that previously allowed players to bypass the mode's stash size limits, and the DNA samples for the Critical Countdown Event can now be collected in Dark Aether Rifts.</p><p dir="ltr">On the Warzone side, the popular DG-58 LSW light machine gun was drastically nerfed, with the weapon's minimum damage decreased from 27 to 22, and the maximum damage range dropped from 29.21 to 17.78 meters.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer says this adjustment was made because the DG-58 LSW was "a bit too dominant at range," so a gradual damage falloff was added to keep the gun competitive at close-mid encounters, but it falls off slightly in long-range fights.</p><p dir="ltr">The update also changes the Season 4 Warzone Rewards challenge for Plunder. The challenge was previously requiring players to collect a specific amount of cash and not tracking progress, but the challenge has been changed to require players to complete 20 Plunder games instead. Hopefully, this new requirement is tracking properly.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/05/call-of-duty-mwiii-warzone-season-4-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Warzone</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.callofduty.com%2Fpatchnotes%2F2024%2F05%2Fcall-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-season-4-patch-notes&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fcod-warzone-and-mw3-patch-notes-include-major-dg-58-lsw-nerf-and-killstreak-fixes%2F1100-6523951%2F&amp;event_type=click" rel="nofollow ">Modern Warfare 3</a> can be found below, as shared by Activision.</p><p>In other Call of Duty news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-reveal-trailer-get-a-first-look-at-2024s-call-of-duty-game/1100-6523744/">Black Ops 6 has been officially announced</a>, and game details will arrive on June 9 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-announced-described-as-dark-new-chapter/1100-6523660/">during the Xbox games showcase</a>.</p><h3>GLOBAL</h3><h3>COD HQ</h3><ul><li>Prompt to restart the game after changing your Activision ID now functions as expected.</li></ul><h3>MW3 MULTIPLAYER</h3><h3>UIX</h3><ul><li>Bug Fixes  <ul><li>While the Looping Killstreaks modifier is active (Season 4.0), the earn progress HUD widget will now reappear after earning the highest Killstreak.</li><li>Corrected placeholder images in the Killstreaks and Equipment tabs of the Armory Unlocks menu.</li><li>Addressed an exploit allowing Custom Mods to be saved with multiple Attachments equipped to a single category.</li><li>Weekly Challenges menu now displays the correct Season 3 Camo name.</li><li>Tokyo map now displays the correct name in the Combat Record.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>PROGRESSION</h3><ul><li>Critical Countdown DNA samples will no longer appear in Private Matches.</li></ul><h3>MODES</h3><ul><li>Escort  <ul><li>Joining a match in progress will no longer display an inaccurate timer.</li></ul></li><li>Infected  <ul><li>Identity Theft Finishing Move now works as expected on Infected team members.</li><li>Inaccurate Scores are no longer displayed when a match ends with few players.</li><li>Fixed an issue causing matches to disconnect with a Connection Timed Out error.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Infected has returned to the Quick Play filter and Private Matches.</p><ul><li>One in the Chamber  <ul><li>Fixed an issue causing poor performance during the Final Killcam.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>WEAPONS &amp;

        <p>Founded by Michal Napora, publisher's first releases include Tensori's Pools and Void Within's Dystopika</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Games marketing veteran Michal Napora has announced a new publishing label, Unikat.</p>
<p>Based in Perth, Unikat aims to support independent developers "who create unique and minimal games," with Tensori's liminal exploration title Pools and Voids Within's upcoming cyberpunk city builder Dystopika already on its roster.</p>
<p>Napora is the founder and CEO of marketing agency 32-33, and has worked with studios including Bloober Team, Techland, and Frogwares.</p>
<p>"For the last year, I've noticed a shift in our industry – in what players play, how they behave and buy, how players and devs want to be treated, how our industry treats them, and what games can actually be," said Napora.</p>
<p>"It feels like there is a new wave coming, a new wave of ideas, patterns, behaviours, and expectations. I feel that this change is a great thing. However, new changes cannot be supported by old industry habits."</p>

		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/nixxes">Nixxes Software</a> has launched a new <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a> PC update for Steam and the Epic Games Store. Available to download now, the new patch includes a small number of fixes and improvements.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut - Features Trailer | PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EzWBNwhb870?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This includes fixing issues that have arose from using certain PC hardware configurations as well as making minor changes to the game’s addictive Photo Mode.</p>


<p>Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut arrived on PC last month, almost four years since the open world samurai sim originally launched exclusively on PS4. The Director’s Cut version includes the base game and its Iki Island expansion as well as other bonus content and the superb Legend online co-op. We decided to revisit the game on PC – via the Steam Deck – and have been impressed by the latest Nixxes port job with Valve’s handheld system being a surprisingly good fit, even if some aspects require dialling down for a smoother experience. For more on what’s included in the latest Ghost of Tsushima PC update, you can review the patch notes below.</p>

<p>Developer Player First Games has also added a new Rift to the Warner Bros. crossover fighting title, introducing PvE bouts centred around Friday the 13th’s Jason Vorhees. Rifts were added as part of the major MultiVersus relaunch as a way to offer more content for those who aren’t solely dropping into competitive online fights.</p>
<p>According to the studio: “Rifts mode is a way for all players to jump into MultiVersus and progress their skills, outside of our competitive PVP modes. Each Rift will have a sequence of battles or challenges around a particular theme, whether it’s The Joker infiltrating the Batcave or Batman and Velma teaming up to decide who’s the best detective. These themes will be organized around seasonal “Attunements,” such as Chaos, for the Clown Prince of Crime who is joining our cast in Season 1. The same way every MultiVersus battle is bubbling with character interactions, we wanted to make each Rift “Uniquely MultiVersus,” every season. ”</p>

<p>After an open beta access period in 2022, MultiVersus seemingly vanished from the face of the planet as Warner Bros. and Player First Games returned to the lab, pulling the game from all storefronts. While the revamp has certainly benefitted MultiVersus in some respects, Miguel wasn’t overly enamoured by the game’s return last month <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/23/multiversus-2024-preview-back-but-is-it-better/">in his write-up</a>. On one hand some of the game’s rough edges have been rounded off and the inclusion of singleplayer/co-op content helps bolster the overall MultiVersus package. However, the reduced tempo of combat has proven divisive and when it comes to monetisation, the game is no less aggressive in veering players towards buying content they’d otherwise have to grind tirelessly to unlock.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s still a long road ahead for MultiVersus and with Nintendo’s support for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate having ended, there’s hopefully room for Player First to improve and innovate within the platform fighting genre.</p>

            <p>It looks like The Last of Us Part 2 will be one of the next Sony games to make its way to PC.</p>
<p>According to reliable leaker Billbil-kun of <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/mais-quand-sortira-la-version-pc-de-the-last-of-us-part-ii-52283">Dealabs</a>, development on a PC release of Naughty Dog's sequel is complete. In fact, work on this port was allegedly tied up as of November last year.</p>
<p>Billbil-kun speculated Naughty Dog was refraining from announcing this PC port for now, in order to tie its release in with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-we-know-about-the-last-of-us-season-2">second season of HBO's The Last of Us TV adaptation</a>. The show's next series is currently slated to air sometime in 2025, and while it will not cover the entirety of the second game, it would likely bolster sales of any simultaneous release, making this a reasonable assumption.</p>

<p>Naughty Dog has already released its first instalment of The Last of Us on PC, packaging it up with its Left Behind DLC. Meanwhile, it released a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-is-getting-a-playstation-5-remaster-in-january">remastered and native PlayStation 5 version of The Last of Us Part 2</a> earlier this year. This Remastered release came with a few extra bells and whistles included, such as its all-new roguelike survival mode No Return and playable Lost Levels.</p>
<p>It would not be surprising to see The Last of Us Part 2 ultimately making its way to PC. Sony has been steadily releasing its once console exclusive games on Steam for several years now, and fellow PlayStation titles such as 2018's God of War and Horizon Zero Dawn have both seen their subsequent games added to the platform, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-next-sony-game-coming-to-pc">God of War Ragnarök set to arrive in September</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps The Last of Us Part 2's PC release is one of the "multiple single-player projects" studio head Neil Druckmann spoke of earlier this week. At this time, he also stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-will-not-be-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-neil-druckmann-says">Naughty Dog "will not be The Last of Us studio forever"</a>.</p>
<p>Towards the end of last month, PlayStation's Hermen Hulst shed more light on the company's strategy for bringing its games to PC. While the exec said live-service games will be released day and date on PC, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-explains-why-its-not-bringing-tentpole-games-to-pc-at-same-time-as-ps5">the team is remaining more "strategic"</a> with when it brings its single player and narrative driven titles to an additional platform.</p>

<p>A new report from prominent leaker Billbil-kun <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1798305767889711131">via Dealabs</a> claims that a PC port for The Last Of Us Part 2 is already under development.</p>



<p>Loosely translated, Billbil-kun adds that the PC port has been in the works since 2021. In fact, they claim that the port was already deep into development by November 2023.</p>



<p>It’s unclear exactly why Sony would wait on this port following the remastered release. However, Billbil-kun points out that there may be some attempt to tie into the HBO live-action series. </p>



<p>There is still a lot of hype for that show after the first season earned strong ratings. Just last month, Max also revealed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-season-two-new-images/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first couple of production images</a> from the upcoming season.</p>



<p>There’s been a lot of criticism over Sony’s PSN requirements. Last week, Sony officially confirmed that both God of War Ragnarok and Until Dawn <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-and-until-dawn-require-psn-account-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will require a PSN account</a> on PC. </p>



<p>However, PlayStation’s PC ports still build a lot of buzz. The Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut on PC even introduced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-trophies-overlay-coming-to-ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation trophies and an overlay</a>. Fans would likely be pleased to revisit The Last of Us Part 2 that way. It also adds a lot of incentives for completionists.</p>



<p>This week, fans were dismayed when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/naughty-dog-the-last-of-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Neil Druckmann stated</a> that Naughty Dog wouldn’t be a The Last of Us studio forever.</p>



<p>At this time, Sony has not officially confirmed anything about a PC port for The Last of Us Part 2.</p>

        <p>Digital outfits in games are shaping the ways we think about what we wear, but what does this mean for fashion brands?</p>

    </div><div>



            <p><em>This series of Playable Futures articles considers how the design, technology, people, and theory of video games are informing and influencing the wider world. You can <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/topics/playable-futures">find all previous Playable Futures articles here</a>.</em></p>
<p>For decades, the conventions of fashion and style were well established. The 20-year fashion cycle would reliably roll around, bringing various styles in and out of vogue on a two-decade loop. Various youth subcultures over the years – from punk and raver to goth and skater – would be framed by a blend of fashion, music and ideology. Youngsters would join those subcultures as a way to express identity and belonging, subscribing to them loyally for years, their self-imposed dress codes bubbling up to the catwalk, as high fashion simultaneously trickled down to the pavement from luxury brands. In the space between those two opposites, high street fashion and streetwear exist and persist, taking their cues from both subcultures and fashion houses.</p>
<p>In the late 20th century, the postmodern mindset would start to trouble those conventions a little, introducing concepts such as irony, pluralism and self-referentiality. Suddenly, things weren't quite so clear cut. Sociologists of style would argue that at the turn of the millennium, we began to be freed from the meanings certain clothing carried.</p>
<p>But postmodernism was just the start of a grand change. In the years that followed, video games established themselves as a true cultural phenomenon, and offered the worlds of fashion an abundance of opportunity, challenge, and change.</p>
<blockquote><p>"People from the world of fashion will increasingly be thinking of games as something like venues, or maybe destinations"</p></blockquote>
<p>For one, 'gamer' as a subculture of its own emerged, offering a broad, vibrant style palette informed by the things we play. Soon after, the fascinating phenomenon of the 'skinification of fashion' would radically shift the very notion of subcultures, meaning, and 20-year cycles. More on that below.</p>
<p>The largest shift, meanwhile, might be that of the opportunity for fashion brands to exist as part of the games people play, connecting with vast audiences while establishing years-long relationships with consumers.</p>
<p>That is something Tom Parry has seen happen across the world of fashion. His varied career kicked off in the media planning world in 2008, before eventually leading him to a contract role at Ralph Lauren, working as gaming strategy and project lead in the company's global digital marketing department. Parry would then move to serving as head of UMI Games, a specialist studio focused on connecting brands with the gaming audience through firstly Fortnite, Roblox, and soon Minecraft.</p>
<p>And for Parry, games are the natural place for fashion brands to congregate, both now and in the future.</p>
<p>"To a significant degree, as a fashion brand you have to go to where consumer attention is; you need presence in those places," offers Parry. "I think the attention of a lot of people has been towards social media over maybe the past 15 years, but increasingly consumer attention is turning to gaming. And thanks to gaming's maturity now, there's a huge built out ecosystem from content creators to players to streaming audiences to certain games emerging as platforms of their own, meaning the likes of Fortnite and Roblox.</p>
<p>"You've also got the industry's technology ecosystem, which is letting the people at the reins of these games serve and maintain these live spaces that games have increasingly become, while letting both players and creators share and host their own content."</p>
<p>Considering games' vast, demographically diverse, always-on and deeply engaged audience, fashion brands simply can't ignore games. And now – relatively, at least – making branded content for the likes of Fortnite is a straightforward process. Equally, placing a fashion brand in a game has been majorly derisked by the emergence of live services. Gone are the days of brand holders having to lay down high sums on content that makes up part of a boxed release, reaching audiences many months after the moment of a campaign's inception.</p>
<blockquote><p>"You can do something with fashion brands in games that you can't do in other ways"</p></blockquote>
<p>"I think people from the world of fashion will increasingly be thinking of games as something like venues, or maybe destinations," Parry continues. "They are places players visit and spend time. That's especially true of Roblox, while Fortnite has a bit more of a community-building element to consider. Younger demographics are hanging out in those games now – not necessarily playing – where maybe in the 1990s they spent that time at the skatepark, not necessarily skating. But these games as places are a chance to meet people from across the world, and discover culture and mix yourself up in it. And fashion has always been in part about that."</p>
<p>In other words, games are increasingly places fashion brands have to be, and where they can meet many different types of potential customer. And, curiously, it looks like we are set to see ever more high-end brands have a presence in games more commonly associated with younger players who sport shallower pockets.</p>
<p>"It's about a longer-term strategy than going to your immediate and existing audiences, and that's only going to become more true in the future," states Parry. "Brands are seeing that they need to start building that relationship with that consumer on what ultimately is a very low financial lift, perhaps long before that consumer might spend on the brand, versus the existing model of reaching them later in life. And there's increasingly older players in these games too, and it appears we'll only see these larger games offer ever more diverse audience. I think it's a bit of a scattergun approach for fashion brands. You can reach hundreds of millions of players globally in a very different, new way, in a very immersive way, really immersing the player in that brand and telling a very rich brand story. I think that is key.</p>
<p>"You can do something with fashion brands in games that you can't do in other ways. So it's ultimately about building that brand loyalty; building brand awareness. We had it working on the Ralph Lauren campaign. We found that lots of these players didn't know what or who Ralph Lauren was. It was a big shock internally. Everyone must know who Ralph Lauren is, right? But that wasn't the case. So even these huge, iconic brands need to keep fighting for presence and attention; maybe moreso in such a crowded brand landscape. And with that effort, within Ralph Lauren we also saw how games could engage people who would be loyal customers a few years later. This approach and mindset is going to become hugely important to fashion in the future."</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>The way players interact with skins in games like Fortnite is presenting new opportunities for fashion brands</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Parry also sees – and believes we will increasingly see – fashion brands of every size start to become more involved, with a broader sweet of games becoming embraced.</p>
<p>"For now there's a lot of focus by the bigger fashion brands on Roblox and Fortnite, and we're seeing increasing interest in EA FC and reaching older players through Call of Duty and so on. But as these bigger brands set the example of what's possible, I think that absolutely, we'll see fashion brands of every size start to work with quite a spectrum of games of all sizes.</p>
<p>"And we're seeing new platforms such as Discord born from gaming, and now they're beginning to branch out and to grow as more audiences come into this space. Discord and other equivalent platforms offer another opportunity for presence where audiences are. So gaming is creating all these brand opportunities that go beyond directly placing your content in a high profile game, and I think right now we're just seeing the beginning of how important games become to fashion – and arguably vice versa."</p>
<p>All of this presents a tremendous opportunity for games; especially as a movement that permeates the medium beyond the live service giants – and particularly at a time when the likes of in-game cosmetic items offer new generations means to explore and assert identity. Which brings us back to the 'skinification of fashion.'</p>
<p>The theory – <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CplXeGpLK7K/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">proposed perfectly here in digest form by trend forecaster and internet culture expert Agustina Panzoni</a> – suggests that the approach to dressing characters in games is starting to profoundly shape style choices in reality. It's part of a cultural movement called hyperrealism, which itself is in part informed by the prowess of game engines like Unreal to play with the space that exists between realism and representation (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/CoiWTnDsqt_/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">again, Panzoni sums it up best</a>).</p>
<p>The skinification theory proposes that video games have set a new standard, where we are free to hop between something like skins out here in the real world, rather than having to subscribe to a singular subculture or personal style for multiple years. That, it is suggested, explains the boom in fleeting fashion 'aesthetic trends' such as '<a href="https://www.russh.com/kidcore-trend-aesthetic/">kidcore</a>', '<a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Clowncore">clowncore</a>' and '<a href="https://coveteur.com/blokette-trend">blokequette/blokette</a>', each of which is giddily free of the cultural and ideological commitments once demanded by traditional subcultures. Now one can hop between these fashion trends day-by-day, or even hour-by-hour, swapping them like skins – embracing a movement that could potential diminish the 20-year cycle to a matter of moments.</p>
<p>"It's a fascinating concept, absolutely, even if it's not yet influencing the mainstream of fashion," concludes Parry. "But it seems to be at play in the evolution of fast fashion. There's every chance we're going to see games and their content directly influence all kinds of elements of fashion in the future, from the brands that succeed to the ways people think about how their clothes reflect who they are.</p>
<p>"It's a really exciting time to be in the space, and if you're in games, you already are."</p>

What interested you about making a game about running your own pizza shop?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Yuni Cho, community marketing manager</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Our CEO, Anthony Lai, grew up in Queens, NY, where people from all cultures and walks of life would eat and enjoy pizza as a universal food. One of his fondest childhood memories was going to a by-the-slice pizza shop and visiting the arcade store in his neighborhood, which later became an inspiration for the general “hole in the wall” neighborhood pizzeria mood of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Good Pizza, Great Pizza</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We were inspired to make a game with the same global and diverse reach through the eyes of pizza-making. After iterations </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>My Pizza Shop</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>My Pizza Shop 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Good Pizza, Great Pizza</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was finally born. Its unique structure combines a story-driven casual game, a technical business simulator, and a creative pizza-making mechanic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into designing gameplay around the actual crafting of the pizzas? What appealed to you about creating such a hands-on play style for making the food? What do you feel this hands-on play adds to the experience?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Anthony Lai, CEO and founder of Tapblaze</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: The initial team were big fans of pizza to begin with. The original artist even worked at Costco Pizza, and we were looking for an artist with a unique style that would appeal to a universal crowd. With the belief in pizza’s global reach and insight into how pizzas were made, we created the design for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Good Pizza, Great Pizza</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is beauty in the art of pizza-making. The dough acts as a canvas for whoever makes it. It’s an empty space where anyone can paint a picture, add their own flair, and express themselves while making an equally delicious pizza. The hands-on play allows players to personalize their experience and satisfyingly adds to the game’s realism. It’s important that a game gives players an opportunity to express themselves, and for us, that was pizza.</span></p><p>Images via TapBlaze.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The food looks pretty tasty as you play through </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Good Pizza, Great Pizza</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>.

The unique art style combined with the overall warmer tone of the game enhances the pizzas’ appetizing look. Each topping also goes through multiple concepts internally before they are put into the game. It is the “beauty in the details” that we believe makes the pizza in the game look so delicious.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cho</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Our focus is to keep the realism. Many of the pizza orders you see in the game are based on real pizza orders/menus like Supreme, Veggie, or Meat Lovers. We wanted to draw from the familiarity and nostalgia associated with eating pizza.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Through the game reviews from actual pizza shop employees, we seemed to have really nailed the realism of the customers in particular. Many would write us an app review on how much of a hoot they got out of some outrageous but very realistic customer requests, like no cheese or sauce on a pizza order.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The game’s Steam page mentions that the designer worked in a pizza shop for years and has brought that experience to the game. Can you tell us a bit about how that actual experience shaped the game? Any stories from your working years that made for interesting elements or storylines within the game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lai</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> The original artist worked at Costco Pizza and dreamed of becoming a game artist. But due to his lack of experience, no one had given him a chance. As a new game startup, TapBlaze saw the artist’s potential and considered his pizza-making experience as a bonus for the company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">His real-life experiences ultimately shaped the general feeling of the game. From the art style, color tones, and characters, the game is reminiscent of an “indie” game. Characters, like the fan-favorite hobo customer, often have a backstory where they become someone from nothing, just like our studio and the original game artist.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cho</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: We try our best to incorporate slightly modified versions of what we see in our daily lives. The diversity of the game’s characters is reminiscent of the customers our CEO saw when he used to hang out at pizza shops growing up. We also take inspiration from the people we encounter in our day-to-day lives; the mailman in the game is also the mailman who used to come to our office.</span></p><p>Images via TapBlaze.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into the cooking equipment players would use within the game and how they would be able to upgrade it? How did this equipment further capture a realistic pizza shop experience?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lai</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: The cooking equipment came from looking up what real-life pizzerias use to cook their pizzas. The pizza oven is based on the ones used in Costco and other pizza chains. The “autobuddy” upgrades available in the game came directly from the idea that Costco saves a lot of money using their auto saucer machine.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It aims to capture a realistic pizza shop experience since everything you see will be exactly like a mom-and-pop pizzeria. The topping bins, pizza peel, pizza boxes, and shop decor should remind players of their local pizza shop. The only difference is the auto buddies that add a game-like mechanic to magically place your toppings in the perfect spots quickly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>You state that there are over one million unique pizza orders possible in the game. What work went into creating so many different orders? How did you accomplish this?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Keyan Zhang, game designer</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: There are thousands of order strings broken up into four different parts. Essentially, these strings are randomized per pizza order to create an entirely new order from the last order the player came across. It is separated into toppings (with over 20 different ones to choose from), sauces, slice amounts, and additional customizations like double-baked pizza.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When you mix these components together to generate an order, more than a million types of orders could be generated.</span></p><p>Images via TapBlaze.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Players can heavily customize their shops in a variety of ways. Why was this important to the experience to you? What thoughts go into designing neat things players can use to decorate their shops?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cho</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> The customizable shop was and still is a very important aspect of the game’s charm. It is the #1 place where players can show off their style and personality, truly making the pizza shop their own. This is evident in the game’s reviews and communities, where players often share their excitement over their decorated shops with many “Rate My Shop” posts. It’s another form of creative expression for players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The artists are given a theme and different places the decors could go. After that, it’s up to them to create the magic. For example, Halloween 2021’s theme was “goth.” The artists designed a gorgeous table set, blood-red chandeliers, a molded oven, and burgundy “goth” decorations that fit the theme of a vampire’s castle.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>You continue to update the game with seasonal events and new content. What thoughts go into adding something fun to pizza-making around specific holidays and seasons? Can you tell us a bit about designing more toppings and items for a specific event you’re particularly proud of?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lai</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: First and foremost, we ask: “How can we make this pizza-style?” Whether it’s for Mother’s Day, summer, Halloween, or Christmas, the point is to make everything in the style of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mary Le, narrative designer at Tapblaze</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: The most recent topping additions were inspired by how different cultures interpret pizza; some have figs, some have avocados, and others may have duck. We try to widen our players’ perspectives and educate them about the pizzas people eat around the globe. A great way to do that is through new, exciting, and sometimes outlandish ingredients.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Zhang</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: We are particularly proud of the 2021 summer event, during which we introduced the avocado topping and gardening feature to the game for the first time. It was a great success as players were able to grow their own pizza ingredients, showcasing a true “farm-to-table” moment. Players loved it so much that we later added it as a permanent feature to the core game in chapters four and five.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The PC port of The Last of Us Part II was reportedly completed a few months ago, and it is not yet known why the game has not been released.</p>
<p>Earlier today, well-known reliable insider billbil-kun <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/mais-quand-sortira-la-version-pc-de-the-last-of-us-part-ii-52283">commented</a> on the PC version of the second entry in the series by Naughty Dog released earlier this year on PlayStation 5, saying that the PC port of the game has been in development since 2021, and it was completed by November 2023. As for why the game still hasn't been released, the insider could not say but speculates the release could have been held back to coincide with the launch of the second season of the HBO show, which is scheduled for next year.</p>
<p>The PC version of The Last of Us Part II will be based on the Remastered release launched earlier this year on PlayStation 5. With the additions of the No Return Mode, the Lost Levels, and the developer's commentary, it is the best way to enjoy the game, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-the-definitive-package/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered is, without a doubt, the best way to enjoy Naughty Dog's excellent survival horror game, thanks to addition of the surprisingly fun No Return roguelike mode, the cut Lost Levels, developer commentary and two display modes for a proper 4K resolution experience. The main campaign's bleak story remains as controversial as it was when the original game launched on PlayStation 4, but underneath it is one of the finest survival horror games ever made.</em></p>
<p>The Last of Us Part II is now available on PlayStation 4, while the Remastered release is only available on PlayStation 5. The game will be released at some point on PC.</p>

The Final Shape wraps up Destiny’s long-running narrative by taking players inside the Traveler for a showdown with the enigmatic Witness. This marks the climax of a decade of intricate Destiny storytelling, leaving fans curious about the future.  <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-cryptic-tweets-spark-destiny-3-speculation-as-expansion-the-final-shape-launches">Some are even speculating Bungie has Destiny 3 up its sleeve</a>.</p><p>For now, if you're looking to jump into the expansion and see what it has to offer, we have found the best deal available for those on PC. Destiny 2: The Final Shape is down to <a href="https://zdcs.link/rdwgX" target="_blank">$42.99 at Fanatical</a> (<a href="https://zdcs.link/V08K3" target="_blank">£35,69 in the UK</a>) a trusted steam code seller, and a 15% saving compared to the $49.99 list price.

The developer, now owned by Sony, is also working on the multiplayer game Marathon. In a series of tweets celebrating the release of The Final Shape, Bungie executive creative director Luke Smith discussed the journey to its release and the tremendous effort the developers invested. However, it was his repeated use of the capitalized word "Hope" that sparked a buzz within the Destiny community.</p><p>For now, the focus is on The Final Shape and its three planned episodes. Echoes kicks off next week on June 11, Revenant is set for October 2024, and Heresy rounds The Final Shape off in February 2025, although of course, the plan may change.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The Final Shape launched on June 4, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-developer-bungie-truly-sorry-for-the-final-shape-launch-issues">Destiny 2 quickly encountered major server issues</a> that hindered players from progressing through the highly anticipated campaign. Many players reported being kicked out of campaign levels, missing crucial cutscenes, and losing progress. Bungie provided progress updates via Twitter as they worked to resolve the issues, but for many players, the night was a loss.</p><p>Bungie has rolled out a number of restarts in a bid to tackle errors causing players to get kicked out of activities, which it said “remains our highest priority issue to resolve.” Those who missed a cutscene can replay the mission by accessing the Replayable Missions node in the middle of the Pale Heart map, Bungie advised. There are cutscenes at the end of Mission 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7.</p><p>“We built The Final Shape to be an exciting, cathartic, story-driven adventure for everyone to enjoy,” Bungie continued. “We’re truly sorry if connection issues and instability is getting in the way of that experience, and we promise to keep working until these issues are resolved.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Destiny 2: The Final Shape Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>We've also been raving around a similar DLC discount for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deal-elden-ring-dlc-before-release-day-pc-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree, which is down to $35.19</a>, also from Fanatical.

Blindspot is blind but possesses superhuman hearing and agility. Homelander, clearly unimpressed, bashes Blindspot’s ears in, declaring him “just another useless f***ing blind guy.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/mortal-kombat-1/How_to_Do_Brutalities">All Mortal Kombat 1 characters have Brutalities</a> — unique moves that end a match in a particularly brutal fashion. They’re triggered by doing an extra input command on top of a specific combo ender or move that wins the final round. Most of the characters in the game have six brutalities, but ever since Mortal Kombat 1 launched in September last year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-players-are-starting-to-discover-hidden-brutalities-including-one-for-omni-man"><u>players have discovered secret Brutalities, too</u></a>.</p><p>Homelander’s Brutality is similar to the ear bash he performs on Blindspot in the show, leaving his opponent screaming in agony on the floor. But, if Homelander performs this Brutality on Kenshi, he says the line from the show: “just another useless f***ing blind guy.” Kenshi, Mortal Kombat fans will know, is a blind swordsman who uses telekinetic abilities to defeat his opponents — and perfect fodder for Homelander’s quip.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Homelander has a unique line when performing a brutality on Kenshi. <a href="https://t.co/OQOgXxk32m" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/OQOgXxk32m</a></p>— Noah Hajnasr (@DIZZ_NH) <a href="https://twitter.com/DIZZ_NH/status/1798077214266974692?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 4, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>It's a cool nod to The Boys, but not everything about Mortal Kombat 1's Homelander is a perfect recreation of the on-screen character. For example, Warner Bros. has remained coy about the voice actor behind Mortal Kombat 1’s Homelander. Antony Starr, who plays Homelander in The Boys, does not voice the character, much to the disappointment of fans. Omni-Man voice actor J. K. Simmons reprised his role for Mortal Kombat 1, as did Peacemaker actor John Cena. It is unclear why Starr did not do the same here.</p><p>The Mortal Kombat 1 Kombat Pack includes the Jean-Claude Van Damme character skin for Johnny Cage (available now), and one-week early access to six playable DLC characters: Omni-Man (available now), Quan Chi (available now), Peacemaker (available now), Ermac (available now), Homelander (available now), and the upcoming Takeda Takahashi, as well as five DLC Kameo fighters. The Boys Season 4, meanwhile, kicks off June 13.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

</div><div>



            
<p>Silkbulb Test is a game in which, going by its demo, you are strapped to a chair and made to answer questions projected onto a screen. You answer the questions by looking ponderously down and pressing the big red and yellow buttons on the desk in front of you. The questions begin with relatively innocuous, CAPTCHA-style inquiries, such as "is this a door?" accompanied by a picture of a face. A few minutes later, there's stuff like "Are you alone?" and "Is it safe to be alone?" and "You are alone" and yep, time to smash Pause or better, throw the Steam Deck behind the sofa and go stare out the window for a while.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In the velvety darkness that surrounds the projection screen, you hear tinkly nursery music and other noises that are less tinkly and more squelchy or breathy and hey, it sounds like they're coming from behind you, and getting louder. "Hold shift to run" anytime now, Silkbulb Test. Hopefully, this is enough to catch your interest, because I couldn't bear to play much more of the demo (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2468250/silkbulb_test/">Steam link here</a>). What a relief to discover that it "should be considered an introduction and early tutorial to the world and is not representative of the gameplay for the full game."</p>
<p>Hang on, the full game sounds worse. It's an asymmetrical co-op and single player horror "experience". Players are called upon to explore "a mysterious, uncanny, and sunken place" in which "the creatures, the environment, and your own body want you dead". Just like shopping at Budgens, then. To make progress you must "harvest the minds of the Sunken Ones" and perhaps work with other unseen test participants, for "Silkbulb Test is about being alone, together". </p>
<p>Your principle tool in navigating these perils appears to be a customisable "Safe-T-Face". It works like Alien's proximity detector, alerting you to threats in the dark. Except that unlike Alien's proximity detector, it's a bruised and hairless disembodied head that sometimes appears concussed and sometimes gurns at you like a Barbie doll from hell. That's the Safe-T-Face in the header image, I think. No, not Wishlisty, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wishlisted">our purple mascot</a>, the other one. Those teeth! Too white, too white. Time to disconnect from the wi-fi with a vengeance and go look out the window again.</p>
<p>Silkbulb Test is one of the most striking shortform horror games I've stumbled on lately and I can't wait to absolutely never play the full thing. Developer Tim Oxton is a DreadXP alumnus: his past credits include the very affordable, well-received and equally disturbing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2840480/FLATHEAD/?curator_clanid=44760799">Flathead</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1952590/Future_Racer_2000/">Future Racer 2000</a>, the latter of which is possibly the worst of the lot for looking like a harmless exhibition of retro aesthetics.</p>

Having only recently had a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hands-on-with-frostpunk-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on with the utopia builder mode</a> of Frostpunk 2, I was keen to see where the story here would jump off from the original.</p>

<p>As I said in my earlier preview, you can look at the original as a launchpad for the sequel, as should be the case. As indicated in the Q&amp;A, the one thing 11 bit studios didn't want was to make a sequel that was essentially a retread of the original. When the room was advised to jump into the easy mode for this quick hands-on, I did what I always do and ignored them, going for normal, and I got the Frostpunk experience I expected - I fell. The first time, I didn't even get to the city for it to fall.</p>
<p>At the start of the campaign's tutorial, you find yourself trying to keep people alive after your dreadnought has crashed. I'm going to spoil something here, but survival is impossible. You want to try your best to survive, and your decisions will impact the core campaign and story, but as with anything in the Frostpunk world, the cold will kill you. I finished the tutorial on my third attempt without killing the elderly or the seals, a very proud victory after one failure and one minor seal-killing victory.</p>
<p>This brings us to the start of the campaign. Thirty years after the first game's events, New London is struggling. The city is essentially in ruins; the generator is down, and there isn't enough housing, resource gathering, or anything. You're the new steward and about as well-liked as Liz Truss. The initial vote of confidence can be won; fortunately, you do have something, and the promises you make to win that vote will have to be met, as well as any actions needed to survive the frozen wasteland.</p>

</figure>


<p>The core difference here is that your actions are naturally on a bigger scale. While I'm not completely sold on the city being in a near ruinous state after thirty years - though not beyond the realms of belief - it makes it difficult to jump right into the new idea of expanding beyond the original city limits. I would have preferred a scenario where your resources are depleting, and now it's time to expand, not one where the resources have depleted and it's gone to shit before expanding.</p>
<p>Not a big issue, not even an issue, just a niggle. So, in Frostpunk 2, you're going beyond your city limits and making districts in the nearby area. Think of them as specialist suburbs. You'll place a residential suburb to increase housing, a resource suburb to exploit resources, a food one to start farming, and so on. This is on a hex-based grid; before you can even place them, you have to use icebreakers to let you get to the terrain. It makes for a natural expansion despite my earlier niggle.</p>
<p>Each of these districts - we'll go by the correct name - can also hold a few unique buildings. The first you need to build in the original city limits is your council hall, where the politics of Frostpunk 2 comes into its own. As with before, you're passing laws and balancing the needs of factions. The difference now is that these factions pass your laws through a voting system, meaning you must sometimes haggle, barter, and promise to get something through. Even if it's objectively for the best, politics gets in the way, and sometimes, the promise is to let a faction decide what the next vote is on. Not always the best if they want something to pass you don't support.</p>
<figure>
<div>

<div>
		
		
		<p><span>2 of 9</span>
	</p></div></div>
</figure>


<p>It creates a constant battle where you're trying to keep factions happy and retain their trust in you while combating the terrible effects of the frozen world outside. Which is when you come to the outside world. Beyond the area where you will be expanding your city is the frostlands. Much like the first game, you can go out into the frostlands with expeditionary teams, but now there's more detail. You can see your units moving to where you've sent them, and as you uncover more, you may even have the option of building new outposts, which can act as settlements in their own right.</p>
<p>Everything I've tried in Frostpunk 2, from the earlier utopia builder to this hands-on with the early stages of the story, gives that feel of a natural expansion that should be found in a successful sequel. What was micro is now macro, but it still feels like Frostpunk. This is probably the best praise I can give to the game and 11-bit studios so far, and all I know is that I'm looking forward to playing the full game when it releases on the 25th of July for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

<p>Roguelike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wild-bastards">Wild Bastards</a> is the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space</a> western follow up to 2019’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/void-bastards">Void Bastards</a>. It takes some of that game’s ideas, mainly those related to shooty and looty, and reforms them into a largely different can o’ campfire beans. This time, it’s less focused on exploration, more on individual, tense shoot-outs. You collect a cast of weirdos, each with different guns and abilities, and form the deadliest dang posse this side of the last tactical overworld map you descision'd your way through. I like what I've played so far, although I think a lot is going to hinge on how much evolution the mid-game offers. As always, here’s a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1660840/Wild_Bastards/">Steam demo</a>, if you want to be all contrary and 'form your own opinions'. Pah.</p>

<p>The first thing you’ll want to do is whack mouse sensitivity as high as it’ll go. Seems as if Ol’ Jimmy Molasses has been gunking up the pistols again, varmint that he is. Once this is sorted though, Wild Bastards appears to have  pushed far more of its chips into the FPS pile this time around. You get two outlaws quite quickly, a spidery Pistolier and a robot with a large laser shotgun. I’m not too hot on the shotgun, but the spinny dual pistols feel pretty solid. There’s still a sense that, whether through engine limitations or design, Wild Bastards is a game that <em>includes</em> shooting, rather than being a dedicated shooter. Still, solid pistols.</p>

<p>I spend some of my first showdown hiding on top of a water tower, which elicits barks from my confused enemies. Feeling sorry for them, I eventually decide to return to the ground. I switch Bastards from pistol to shotgun, which is instant, so it basically just feels like switching loadouts. Except! Individual Bastards can get wounded, so it’s a bit like each of your guns having their own health pool. When the short showdowns end, you’ll enter the overworld map. Health carries over between showdowns, but you can find heals on the map  in between bags of money, upgrades, and other encounters. This incentivises you to either finesse each showdown as smoothly as possible, or switch out Bastards often so you get an even spread of wounds. The overworld map itself is styled somewhat like a board game, giving you a certain amount of movement points each turn instead of just a flat node hop.</p>
<p>Why does this movement limit matter? Because you’ll also be pursued by enemies as you move around. I finish the first map, do some upgrade stuff in space, then start the second.  Eventually, a no-good rotten treacle-bellied prairie dog-kissing varmint called McNeil arrives. He pursues me across the map, and the game tells me to avoid him. So, of course, I decide to run straight toward him to see what all the fuss is about. He manages to kill Spider Rosa. But! The duff-feeling shotgun turns out to be quite effective. I change tac from hiding out in a big pipe, and bunny hop over to McNeil and his horse, giving them old shell-to-face as I go. McNeil? More like McNeil, but dead! Did the game make McNeil deliberately weak to make me feel special, or I am just that good at Wild Bastards? I suppose I’ll learn more when the full game releases this year, September 12th 2024.</p>

			<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO is almost guaranteed to be released before the end of the year, judging from a legal document that's been circulated online.</p>
<p>As reported by Enomis on <a href="https://x.com/venixys/status/1798061147956076907?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X/Twitter</a>, Bandai Namco has six months to demonstrate the commercial use of the trademark or to request an extension, which apparently never happened with the latest games based on the series created by Akira Toriyama. As such, there's an extremely good chance Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO will be released before the end of the year, as suggested in <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-2024-release/">a new rating a few days back.</a></p>
<p>On a related note, it seems like one of the core features of the Budokai Tenkaichi series will be coming back in Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO. The game's<a href="https://store.playstation.com/it-it/concept/10007902/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> PlayStation Store listing</a> was updated today to include a 2-player local multiplayer tag, suggesting splitscreen multiplayer will be in alongside online multiplayer. This is great news, as the original listing on both the PlayStation Store and Steam did not list local multiplayer.</p>
<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. It is being said the release date will be officially revealed soon, so it won't take too long to learn if the new entry in the series will indeed launch in the next six months or so.</p>

            <p>
Flock - the sky-based shepherding game from Richard Hogg and Hollow Ponds described as an "ode to the joy of flight and discovery" - has landed itself a release date. 
</p>
<p>
Flock will be arriving across PC via Steam, PlayStation and Xbox next month, on 16th July. It will also be available day one on Game Pass. 
</p>
<p>
You can check out Flock's release date trailer, which has been styled as a David Attenborough documentary-like short, below.

<p>
On its release, Flock's players will be able to take to the skies as they charm a number of curious flying creatures such as Bewls and Cosmets to join their herd. There are also sheep to shear, and hats to knit.
</p>
<p>
"Starting with a small herd of hover-sheep, you nurture and fly them toward fresh, untouched pastures. Along the way, you will discover the secrets of the beautiful uplands and its wild creatures," the official blurb reads. 
</p>
<p>
I was rather taken with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/flock-feels-like-the-video-game-equivalent-of-throwing-open-the-window-for-a-breath-of-fresh-air">Flock's demo</a> when I gave it play earlier this year, describing it as "the video game equivalent of throwing open the window for a breath of fresh air".
</p>
<p>
For more, I also chatted with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hohokums-spiritual-successor-takes-flight-in-flock">Flock's creators Richard Hogg and Ricky Hagget</a> about their upcoming game, including what it is like to actually shear a sheep in the real world. Spoiler, it's harder than it looks.

<p>
Essentially, this is Square Enix plugging the gaps, so that both Octopath games will be available across all platforms.
</p>
<p>
Further, <a href="https://exputer.com/news/xbox/octopath-traveler-2-xbox-release-june/">Exputer</a> has reported Octopath Traveler 2 will be added to Game Pass too.

</p>
<p>
This would tie in with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">Square Enix's new plan of "aggressively pursuing" a multiplatform strategy</a> to diversify its earnings and allow more players to "enjoy our titles in regards to major franchises and AAA titles including catalogue titles".

</p>
<p>
What's more, at the Final Fantasy 14 Fan Fest event in Las Vegas last year, Xbox boss Phil Spencer took to the stage to announce the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-heading-to-xbox">MMORPG was heading to Xbox</a>. Square Enix CEO Takashi Kiryu also noted other games would be arriving on Microsoft's consoles.

</p>
<p>
The release of the Octopath games on more platforms is the next step in this multiplatform strategy, then, but whether the likes of Final Fantasy 16 or the Final Fantasy 7 remake trilogy follow remains to be seen.
</p>
<p>
The Octopath Traveler games each follow eight characters, as the name implies, in a traditional turn-based RPG that popularised the HD-2D graphic style. The games are perfect for any Final Fantasy fans who dislike the action combat of the latest games.
</p>
<p>
The HD-2D style is also being used for other Square Enix games, with the company teasing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-teased">remake of Dragon Quest 3</a> with this aesthetic.

            <p>
Destiny 2's climactic expansion The Final Shape is now available, bringing to a close 10 years of storytelling - but launch issues have meant many players missed key narrative moments.
</p>
<p>
A string of issues plagued last night's The Final Shape launch, which Bungie has now apologised for. These began with the game's usual traffic issues whenever a big update lands, but continued with further problems that saw players kicked out of the game mid-activity and mid-cutscenes. 
</p>
<p>
"I was wondering why the pacing felt so weird until I realised I had missed two entire cutscenes and had to look them up," one fan wrote on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1d8be3e/this_is_the_biggest_narrative_moment_in_destiny/">reddit</a>. "I understand and sympathise with server instability, but it feels so bad for the story experience to be harmed this much. I don't remember this being that much of an issue with previous expansions."

<p>
As a "temporary workaround", Bungie has said anyone affected can replay missions to then watch the cutscenes again at their end (there are five major cutscenes, at the end of missions one, four, five, six and seven). Alternatively, fans have already begun uploading the expansion's full story moments onto YouTube.
</p>
<p>
Regardless, this isn't how Destiny's decade of narrative was supposed to climax, and for that Bungie has apologised. 
</p>
<p>
"We built The Final Shape to be an exciting, cathartic, story-driven adventure for everyone to enjoy," the developer <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1d8gfie/the_final_shape_stability_update/">wrote</a> in a statement released overnight. "We're truly sorry for connection issues and instability getting in the way of that experience, and we promise to keep working until these issues are resolved."
</p>
<p>
While Destiny 2's narrative reaches a climax in the expansion, Bungie has already said there's plenty more Destiny to come. The coming year will see the launch of three DLC episodes to wrap up remaining plot threads - and after that, well, this was always just the end of the franchise's Light and Dark saga. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-3-discussion-swirls-following-accurate-expansion-leak">Leaks suggest work on Destiny 3 is already underway</a>.

            <p>A month after its early access launch, Supergiant Games has released a second patch for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-review">Hades 2</a>.</p>
<p>As with its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-hades-2-patch-aims-to-underline-melinoes-distinct-swift-style">first patch</a>, this update does not add any new content to the game, with its focus remaining on things such as bug fixes, general gameplay fixes (many of which were inspired by community feedback) and numerous tweaks to Daedalus Hammer upgrades. </p>
<p>
For example, Marauder Wallop has been removed from the game to be replaced with a staff upgrade known as Rapid Thrasher, which will allow for faster attacks.</p>

</figure>
<p>In addition, the developer has made some adjustments to the game's difficulty levels at certain points. Both the Trial of Heartache and Trail of Haste should now be a bit easier, the team said, following player feedback.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some boss fights have been tweaked slightly. One particular foe (won't say their name to avoid spoilers) has had several adjustments made to their fight, meaning there should now be "fewer instances" where they are "patently unfair".</p>
<p>Hades 2 players will now also be able to meet an additional Olympian each night. There is also a selection of new UI icons for things such as Keepsakes, Weapons, Well of Charon offerings and "more" included with this patch.</p>

            <p>Witchy roguelike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-release-date-details-everything-we-know">Hades 2</a> got a fresh update yesterday that sees a bunch of weapons getting stompier, thumpier, and, yes, whompier. It's like the hammer of Hephaestus himself was put to work on the entire armory. The Moonstone Axe's heavier attacks now channel faster, for one thing, which could make the most sluggish of the weapons a little more viable. I haven't had a go at the re-jigged bashing yet myself but I trust from these patch notes it will be subtly noticeable.  </p>
<!--more-->
<p>Apart from the sharpened edge of that axe, the twirling pain orbs of the Umbral Flames are also now "stronger and faster". Plus, fans of the stagger daggers will be happy to know slices from the Sister Blades now stagger foes for longer. Meanwhile, the Argent Skull, your morbid bowling ball of hurt, has got a wider field of damage when you do its dash-like Omega attack. The default pokey stick, the Witch's Staff, gets a simpler tweak: "Special knocks foes away, but is slightly slower." </p>
<p>The upgradey effects of the Daedalus Hammer have also seen a big change (the Daedalus Hammer is a heavy-hitting dinger that can alter your attacks when you find it during a run). A large number of its upgrades have been cut and replaced with new effects. I count eight new upgrades with six being removed. The Witch's Staff and the whirligig wound-making of the Umbral Flames seem to be the most affected here. So if you're a fan of those weapons, you might feel a significant difference as you get deeper into a run. One of the new upgrades for the Staff is called Mirrored Thrasher, and reads: "All your Attacks hit twice, but you take more damage". Ouch. But also: pow!</p>
<p>There are a lot of other changes, including alterations to some enemy behaviours (self-destructing Hippos are now more accurate) and some fixes to the menus. As is often the case with Supergiant patches, there are a lot of small but significant changes. Individually they seem minor but altogether they constitute a big ol' update. Very importantly, there is some extra dialogue for when you speak to your pet frog. "More voice lines should play when confiding in Frinos in certain contexts," the notes say. </p>
<p>You can read the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/4191241567727414432">full list of changes here</a>. Or if you have no idea what's going on and, for some reason, don't even know what this game is all about, you can read my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-early-access-review">Hades 2 review</a>. I like it!</p>

            <p>I've set aside some time this evening for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>'s latest expansion The Final Shape, which launched last night. My pal Liam suggested we play <em>this</em> evening because Bungie's servers would inevitably go up in flames the moment it launched. And what do you know? The right decision was made. Are we smug about it? Yes. Anyway, the good news is that Bungie have put out a few of those fires, though there are still a few bugs to fix.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a diary entry-style <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1798195541291188323">series of Xweets</a>, Bungie have jotted down things they've tackled so far and things they're working on. Those include sign-on issues and a range of errors with codenames that make them sound like very dubious makes of scented candle. Namely, "Honeydew" errors have been squashed, alongside "Weasel" and "Plum".</p>
<p>Bungie also began a <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1798220138917016001">rolling restart of their servers</a> at 8:45am PDT (4:45am BST) this morning. This has led to the extinguishing of a few more scented candles/connection problems, including "Currant" errors that kicked players from activities. However, pesky "Cabbage" and "Weasel" errors are back on the rise, and Bungie are continuing to monitor things until all is resolved.</p>
<p>Bungie say that if you've missed a cutscene thanks to these crashes and errors, you can always go back and replay the mission via the "Replayable Missions" node in the middle of the Pale Heart map (the new expansion area).</p>
<p>Reviews over on Steam are "Mostly Negative", unsurprisingly, as folks express their dismay at the server fire. Besides the obvious frustration, there's some positivity surrounding The Final Shape's campaign, with folks saying it's "a blast" and "leagues better than Lightfall", the previous piece of Destiny 2 DLC. </p>
<p>I'll report back on my Final Shape findings at some stage, as Liam and I shoot some triangles, plunge some orbs into sockets, and try out the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-2-the-final-shapes-game-breaking-subclass-detailed-in-new-bungie-video">Prismatic subclass</a>. I'm looking to mix Arc with Strand, for no real reason other than I like the idea of mixing electricity with Matrix goop.</p>

            <p>
Call me a Paranoid Android or a Suspicious Stanley, but when I ask a videogame developer a question and the videogame developer pauses for exactly 31 seconds and then says “no”, I tend to assume the answer is, in fact, “yes”. Or at least “it’s complicated”, to channel a bit of antique Facebook coyness. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-alters">The Alters</a> is a complicated game. It is a moody sci-fi extravaganza in which your character, beleaguered offworld miner Jan Dolski, has to create new versions of himself by branching off his own past timeline using a "quantum computer", splitting the chain of events at trigger points by, say, having his younger self stand up to his domineering father rather than leaving home. 
</p>
<p>
The result is a rolling space base full of alternate, vat-grown Jans, from bitter repairman Jans to aloof scientist Jans and all the many glittering gradations of Jan that lurk betwixt. The Jans have a hard time getting along, initially. The shared existential horror of everybody being a version of everybody else aside, they all represent each other’s roads-not-taken, a premise that leaves ample room for resentment, envy and contempt. But jolly along they must, in order to operate the aforesaid rolling space station and escape the apocalyptic planet they’re stranded on. Assuming you make the right dialogue decisions as Jan Prime, and ensure each Jan’s material needs are met while upgrading and expanding the station, this practical objective will produce a growing closeness, punctuated by swirly notifications about changes of emotional state, which feels like one big, baroque metaphor for a guy making peace with his own past and warring urges. 
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/5_DLKABC0.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>11 bit</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
It’s both a fun narrative setup and the makings of a production nightmare, to say nothing of the presumably enormous strain placed upon the vocal chords and mental coherence of Jan’s sole voice actor, Alex Jordan. There’s the intricacy of each Jan’s personality in itself, and then there’s the problem of writing up all their interactions, and how they might develop in response to each other - depending on which Jans the player decides to spawn in whatever order. 11 bit have managed this potential for overwhelming complexity by, firstly, only giving you charge of one Jan, the primary Jan who gets to sleep in the captain’s bedroom at the base’s heart, and secondly, by firmly resisting the temptation to do a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eD-dHzGmS4">Flanders family reunion</a> and conjure up a Jan for every genre or season. There are, as far as I can tell, no Janpunks, Cowboy Jans, Jan 3000 BC’s or other Expanded Janiverse misadventures in The Alters. 11 bit has limited the population carefully to keep the quality up and suit the particular narrative dilemmas they want to explore.
</p>
<p>
“We had the idea of what are the most important problems or maybe decisions that players can relate to, and built upon that was the decision of how many Alters do we want to have,” lead designer Rafal Wlosek told me. “We want to have enough Alters to talk about all those things, but not too many, so we wouldn't drown in in writing the shallow stories. So there are more Alters hidden [in the game] then you can find in one playthrough, but just enough for us to get deep into each type of decision and where they came from - what type of person will he become? What will he decide to believe in? How does it work for him in his life, for the people around him?”
</p>
<p>
Looking beyond the tension between multiversal storytelling and project management, the idea of duplicating somebody by reaching into their backstory and yanking levers has a certain amount of overlap with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/electric-nightmares">current discussions about generative AI</a> and its questionably legal and often intrusive reuse of data shared online. Jan is not the architect of the quantum computer – he is shocked to discover that it is loaded with his entire life history, with one character noting that he probably should have read the small print on his mining contract. 11 bit had a booth at their Alters hands-on event where journos could chat to AI-generated characters. When I asked Wlosek about this, however, he insisted that The Alters isn’t designed to offer “food for thought” on AI.
</p>

“There was a time when we were discussing the idea of an AI being part of the quantum computer - maybe creating a character out of this machine,” he said. “But we wanted to focus on one topic at a time. And we didn't want to, you know, put the spotlight on too many different aspects of sci-fi.” To be clear, the quantum computer AI would have been a written character, not a piece of text-generating software. “I think it was [conceived] before GPT showed up to the general public,” Wlosek added. “Personally, of course, I'm very interested in how things are going in this area. This is something that probably everyone who knows what's going on is interested in, and will be watching closely, but it’s not in this game.”

Among the broader strokes that differentiate one Jan from another is romantic history. Jan Prime has signed up for offworld mining duty partly because he’s broken up with his wife, who plays an active role nonetheless in the plot. One of the other Jans is from a Janiverse where his wife has died, and is naturally frantic to discover that she’s still alive in Jan Prime’s continuity. The topic of lovelives, together with the conspicuously cramped confines of the rolling space base and the emphasis on building a rapport with other Jans, got me wondering just how far Jan’s evident enormous self-absorption might go. Is it possible for Jans to romance other Jans? And with a view to getting ahead of the Rule34 crowd - can they bone?
</p>
<p>
“No they don’t,” Wlosek said, exactly 31 seconds later. “But it’s not like this topic is totally removed. The whole game or is about thinking about your decisions, about your life, going back to those decisions, if they were good or wrong, and dwelling on them, and maybe we want to show this from very different angles, to give the player the space to think about it. And in order to do that, we had to take a look at every aspect of life, so I guess that would be my general answer! It's not like having sex with the other Alters or anything like that, but the romantic relations of a couple of the Alters are very important, and not all of them are with women.”

			<p>Dragon Age Dreadwolf, the highly-anticipated next entry in the Dragon Age series, is said to be fully revealed later this week.</p>
<p>That's what Insider-Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/will-we-see-dragon-age-dreadwolf-at-summer-game-fest-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reports</a> based on insider reports. Although the outlet isn't entirely sure during which planned showcase Bioware's title will be revealed, it's likely that it will happen during Geoff Keighley's Summer Game Fest event later this week. "According to insider reports, which we’re working to corroborate, Dragon Age: Dreadwolf will receive a full reveal this week, likely during Summer Game Fest", the outlet writes. "Whether it happens during the Summer Game Fest Showcase, Xbox Games Showcase, or elsewhere, however, remains to be seen."</p>
<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-devs-pretty-confident-2024-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered</a> back in March of this year, the team behind Dreadwolf as well as publisher EA seemingly have been expressing to be pretty confident that the game will launch later this year, and that a reveal during the summer is likely. "<em>I suspect [Dragon Age] will probably pop up this summer", </em>Journalist Jeff Grubb wrote back in March<em>. "I don't know exactly when it will be shown is the real answer. I assume it will be shown sometime this summer, could happen at any time though. It will be released this year, last I heard. They're pretty confident about that. Doesn't mean it's a guarantee, could slip, but right now, internally, they expect to release it later this year.”</em></p>
<p>Earlier this month, Grubb <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-has-everyone-at-bioware-really-happy-with-how-it-turned-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also said</a> that the development team behind Dreadwolf is really happy with how the game has turned out. "<em>And they should have all of the details for that thing because everyone seems really happy with that game; they're pretty pleased with how it turned out", </em>Grubb said earlier this month<em>. "The plan is to launch that this calendar year, so not EA's fiscal year, not before March 2025 or anything like that, this year. And I don't think you're going to have to wait too long after this thing gets announced to play it."</em></p>
<p>Dragon Age Dreadwolf is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. We'll update you as soon as more information about the title comes in.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-capture-the-flag/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xdefiant-will-receive-a-%E2%80%98capture-the-flag%E2%80%99-mode-soon-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.889995/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-capture-the-flag/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>XDefiant’s first season update will reportedly introduce a Capture the Flag mode to the game.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/xdefiant-leaker-claims-capture-the-flag-mode-will-arrive-in-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoGamer</a>, datamined information has revealed some interesting details for XDefiant’s Season 1 update. Through a now-deleted post by X user <a href="https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1796702849792967131" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rogue TX</a>, the dataminer revealed that Ubisoft will introduce a new game mode in its Season 1 update.</p><p>The game mode in question is Capture the Flag, which we have seen primarily in games like Call of Duty, Team Fortress 2, Halo Infinite, Overwatch, and more as a staple gamemode. Of course, players should take this information with a grain of salt as it does not come from an official source, but as the account has seemingly been copyright stricken by Ubisoft, it does have some credibility. </p></div>

<div><p>Capture the Flag is a game mode that most multiplayer shooter veterans are well-versed with. The mode is simple, where players aim to capture the enemy team’s flag and bring it back to their base to score a point. The team with the most points at the end of the match or round wins the game – Simple!</p><p>At the moment, XDefiant has five game modes to explore: Occupy, Domination, Zone Control, Escort, and Hotshot. Adding Capture the Flag as a six-game mode will surely be a worthy addition to the game and could be a great addition to its future competitive scene.</p></div>



<p>Xdefiant is a free-to-play, first-person, multiplayer shooter by Ubisoft that has taken the world by storm. The game has been out for a little over two weeks now and has managed to gather more than 8 million unique players in that time. The game recently released its Y1S0.2 patch, which included fixes for Social features and other miscellaneous issues.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to a Capture the Flag mode in Xdefiant? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="183" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">New weapons always dominate the <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> meta at launch, but players have already had enough of Season 4’s Kar98k sniper rifle, and are begging Sledgehammer to nerf it. </p> <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="260" data-injectable="false">Season 4 has already seen <em>CoD</em> fans complain about <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-players-are-sick-of-old-guns-getting-nerfed-into-the-ground-every-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sledgehammer making old guns useless</a>, but the other side of that coin is that when they drop a new weapon, it’s often so powerful that it becomes the game’s most picked gun and is far too powerful. </p> <p data-characters="180" data-current-count="440" data-injectable="true">That’s the opinion that many have of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-kar98k-loadout-in-mw3-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kar98k</a> right now, with riversub calling the weapon “a menace” and “the definition of overpowered” on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernWarfareIII/comments/1d8eow2/kar98_needs_a_nerf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a>. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>A welcome return. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="597" data-injectable="true">“Yep, one-tap weapons should be high risk, high reward, but nearly all of them in this game aren’t,” agreed Grand-Article4214. “There are barely any risks for snipers, especially since they aren’t balanced to 150 health compared to every other gun in the game.”</p>
 <p data-characters="524" data-current-count="524" data-injectable="true">Icy-Computer7556 explained that they feel the gun has “ridiculous aim assist,” stating: “Anything with one-shot potential close or far should instantly be aim assist free. They did that in previous <em>CoD</em>s and it worked well. Skilled players kept sniping and sh*tters gave up because they realized they didn’t have the skill to just bloop everyone every second. I’m not saying I’m a good sniper, but the fact that it can slow down or pull on a gun like that? It’s f**king crazy.”</p>
 <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">For some though, the idea of nerfing the Kar98k is pointless because something else will take its place, with conanwongmkii writing: “It’s either the Kar98k, the Wardens, or the MORS sniper. Pick your poison, you can’t escape it.”</p> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="607" data-injectable="false">Personally, I find the Kar98k to be unbelievable in other people’s hands, but in mine it feels like I get nothing but hitmarkers. I’ve never been a great sniper though, so it may be my fault. Still, getting one-shot killed over and over again by people running the Kar98k is infuriating, and I’d love to see some balancing changes too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dark-and-darker-adds-free-to-play-option-with-some-limitations/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During yesterday's OTK Games Expo, South Korean developer IRONMACE <a href="https://www.darkanddarker.com/news/54" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the availability of a free-to-play option for Dark and Darker.</p>
<p>Free-to-play accounts have certain limitations, as you would expected. Players taking advantage of the free access will only get to create one character and only be able to enter Normal modes, although there are no limitations regarding maps. The goal is obviously to get more players into Dark and Darker while also providing the option to upgrade later to 'Legendary' status. All players who purchased the Standard and Founders Edition will be automatically upgraded to Legendary Status, by the way, and premium players will also have exclusive access to the Shared Stash between their characters.</p>
<p>That's not all the news IRONMACE shared yesterday. The studio also discussed some of the changes coming with the upcoming season, which starts in a few days.</p>
<p><em>One of the big changes is the reduction in the power gap for items. We have now removed all ‘Junk’ and unnamed ‘Unique’ items. Named ‘Unique’ grade weapons still appear but they now share the same stats and rolls as their ‘Legendary’ counterpart with only difference being the addition of their unique passive. We have also reduced the damage and armor rating values for all weapons and equipment at the upper end to make them less overbearing. We have removed random modifiers that were too valuable such as the +all attribute rolls and have lowered and tightened the gap for the remaining rolls. We have also diminished the movement speed penalty gap on armors to reduce the heavy reliance on move speed. Finally, we have added a flat HP boost to all classes to slightly improve survivability in battles. Please note that many of the perks, skills spells, and class balance remain to be tuned with this new philosophy in mind and will be adjusted in the future.</em></p>

<p>Dark and Darker, you'll remember, is the fantasy extraction game that first debuted on Steam in early 2023. It enjoyed great success for a while, but NEXON quickly filed a DMCA and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dark-and-darker-removed-from-steam-due-to-dmca-takedown-issued-by-nexon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had it removed from the store,</a> alleging that IRONMACE employees developed the game using 'trade secrets' from NEXON's unreleased P3 project. The lawsuit in American court was eventually dismissed last year, and Dark and Darker will soon launch <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/dark-and-darker-qa-c1e629" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the Epic Games Store</a>, but there's no confirmation regarding a return to Steam.</p>

Many reported being booted from campaign levels, missing out on crucial cutscenes and losing progress. Bungie tweeted progress updates as it worked to ease the problems, but for many players the night was a write-off.</p><p>On Steam, the user review rating for The Final Shape is, predictably, 'mostly negative'. "Best 40 bucks I ever spent and best two hours of my life... My favorite part was when Cayde said 'Destiny 2 servers are not available. Dismiss this message to try again,' " reads one review.

There are cutscenes at the end of Mission 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7.</p><p>“We built The Final Shape to be an exciting, cathartic, story-driven adventure for everyone to enjoy,” Bungie continued. “We’re truly sorry if connection issues and instability is getting in the way of that experience, and we promise to keep working until these issues are resolved.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We built The Final Shape to be an exciting, cathartic, story-driven adventure for everyone to enjoy.

Destiny 2 Steam concurrent players peaked at an impressive 315,285, a figure high enough to make the top five most-played games on Valve’s platform. Microsoft and Sony do not provide player numbers for Xbox and PlayStation.</p><p>The Final Shape concludes Destiny’s overarching story by placing the player inside the Traveler in a face-off against the mysterious The Witness.

        <p>Bespoke Pixel has raised $25 million in funding</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>A new development studio has launched in Barcelona, led by games veteran David Polfeldt.</p>
<p>Called Bespoke Pixel, the studio is currently in the process of assembling its core team, and has raised $25 million in funding as reported by <a href="https://venturebeat.com/gaming-business/david-polfeldt-opens-bespoke-pixel-game-studio-in-barcelona/">GamesBeat</a>.</p>
<p>Polfeldt previously worked at Ubisoft's Massive Entertainment for 17 years in various leadership roles, the longest serving as managing director from 2008 to 2021.</p>
<p>He was involved with franchises including The Division, Avatar, Far Cry 3, and Assassin's Creed Revelations.</p>
<p>Polfeldt left Massive in 2022 to work as a strategic advisor for PlayerUnknown and Disney before co-founding Bespoke Pixel.</p>
<p>"The opening of Bespoke Pixel in Barcelona reflects our confidence in the local gaming industry, as well as the city's supportive infrastructure" said Polfeldt. "As a newcomer, we hope to add a new dimension to Barcelona's incredibly rich cultural heritage."</p>
<p>He added: "We aim to create original intellectual property focused on refined and well-crafted gameplay. We are forming a small and agile team, initially dedicated to prototype development. We will harness the extensive experience of the core team to deliver top-tier gaming experiences."</p>
