<p>Mario &amp; Luigi vs. Bowser Jr.</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>At The Game Awards, Nintendo and Illumination surprised fans with another look at the upcoming <strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>.</p>
<p>It features Bowser Jr. taking on Mario and Luigi in a very brief teaser. Some not-so-pleasant introductions are exchanged, and before you know it, the younger Bowser is smashing everything in sight. Fortunately, Luigi steps in to save the day (and Mario).</p>
<p>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is scheduled to arrive in theatres next year in <strong>April 2026</strong>. This latest teaser follows the announcement of the new movie in November, along with an official trailer reveal. You can see the first video in our previous story.</p>
<p>This wasn't the only video game movie trailer shared at The Game Awards this year. Capcom also showed off a first-look at its live-action <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/street_fighter">Street Fighter</a> movie.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/highguard-the-game-awards-announced-titanfall-apex-legends/</link>
            <guid>1381309</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>While <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/tga-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a> always has plenty of its trademark “World Premieres,” usually only a few of them are legitimate surprises. Leaks, or just common sense, often spill the beans ahead of time. Well, this year the big show ended with a completely under-the-radar announcement – Highguard. This new PvP raid shooter is coming our way from a number of the original creators of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/titanfall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/apex-legends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apex Legends</a> who broke away from Respawn Entertainment to form the new studio Wildlight Entertainment.</p>



<p>Highguard looks like it’s going to be pushing a lot of different ideas at once, with tons of different powers in the mix, although the thing people are probably most likely to pick up on is that you can shoot people while riding a dang horse. A horseback shooter – it’s one of those things you never knew you needed until you see it with your own eyes. Check out the debut trailer for Highguard for yourself, below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Highguard | Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y_6tjMvckZ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Is Highguard primed to be the next breakout indie-developed shooter ala something like Arc Raiders? That's a tough call to make, but it certainly has the pedigree behind it and looks to be throwing a lot at the wall. You can't say this one is playing it safe, that's for sure. T<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he game’s Steam page is up</a>, with this rather basic description of the game attached…</p>



<p><em>“From the creators of Apex Legends and Titanfall, comes Highguard: a PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent. Battle rival Warden crews for possession of the Shieldbreaker, then break into and destroy the enemy base to secure territory in this all-new breed of shooter.”</em></p>



<p>Highguard is coming to PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5. We won’t have to wait too long to find out exactly what kind of game it is and what level of potential it has, as it will be launching on January 26, 2026. The game will be free to play.</p>

              <p>Tonight the 2025 Game Awards took place, and like every year, millions of people tuned in for a glimpse into the next few years of games. The Los Angeles event may have “Awards” in the name, but for most people, it’s an extended E3-style press conference hosted by Geoff Keighley. If you weren’t able to catch the live show and want to know all the World Premieres you missed, we’ve got you covered. Here’s everything we saw at the 2025 ceremony.</p> <h2><em>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</em></h2>  <p>After some awards and a&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur</em> musical performance, we got the first trailer for <em>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic </em>by Arcanaut Studios. The game is a single-player action RPG, and ex-BioWare director Casey Hudson, who is known for his work on the original&nbsp;<em>KOTOR&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>trilogy, is returning to&nbsp;<em>Star&nbsp;</em><em>Wars</em> for the project.</p>

 <h2><em>Divinity</em></h2>  <p>After lifting a bunch of people off the ground,&nbsp;<em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> developer Larian revealed what the mysterious statue Keighley had been teasing all week was for: a new entry in the <em>Divinity </em>series. All we saw was a pretty brutal cinematic trailer of a man being burned alive in front of a crowd of cheering cultists, but that didn’t go very well for them. See for yourself by watching the full trailer. Damn. Pretty gnarly for this early in the show, huh? The game will apparently be even bigger than&nbsp;<em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, and that’s pretty daunting.</p>

 <h2><em>4:LOOP</em></h2>  <p>After a lovely speech from Best Performance winner Jennifer English, we saw a new shooter/roguelike from Sony and Bad Robot called <em>4:LOOP</em>.</p> <h2><em>Coven of the Chicken Foot</em></h2>  <p>Next up is the debut game from Wildflower Interactive, led by ex-Naughty Dog director Bruce Straley. The narrative adventure game stars an older woman and a strange plant monster as they work together to survive. However, it looks like their relationship might not be entirely smooth sailing, as the monster appears to turn on the woman at the end of the trailer.</p>

 <h2><em>Ontos</em></h2>  <p>Fractional Games and Kepler Interactive were up next with a new look at <em>ONTOS</em>, a new first-person horror game that’s got some fucked up body horror shit happening. But this is the same team that made <em>Soma</em>, so that’s not surprising. It’s coming out in 2026.</p>

 <h2><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em></h2>  <p>For the Hoyoverse sickos, a new character for&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero </em>was revealed.</p> <h2><em>2XKO</em></h2>  <p><em>2XKO</em>, the&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>fighting game, is coming to consoles in January, and Riot showed off a quick glimpse of Caitlyn as she’ll appear when she joins the roster.</p>

 <h2><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></h2>  <p>Next we got a new look at&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, and my husband Old Leon Kennedy was in this one. I didn’t hear a word anyone else said over the wedding bells. But you can watch it yourself. Game looks sick.</p>

 <h2><em>Order of the Sinking Star</em></h2>  <p><em>Order of the Sinking Star</em> is a fantasy puzzle game from <em>Witness </em>and <em>Braid </em>developer Jonathan Blow. It has over 1400 puzzles and is coming in 2026.</p> <h2><em>Exodus</em></h2>  <p>Oh right, Matthew McConaughey is in this one.&nbsp;<em>Exodus&nbsp;</em>is an upcoming sci-fi action RPG shooter that looks like it’s trying to fill the <em>Mass Effect</em>-shaped hole in your heart. It’s from&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>company Wizards of the Coast, so it’s got a pretty notable legacy behind it. We’ll see if it lives up to it when it launches in early 2027.</p> <h2><em>Warlock: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></h2>  <p>Wizards of the Coast isn’t done, though, as&nbsp;<em>Battlestar Galactica&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>star Trisha Helfer took the stage to introduce&nbsp;<em>Warlock: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. The cinematic trailer confirmed the game will launch in 2027, with a proper gameplay reveal to come in 2026.</p>

 <h2><em>Control Resonant</em></h2>  <p>Remedy showed up to announce the sequel to 2019’s <em>Control</em>. After an elaborate stage show that was probably a seizure hazard, we saw a cinematic trailer that I’m sure was comprehensible to those who finished the first game. It’s coming in 2026, and you can read <a href="https://kotaku.com/control-2-is-a-trippy-character-action-game-set-in-a-twisted-nyc-2000650168">more details about this bold, unusual sequel that Remedy shared with us here</a>.</p> <h2><em>Gang of Dragon</em></h2>  <p>Next, the trend of bloody trailers continued with <em>Gang of Dragon, </em>the first game from Nagoshi Studio, led by Toshihiro Nagoshi, one of the former leads behind the <em>Yakuza&nbsp;</em>series. It definitely feels in line with his previous work on Japanese crime dramas, so&nbsp;<em>Yakuza&nbsp;</em>fans will probably feel right at home.</p>

 <h2><em>Street Fighter&nbsp;</em>movie</h2>  <p>We’re taking a break from games for a moment with the first look at upcoming the <em>Street Fighter </em>live-action movie. There wasn’t a whole lot to glean about the story, but there’s plenty of punching, kicking, and other mayhem. Several members of the cast were present, and I am a total mark, because this totally got me. I’m ready to boot up&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6 </em>right now&nbsp;but there’s still like, two hours of this show left. Jesus.</p> <h2><em>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</em></h2>  <p>Geoff had an extended conversation with a Batman minifig before showing off a new look at <em>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</em>. That game is basically a new&nbsp;<em>Arkham</em>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-preview-arkham-2000633994">what I played of it earlier this year was pretty dope</a>.</p> <h2><em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>hour</h2>  <p>After an hour of teases, we finally got to see the next&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>game. The announcement began with a cinematic trailer in which Lara shoots up some scavengers, and it sounds like Alix Wilton Regan, known for her work as the Inquisitor in <em>Dragon Age</em>, is voicing her this time around. Good for her. The game is coming in 2027.</p>

  <p>After this, we saw footage of <em>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</em>,&nbsp; a remake of the original game from the ’90s. We got to see a little bit of Lara doing cool acrobatics and shooting up a dinosaurs, so she’s still doing what she does best. This one is coming in 2026.</p> <h2><em>Forest 3</em></h2>  <p>Next, we saw a moody trailer for&nbsp;<em>Forest 3 </em>which&nbsp;for a second I thought might be <em>Half-Life 3</em> because the logo started with the “3.” That one’s on me. My bad.</p> <h2><em>Invincible VS</em></h2>  <p>The&nbsp;<em>Invincible </em>fighting game is coming in 2026, and we have our first look at new fighter Ella Mental.</p> <h2><em>Orbitals</em></h2>  <p>Next we saw a short trailer for co-op game <em>Orbitals</em>, which&nbsp;<em>Kotaku&nbsp;</em>managing editor Carolyn Petit described as “anime&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>,” and that’s a pretty apt comparison.</p>

 <h2><em>Diablo IV</em></h2>  <p>After Mephisto, a big ol’ demon, roasted the audience on stage, Blizzard revealed <em>Diablo IV</em>‘s next expansion called <em>Lord of Hatred </em>with a grody cinematic trailer. It’s coming on April 28 and bringing <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4s-second-expansion-adds-new-classes-and-big-changes-2000652722">some new classes and big changes to the game</a>.</p> <h2><em>Marvel Rivals</em></h2>  <p>After a long-ass wait, Deadpool is finally coming to&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>. The merc with a mouth debuted with a stylish animated trailer, but unfortunately NetEase didn’t bring any gameplay with them to show us how he’ll play in-game. He’ll join the game next season in January, with Elsa Bloodstone to follow after.</p>

 <h2><em>007: First Light</em></h2>  <p>In a new trailer we see that Lenny Kravitz is playing the villain in the upcoming&nbsp;<em>James Bond&nbsp;</em>game&nbsp;<em>007: First Light</em>. This will be the musician’s first video game role.</p> <h2><em>Lords of the Fallen II</em></h2>  <p>Next up is the first gameplay trailer for fantasy-soulslike sequel <em>Lords of the Fallen II</em>. The original game also has a new update out today.</p> <h2><em>Saros</em></h2>  <p>Housemarque and actor Rahul Kohli showed up with a new trailer for the upcoming roguelike shooter <em>Saros.</em> The trailer focuses on the game’s story and characters, and the game is coming to PS5 on March 20.</p>

 <h2><em>No Law</em></h2>  <p><em>No Law&nbsp;</em>looks like&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>‘s baby brother. Literally can’t think of another way to describe it.</p> <h2><em>Total War: Warhammer 40k</em></h2>  <p>David Harbour of&nbsp;<em>Stranger Things&nbsp;</em>fame showed up to announce&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer 40k</em>, because he’ll be in the game. The beloved strategy series is crossing over with <em>Warhammer 40k</em>, which means the Venn diagram of some of the sickest of sickos is converging when the game launches.</p> <h2><em>Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve</em></h2>  <p>Bandai Namco was up next with&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve</em>, the next entry in its flight combat series. It’s launching in 2026.</p> <h2><em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em></h2>  <p><em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>fans are eating tonight, as they’re soon getting not only an RPG, but also a racer. <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em> will let you live out your podracing dreams in 2026.</p>

 <h2><em>Out of Words</em></h2>  <p>If a stop-motion co-op platformer that’s probably gonna make you cry sounds like something you’d jive with, <em>Out of Words&nbsp;</em>is probably for you. It’s coming next year.</p> <h2><em>Phantom Blade 0</em></h2>  <p>Next, we got a lengthy look at&nbsp;<em>Phantom Blade 0</em>, S-GAME’s upcoming wuxia action game. It looks like the kind of challenging, twitchy hack-and-slash you want from something like the modern day <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> games. It’s coming to PS5 and PC on September 9.</p> <h2><em>Mega Man Dual Overdrive</em></h2>  <p>As we start to wind down, Capcom announced a new&nbsp;<em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>game called <em>Dual Overdrive</em>. After a brief gameplay clip, the company announced it will launch in 2027.</p> <h2><em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em></h2>  <p>We got a short clip of the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> in which Mario and Luigi face off against Bowser Jr. Luigi does get a pretty good knee to the kid’s face.</p> <h2><em>Highguard</em></h2>  <p>Closing the show was&nbsp;<em>Highguard</em>, a new fantasy shooter by Wildlight Entertainment, a studio led by ex-Respawn folks who worked on&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Titanfall</em>. You can see some of that DNA in here with its focus on traversal and quick movement, which its mixing with its fusion of modern and fantasy weaponry. The game will launch on January 26, and is free to play.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Our Story Will Haunt You</strong></p><p><em>Saros</em> is the ultimate evolution of the Housemarque gameplay-first experience. In our trailer at The Game Awards we focus on our mysterious and monstrous story and show how we are taking things to the next level. This is our biggest and most ambitious story yet at Housemarque.</p><p><em>Saros</em> is the haunting story of a lost off-world colony on Carcosa under an ominous eclipse. You play as Arjun Devraj, a powerful Soltari Enforcer who will stop at nothing to find who he is looking for.</p><p>You may have noticed a mysterious corridor and bedroom which you will need to explore. In the interest of protecting our mystery I will let the trailer share what we want to share about our story so you can discover it ahead.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Arjun Devraj is performed by the brilliant Rahul Kohli, but he is not alone. We have an incredible ensemble cast of NPCs that deepen Carcosa’s world with their own perspectives and personalities for you to discover.</p><p><strong>Our Ensemble Cast Pulls You Into the World of <em>Saros</em></strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Saros_12-11-25_002.jpg"></a></figure><p>For fans of Selene Vassos from <em><a title="Games > Returnal [20 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/returnal">Returnal</a></em>, the one and only Jane Perry is back as Sheridan Bouchard. Jerome Jackson is performed by fellow Aussie Ben Prendergast (<a title="Games > Tyr" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/tyr">Tyr</a> in <em><a title="Games > God of War (2018) [176 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/god-of-war-2018">God of War</a>: Ragnarok</em>), Sebastian Torres is performed by David DeSantos, and you can hear the fantastic Adriyan Raye (<em><a title="Games > South of Midnight [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a></em>) and Shunori Ramanthan in our trailer too. We have even more amazing cast members to share, they have all been exceptional.</p><p>You will meet our ensemble cast of NPCs in the Passage, our hub where you start each run, or in the world where you explore and discover their haunting stories through conversations, Soltari Hologram logs or audio logs.</p><p>Expect hard- hitting performances from our actors and narrative team at Housemarque to pull you into our new world with <em>Saros</em>. Our goal is to create an emotional, haunting, and powerful character study that explores the cost of what it takes to create a new future.</p><p><strong>Our Spectacular Bullet Ballet returns</strong></p><p>It would not be a Housemarque trailer without some bullet ballet. We hope you loved a sneak peak at Prophet and some action gameplay against Carcosan flora and fauna. As Arjun you will have to overcome a variety of hostile creatures and uncover their dark secrets by the end of our cinematic journey.</p><p>We also showed off a new ability, Parry, where with perfect timing of R1 you can reflect certain projectiles back at enemies, destroying or staggering them. It feels awesome to use and it’s another way we are taking out action to the next level.</p><p><strong>Digital Deluxe and Pre-Order Editions: 48- Hour Headstart With Digital Deluxe</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Saros_12-11-25_003.jpg"></a></figure><p>For players who want the deluxe <em>Saros</em> experience: you will be able to play <em>Saros</em> 48 hours before launch with our Digital Deluxe Edition. This stunning Digital Deluxe art shows some of the ancient murals found in the game and our worldbuilding.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Saros_12-11-25_004.jpg"></a></figure><p>For those playing with the Digital Deluxe edition, they will be able to play <em>Saros</em> with our <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [49,182 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> Studios celebration suits, featuring <em>Returnal</em>, <em>God of War</em>, and <em><a title="Games > Ghost of Yotei [12 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a></em>-inspired Enforcer suits for Arjun. Playing as Arjun with an ASTRA suit is awesome, and as a huge fan of Sony Santa Monica and <a title="Companies > Sucker Punch Productions [159 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-group-corporation/sony-interactive-entertainment/sucker-punch-productions">Sucker Punch Productions</a>, it’s an honor to have their worlds merged with ours for Digital Deluxe players.</p><p>For players who pre-order <em>Saros</em> or <em>Saros</em> Digital Deluxe you can unlock the “Hands of Shore Armor.”</p><p><strong>Come Back Stronger in 2026</strong></p><p>Following today’s deeper look at our storytelling, we also wanted to share an update on our launch timing. To make sure that <em>Saros</em> exceeds our vision, <em>Saros</em> will now release on April 30, 2026.</p><p>We cannot wait to share more about our game, how we push the PlayStation 5 hardware, and more from everyone working on S<em>a</em>ros.</p><p>Expect more news next year as we get closer to our launch, with a focus on our “Come Back Stronger” systems, eclipse escalation, and more extended gameplay for you all to enjoy.</p><p><em>Saros</em> is the next single-player, cinematic action game from Housemarque and our amazing collaborators.</p><p>A dream project made by a dream team.</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/saros-delayed-to-april-30-2026]]></content:encoded>

Not only that, the game will be playable in a few weeks.</p><p>A gameplay trailer showcased that Highguard leans into Apex Legends' hero shooter formula but takes it in a different direction, opting for an objective-based raid shooter as opposed to a kill-or-be-killed battle royale. The narrative direction of the game is different too, opting for something that looks more high fantasy (like horses, magic, and pet familiars) while still maintaining that science-fiction flair when it comes to the various characters' abilities and firearms.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Highguard | Official Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>On <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, Highguard is described as a "PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent. [Players will battle] rival Warden crews for possession of the Shieldbreaker, then break into and destroy the enemy base to secure territory in this all-new breed of shooter."</p><p>Highguard isn't pulling an Apex Legends and launching as it was announced, but it is coming very soon. The shooter is scheduled to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on January 26. Like Apex Legends, the game will be free-to-play.</p>

                <p>To probably no one's surprise, Sandfall Interactive's turn-based RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" data-ref-id="5000-631965">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> won Game of the Year at this year's The Game Awards (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2025/1100-6536771/" data-ref-id="1100-6536771">as well as GameSpot's Game of the Year accolade</a>), and the team delivered a heartfelt thank you to "the unsung heroes of this industry," YouTubers. Hold on, let me explain.</p><p>Game director Guillaume Broche took to the stage at the end of The Game Awards to accept the GOTY trophy on behalf of the team at Sandfall Interactive. While commenting that the outfit--a traditional French garb replete with a black-and-white striped shirt and a red beret--started as a joke and thanking the team, publisher Kepler Interactive, and the cast, Broche had a couple more people in mind to give special thanks to.</p><p>"And also, I want to extend [my] thanks to the unsung heroes of this industry," he said during his roughly five-minute speech. "The people who make tutorials on YouTube on how to make a game because we had no idea how to make a game before. So, thank you."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDraAxp-Wp8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WDraAxp-Wp8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>After giving TutorialTubers their flowers, Broche then gave a "personal thank you to an important man." That man is none other than Hironobu Sakaguchi, a Japanese game designer and director best known for Chrono Trigger, the original Final Fantasy games, and Super Mario RPG. Basically, the father of turn-based PRGs.</p><p>"[He] made me fall in love with his games and inspired me to become a game dev," Broche continued. "So, thank you, Mr. Sakaguchi."</p><p>Of course, Broche also spent some time giving a "massive thank you" to the players for everything: the covers, the fan art, the "endless arguing about which ending is the good one." And as a way to show that gratitude while fulfilling a promise, Broche confirmed that Expedition 33--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-made-the-game-awards-history/1100-6536918/" data-ref-id="1100-6536918">which broke records for winning the most awards in The Game Awards' history</a>--now has a free update that adds some new content to the game, including weapons, quests, buffs, and a bunch of other stuff.</p><p>And that concludes this year's The Game Awards. Over four hours of announcements and awards have come to a close. GameSpot has the roundup of everything you need to know and might have missed from the showcase, from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/#1" data-ref-id="2900-7341">the biggest announcements</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/#1" data-ref-id="2900-7258">the biggest winners</a>.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Neon Giant, Swedish developer of cyberpunk shooter-RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-ascent">The Ascent</a>, has unveiled its new game No Law at The Game Awards 2025. The game is in development for PC, PS5 and Xbox S/X, and will be published by South Korean company Krafton. There's currently no release date.</p>
<p>No Law takes the action first-person, whereas The Ascent was quasi-isometric, and creates an experience which looks superficially like CD Projekt Red's blockbuster <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. However, as I discovered talking to the team before the TGA reveal, No Law will be a more condensed kind of experience, and one made by a much smaller team - there are 24 people working on the game there.</p>
<p>"We focus a lot more on making something that feels more deep and dense and layered," studio co-founder Tor Frick told me in an interview, "instead of making it very big. So the actual physical footprint on a map for Port Desire, where this takes place, is pretty small by open-world standards. We don't really have any open fields; we don't even have big parking lots. It's not about going to that mountain over there, it's about: there's an open window up there, or that rooftop looks interesting. It's more about that kind of scale and that kind of exploration."</p>
<p>Vengeance is the aim in No Law. You play as a retired military veteran called Grey Harker, who's living a quiet life, a bit like Jon Wick, when trouble finds him again. And how you go about exacting that vengeance is up to you. "The narrative is nonlinear," Arcade Berg, another studio co-founder, with possibly the coolest name ever, told me. "We encourage you to figure out how you want to solve everything yourself, and we will make sure that the game responds to that - responds to how you choose to play, be that playstyle or certain decisions you make."</p><p>A large part of No Law will feel familiar to people who play immersive sims such as those made by Arkane, like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deathloop">Deathloop</a>, although without the time-looping mechanic of course. "It can be fairly similar to a lot of these games that you're thinking about," Berg told me, "especially when it comes to the gameplay. I am an immersive sim fan - basically everyone in the studio is. If you want to play it that way, you should. The game will be great. That is one way to play the game." But, he added, there is also a story-led way to enjoy the game if you prefer a more linear shooter experience.</p>
<p>No Law will have dialogue choices and character ability customisation and development. There will also be varying ways you can approach combat, be it via stealth, hacking, or kicking the front door down and charging head-first in. "We will give the player all the tools," said Frick. "We will never tell you when to use them or not use them. It's completely up to the player how to tackle each scenario."</p>
<p>Neon Giant's previous game The Ascent was released in 2021 to middling reviews. "The Ascent's arcology setting is splendid, if heavily derivative - shame that all you can do here is gun and grind," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-ascent-review">wrote Edwin in Eurogamer's The Ascent review</a>.</p>

<p>Here's a first look at the gameplay</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Perhaps one of the biggest surprises of The Game Awards this year was the announcement of <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mega-man-dual-override">Mega Man: Dual Override</a></strong> for the Switch and Switch 2. It will be releasing on Nintendo systems (and other platforms) at some point in <strong>2027</strong>.</p>
<p>Along with this news was a first look at the gameplay, it doesn't really show all that much, but it does appear to feature the same type of platforming action fans know and love. Here's Capcom's official description to go with it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Mega Man returns in 2027 with a brand-new entry in the classic action platforming series! Override challenges and blast down legions of robots while springboarding across a new array of futuristic frontiers!"<br></em></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Apart from this Mega Man news at The Game Awards, Capcom also announced the sci-fi title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a> will be coming to the Switch 2 early next year. There'll also be an amiibo and a demo released in the future.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/">The Game Awards 2025</a> have come and gone, and the heavyweight favourite, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, did not disappoint. It went home with the most wins of the night, including some of the bigger awards like Best Art Direction, Best Score and Music, Best Narrative, Best Game Direction, and of course, Game of the Year.</p>



<p>Because Clair Obscur came into the show with 12 nominations (10 if you only count one of its three Best Performance nominations), and it won most of its categories, there weren't really other standout games. It was Clair Obscur's night, through and through, as it nearly swept The Game Awards, winning 9 out of 10 possible awards.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 was the only game to beat Clair Obscur, taking home Best Audio Design and keeping Sandfall Interactive from the full sweep. That said, it technically also lost to Wuthering Waves in the Player's Voice category, so make that 9 of 11 possible wins.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight Silksong was able to walk away with one win, and South of Midnight picked up a win as well. ARC Raiders also took home the award for Best Multiplayer game, and No Man's Sky grabbed Best Ongoing game. And while the <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-announces-divinity-the-game-awards-2025/">more exciting part of the night for Larian Studios was its reveal of Divinity</a>, it also took home Best Community Support for Baldur's Gate 3.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of winners from tonight's The Game Awards 2025.</p>

			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/total-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Total War series</a> has gone a lot of places over the years, from every corner of real-world history you could imagine, to the fantasy realms of Warhammer, but now the folks at Creative Assembly are kicking it up a notch and bringing the battle to the grimdark future. Yes, that’s right, at <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/tga-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a>, Creative Assembly officially revealed Total War: Warhammer 40,000 (with some help from Stranger Things’ David Harbour).</p>



<p>The trailer included first gameplay footage, which looks suitably intense, and the scope looks impressive, with the camera zooming out at the end of the trailer to show that the battle will be unfolding over multiple planets. You can check out the trailer for yourself, below.</p>

<p>T<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4199910/Total_War_WARHAMMER_40000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">otal War: Warhammer 40K’s Steam page is up now</a>, revealing the game’s four factions:</p>



<p><strong><em>“Space Marines:</em></strong><em> Genetically enhanced weapons of war, these warriors are few in number but near unmatched in power. Clad in sacred armour and wielding the Imperium</em><em>’</em><em>s most deadly weaponry, each strikes with devastating and unyielding precision.</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Orks:</em></strong><em> Brutish hordes of destruction, they are unrelenting, countless and live for war. Storming the battlefield in endless mobs, they brandish unpredictable weapons and clanking war machines - all driven by the primal power of the WAAAGH!</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Aeldari:</em></strong><em> An ancient and waning xenos race, who once ruled the stars, but now rail against their certain fate. Swift and elusive, they strike with psychic precision and elegant weaponry, exploiting weakness before vanishing into shadow.</em></p>



<p><strong><em>Astra Militarum:</em></strong><em> The massed ranks of humanity</em><em>’</em><em>s largest fighting force are a bulwark of flesh and steel. Their legions of soldiers' march beneath the roar of battle-tanks and the thunder of artillery, grinding enemies into ruin with disciplined fury and sheer determination.”</em></p>



<p>Total War: Warhammer 40,000 has been announced for PC. A release window has not yet been revealed, which means we'll likely be waiting for a while.</p>

			<p>Blizzard was one of the studios that took over the <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/">The Game Awards 2025</a> stage tonight with its announcement, which was the reveal for Diablo IV's next major expansion, Lord of Hatred, which is due to arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this coming April 28, 2026.</p>



<p>Lord of Hatred follows the game's last major expansion, Vessel of Hatred, and is "<em>the climax of the Age of Hatred</em>," according to a press release. Players must fight back the forces of Mephisto as they now have the run of the Sanctuary, and players will be pulled towards an ally they can't trust, but will have to work with.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The expansion adds two new classes, a Paladin class and a second class that has yet to be revealed. It also adds a new region of Skovos, a reworked skill tree, a new loot filter, enhanced crafting, a new powerful talisman, and player-driven war plans.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/">When Blizzard announced its roadmap for 2025 this past April</a>, this expansion arriving in 2026 was one of the final updates the studio had already set in stone, including a new ranking system, leaderboards, and more that Blizzard wasn't ready to share at the time. Hopefully, we'll hear more about its 2026 plans soon.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-systems-galore/">Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo reviewed Vessel of Hatred when it arrived in October 2024</a>, at the time writing, "<em>Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred is a solid expansion that is perhaps not heavy on content but more than makes up for it with many systemic changes that will elevate the whole game for years to come</em>."</p>

<p>That <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-40000-reveal-likely-after-telltale-words-40k-spotted-in-creative-assembly-video">furious cyborg face in Geoff Keighley’s bottom</a> was telling the truth! Creative Assembly <em>are</em> making <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> 40,000, a new era for Twar that looks to take the Total War strategy map/battle map format and apply it to whole solar systems. They got David Harbour to announce the game at the Geoffies just now. There was a moment of pure, ecstatic terror when I thought they were making Total War: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stranger-things">Stranger Things</a>. Harbour wouldn’t have left the stage alive. But no, don’t worry, he’s here because he’s voicing some unit or other. Catch a cinematic intro and just a tiny bit of footage in the announcement trailer, below.</p><!--more-->

<p>So far, the only factions on show are the Space Marines and the Orks, but they've elsewhere confirmed that the swift and psychic Aeldari are joining the party, plus the human tank corps of the Astra Militarum. I wouldn’t be surprised if this were the first game in another Total Warhammer-style trilogy, with other factions like the Necrons and Tyranids showing up over the course of a decade, but let us not preoccupy ourselves with such grimdark prospects for the moment. Let us speak of Bolters.</p>
<p>The big question is whether Creative Assembly can handle a strategy game with this many projectiles and vehicles. The trailer embraces the prospect pretty confidently, showing an accelerated food chain of large, armoured entities getting shat on by other, larger, armoured entities. We also see an orbital bombardment, and the suggestion of real-time zooming transitions between planetary surfaces and the galaxy map. I’m still trying to work out which Marine or Ork is David Harbour (who, we should probably note, is <a href="https://www.marieclaire.co.uk/celebrity-news/millie-bobby-brown-on-david-harbour">embroiled in harassment allegations</a> seemingly lodged and then walked back by Stranger Things co-star Billie Bobby Brown). I assume it wasn’t that wee turret boi who got his face melted.</p><p>There's a little extra on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4199910/Total_War_WARHAMMER_40000/">the Steam page</a> about unit customisation. "Tailor your faction’s combat philosophy for both campaign and battle, arming them with your own unique fusion of devastating tactical abilities, signature traits, and arcane wargear," it reads. Where is my "leave all the figurines unpainted as a form of psychological warfare" option.</p>

<p>There's a lot of Twar going around at the moment. Creative Assembly's anniversary showcase last week also saw them revealing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-medieval-3">Total War: Medieval 3</a>. That one's currently in early pre-production, and will let you rewrite medieval history with your tactical smarts. Think of those <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBP5NUDP28A&amp;t=1s">YouTube videos</a> which assess how the fall of Constantinople affected basketball players LeBron James' legacy, except LeBron's Richard the Lionheart or Saladin.</p>
<p>Medieval 3 and the new Warhammer 40,000 game will run on Warcore, the latest iteration of Creative Assembly's engine. There's the promise of tools "designed to bring the medieval era to life in ways we’ve previously never been able to achieve". As regards Medieval, we here at RPS expect to be able to tweak all of the individual buboes on the bodies of our soldiers. As regards Warhammer 40,000, we'll settle for some less kite-suspectible AI. You can't kite a Terminator - it's probably blasphemy.</p>
<p>Not to be forgotten, Total War: Warhammer 3 also has some extravagant DLC on the way - dubbed Lords of the End Times. It'll add in uber-necromancer Nagash and three other legendary lords.</p>
<p>And that's the totality of Creative Assembly's warring for the moment. On to more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/the-game-awards">Game Awards</a> things. Alternatively, why not read about Creative Assembly's big non-strategy project, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alien-isolation-is-getting-a-sequel-10-years-later">the sequel to Alien: Isolation</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/mega-man-dual-override-trailer-capcom-2000652829</link>
            <guid>1381216</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>What’s the most surprising thing about <em>Mega Man Dual Override</em>? That it exists? Or that it’s still coming to last-gen consoles when it launches in 2027? Capcom revealed its classic icon will return to its roots for another 2D adventure and I’m hopeful it will be <a href="https://kotaku.com/mega-man-11-the-kotaku-review-1829453857">more impressive than<em> Mega Man 11</em></a>.</p> <p>We only got a brief teaser at the Game Awards but it was enough to appreciate that Mega Man has a fresh 2.5D look in what otherwise appears to be a very traditional spin on the Blue Bomber’s formula. He jumps! He shoots! He get’s knocked back when he gets hit. What more do you want, folks?</p>

 <p>Here’s the snippet of gameplay we got:</p>  <p>Why am I more hopeful this time around when Capcom has otherwise failed to reinvigorate the franchise in the past? Well, <a href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-pragmata-mega-man-conspiracy-theory-debunked-2000621414">the Capcom of today</a> is different from the Capcom of the mid 2010s. It’s shown a commitment to both quality control and experimenting with cool ideas even if they aren’t going to be commercial juggernauts, like last year’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/kunitsu-gami-path-goddess-game-pass-capcom-1851606852"><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em></a>.</p> <p>The 2027 release date tells us this project is still early on in production, however, and I’m guessing it’s got a relatively small team. Maybe it can at least throw in a few fresh ideas and get the ball rolling on a wider resurgence. It would be great to see <em>Mega Man X</em> also come back, or get that new 3D <em>Mega Man</em> fans have dreamt of for decades now. Until then, I’ll settle for a modern day rematch against the Yellow Devil or an equally cheap boss fight.</p>

              <p>And so, another Game Awards is done. Geoff Keighley’s annual trailer-a-thon once again included some game awards shoved in between all the ads, teasers, and more ads. If you want to know who won what (and who lost) at the 2025 Game Awards, we’ve got you covered.</p> <p>Perhaps you didn’t watch the awards this year? Maybe you did, but missed the rapid-fire announcement of certain winners? It can be tricky to keep up with how fast awards are handed out at this show. Geoff needs more time for pricey trailers! Regardless of all that, here’s a complete list of the Game Awards 2025 winners and losers:</p> <hr> <h2>Game of the Year</h2> <ul> <li><strong><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 – Winner!</em></strong></li> <li><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em></li> <li><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></li> <li><em>Hades II</em></li> <li><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></li> <li><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em></li> </ul> <h2>Best Game Direction</h2> <ul> <li><strong><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 – Winner!</em></strong></li> <li><em>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</em></li> <li><em>Ghost of Yōtei</em></li> <li><em>Hades II</em></li> <li><em>Split Fiction</em></li> </ul> <h2>Best Adaptation</h2> <ul> <li><em>A Minecraft Movie</em></li> <li><em>Devil May Cry</em></li> <li><strong><em>The Last of Us: Season 2 – Winner!</em></strong></li> <li><em>Splinter Cell: Deathwatch</em></li> <li><em>Until Dawn</em></li> </ul> <h2>Best Narrative</h2> <ul> <li><strong><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 – Winner!</em></strong></li> <li><em>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</em></li> <li><em>Ghost of Yōtei</em></li> <li><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em></li> <li><em>Silent Hill f</em></li> </ul> <h2>Best Art Direction</h2> <ul> <li><strong><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 – Winner!</em></strong></li> <li><em>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</em></li> <li><em>Ghost of Yōtei</em></li> <li><em>Hades II</em></li> <li><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></li> </ul> <h2>Best Score And Music</h2> <ul> <li><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></li> <li><em>Hades II</em></li> <li><strong><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 – Winner!</em></strong></li> <li><em>Ghost of Yōtei</em></li> <li><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em></li> </ul> <h2>Best Audio Design</h2> <ul> <li><strong><em>Battlefield 6 – Winner!</em></strong></li> <li><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></li> <li><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em></li> <li><em>Ghost of Yōtei</em></li> <li><em>Silent Hill f</em></li> </ul> <h2>Best Performance</h2> <ul> <li>Ben Starr</li> <li>Charlie Cox</li> <li>Erika Ishii</li> <li><strong>Jennifer English – Winner!</strong></li> <li>Konatsu Kato</li> <li>Troy Baker</li> </ul> <h2>Innovation In Accessibility</h2> <ul> <li><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></li> <li><em>Atomfall</em></li> <li><strong><em>Doom: The Dark Ages – Winner!</em></strong></li> <li><em>EA Sports FC 26</em></li> <li><em>South of Midnight</em></li> </ul> <h2>Games for Impact</h2> <ul> <li><em>Consume Me</em></li> <li><em>Despelote</em></li> <li><em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp;

              <p>A second<em> Star Wars</em> game was announced at the Game Awards 2025, but this is very different <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-rpr-kotor-fate-of-the-republic-2000652729">than a single-player RPG.</a> Instead, <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em> is an intense racing game from some former <em>Burnout</em> devs.</p> <p>Developed by Fuse Games,<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/former-criterion-leaders-set-up-new-aaa-games-studio-fuse-games"> a studio formed in 2023</a> by some longtime former Criterion devs, <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em> looks like a spiritual successor to <em>Star Wars: Episode I Racer.</em> Here’s the first trailer:</p>  <p>And yes, at the end of that trailer, that is indeed everyone’s favorite, no-good alien podracer, <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-galactic-racer-reveal-trailer">Sebulba.</a></p> <p>“There’s so much love for Sebulba on the team and across the&nbsp;<i><em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em></i>community,” &nbsp;Fuse Games co-founder Matt Webster said. “There are particular reasons why he finds his way into our trailer as well as a detail in this shot that may lead to even more questions…the answers to which we’ll have to leave to another time!”</p>

 <p>Interestingly, according to Webster, Galactic Racer will also feature some rouglike elements as players make choices on their journey to become the racer in the galaxy.</p> <p>As for when this game is set, <em>Galactic Racer</em> takes place after the fall of the Empire in the same time period as the sequel trilogy. The game, as well as Sebulba, will launch in 2026 across consoles and PC.</p>

<p>Star Wars Galactic Racer was announced today with a new trailer and is set to arrive for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2026. </p>



<p>The Game Awards was a good day for Star Wars fans, as earlier in the event, Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-shockingly-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a>. Now, it has been revealed that the event had not one but two Star Wars game announcements, and the new one falls surprisingly in the racing genre. </p>



<h2 id="h-star-wars-galactic-racer-releases-2026">Star Wars Galactic Racer Releases 2026</h2>



<p>Star Wars Galactic Racer comes from Fuse Games, Secret Mode, and Lucasfilm Games. The team consists of the people who are responsible for bringing us Burnout and Need for Speed games. Interested readers can check out the announcement trailer for Wars below: </p>

</p></figure>



<p>The official description of Star Wars Galactic Racer states that it is “a runs-based, high-stakes reinvention of racing born in the lawless Outer Rim of the Star Wars galaxy.” The Empire is gone, and the galaxy is rebuilding, leading to the creation of the Galactic League. This league is an “underground, unsanctioned circuit where syndicates bankroll chaos and champions are forged.” The game will be available to wishlist from today. </p>



<p>In other news, a full remake of Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2: The Sith Lords was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-2-remake-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly in development</a>. Additionally, Quantic Dream has stated that Star Wars Eclipse development “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/quantic-dream-says-star-wars-eclipse-development-continues-alongside-a-new-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continues</a>” alongside a new game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Phantom Blade Zero is finally coming out in September 2026. The news comes from a new trailer shown during The Game Awards, which showcases thrilling gameplay</p>



<p>Revealed in 2023, Phantom Blade Zero follows an assassin tasked with locating the killer of The Order’s patriarch. Mixing the gameplay of Soulsborne titles and RPGs, its combat system and graphics look top-notch. Insider Gaming even went <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phantom-blade-zero-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on with the title</a> earlier this year, calling it a ‘day-one purchase’ and ‘a great time’. It was announced that a date would be announced for the title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phantom-blade-zero-release-date-announcement-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier last week</a> for The Game Awards. Now, fans can mark their calendars for September 2026.</p>







<p>This story is currently in development and will be updated once more information is available.</p>

<p>In the trailer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhxdG_-e1zM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shown above at The Game Awards 2025</a>, fans get a sneak peak at the intense combat and visuals. It certainly rings familiar to other titles like Black Myth: Wukong. Many story elements also come to pass, sporting an origin story of sorts for the protagonist. However, at the end, the official release date for Phantom Blade Zero is shown: September 9th, 2026.</p>



<p>It’s clear the team at S-Game is fairly confident in the final product. In many previews, the wuxia-inspired combat system and stunning visuals were a highlight. If it can live up to other Chinese games like Black Myth: Wukong and Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, Phantom Blade Zero has the chance to hit it big. Soulslike or not, it’s sure to gain some traction when it releases in September 2026.</p>

            <guid>1381195</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"We asked our community just how far we should push the gore."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Lords of the Fallen II publisher CI Games has shown gameplay footage of its Soulslike sequel during The Game Awards 2025, featuring new character Omeuras and enemy limbs flying everywhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of tonight's showing, IGN asked CI Games for more detail on what we'd just seen, keen for more detail ahead of the game's  launch at some point in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most prominent in the trailer is Omeuras, who CI Games creative strategist Ryan Hill told IGN is one of the sequel's central characters. She's brought to life by Hannah Melbourne, who previously played Agrias Oaks in Final Fantasy Tactics, and The Sorceress in Path of Exile 2.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/11/1-4-1765476366423.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">"With the sequel, we wanted to craft a narrative that's more accessible and character-driven, while still honouring the environmental storytelling that Soulslike fans love," Hill said. "Players who want to dive deep into the lore absolutely can, but we also want every player to reach the end of the game understanding the journey they've taken and the pivotal role they've played in shaping this world."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another key focus in the trailer is Lords of the Fallen II's new dismemberment feature, which allows you to lop limbs off enemies like nobody's business. Lords of the Fallen has never been squeamish with its blood and guts, but its developers say they have heard the call from fans for even more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When we asked our community just how far we should push the gore in the next Lords of the Fallen, the answer was loud and unanimous: 'go all in'," Hill noted. "This is a game made by adults for adults, and we didn't want to dilute the brutality or intensity of that experience. Soulslikes thrive on challenge, and that rush you get when defeating an enemy is unlike anything else. Enhancing that moment with a dynamic dismemberment system takes the satisfaction to another level - instead of enemies simply ragdolling to the floor, players can literally tear them apart."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, can every limb be removed? "Yes - every limb can be removed."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Tonight's showing for Lords of the Fallen 2 comes just hours after CI Games launched a final surprise update for its predecessor, capping off almost two years' of post-launch support that has helped turn player sentiment around. While those updates have been welcomed, CI Games said it had learnt from the experience, and been listening to fan feedback "from day one."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The journey from launch to Lords of the Fallen Version 2.5 (released yesterday) was transformative for our team. Over 70 updates later, the game evolved substantially, and that evolution was driven directly by our relationship with the community. Those learnings shaped not only how we build, but how we listen," Hill concluded. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For the sequel, we’ve been actively engaging our fast-growing community from day one, understanding exactly what they want from the next chapter. You can already see some of those requests reflected in our new gameplay reveal trailer: a more varied game world, more distinctive and memorable boss encounters, and a deeper, more meaningful Umbral realm experience."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at The Game Awards 2025</a> for more, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-winners-the-full-list">the winners list in full</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Light at the end of the tunnel.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard has fully unveiled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> expansion Lord of Hatred, confirming that it includes not one but two new classes, including the Paladin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At The Game Awards 2025, Blizzard announced an April 28, 2026 release date for Lord of Hatred, which will see the Age of Hatred Saga, as Blizzard calls it, reach its climax. Campaign wise, players go up against eternal evil, Mephisto, but there’s a surprise return for Diablo 4 antagonist Lilith, who is back from the dead — shock horror! — after the events of the Diablo 4 campaign. Lord of Hatred adds the new region of Skovos, and there are significant gameplay changes, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The big news here is a pre-purchase of Lord of Hatred grants immediate access to the Paladin class, which is a fan-favorite from Diablo 2 and one of the most-requested classes for Diablo 4. Blizzard didn’t say what the mystery second class is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the story setup:</p><blockquote>In the aftermath of Vessel of Hatred, this next chapter drives players toward their final stand against Mephisto, whose deception and spreading influence threaten to twist Sanctuary into a world consumed by malice. As Hell’s legions surge and the ancient Pools of Creation draw Mephisto ever closer, the fate of humanity hangs by a thread. To stop him, the Wanderer must embrace an old foe long believed to be dead. Lilith returns, her prophetic last words echoing true, forcing a perilous alliance bound by necessity rather than trust. With time and allies running out, the Wanderer is in a desperate race to stop Mephisto before hatred reshapes the world forever.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The Paladin, as you’d expect, revolves around hammer and shield gameplay, and smites enemies with Holy Light power. The mystery second class “looms on the dark horizon,” Blizzard said, adding: “its power undeniable, its arrival poised to reshape the battlefield when Lord of Hatred launches in April.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Skovos is the ancestral birthplace of the first civilization and the former home of Lilith and Inarius. It stands as Sanctuary’s oldest and most storied region. Now ruled by The Oracle and the Amazon Queen, this never-before-seen in-game land blends volcanic coasts, storm-lashed forests, and waterlogged ruins steeped in forgotten lore.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The expansion also reworks the Skill Trees to introduce new class-specific variants and expanded level caps, offering fresh buildcraft and strategic depth across all eight classes. There’s a new Loot Filter system to help you target desired gear more efficiently. Crafting is enhanced, with the return of the Horadric Cube. The new Talisman unlocks powerful set bonuses, expanding late-game customization.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Veteran players will be keen to know about the overhauled endgame, which you can tap into once you’ve finished the campaign. War Plans let players craft their own endgame progression path, selecting favored activities and layering strategic modifiers as they push toward high-value rewards. The Echoing Hatred stands as the Age of Hatred’s ultimate test: a relentless gauntlet of demonic hordes designed to challenge even the strongest builds. Meanwhile, for something completely different, the expansion adds Fishing!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lord of Hatred includes the full Vessel of Hatred expansion, which players can access instantly via pre-purchase. Players who pre-purchase gain early access to the Paladin class, one extra Stash Tab, two more Character Slots, and three World of Warcraft décor items.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at The Game Awards 2025</a> for more, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-winners-the-full-list">the winners list in full</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Sons of the Forest launched in 2024.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Endnight Games showed up for The Game Awards 2025 with what may be one of the most unexpected announcements of the night: Forest 3 is coming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A trailer for the latest in its line of popular survival games revealed a visual style unlike anything the series has seen so far. It’s a lot to digest, as first-person gameplay footage showed off lots of sci-fi technology, what seems to be a shoulder-mounted crane, one crashed spaceship, and many new, dangerous environments to explore.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Now for a completely unexpected world premiere. Here’s Forest 3! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheGameAwards?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#TheGameAwards</a> <a href="https://t.co/kKiF7b4rAS" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/kKiF7b4rAS</a></p>— The Game Awards (@thegameawards) <a href="https://twitter.com/thegameawards/status/1999306602436837419?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">As holgram chess and futuristic doors fade into the background, it's only toward the end of the Forst 3 reveal trailer that we see some of that misty horror atmosphere fans have come to love the series for. The monsters in this new world seems to be just as strange, too, with that giant Lovecraftian beast being the most intimidating of the bunch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's unclear how Forest 3 will pick up where Sons of the Forest left off or how its new sci-fi spin will affect gameplay. One thing is for sure, though: Endnight definitely has more tricks up its sleeves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Endnight began its survival series with The Forest in 2018 and followed it up with Sons of the Forest in 2024. With the studio's last game still so fresh in our minds, it's no surprise to see the team keeping their cards close to their chest when it comes to Forest 3. A release date and platforms have not be announced, but we can likely expect to see Forest 3 come to PC.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN gave Sons of the Forest a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sons-of-the-forest-review">9/10 review</a> upon its 1.0 launch last year. At the time, we said, "Sons of the Forest takes everything its predecessor did well and does it a little bit better." It's unclear if Forest 3 will launch in eary access as its predecessors did.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more from The Game Awards 2025, you can check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced"><u>everything announced</u></a> at The Game Awards 2025.
