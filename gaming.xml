		<p>Enjoy Studio has announced that it will be releasing the Everwind demo slightly earlier than planned, with those interested in the game able to try it out from tomorrow, October 12th. The demo will launch at 5pm BST. The developers had originally planned to release the demo on October 13th, but brought it forward by a day due to the support they have received from people following the game. This is a limited time demo, and will only be available until October 20th.</p>

<li><em>Your Island – Your Ship – Your Home! – Step aboard your ship, a fortress that serves not just as your safe haven but also as your gateway to new adventures. This ship is more than just a vessel—it’s your home in the skies, where you craft essential items that will aid you on your journeys.</em></li>
<li><em>Two Heads are Better Than One! – Explore the endless world of Everwind together with your friends! The game offers full support of co-op and multiplayer.</em></li>
<li><em>Personalize your character! – Adjust facial features, select from a variety of hairstyles and choose the skin tone that matches your liking!</em></li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Originally released in 1996, KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE still stands as one of SNK's less popular games . Despite never reaching the mainstream success of other franchises like The King of Fighters, Fatal Fury or Samurai Shodown, its cast of characters, tag mechanics, and distinctive visual design attracted a small, yet passionate cult following. Almost 30 years later, the game has arrived on PC with some brand new features as the second release of the NEOGEO Premium Selection</p>



<p>Before spending some time playing the new KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE release, which made me appreciate the game's unique take on the tag mechanics based on character positioning, I had the chance to talk with producer Laurent&nbsp;Vernézy about the new<strong> </strong>4-player mode, how the developers approached modern balance changes while keeping the spirit of the original intact, and what the future might hold for SNK’s classic arcade catalog.</p>



<p><em><strong>NOTE: This interview was conducted via written Q&amp;A.</strong></em></p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE is considered a cult game, its popularity far from that of other SNK franchises like King of Fighters, Fatal Fury and Samurai Shodown. What inspired SNK to bring the game back now as part of the NEOGEO Premium Selection?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> With its charismatic characters, its tag battle mechanics, fast-paced gameplay, and unforgettable soundtrack, we felt KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE would be a great fit to join our brand-new NEOGEO PREMIUM SELECTION line-up after REAL BOUT FATAL FURY 2: THE NEWCOMERS, which launched a few weeks ago.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> How do you expect the game to be received by a modern audience who never played it before?</p>



<p>A: We are very confident that KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE will be well received by younger audiences as well, due to its iconic characters, soundtrack, and great gameplay.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Were there any lessons learned from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3359900/REAL_BOUT_FATAL_FURY_2_THE_NEWCOMERS/">REAL BOUT FATAL FURY 2: THE NEWCOMERS</a> that influenced the development of this re-release?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> REAL BOUT FATAL FURY 2: THE NEWCOMERS just came out a few weeks ago, so it’s still too early to note anything specific.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is the gameplay a faithful recreation of the original arcade release, or was balance changed in some way?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> Absolutely. This premium port of KE STB is 100% faithful to the original title released on NEOGEO in 1996, so the gameplay and character balance is unchanged.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Rollback netcode has become the standard for online play in fighting games. Was it challenging to implement in a classic game?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> Implementing rollback netcode in KE STB was not challenging, as it wasn’t the first time we added rollback netplay to our classic fighters. However, adding rollback netcode to a 4-player online game was quite challenging, but everything is ready now for intense online battles!</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE is remembered by enthusiasts for its tag-based gameplay, and the new release further leans into it by expanding the 2 v 2 mode with 4-player and 3-player play modes which introduce an interesting twist to traditional online play. How did this idea come about? Was its development challenging?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> We wanted with our developer to ensure that all possibilities of versus tag battles was available in this premium port of KE STB, and we hope players will be happy with them!</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE comes with a hitbox viewer, which is an essential tool to master any fighting game as much as frame data is. Is it accessible in the game? If not, would you consider adding it post-launch if requested by the community?</p>

</figure>



<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, this premium version of KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE offers a hitbox viewer feature which is easily accessed through the Practice Mode, and can be toggled on or off.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE makes boss characters playable without any cheat code. Was anything done to make their inclusion in the base roster balanced for competitive play? Boss characters are notoriously overpowered in traditional fighting games.</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> No, nothing was done to change or alter Jyazu and King Leo. They are infamous for being very strong, but as they can’t tag other characters in our out, they’ll have to be careful when choosing one of the boss characters</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Has fighting game community feedback from the launch of REAL BOUT FATAL FURY 2: THE NEWCOMERS influenced the design of the new modes or features?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> No, as REAL BOUT FATAL FURY 2 came out only a few weeks ago, it’s still too early to have enough feedback from its launch.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> Do you see KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE potentially finding a place in the modern fighting game competitive scene, even as just a side game at the biggest competitions like EVO?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> Absolutely. There are countless fighting game genres and communities, and we are confident that a lot of young and veteran players will enjoy the return of KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> REAL BOUT FATAL FURY 2: THE NEWCOMERS has yet to launch on consoles, and KIZUNA ENCOUNTER: SUPER TAG BATTLE is only launching on PC. Are there plans to bring the NEOGEO Premium Selection to consoles? If so, would cross-platform play be considered?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> We haven’t decided yet if we will expand our NEOGEO PREMIUM SELECTION line to consoles, but if there is demand for, we will definitely consider it. Nothing has been decided yet regarding adding crossplay or not.</p>



<p><strong>Q:</strong> What are the future plans for the NEOGEO Premium Selection? Will releases be limited to fighting games?</p>



<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, of course. There will be more rereleases of SNK classics as part of our NEOGEO PREMIUM SELECTION lineup, and it won’t be limited to classic fighting games.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time!</strong></p>



<p>The relaunch of KIZUNA: SUPER TAG BATTLE clearly establishes the NEOGEO Premium Selection as a brand focused on enhanced classic experiences with new features and expanding beyond fighting games. While console plans remain undecided, the quality of this port and its new features only confirm that SNK is taking its arcade legacy seriously.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/five-nights-at-freddys-2-megan-fox-matpat-cast/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/five-nights-at-freddy%E2%80%99s-2-adds-megan-fox-matpat-to-cast.1322728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 has revealed three new cast members at Comic-Con, with two directly related to the series.</p>



<p>A sequel to the original 2023 film adaptation, Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 plans to up the stakes and deliver some quality scares. The story will seemingly see the animatronics of Freddy Fazbear’s Pizzeria unleashed to the public. New to the film are the Toy animatronics from the video game’s sequel. Now, confirmed at Comic-Con, we have a fresh new look at them, alongside who will be voicing them.</p>



<h2 id="h-megan-fox-matpat-cast-as-toy-animatronics-in-five-nights-at-freddy-s-2">Megan Fox, MatPat Cast as Toy Animatronics in Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>During a panel for Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 at New York Comic-Con, it was announced that the Toy animatronics will have some well-known actors attached to them. As Toy Freddy, the role will be played by VA Kellen Goff, who voices Glamrock Freddy in Five Nights at Freddy’s: Security Breach. For the role of Toy Bonnie, MatPat, former host of Game Theory and FNAF icon, will voice the robotic bunny. Finally, and perhaps the most out-there, Transformers actress <a href="https://x.com/FNAFMovie/status/1976815880626679994?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Megan Fox</a> will voice Toy Chica.</p>



<p>Megan Fox’s addition to Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 is an interesting one, though not too far-fetched. Previously, the Jennifer’s Body actress voiced Nitara in Mortal Kombat 1. She has stated to be a fan of games, so being in FNAF is a no-brainer. MatPat (Matthew Patrick), interestingly enough, already cameoed as a waiter in 2023’s Five Nights at Freddy’s film. Still, given his contributions to the fandom, it’s a great role for him, especially considering his acting background. </p>



<p>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2 is set to hit theaters on December 5th, 2025. A new poster, showing off the Toy characters, is <a href="https://x.com/FNAFMovie/status/1976814091596619866?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">above</a>. If the film is anything like the original, fans are in for one fun ride.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After a long wait, Battlefield 6 is finally here, and it's also an excellent return to form for the series after a disappointing release in Battlefield 2042. If you're one of the hundreds of thousands of players on Steam (and potentially millions with consoles mixed in) jumping into it on launch, then this guide will help you step onto the battlefield with confidence.</p>



<p>While <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/battlefield-6-guide-best-early-weapons-and-loadouts-for-each-class/">our guide on the best early loadouts</a> delved into what weapons you'll want to jump in with and focus on unlocking as soon as possible, this guide will go over more general tips and ways of thinking when you're playing to help you have the right mindset for each match.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-guide-tips-to-rule-the-battlefield">Battlefield 6 Guide - Tips to Rule the Battlefield</h2>



<h3 id="h-play-your-role-and-play-together">Play your role, and play together</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Battlefield has always been a squad-focused game. Its class system is there for a reason, and especially when jumping into its signature modes like Conquest, which take full advantage of the multiple ground and air vehicles available, playing your role is key to success.</p>



<p>If you're running Support, keep your defibrillator handy and use it as often as you can. If you're playing Engineer, keep a launcher in your loadout to help take out tanks and jets if you can lock onto one. If you're playing Recon, be sure to spot enemy vehicles and mark them for your teammates, and try to keep an eye on the edges for enemies looking to flank your side. If you're playing Assault, use your added firepower and stay on the frontlines.</p>



<p>Every role is important, and playing your role instead of just running at enemies looking for kills is the difference between winning and losing a match, no matter what mode you're playing, but especially when playing any of the large-scale game modes.</p>



<h3 id="h-keep-an-eye-on-your-mag">Keep an eye on your mag</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This is a simple tip, but that doesn't make it any less important. Battlefield is not Call of Duty, where you'll die long before you run out of bullets. It's very possible that being a little too trigger-happy can leave you without ammo for your primary weapon, and unless you're playing Support and can give yourself an ammo refresh, you'll be a free kill for the other side. </p>



<p>Yes, respawning is the fastest way to get back to a full magazine, but when dying means your side is down in reinforcements, you're actively hurting your side's chances of winning. You want to try to survive as long as possible, and part of that is keeping an eye on your ammo and not reloading the moment you let a few bullets fly. Time your reloads well, wait until you're towards the bottom of your magazine, and you know that if you were to get into another firefight, you'd lose it because you can't take out an enemy with sub-8 bullets.</p>



<p>It should also be said that keeping yourself mobile while in a firefight can be the difference between dying and getting a kill. If you can, dive to cover and use that time to reload if you absolutely have to. Use a grenade to give yourself even more time. Don't just spray and pray, and keep an eye on your ammo.</p>



<h3 id="h-go-ahead-jump-in-the-tank">Go ahead, jump in the tank</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Vehicles are a key part of Battlefield gameplay, and Battlefield 6 is no different. If a vehicle is available, don't be afraid to jump in. Having a tank on the battlefield for your squad or a jet fighter can be a huge difference maker, and you should be hesitant to jump in when you get the chance.</p>



<p>You can do solid damage to enemy frontlines, help take some of your squadmates across the map, and hold down the defensive line for your side.</p>



<h3 id="h-mount-your-launcher-to-your-rifle">Mount your launcher to your rifle</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>You can add a grenade launcher to your loadout as one of your gadgets, and the default way of doing so is swapping to it as a separate weapon. That's perfectly fine, of course, but to swap to your launcher even faster, mount it to your rifle. You can attach it as an underbarrel attachment, and it'll be a quick flick to swap from your launcher to your rifle.</p>



<h3 id="h-pay-attention-to-your-loadouts-and-weapon-customizations">Pay attention to your loadouts and weapon customizations</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This is another tip that should feel obvious, but it's still worth saying - pay attention to your loadouts and your weapon customizations. Even seemingly small adjustments can make a difference in how a weapon performs for you, whether that's adjusting the ammo type to deal more penetration damage or a different magazine for a faster reload, or better ergonomics. </p>



<p>Your choice of attachments is just as important as your choice of weapons, and it's worth spending the time in the menu, going back and forth from menu to the firing range, to try things out and see how they feel for you.</p>



<h3 id="h-ping-your-enemies">Ping your enemies!</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Battlefield 6.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>When you're not playing Recon and don't have a laser designator, you can still call out enemies for your squadmates. Use the ping system to help you and your squadmates keep track of enemies on the battlefield.</p>



<p>With the size of the maps in Battlefield 6, using the Ping system effectively can be a huge help, especially if you're not one for jumping into proximity chat or typing in the game chat. More so than in other multiplayer shooters, communication is key!</p>



<hr>



<p>These are just a few key tips to remember and to help you dominate on the battlefield now that Battlefield 6 is finally here.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[FBC: Firebreak Still Underperforming Despite Overhaul, Confirms Remedy]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fbc-firebreak-still-underperforming-remedy-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fbc-firebreak-still-underperforming-despite-overhaul-confirms-remedy.1322677/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>FBC: Firebreak still isn’t having the success Remedy was hoping for, despite the massive new update, the studio confirms.</p>



<p>As Remedy Entertainment’s debut with multiplayer, FBC: Firebreak released earlier this year to not-so-shining reviews. Set in the Control universe, the title was met with many complaints for its opening and lack of substance. Last month, a new update, called <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fbc-firebreak-breakpoint-update-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Breakpoint</a>, aimed to fix those issues and add more content like new Crises and weapons. While it seemed like it would do the trick, Remedy has confirmed that it has not done that just yet.</p>



<h2 id="h-fbc-firebreak-did-not-meet-internal-targets-at-remedy-studio-confirms">FBC: Firebreak Did Not Meet Internal Targets at Remedy, Studio Confirms</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Remedy</figcaption></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=b4d23a32-03e7-49e5-bbc3-93ec062699a5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an investor’s post</a> on the company’s website, Remedy Entertainment confirms that, despite the overhaul, FBC: Firebreak has not met internal targets for sales. The news comes before the studio’s actual investors’ reports, set for October 29th. In a statement from CEO Tero Virtala, he states,</p>



<p>“Remedy is recognizing a non-cash impairment of capitalized development costs and allocated purchased publishing and distribution rights related to&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>,” says Virtala. “While we balance future investments to the title, we continue developing and improving the game in line with our updated long-term sales forecast.”</p>



<p>The aforementioned non-cash impairment is up to 14.9 million EUR, with a majority of it representing the game’s development costs and publishing and distribution rights. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fbc-firebreak-launch-deemed-unsatisfying-and-underperformed-major-update-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disastrous launch</a> of FBC: Firebreak is one the studio wasn’t expecting and perhaps had too much faith in. Curiously, it seems Remedy wants to continue working on the title despite its continued failure. The company is known for crafting some amazing experiences like Control and Alan Wake, so it is possible. However, it may not be worth it for FBC: Firebreak, which currently has players in the double-digits.</p>



<p>What do you think about FBC: Firebreak’s failure for Remedy? Did you play the title at launch? Return to it after the Breakpoint update? Did you enjoy the game? Let us know in the comments, forums, and on the&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/gufNW2YhJ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

<p>In recent hours, it has been claimed that Nintendo has been ‘breached’ by Crimson Collective, a notorious hacker group that most recently claimed responsibility for an attack on Red Hat,  breaching the prolific technology firm and stealing 570 GB of data. The group has been tracked for the last couple of months, and it has now been claimed that they’ve breached <strong>Nintendo</strong>.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, a screenshot uploaded by Crimson Collective seems to show a repository of Nintendo folders, but the legitimacy of the breach is yet to be addressed.</p>



<h2 id="h-has-nintendo-been-hacked">Has Nintendo Been Hacked?</h2>



<p>On social media, an image has surfaced, allegedly coming from the Crimson Collective hacker group, that shows a library of Nintendo folders. At face value, these folders contain information regarding new games, development assets, production admin files, and backups.</p>



<p>It was mentioned by <a href="https://xcancel.com/H4ckmanac/status/1976895206273220758#m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hackmanac</a> on socials that hackrisk.io has been tracking the purported breach, and in a comment accompanying the screenshot, Crimson Collective wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Who said we did not have Nintendo topics files?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nintendo has suffered from several key breaches historically, including a massive leak that circulated between 2018 and 2020 and saw source codes for classic games emerge online. In 2020, a Nintendo Network ID breach occurred, impacting more than 300,000 user accounts.</p>



<p>We’ve reached out to Nintendo for comment, but at present, it’s worth taking this with a pinch of salt. We’ll know soon if this is a legitimate breach. If it is, fans are now concerned that a mass wave of Nintendo’s unannounced projects could be cast into the open without warning.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Gone Hunting Codes (October 2025)]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gone-hunting-codes/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gone-hunting-codes-october-2025.1322647/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Gone Hunting is, as the name suggests, a game that revolves around the subtle art of hunting in the wild. Players need to use traps, rifles, and other such tools to hunt down a variety of different animals. An experienced hunter will tell you that the most underrated quality in a good hunter is patience, and this game requires players to have plenty of that. Hunting isn’t as easy as just picking up a gun and shooting at the first animal you see; it’s a far more methodical process that can go wrong if one bad step is made.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players have to use items like tranquilizer guns, traps, and fishing rods to hunt down their prey. Fishing is another major gameplay element of Gone Hunting. What sets Gone Hunting apart from the competition is the fact that you don’t merely kill animals in this game, but rather, you capture animals using non-lethal weapons. These weapons can be upgraded using the in-game currency, and although you can get plenty of it by simply playing the game, one of the easiest ways to get some free money is using these Gone Hunting codes.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-new-gone-hunting-codes-october-2025">All New Gone Hunting Codes (October 2025)</h2>



<p>We currently only know of two active codes in Gone Hunting, which are listed below:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>RELEASE</strong>: 250 Coins (NEW)</li>



<li><strong>GONEHUNTING</strong>: 30 Mins of Luck Boost (NEW)</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-expired-gone-hunting-codes">Expired Gone Hunting Codes</h2>



<p>There is currently only one expired code for Gone Hunting, but sometimes its worth trying expired codes as they could become active again.</p>



<p>The expired code is:</p>



<ul>
<li>BIGPLANS</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-gone-hunting-codes">How to Redeem Gone Hunting Codes</h2>



<p>If you’re ready to hunt down some animals, using these Gone Hunting codes can be a good way to give yourself a head start. Redeeming codes in Gone Hunting is a simple and rather straightforward process. Players aren’t forced to follow any social media accounts or to join the Roblox game group. Instead, all players have to do is navigate through the menus of the game and simply input one of the active codes given above. For newer players who may be unfamiliar with the menus, here’s a step-by-step guide to redeeming Gone Hunting codes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Launch Roblox and open up Gone Hunting</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Shop’ icon at the top&nbsp;</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Codes’ button</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes given above into the provided text box</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Redeem’ button to instantly receive your rewards</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-gone-hunting-codes">How to get more Gone Hunting Codes</h2>



<p>Although there are only two active Gone Hunting codes right now, players can rest assured, as given the current popularity of the game, new codes are surely in the works. While following the game’s socials and Discord server is one way to get the codes, manually scrolling through all the posts to find the codes you’re looking for can be quite a hassle. Instead, players are urged to <strong>keep this page bookmarked</strong>, as we update it as soon as any new Gone Hunting codes drop.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Nintendo is rumored to be the latest high-profile target of the hacker group Crimson Collective, according to a new online report.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/H4ckmanac">cyber intelligence firm Hackmanac</a>, the hacking group shared a screenshot showing folders of <em>"Nintendo topic files,"</em> claiming they are now in possession of the data. The Japanese company has yet to issue a statement or confirm any breach, making the group's claim impossible to verify at the time of writing (October 11 - 10:03 AM EDT)</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While this cyberattack against Nintendo has yet to be officially confirmed, the Crimson Collective hacking group has already maliciously attacked other companies in the past few days, so an attack against Nintendo is not outside the realm of possibility. </p>



<p>Only this month, the Crimson Collective group attacked company Red Hat, breaching the software company's private GitHub repositories to steal 570GB of data. Red Hat itself confirmed the breach shortly after the attack, following claims from the hacking group that it had made extortion demands to the company. If the attack against Nintendo is real, there's a good chance the hacking group also made similar demands to the Japanese company.</p>



<p>Cyberattacks against video game companies are not a new occurrence, and many companies have had data stolen, ranging from information about yet-to-be-announced projects to personal information of employees. Insomniac Games, developer of Marvel's Spider-Man games and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-new-trailer-provides-first-look-at-gameplay-confirms-fall-2026-release-window/">upcoming Marvel's Wolverine</a>, was the target of a massive cyberattack back in 2023, which resulted in confidential information making its way on the web.</p>

<p>Ever dreamt about running your own store that sells premium makeup and skincare products? If yes, then this is going to be an unforgettable experience for you. The main point of Makeup Store Simulator is to make the most amount of money possible every day, all while keeping customers happy and the stock in check. Makeup Store Simulator throws you into the deep end in terms of the makeup business, in that you have to buy and sell high-end makeup products at a profit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you try to sell at too low a price, you won’t make any money, whereas if you try to make a lot of money by boosting the prices, your customers will stop buying. As with most businesses, it’s a matter of acceptable margins, and Makeup Store Simulator will teach you how to walk that tightrope. One thing that all businesses need, however, is money, and you can earn some extra free cash by redeeming the following Makeup Store Simulator codes.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-new-makeup-store-simulator-codes-october-2025">All New Makeup Store Simulator Codes (October 2025)</h2>

<h2 id="h-expired-makeup-store-simulator-codes">Expired Makeup Store Simulator Codes</h2>



<p>The following codes are currently expired for Makeup Store Simulator:</p>



<ul>
<li>LIPSTICK2025&nbsp;</li>



<li>MakeUp&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Although there are only two expired codes in the game currently, more will likely be added to this list as new Makeup Store Simulator codes drop. With just one active code in the game at this moment, the likelihood of new codes being released by the developers in the near future is quite high. Although there’s no defined date for when new codes might be released, considering how popular the game has become, the release of new Makeup Store Simulator codes is a likely eventuality at this point.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-makeup-store-simulator-codes-nbsp">How To Redeem Makeup Store Simulator Codes&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Unlike in real life, free cash in this game is extremely easy to get, thanks to the Makeup Store Simulator codes. All players have to do is redeem active codes to get their rewards, but sometimes, that’s easier said than done. Some games force players to complete additional steps before they’re allowed to redeem codes, such as following the game’s socials or joining their Discord server.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Makeup Store Simulator, however, hasn’t imposed any such criteria on its players. All you have to do to receive this free cash is navigate to the codes option in the game and input one of the active codes given above. Here’s a step-by-step guide to redeeming your Makeup Store Simulator Codes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Launch Roblox and open up Makeup Store Simulator</li>



<li>Hit the ‘Z’ button on your keyboard to bring up your mobile phone</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Codes’ button to open the text box</li>



<li>Input one of the active codes given above into the text box</li>



<li>Hit the ‘enter’ key on your keyboard to receive your rewards</li>
</ul>

		<p>Today, Bandai Namco released a new trailer for Dragon Ball FighterZ marking the game’s inclusion at EVO France 2025 this weekend, and within that trailer the publisher made a surprise annoucement. Goku from Dragon Ball Daima will be added to the Dragon Ball FighterZ roster, with the new character expected to be added in Spring 2026. In addition, a balance update was also announced. Check out the reveal trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="DRAGON BALL FighterZ: EVO France 2025 Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fVtdkNqbiKE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The balance update for Dragon Ball FighterZ will be released on October 12th, with Z-Reflect being one of the key parts of the game being addressed. In addition, all characters on the roster have been updated so moves will be rebalanced across the board, though full patch notes will not be released until the balance update is released.</p>
<p>Released back in 2018, Dragon Ball FighterZ was a major hit for fighting game vets&nbsp;<a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/arc-system-works">Arc System Works</a>, followed by numerous updates and character additions. In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/29/dragon-ball-fighterz-review/">our glowing review</a>, Dave wrote, <em>“2018 is off to a strong start with Dragon Ball FighterZ an early contender for this year’s best fighting game. &nbsp;By shattering some boundaries, Dragon Ball FighterZ has combat that’s more than worth getting into, but also a diverse roster and some phenomenal presentation. The Story Mode could have been improved if it were more streamlined, but it’s a mere blemish on an otherwise spectacular game.”</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-17-inch-laptop-with-windows-11-pro-is-1560-off-now-going-for-pennies-right-after-prime-day-2000634417</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hp-17-inch-laptop-with-windows-11-pro-is-1-560-off-now-going-for-pennies-right-after-prime-day.1322602/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Most people need a laptop that covers the basics reliably: smooth web browsing, comfortable document editing, video calls that don’t freeze and enough screen space to actually see what you’re working on. This HP laptop checks every box on that list and delivers a spacious 17.3-inch FHD display, an Intel i3-N305 8-core processor, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and a generous 1TB SSD. Right now, t<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4710/">his machine is down to $639 on Amazon, slashed from its typical $2,199 price</a>. This all-time low didn’t even show up during Prime Day last week.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4710/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Intel i3-N305 processor has a surprising amount of muscle to deliver for an i3 chip. With the ability to run 8 cores and 8 threads and turbo speeds that can hit as high as 3.8GHz, this processor can handle office workflows, multimedia, and multitasking situations that would slow older budget notebooks to a crawl. Those 8 cores enable you to have dozens of browser tabs and video conferencing programs running, edit docs, and stream music and still never have a slowdown. By delivering responsive speeds to heavy duty programs like photo editing or analyzing a spreadsheet, this notebook has the capacity to do much more than simple web browsing and email.</p>
<h2>A Display that makes Everything Easier to View</h2>
<p>That 17.3-inch diagonal display transforms your computer experience in ways you may not anticipate until you’ve experienced it. Additional screen real estate translates to less scrolling to documents, effortless use of windows side-by-side and real productivity boosts working in spreadsheets or graphics applications. FHD resolution of 1920×1080 maintains text sharp and images clear and IPS panel technologies deliver true colors over extremely wide viewing angles.</p>
<p>Anti-glare coating <strong>minimizes eye strain when you’ll be sitting for long periods</strong> which is essential when you’ll be looking at the display for hours on end. Narrow bezel design makes maximum use of the screen real estate without making the laptop too large and innovative lift-hinge design raises the keyboard when you open the lid to form a steeper and more upright typing angle that minimizes wrist strain.</p>



<p>The 16GB DDR4 RAM has enough headroom to handle current computing needs: This memory capacity allows you to have several applications running smoothly, jump between applications quickly without loading times, and hold dozens of web pages without slow downs. The 1TB PCIe NVMe solid-state drive provides incredibly fast boot times, normally propelling you from power button to desktop in less than 10 seconds. File transfers occur virtually right away, and programs launch the moment their icons are clicked. Storage capacity also allows you to have your complete digital library stored right on the laptop without having to constantly manage it or rely on external storage units.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life can go as long as 8 hours</strong> due to the use of HP Fast Charge technology and it allows you to work throughout a day of meetings or travels and not have to search for outlets. HP True Vision HD camera provides clear video resolution even when you are in a low-light environment which eradicates the universal headache of having grainy, dark video calls while working in darkened rooms.</p>
<p><strong>Windows 11 Pro comes standard with the built-in Copilot AI assistant</strong>&nbsp;which can be accessed via a specialized keyboard key. This AI aide can provide answers to questions, summarize documents, create text, and automate many other tasks, all without having to leave your workstation. A full-size keyboard, complete with a numeric keypad that every person working with numbers or performing data entry will love, comes included as well.</p>
<p>With that $639 purchase price, you’re receiving a laptop that normally costs over three times as much.</p>

            <p>The one-year anniversary of Silent Hill's glorious return to form has come and gone with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, and with it, hopes that the Born From a Wish DLC is on the way.</p>
<p>Born From a Wish is the brief but potent DLC story extension that was available only to Xbox players of the original 2001 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> game that focuses on Maria. Remake developer Bloober Team has yet to mention it, though, and while some fans had hoped we'd get news about the DLC on or near the anniversary or perhaps the upcoming release of the Return to Silent Hill movie, the voice actor behind Remake's Maria has confirmed she hasn't been contacted by Bloober to record extra content.</p>

<p>Salóme Gunnarsdóttir launched her streaming career earlier this week, popping up on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2587528784">Twitch</a> to mark the remake's first anniversary by playing it for the first time. Gazillions of Silent Hill fans descended into her chat, which predictably led to a question about the missing DLC.</p><p>After seeing several comments about it, Gunnarsdóttir said: "I'm just going to– I'm not going to announce any Born from a Wish thing. Um, I have been waiting for Konami to say something, I even asked Bloober if they were going to say something, but we've not recorded anything from Born from a Wish. I'm so sorry. Um, I don't know anything else, I just know I haven't recorded any material for it. So. I'm sorry."</p>
<p>Is it possible that she recorded dialogue or mocap for the additional content while the game was in full production? Sure. Maybe. Could she be bound by an NDA and unable to confirm or deny anything? That's plausible, too. But the expression on her face and the multiple "sorrys" feel more like a gentle letdown than a teasing affirmation. Until Konami or Bloober confirm one way or the other, though, I suppose there'll always be the hope that more Silent Hill 2 Remake could eventually arrive.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">I had a thrilling time with Silent Hill 2 Remake, awarding it 5/5, writing</a>: "Against the odds, Bloober Team has delivered a remake that both expands Silent Hill 2 in just the right places, and gives careful attention to what it preserves."</p>
<p>ICYMI, the remake of Silent Hill 2 is reportedly heading to the PS Plus catalogue later this month, available for Extra and Premium subscribers. While not formally confirmed, reliable insider billbil_kun of Dealabs reports Konami and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s remake will be added on 21st October. It was released last October as a PS5 console exclusive, also available on PC. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-will-be-a-ps5-console-exclusive-for-one-year">trailer from last year added that it would be available on "other formats"</a> from 8th October 2025, exactly a year later.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159482/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-atelier-games-on-nintendo-switch">Atelier</a> series, variety is the spice of life. One might think that more than 25 games deep into developer Gust’s long-running RPG series, the sheen of that trademark gameplay loop of collecting materials, learning recipes, and crafting items via alchemy would start to dull a little. Yet, with the introduction of each new entry and corresponding sub-series, Atelier constantly finds ways to reinvent itself and offer a unique spin on its tried-and-true gameplay systems. From the darker and more action-focused <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/atelier_yumia_the_alchemist_of_memories_and_the_envisioned_land">Atelier Yumia</a> to the sprawling adventure saga of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/atelier-ryza-secret-trilogy-deluxe-pack">Atelier Ryza</a> trilogy, each title has its own distinct identity.</p>
<p>That’s why <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/atelier_resleriana_the_red_alchemist_and_the_white_guardian">Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian</a>, the 27th mainline entry in the series, is such a complicated game to explain. So much of its identity is owed to what came before it. It’s simultaneously a standalone sequel to a free-to-play gacha game, a major crossover event that incorporates characters from past entries, <em>and</em> a self-proclaimed return to the series' turn-based roots. At the same time, it’s also very much its own thing, chronicling an original story with new leads and fresh gameplay concepts.</p>
<figure><a title="Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159479/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>A lesser game might be crushed under the weight of all the things Atelier Resleriana is supposed to be, yet it manages to dovetail each responsibility into a cohesive whole. The result is one of the stronger Atelier releases in recent years and, thankfully, an enjoyable experience that remains largely unfettered by Switch 1’s ageing hardware.</p>
<p>Set after the events of 2023’s <strong>Atelier Resleriana: Forgotten Alchemy &amp; the Liberator of Polar Night</strong> (a mobile and PC-based gacha title that is no longer available to play outside of Japan), this moves the focus to two new playable protagonists: Rias and Slade. They hail from Hallfein, a once-bustling town that suffered a mysterious tragedy 12 years prior and has since fallen into disrepair. When the pair of adventurers meet and stumble across an abandoned atelier, they resolve to use the power of alchemy to restore their hometown to its former glory and uncover the mystery behind its downfall.</p>
<figure><a title="Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159481/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In keeping with its narrative focus, Atelier Resleriana’s gameplay is defined by three key areas: exploring the world and its dungeons while collecting alchemy ingredients and battling enemies; synthesising and strengthening new items via alchemy recipes at the atelier; and improving the quality of the town by selling items at Rias’ store or taking on additional quests and side activities. Each strand is well-defined with its own set of intricacies and systems to learn, and the way all three interweave makes engaging with each one key to progression.</p>
<p>The game’s refreshed alchemy system sees you combining ingredients to produce items and equipment for your party. Materials possess two distinct colour attributes that must be chained together to effectively pass on unique traits and effects. It may seem like a simple match-the-colour system on the surface, but there are a ton of wrinkles and additional mechanics that up the complexity of crafting considerably.</p>
<p>Having a nice amount of depth in the alchemy system is an Atelier hallmark, though this iteration’s tutorials don’t always do the best job of explaining all the need-to-know ins and outs. This opaqueness can be frustrating, especially as a few battles in the mid-to-late game ramp up the challenge to test your crafting mastery.</p>
<figure><a title="Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159484/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>You collect materials by exploring locations and progressing through a slew of floor-based dungeons with procedurally generated interiors that change upon each visit. The act of collecting materials essentially boils down to hitting a button to instantly harvest useful stuff with ease. You can gather one handful of items after another within seconds, and having a constant influx of valuable ingredients added to your basket is pure dopamine.</p>
<p>For their part, battles have returned to a turn-based format from earlier Atelier titles. Here, you control the actions of up to three party members on your frontline. Most of the genre staples are present — each character has their own stats and skillsets (which can be expanded and improved via a skill tree or levelling up), and they can use their turn to perform an element-based attack or use an item. Enemies have elemental resistances and weaknesses that can be exploited to temporarily stun them. Party members who act in succession can also follow up each other’s actions with extra attacks.</p>

<p>The basics of combat may be straightforward, but Atelier Resleriana also includes several key mechanics that keep battles feeling dynamic and fresh. Arguably the biggest is the presence of a visible turn timeline à la <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a>, which you can use to plan out your strategy multiple moves in advance, and even manipulate to change turn timings and obtain certain bonus effects. Determining when to schedule an Interruption action for a free item use or deciding which target to steal an effect from on their next projected turn adds a whole additional layer to battles.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Multi-Action mechanic allows you to spend accumulated Technical Points to give an active combatant and two of your non-active party members a chance to perform an action in one fell swoop before swapping out the main fighter for someone on the back line. This twist allows you to perform some pretty devastating combos while keeping all of your party members relevant and involved.</p>
<p>There are more battle mechanics to play around with besides these, but the point is that Atelier Resleriana’s combat is a nice blend between classic turn-based RPG fare and fresher concepts that encourage further strategy and optimisation.</p>

<p>Finally, there’s the town improvement system, which centres around management of Rias’ shop, Mistletoe Miscellaneous. Here, you can stock items you’ve synthesised, hire fairies as staff, and customise the interior to your liking. As the shop sells wares, you can both turn a profit and level up various parts of Hallfein.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to improve the town by taking on optional side quests and partaking in other activities around town. Certain shops, items, and visitor characters become available as Hallfein grows, but seeing the struggling locale’s condition visibly improve over the course of the game offers a rewarding sense of progression in itself.</p>
<p>On that note, I quite enjoyed the restrained and laid-back nature of the story. While it’s not without its high-stakes moments and occasional twists to keep things interesting, Rias and Slade’s journey feels refreshingly quaint with a greater emphasis on character dynamics. It helps that the main cast is made up of supremely likeable and charming people who come alive thanks to fluid animation work and fully-voiced cutscenes.</p>

<p>The people you meet are compassionate and willing to lend a helping hand far more often than not, and it’s easy to root for the team as they rally behind Hallfein’s restoration. It may not be everyone’s tonal cup of tea, but the whole thing just comes off as very pleasant and earnestly sweet without falling into saccharine territory.</p>
<p>You'll spend a whole lot of time with these characters, too, with an ample amount of cutscenes both throughout the main story and within optional character episodes and side quests. These story segments are generally enjoyable for the reasons described above, although there really are a ton of them, and they can be rather long-winded at times.</p>
<p>Cutscenes are also easy to trigger, even when you don’t intend to. Going to a certain area or speaking to a certain character can cause multiple cutscenes to stack, automatically playing out one after another and bringing progress to a screeching halt. Suffice to say, there are plenty of spans when all you can do is set down the controller and watch things play out.</p>

<p>It’s also worth mentioning that both the main story and side content feature a bunch of returning characters from Atelier history who make up most of the primary and supporting cast, including the bulk of your party members. Thankfully, the game doesn’t let this crossover element overpower the core narrative and effectively introduces everyone without much confusion. That said, you’ll definitely get much more out of all the little nods and references embedded in the story if you’re familiar with previous entries.</p>
<p>You'll also be relieved to hear that Atelier Resleriana appears on Switch without egregious performance concessions. The game ran at what appeared to be a rock-solid 30 frames per second throughout my playthrough, which feels fluid enough to fit its moment-to-moment gameplay.</p>
<p>Visuals have definitely taken the greatest hit, as it can get pretty blurry and jaggy in handheld mode. Thankfully, the stylised art direction shines through even in the messier moments. Atelier Resleriana on Switch may not be as sharp or as smooth as it is on other platforms, but it still plays just fine and stands as a more-than-viable version.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Between a restrained scope and structure that harkens back to the Atelier games of old, a bevvy of fresh gameplay twists to call its own, and a metric ton of fanservice for veterans, Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian feels like a triumphant celebration of the entire series’ legacy.</p>
<p>More importantly, it’s just a really great RPG experience. Appropriately, it mixes together a bunch of quality ingredients — a heartwarming narrative, strategic and dynamic turn-based combat, complex crafting systems — and synthesises them into a jolly little romp of an adventure. There’s certainly a bump in the road or two, but the ride is too enjoyable to linger on those for long.</p></section>

<p>A balance update arrives tomorrow</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>At the end of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_ball_fighterz">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a> finals at EVO France, Bandai Namco shared some exciting news. The highlight was the teaser announcement of a new warrior. It's Super Saiyan 4 Goku (Daima), and he's arriving at some point in <strong>Spring 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Along with this was the announcement of a balance adjustment update. This will be arriving tomorrow on <strong>12th October 2025</strong>. Bandai Namco highlighted how "successfully timing a Z-Reflect can turn the tide of battle". Along with this, every character is getting updated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Goku (SS4, DAIMA) from DRAGON BALL DAIMA is officially joining the #DRAGONBALLFighterZ roster! Plus, a balance update drops October 12, bringing strategic depth to Z Reflect! Full patch notes will be available on release day!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see in the trailer above, legends of the game's competitive scene will also be returning at the Dragon Ball FighterZ Masters Showdown at Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026. This event will take place in Los Angeles, California at the Shrine Auditorium and Expo Hall between 18th to 19th April 2026.</p>
<p>Dragon Ball FighterZ was released on the original Switch in 2018, and was followed by multiple game updates and DLC characters. Bandai Namco hasn't mentioned anything about a Switch 2 Edition or update, but if there are any announcements, we'll let you know. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions with rollback netcode were <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/02/dragon-ball-fighterzs-ps5-version-is-out-tomorrow-with-rollback-netcode">released last year</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dreams-of-another-feels-like-a-fever-dream.1322581/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Dreams of Another</em> is like playing an art-filled dream. It’s filled with unexpected events, disjointed acts, and hazy landscapes. Scenes end abruptly, and then you unexpectedly pick up the thread later on. You’ll meet talking angel statues and fish that want to escape their home and swim to the ocean. But it’s that same unstable, dreamlike quality that makes the game so memorable.</p><p>In <em>Dreams of Another</em>, from <em>PixelJunk</em> developer Q-Games, you play as a pajama-clad man who is aptly referred to only as the Man in Pajamas. He wields a gun given to him by a man called the Wandering Soldier. In the opening sequence, the soldier realizes he is unable to shoot a bullet from that gun. But in the Man in Pajamas’ hands, the gun doesn’t destroy things but instead “creates” them.</p><p>Q-Games says <em>Dreams of Another</em> is a “third-person exploration-action game,” but it’s easier to understand the game as a series of vignettes rather than by its genre. When you’re dropped into an environment in <em>Dreams from Another</em>, which usually happens suddenly and without any preamble, parts of the landscape are deconstructed into a bunch of tiny, colorful pieces. When you shoot the pieces with your gun, they’ll solidify into things like a bench, a tree, a building, a person, or a shipwreck. But even then, the objects in the world will still be made of the loosely connected pieces, giving them the impression that they could all scatter apart at a moment’s notice, and sometimes things do actually start to split up.</p><p>As you shoot the pieces of the world, things will solidify into objects that you can have conversations with, like the Wandering Soldier, or a clown who creates a giant ring statue out of the rings of divorced partners, or even seemingly inanimate objects like a bench pondering the nature of consciousness. Characters speak in a halting, unnatural way and say strange things: Once, after taking a photo of her husband, an old lady said that it would “make a nice funeral portrait for him.” And each “scene” typically lasts a few minutes before the entire environment comes apart, fades to white, and the game drops you someplace new — or brings you back to the main menu screen, which features the Man in Pajamas sleeping in his bed.</p><p>The strangeness of it all can make things difficult to follow. The game is often more concerned with exploring ideas about art, consciousness, and human nature rather than having every moment make sense or be “fun.” But it also has a welcome sense of unpredictability; at any moment during my six-hour-long playthrough, I had basically no idea what to expect. I found that, like in a real dream, even if it’s tough to keep everything straight, there are profound moments that stick with you long after it’s over.</p><p><sup>Dreams of Another<em> is available now on PS5 and PC.</em></sup></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/795553/dreams-of-another-review-ps5-pc]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-ea-app-outage-leads-franchise-head-to-recommend-steam/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-ea-app-outage-leads-franchise-head-vince-zampella-to-recommend-using-steam-instead.1322578/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, when the Battlefield 6 servers went live, some users who purchased the game on PC via the EA app experienced a nasty entitlement issue that essentially locked them out of playing any of the game's modes. Most users received a message saying they were missing DLC content, and the bug quickly became a meme. A few hours later, everything was fixed, and the impacted players even received some bonuses for their troubles:</p>



<p><em>Today, we experienced an outage on the EA app that prevented some of our players who pre-ordered Battlefield 6 from accessing the game, and we know this can be frustrating so we wanted to offer an apology… with perks. The fix has been rolled out. But we aren't done.</em></p>



<p><em>Anyone on the EA app who was impacted will receive 12 Hardware and 12 Career 60-Minute Boosters, which should be arriving in impacted players' in-game inbox this weekend. In addition, we will also be granting impacted players full access to a seasonal Battle Pass. If impacted players purchased the Phantom Edition, we will be granting them access to Season 2's full Battle Pass.</em></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Interestingly, while the bug was still active, Vince Zampella very candidly <a href="https://x.com/VinceZampella/status/1976738354164277604" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told his X followers</a> that he was playing on Steam and recommended getting a refund on the EA app and purchasing the game again on Steam. </p>



<p><em>I have yelled about EA app people. Any suggestions on next levels of escalation? </em></p>



<p><em>I am playing on Steam. Can you refund and buy on Steam?</em></p>



<p>It might be strange to see the head of the Battlefield franchise recommend something that effectively goes against the interests of his employer (EA gets full revenue through its own app, whereas it has to give Valve a cut of every purchase made through Steam, just like everyone else), but then again, EA CEO Andrew Wilson is more likely to commend Zampella on a job well done. </p>



<p>The former studio head of Infinity Ward and current studio head of Respawn Entertainment and Ripple Effect Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-shakeup-respawn-vince-zampella-halo-designer-in-charge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was appointed new head of the IP in December 2021</a>, just a couple of weeks after the disastrous launch of Battlefield 2042. Given <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how well Battlefield 6 has been reviewed</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-servers-hit-capacity-at-launch-steam-charts-747k-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">initial concurrency data from Steam</a>, it seems like Zampella and the teams involved (Ripple Effect, DICE, Criterion, and Motive) successfully pulled off a strong comeback for the military shooter series.</p>



<p>That said, if you are playing on PC, there's a chance you might encounter some weird errors. <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/battlefield-6-troubleshooting-guide-how-to-fix-common-pc-errors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">We've compiled a troubleshooting guide here</a> to help with those. </p>

<p>Eclipsing even its own free-to-play open beta and Call of Duty's peak numbers, Battlefield 6 is now EA's most successful shooter ever after clocking up 747,440 concurrent players in a single day. And that's only counting Steam players, of course.</p>
