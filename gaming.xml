			<p>The next version of the PlayStation 5 Pro AI-powered PSSR upscaler will come with some significant improvements, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore's Law is Dead</a>, who previously provided correct information regarding the PlayStation 5 Pro and the PSSR upscaler before the official announcement, revealed that Sony is training a new lightweight neural network requiring less frame time to upscale that will offer higher image quality, no matter the base resolution a game is upscaled from. Currently, PSSR requires a base resolution of 864p, which is pretty high compared to the Ultra Performance NVIDIA DLSS option, for example, but the next iteration of the upscaler should be able to deliver better image quality upscaling from lower base resolutions.</p>
<p>According to the leaker, one of the main reasons Sony is working on this new version of the PlayStation 5 Pro upscaler, which may not even be marketed as PSSR 2, because they want to get better at running 4K resolution at 120 FPS and offer 8K resolution output at 60 frames per second. While some games already offer 4K resolution at 120 FPS with the current version of PSSR, the new version of the upscaler will make it so that games that currently can't push past the 70, 80 FPS range can offer better performance besides the improved image quality, which will see improvements in line with the leap in quality from AMD FSR 2.0 to 3.1. Additionally, the new version of the upscaler will offer wider resolution offerings, supporting 1440p and 1080p resolutions at locked 120 FPS, which the current version of the upscaler doesn't, as it only used to offer 4K resolution output. Better image quality is reportedly also coming to PlayStation 5 Pro games that don't use PSSR to upscale with MFSR, which was the internal acronym for the upscaler. MFSR will be an alternative option to TAA to offer better image quality.</p>

<p>With the current implementation of the PlayStation 5 Pro upscaler having been <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-playstation-5-pro-disappoints/">hit-and-miss</a> so far, it's not surprising that Sony is working on a new iteration that will likely benefit the future console generation, considering the PlayStation 6 will likely support PSSR as well. Hopefully, it won't take long to see this new version of the upscaler in action and to know whether it will deliver all of these rumored promises.</p>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The paid release of <em>Deltarune</em>, Toby Fox’s episodic <em>Undertale</em> spinoff, will be available for most people at the same time the Nintendo Switch 2 launches in Japan, Fox says in the <a href="https://toby.fangamer.com/newsletters/release-time/"><em>Deltarune</em> newsletter for May 2025</a>. <em>Deltarune’s</em> first two chapters, released in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18047410/undertale-spinoff-sequel-deltarune-toby-fox">2018</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22677626/toby-fox-undertale-sequel-deltarune-chapter-2-release-date-mac-pc">2021</a> respectively, were free, but this new release, which adds chapters 3 and 4, will be a paid version that costs $24.99. </p><p>How the release timing will work is a little confusing, but let me explain. For PS4, PS5, Steam, and the original Switch, <em>Deltarune</em> will launch on June 5th at 12AM in Japan, which translates to June 4th at 11AM ET / 8AM PT for people in the US.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 version of <em>Deltarune</em>, on the other hand, will launch at midnight local time in most regions on June 5th. This decision actually means that people in New Zealand or Australia who get a Switch 2 at midnight have a slight head start. “But, for convenience’s sake, we’re just going to ignore you guys and pretend that the game is not out… Meanwhile, don’t say anything about it please,” Fox says.</p><p>Future updates to <em>Deltarune</em> will be added for free, Fox said in a newsletter last month, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83-uYZHgQ6Y">Switch 2 version</a> will have a special room that takes advantage of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642493/nintendo-switch-mouse-controls-metroid-prime-4">console’s mouse controls</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p><em>Many of the games we play on our Wheel of GeForce NOW streams show off what the technology is capable of because it lets us crank up every single setting on a game without caring what might happen next. </em></p><p><em>But it was a real joy to spend time a few weeks back with the Command &amp; Conquer games, because it immediately brought us collectively back to a wholly different era of playing video games.</em></p><p><em>It's not just about how games have changed, either. It's about how we have changed, too. And "we" isn't just Rob and Patrick—it's gaming culture and the standards and resources we use to determine what to play and what is "fun."</em></p><p><em>If you can look up a video that tells you how you're supposed to play a game, how you're supposed to have fun, won't that influence how you end up playing and enjoying it, too? Is that a better world than one where you're on your own?</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>When we were playing various<em> Command &amp; Conquer </em>games recently, and then reminiscing about my time with games like <em>BioForge</em> and your time with games like <em>Myth</em>, it reminded me of a pretty unique time in life, one that’s impossible to capture as you get older:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>You don’t know what you even like</li><li>Even if you like something, you’re not entirely sure why</li><li>When <em>we</em> played these games, there was no way <em>to</em> know the right way to play</li></ol><p>The reason I constantly joke about spamming mammoth tanks in <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em> is because that’s the dumb and goofy “strategy” I deployed over and over playing those games, an early indication that, perhaps, Patrick’s brain was not suited for coming up with more legitimate tactics. But whereas today I feel a sense of unease—shame, even—at feeling bad playing a game, this was an era, both because video games were inherently more mysterious during this era and because I was young, where I didn’t know, or it didn’t occur, to experience that unease.</p><p>I remember bringing home a copy of <em>Civilization II </em>because it was so highly praised in <em>PC Gamer</em>. (Remember, it alongside <em>EGM</em>, might as well have been my personal bible at the time, and if they ended up giving a game a 90+ review, it basically meant I’d be buying it.) There was no reason to think I should have any interest, or derive any fun, from Civilization II, based on the games that I’d previously played. <em>Doom</em>, <em>Dark Forces</em>. Mostly shooters. And the massive manual that came with <em>Civilization II</em>—an unholy 206-page tome that basically meant the game also came with a <em>book</em>—did not give me much confidence playing the game would change that.</p><p>But that also should’ve been the case for <em>SimCity 2000</em>, which came out a few years prior…</p><p>…And I had a <em>blast</em> with <em>SimCity 2000</em>. These games were not about endstates for me, they were about being tossed into the unknown and, over time, figuring out your own kind of fun.&nbsp;</p><p>Sure, if you were lucky enough to have internet access, you could hop on a place like <em>GameFAQs</em> and page through an ASCII walk through made by some random stranger, but for the most part, I was booting up these system-heavy simulation games and basically winging it.</p><p>Some of that curiosity, I think, was fueled by the demo disc phenomenon at the time. Demos were a low stakes way to play with a game, get a fuel for what it was doing and how it made you feel, without the commitment of buying. I’m <em>sure</em> there were demos that I spent dozens of hours playing, because the demos were enough. But there’s fewer opportunities for that these days in that format! There <em>are</em> demos, but chances are you’re downloading one because you <em>want</em> it.</p><p>This has been one of the benefits of having kids, actually. One reason I was excited to <em>have</em> kids was being broken out of my own habits. Games like <em>Minecraft</em> unlocked because of playing it with my kids and being a support beam in their own adventures—I see fun through their eyes.</p><p>So in that way, I’ve captured some of that lightning in a bottle again. That mystery. It’s nice.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>Hmm, reading this I feel like there’s two threads you’re touching on. The first is a kind of inherent self-consciousness that comes with games now. The second is the way it’s harder for games to catch us by surprise. Partly that’s because we aren’t kids and it’s harder to recover that openness to discovery and curiosity, but also because the way we find out about games and choose from among them leaves less space for mystery.</p><p>I’ve talked about this before but for a long time RTS games did a great job of concealing how hard they were and how much they expected of players. My skills have atrophied but they were never more than <em>passable</em>. I don’t think you and I played <em>Red Alert </em>very differently from one another: band-select the best units you have and attack-move into the other guy’s base or ore field. I was in it to see sick, goofy cutscenes and to watch my sci-fi Micro Machines unleash holy hell on each other. My dad, one of the clumsiest PC users I have ever encountered, played <em>Age of Empires </em>extensively on his laptop without ever feeling more than a pleasant frustration as he built his city walls or sent his trebuchets against enemy citadels in a campaign. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/gearbox-announces-new-risk-of-rain-2-expansion-and-digs-into-more-details-on-borderlands-4-at-pax-east-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Gearbox took over the main stage at PAX East 2025 today to focus on two of its games, Borderlands 4 and Risk of Rain 2. For the latter, a brand new expansion was announced, titled Alloyed Collective. For the former, members of the development team, including Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford, took to the stage and answered a few questions from the community, but notably, Pitchford was unable to answer one pretty important question, one that he says Gearbox doesn't have an answer for yet.</p>
<p>Starting with Risk of Rain 2, the new expansion goes deeper into Petrichor V, with six new stages for players to dig into, and if you're playing with friends, only one of you needs to own the Alloyed Collective expansion for all of you to enjoy the new content.</p>
<p>The Alloyed Collective will add 15 new items for players to grab, seven new enemies to fight, and two new survivors to master. There's currently no release date, with the announcement trailer below simply stating that it is "<em>coming&nbsp;</em><em>soon.</em>"</p>
<p><iframe title="Risk of Rain 2 | Alloyed Collective Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EXaaA5yCXW8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As far as new details about Borderlands 4, Pitchford was joined by Andrew Reiner, chief creative officer at Gearbox, April Johnson, associate narrative director at Gearbox, Nick Thurston, lead game designer, and Grant Kao, associate creative director.</p>
<p>After recapping the end of Borderlands 3, the Gearbox panel dug into community questions, starting with what's up with the rest of the Crimson Raiders, and according to Johnson, the answer is that they've all split up looking for Lilith across the galaxy. Johnson also confirmed that we'll be seeing more of them in Borderlands 4, but didn't dig much further into detail.</p>
<p>Johnson also talked about the antagonist in Borderlands 4, the Timekeeper, the events that kick off the story of Borderlands 4, and the chaos that the vault hunters find when they arrive on Kairos at the start of the game. The broad strokes of these narrative details were all things we learned during Gearbox's <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-state-of-play-deep-dives-into-gameplay-gear-movement-changes-and-more/">State of Play event for Borderlands 4 last week</a>, so with the added time afforded Johnson and the rest of the team at the panel, they went through the individual backstories of the four new vault hunters, Rafa, Vex, Harlowe, and Amon, the planet of Kairos.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gearbox Main Theater Show at PAX East 2025!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mvsx1FzIKEg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Pitchford added that there are no load times when players are exploring Kairos, and said it is the "<em>biggest</em>" world that the team has made for players to explore in the entire Borderlands series.</p>
<p>Beyond revealing too many narrative details and spoiling too much of the game, the one notable question Pitchford didn't exactly answer was the question of how much Borderlands 4 will cost. Instead of being able to give a direct answer, Pitchford went into a long response as to what Gearbox and his own thinking is on the issue.</p>
<p>"<em>I'll tell you the truth, I don't know. And that is the truth,</em>" he began saying."<em>It's an interesting time, right? On one level, we've got a competitive marketplace where the people that make those choices want to sell as many units as possible, and they want to be careful about people that are price sensitive. So there's some folks that don't want to see prices go up, even the ones deciding what the prices are.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>There's other folks accepting the reality that game budgets are increasing, and there's tariffs for the retail packaging. It's getting gnarly out there, you guys. Borderlands has more than twice the development budget than Borderlands 3. More than twice. So the truth is I don't know what the price is going to be. I do know that we will be opening pre-orders soon, and that will be when the price is</em> <em>set</em>."<em><br>
</em></p>
<p>"...<em>We're going to have a price set soon. </em><em>It might be the new price that Nintendo and Microsoft have led with. It might be that we stay back. It’s going to be the people at the [Gearbox] publishing house that decide that...We’ll know soon. I think it’s going to be fine, whatever it ends up being. Borderlands 4 is [expletive] amazing. It’s worth it.</em>"</p>
<p>The question of pricing has been a big one for games since discussions around <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-confirms-latest-grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-was-captured-entirely-on-ps5-includes-gameplay-and-cutscenes/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> being priced at <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-at-100-would-be-a-bridge-too-far-even-for-grand-theft-auto&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjNjv6cqZeNAxXapIkEHUobAoEQFnoECDwQAQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw3L37WylpHEkWHXgJBm8zXw">$100</a> started to make the rounds. Now that Nintendo has broken the seal with an <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/">$80 Mario Kart</a>, it's almost certain that GTA VI will cost at least $80. But it wouldn't be shocking to see Take-Two test the waters of an $80 game with Gearbox and Borderlands 4 hitting that same bar.</p>
<p>Earlier in the Q&amp;A session, Pitchford mentioned an event Gearbox will be hosting in June, so it could be that pre-orders will go live at the time of that event, which could very well be around the time of Summer Game Fest. If so, we won't have to wait very long at all to see where Gearbox ends up landing.</p>

Now, let’s talk about three of the most compelling episodes of television in recent memory. </p><hr><p><strong>Zack Zwiezen:</strong> So I think these last three episodes are my favorite <em>Andor</em> episodes of season 2 so far and maybe the entire series. From what happens on Ghorman, the stuff with Mothma, and the heartbreaking ending seen in Episode nine... it was all so good!</p><p><strong>Carolyn Petit:</strong> It was. In the past I’ve taken notes as I watched, just so I had a few things to refer back to when we do these chats, but with this week’s trio of episodes I was just so captivated and horrified by the slow, inexorable buildup to the events of episode nine that I totally forgot. I almost couldn’t believe how good these episodes were. But let’s start at the beginning. </p><p>First of all, it was cool to get a glimpse of life on Yavin, to see the beautiful home that Andor and Bix share there. Now if I ever rewatch <em>A New Hope</em>, I’ll have a fuller picture in my mind of how important this place was for the Rebellion in establishing its foothold, and what life was like there when its members weren’t off engaging in operations to subvert the Empire’s efforts.</p><p><strong>Ethan Gach: </strong>We obviously need to start with the weird force healing stuff, which I’m sure Zack can explain. It was an odd nod to the mystical side of Star Wars we never see in <em>Andor</em>.</p><p><strong>CP</strong>: Hahaha. I did like the mention of Maarva hating Force healers, or at least hating one Force healer. You have to think that’s a field inhabited to some degree by scammers and the <em>Star Wars </em>universe’s equivalent of manipulative woo-woo YouTubers. </p><p><strong>ZZ</strong>: We see some of that in the <em>Obi-Wa</em>n show, with the guy pretending to be a Jedi. I imagine fake Force Healers are a thing and I get why Andor is wary about them. Honestly, I love that modern <em>Star Wars</em> is making it clear that the Force isn’t something everyone believes in or understands. For many, its this weird magical thing they scoff at.</p><p>As for Force Healing, we mainly see Jedi doing it—like Grogu and Rey—but it’s been a thing in Legends and Canon for some time before that and anyone with a deep connection to the Force could in theory do it. But there’s also debate that the person isn’t really healing them, but instead the Force wants to make sure that the injured person is healed to continue on their important journey or purpose. The Force Healer even mentions that it doesn’t always work to Andor.</p><p>And we know Andor is going to do some important stuff in <em>Rogue One</em>. So it makes sense that the Cosmic Force would intervene to make sure he’s healthy and able to keep moving forward on his journey. And I think that’s what the woman sensed.</p><p>Did you all like the Force being included in <em>Andor</em>? I’ve seen some mixed reactions online</p><p><strong>CP</strong>: I don’t mind it as this kind of fleeting bit of worldbuilding detail that informs our understanding of the characters. I think it helps that the actor playing the Force healer was so good, she really made the most of her brief time. </p><p>I wouldn’t want it to become a larger element or to overtly influence the story in any way, but here I saw it as a plot device that illuminated the fact that Cassian is feeling uptight and closed off in larger ways, and it also gave Bix something to think about.</p><p><strong>EG</strong>: And now Wilmon is back with “One Last Job...” and Cassian is running out of time to decide if he’s going to become a professional rebel or not. I at first thought the plan to go snipe Dedra was their own as payback for Ferrix, but it seems maybe Luthen is keen to finally bag the spy that’s been tracking him for years before she can come back and finish the job.</p><p><strong>ZZ</strong>: Yeah, I thought it was revenge too. And it might still be, but I agree. I think Luthen is trying to tie up some loose ends.</p><p>I think the one year leaps between each three episodes has worked well. But it was used perfectly here to show us how much Ghorman has changed since we last saw it. Seeing the plaza filled with Imperial troops, blockages, and reporters spouting propaganda really showed how much progress the Empire has made in taking this place over and crushing the people.</p><p>So where do we land on Syril and Dedra? I think these episodes seem to show that she genuniely cared about him. The kiss, the way she is worried about his safety, wants him to be kept in the building away from the protestors and chaos outside, etc. I got the feeling that in some twisted sick way she really loved Syril. She had a connection with him and maybe it was simply that she needed to have something to look forward to after doing what she did on Ghorman and being with him back on Coruscant was that end goal. (edited)</p><p><strong>EG:</strong> Yes I think it did a really good job of showing two different accomplices to fascism. </p><p>The one is obsessed with fighting “outside agitators” and the other is just chasing the next carrot from their boss. They are both unnerved by what’s going on, but more at the unpleasantness and because of how it complicates their self-mythologizing, rather than because of the actual evil and pain involved. She’s like just forget about this genocide. A dozen more people were ready to pull the trigger if I didn’t. But now we can go back to Coruscant and chill and maybe get invited to some fancier parties.</p><p><strong>CP</strong>: Yeah, that connection with Syril, strange as it was, was also the most genuine human thing in her life. Some part of her really was looking forward to that point where this was behind them and they were together again on Coruscant.</p><p>I think the show navigates that line well. It doesn’t ever make Syril or Dedra truly sympathetic (not yet, anyway), but it does explore how fascism strips those who carry it out of their potential humanity as well.</p><p><strong>ZZ</strong>: Speaking of Syril, that moment when he sees Andor was perfect.</p><p>Everything in his life is falling apart. The woman he loved betrayed his trust. The Empire he worked for is truly evil in a way he’s finally understanding. His entire life is shattering and falling apart. And right at that moment he sees the motherfucker who sort of put all of this in motion for him. And he just loses it.</p><p><strong>CP</strong>: Right, it was another example, maybe the best one yet, of something I think the show has done a remarkable job of across all three episode drops we’ve gotten: taking conflicts that exist on both a personal, intimate level, and on a larger, more political level, and weaving them together such that they really build up, complement each other, and then collide in ways that have big emotional payoffs in the climax to each little mini-trilogy. The personal is political, and boy does <em>Andor </em>know it.</p><p><strong>ZZ</strong>: Yes! We this happen in later when Andor saves Mothma. They are both struggling with personal conflicts and that directly ties into the bigger political conflict engulfing the galaxy. Lovely stuff.</p><p>But back to the chaos at Ghorman. After Syril leaves Dedra, but before spotting Andor, we see the empire shove out some young soldiers into the angry crowd as bait</p><p><strong>CP</strong>: My heart sank as that happened. What a way to depict the utter ruthlessness of the Empire, deliberately sacrificing its own greenest recruits for this false flag operation.</p><p><strong>ZZ</strong>: The moment that bastard sent them out, you knew what was coming. And then the Imperial sniper aiming at not the protestors, but the guards, and starting the most brutal and hard to watch sequence in a S<em>tar Wars</em> show or movie.</p><p><strong>CP</strong>: Right. The show wants us to know, wants us to feel the inevitability of it all, as the Ghors stand there beautifully protesting. It really was gutting, not to mention just exceptional television.</p><p><strong>EG </strong>The show has been jumping around so much this season, both in time and location, it was nice to finally see all of the tension erupt in one place for a prolonged period of time. Shame on the Ghormans for using their fellow citizens as human shields though.</p><p><strong>ZZ</strong>: One of the best moments in all of this, going back to Carolyn’s point about the show weaving smaller and bigger conflits together, is when Syril tackles Andor and they fight for a bit.</p><p>From Syril’s perspective he’s trying to kill the asshole who ruined his life and put him in this place. He hates Andor. But from Andor’s perspective he’s like “Who is this random dude attacking me?”</p><p><strong>CP</strong>: It’s amazing! “Who are you?”</p><p><strong>ZZ</strong>: You can see Syril in that moment realize that Andor never cared about him. Never knew about him. Nothing. He means nothing to him. And then he gets killed. No special death. No redemption. Just an angry dude who thought he could be a good person in fascist evil empire realizing how small he was. Then death.</p><p><strong>CP</strong>: Everything he’s poured his energy into for all these years, and for what? To be hated by those he’s seemingly learned to respect, like the Ghorman leader, and to be completely unknown to the focus of his obsession. I do wonder what the ramifications of his death will be in the final run of episodes, though. I somehow suspect that we haven’t seen the last of his mother.</p><p>Also, speaking of all the chaos on Ghorman, one little detail that I really liked was the hotel employee uttering that famous line, “Rebellions are built on hope.” </p><p>Very often I think one of the worst tendencies of contemporary<em> Star Wars</em> is its impulse to explain everything, to fill out every mysterious space in its mythos, but this little nod resonates for me. It feels authentic and human, a little way of recognizing that every individual’s contribution to the struggle matters. Like, I totally believe that Cassian would remember that, and remember his interactions with the man who said it.</p><p><strong>ZZ</strong>: Yeah! I agree that <em>Star Wars</em> far too often wants to explain every detail and place it neatly in a timeline or a wiki. But that was a moment that worked for me because it showed that no voice is too small in a rebellion. This random hotel clerk on Ghorman ends up having a big impact on Andor and later Jyn Erso and her allies. In some ways, you could connect him to the successful mission to steal the Death Star plans as seen in <em>Rogue One. </em></p><p>And then after Ghorman we get Mon Mothma’s plan to call out the Empire publicly at the senate. A moment we’ve know about in canon for years, but finally get to see. And what a speech.</p><p><strong>CP</strong>: What. A. Speech.</p><p><strong>EG</strong>: Followed by one of the best escort missions I’ve ever seen. </p><p>I like that even as the Rebellion is gearing up and there’s more and more outright insurgencies brewing, we still get a big dose of <em>Star Wars </em>spy craft. What might be just another blaster light show takes a much sharper focus with the double-agents in Senator Organa’s circle and Cassian’s willingness to exploit the people around him to flip the odds.</p><p><strong>CP</strong>: And it did something <em>Andor </em>has repeatedly done which is use action both as action but also as something that informs character. It’s the second big moment this season when Mon Mothma is confronted with the reality of “Holy shit, what have I gotten into? What does this really demand of me?” and now I think, she very quickly has to learn to make her peace with it and move on.</p><p><strong>ZZ</strong>:<strong> </strong>“Welcome to the Rebellion!”</p><p><strong>CP</strong>: And I don’t want to gloss over the speech itself too quickly. I mean, my mouth was hanging open as I listened to it, as I felt the truth of it in my body.</p><p>I know the show was in production some time ago and it’s not like the writers intended to directly comment on the present moment in some ultra-specific way, but I really urge folks who are enjoying the show to read Roxana Hadidi’s piece for Vulture, “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vulture.com/article/andor-ghorman-massacre-mon-mothma-genocide-speech-explained.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vulture.com/article/andor-ghorman-massacre-mon-mothma-genocide-speech-explained.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Andor Dared To Say ‘Genocide</em></a></span>’.” I think she illuminates a big part of what makes these episodes extraordinary not just for<em> Star Wars, </em>but for television as a whole right now.</p><p><strong>EG</strong>: I was kind of shocked Disney (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://boycott.thewitness.news/target/disney&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://boycott.thewitness.news/target/disney" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which is currently facing a BDS boycott</a></span>) let them do it. </p><p><strong>ZZ</strong>: Same. </p><p>Thankfully, we don’t live in a timeline where a ruthless evil old guy has control over a large legislative body and can use fear to make them worship him and avoid directly criticizing him or pushing back on his plans.</p><p>And now for the moment that truly broke my heart. Andor telling Bix he’s done. That he wants a life with her. He chooses her over everything else. And her realizing, quietly as he says this, that she has to leave. It mirrors Dedra and Syril’s moment. Syril walks away from the person he loves because he no longer believes in the cause. Bix walks away from her love to save the cause she knows is more important. </p><p><strong>EG</strong>: She fired him over Zoom just like any great media executive would.</p><p><strong>CP</strong>: Absolutely crushing, and in a way I do have mixed feelings about. </p><p>We knew Bix had to be out of the picture by the time the series ended one way or another, of course, given that she’s not in <em>Rogue One</em>, and I do understand why she would make this choice. I think the story and our understanding of who she is support it well. But I did see someone on Bluesky remark that it’s almost as if <em>Andor</em>, as a show, thinks that to be really committed to a rebellion or a resistance movement, you can’t have other close attachments, when in truth of course you can. </p><p>Ultimately I’m cool with Bix making this choice, sad as it is, but it did make me feel that maybe somewhere in the midst of all of this, there could have been one lasting, healthy, happy relationship instead of a whole rebellion of Luthens who have made of their minds a sunless space. Well, I take it back. K-2SO did just show up so we know there’s some light in Cassian’s life!</p><p><strong>ZZ</strong>: I totally get that criticism. And I think there are smaller examples of relationships lasting in this rebellion. Mothma and Erskin (not romantic, but still) and Wilmon and that woman in the Ghorman resistance. So I’m not sold on the idea that the show is trying to say that, but I get the criticisms.</p><figure id="" data-id="e0cc9b72cb89542d5df0236e8eb8160e" data-recommend-id="image://e0cc9b72cb89542d5df0236e8eb8160e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lucasfilm / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e0cc9b72cb89542d5df0236e8eb8160e" data-recommend-id="image://e0cc9b72cb89542d5df0236e8eb8160e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And yes, Cassian has met K-2SO! It was nice to hear Alan Tudyk’s voice at the end. Tony Gilroy mentioned in the behind the scenes video about this episode that having Bix leave Andor right as K-2SO enters his life felt like the right move. And I agree. I really really really hope we get to see them be friends and rebel buddies. We deserve that!</p><p><strong>EG</strong>: For now it feels like they haven’t really resolved Bix’s struggles. Her leaving felt as much about her running away as it did forcing him to commit.</p><p><strong>CP</strong>: I agree. I wonder if we’ll see any more of her in the final episodes, or maybe learn about what she does in some spin-off comic or other story. I’d be curious to find out!</p><p><strong>ZZ</strong>: I hope so! I feel like taking Bix out of the series like this lets them race to <em>Rogue One</em>, which the final three episodes will do, without having to figure out reasons she wasn’t around. And now they have this awesome character people like from a popular show that they can use in future stories set during the Original Trilogy. I’d love to see Bix in more stuff. I also know the moment she learns about Cassian will be heartbreaking.</p><p>And so, here we are. The next three episodes will be set in the days before<em> Rogue One</em>. It’s coming to an end and I’m both excited to see it wrap up and sad its ending. Are you all ready to say goodbye to <em>Andor</em>?</p><p><strong>EG</strong>: No. I keep wishing there was an <em>Andor </em>immersive sim or <em>Cyberpunk 2077-</em>style RPG.</p><p><strong>CP</strong>: Not really! That’s the one drawback of the three-episode drop format: it all comes to an end so much faster. </p><p>But I’m also glad the show has burned so brightly, that Tony Gilroy and co. made it so dense with drama and character and relevance and didn’t try to spread it out or water it down. At this point, I’m just hoping for a strong ending, one that cements <em>Andor’s </em>position even further as one of the greatest works of storytelling ever set in the <em>Star War</em>s universe.</p><p><strong>ZZ</strong>: I’ll see you all next week for the end. I’m not ready either.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Devil May Cry director Hideki Kamiya has revealed he'd "love" to remake the first game in Capcom's classic hack-and-slash series, acknowledging the aging original "really does feel like a 24-year-old game design" after all this time.
</p>
<p>
Back in December, Kamiya confirmed he'd entered into a new partnership with Capcom - the publisher he left in 2006 after helming such classics as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a>, Okami, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/viewtiful-joe">Viewtiful Joe</a> - and was responding to a fan question inspired by the news during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOBoqQCcRTQ">latest episode of his YouTube show</a> (as translated by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideki-kamiya-says-hed-love-to-remake-devil-may-cry-now-hes-working-with-capcom-again/">VGC)</a>. When asked how he might approach a remake of the first Devil May Cry, he replied, "I'd love to do that."
</p>
<p>"I usually don't replay my own games after release," he continued, "and Devil May Cry is no exception. But once in a while, I catch gameplay clips and think, 'Yeah, this really does feel like a 24-year-old game design.'" As to how he might tackle a remake, Kamiya said, "With today's technology and game design approach... I'd want to remake it from the ground up. If that ever happens... well, I don't think seriously unless it's really happening, so right now, I don't have anything in mind. But if the time comes, I'll come up with something. That's what I do! So Capcom, leave it to me! Also, let me handle Viewtiful Joe too!"

Since its debut outing in 2001, Devil May Cry - which follows the demon-hunting adventures of white-haired protagonist Dante - has seen five major instalments (plus the polarising <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dmc-devil-may-cry-review">2013 reboot DmC: Devil May Cry</a>), but Kamiya only directed the first. After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideki-kamiya-on-leaving-platinumgames-i-couldnt-allow-myself-to-kill-my-soul">departing PlatinumGames in 2023</a>, he formed new studio Clovers, which is currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/okami-sequel-in-the-works-with-capcom-and-hideki-kamiyas-new-studio-clovers">working with Capcom to create a sequel to his beloved action-adventure Okami</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for Devil May Cry, the series has remained dormant since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-cry-5-review-an-unashamedly-old-school-retooling-of-an-action-classic">2019's well-received fifth instalment</a>, but it recently returned to the spotlight thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-cry-season-1-review">Netflix's anime adaptation</a>, which Eurogamer contributor Graeme Virtue called a "spirited take on the mythos" last month.

Others are hoping for a delay so that they can push their own in-development games back into 2027 and get more time. </p><p>One developer working on a big multiplayer game told <em>Bloomberg’s </em>Jason Schreier that they had previously delayed their game from fall 2025 to spring 2026. This was mostly done because the title needed more time, but it also was done to avoid <em>GTA 6.</em> Now they’re in a tough spot. Delaying again would be very expensive and make it harder for the game to be profitable. But not delaying and landing right next to <em>GTA 6</em> could be a disaster, as Rockstar’s open-world sequel is likely to suck up all the oxygen in the room the month it launches. However, there’s also the fear <em>GTA 6 </em>gets delayed again, meaning that if they move their release window to avoid it, they might land right next to it with no options to escape. </p><p><em>Bloomberg </em>reports that in meetings happening at major publishers and studios across the industry, business analysts  are trying to figure out if Rockstar’s big sequel will arrive on time or get delayed again, and how that will affect their current in-development projects. And none of this factors in <em>GTA 6</em>'s online mode, which might launch later. (In 2013, <em>GTA Online</em>’s release followed that of <em>GTA V </em>by a few weeks.) That could prove to be a huge problem for an online game that avoids the initial launch, but still gets devoured by <em>GTA 6</em>'s multiplayer mode. </p><p>We know of at least one specific game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-release-date-showcase-ea-1851779462&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-release-date-showcase-ea-1851779462">EA’s upcoming <em>Battlefield</em></a></span>, that has changed its release plans since the delay of <em>GTA 6</em> and is now aiming for sometime before March 2026. The company’s CEO told investors that he believed that “the window is clearer than it was before” for a new <em>Battlefield </em>game since the delay.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/belgian-warhammer-player-boycotting-warhammer-world-championships-in-act-of-political<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A lucky player has turned down an invitation to the Warhammer World Championships. This prestigious competitive event is one of the biggest in the game's history, and the reason for the player's refusal is political and ethical activism.</p>

<h2>The Warhammer World Championships Boycott</h2>

<p>In a thread of posts on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/darkpips.bsky.social/post/3loi4fpuonc2c" rel="nofollow">Bluesky social</a>, Belgian Warhammer player Quentin Dubus stated that he had received a golden ticket for the Warhammer World Championships after competing at a recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Age of Sigmar</em></a> tournament. This is an all-expenses-paid invitation to an event where you represent your country on the world stage.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-world-championships-dubus-bluesky-posts.jpg?itok=AJIHlc5M 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-world-championships-dubus-bluesky-posts.jpg?itok=yXuHUqP3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>However, as the thread continues, Dubus states that he will not attend the event. The Warhammer World Championships are being held in the United States, a country currently acting extremely hostile to foreign visitors of all stripes. So hostile that certain indie studios are <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/indie-ttrpg-studio-rowan-rook-and-decard-not-attending-gencon-2025-over-travel" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">cancelling convention</a> plans because they feel unsafe.</p>

<p>Dubus explicitly states the reason for his boycott is because of these authoritarian actions by the US government. He says he refuses to travel to a country lead by someone whose policies harm trans people, marginalized communities, and the environment. The thread even ends on a call to action by Games Workshop, saying the act of hosting the event in the US sends a mixed message of community values.</p>

<p>Current events aside, Games Workshop has had to confront <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/games-workshop-speak-out-against-hate-groups" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">similar criticism</a> in the past. Their vastly popular sci-fi far future franchise, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a> is routinely expressed with maximalist fascist iconography. While originally intended to be satire, these trappings do attract more bigoted communities to form. So much so that Games Workshop keeps restating a simple tagline, "Warhammer is for everybody."</p>

<p>Dubus is not alone in his boycott of the Warhammer World Championships. In a report by <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/warhammer-age-of-sigmar/golden-ticket-winners-boycott-world-championships" rel="nofollow">Wargamer</a>, other international players have turned down their golden ticket in solidarity with Dubus' decision. These include Australian Kill Team player Emma Hallinan, and Swedish player Konstantinos Kellis.</p>

These 20 percent rewards in Epic’s games are here to stay.”</p><p>Alongside that new policy is a similar but temporary 20 percent cash back bonus on all Epic Games Store game purchases, including from third parties. That runs until August 31. So if you buy, say, <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> for $50, you’ll get $10 back to spend on other stuff. Epic is apparently feeling a bit generous after a federal judge recently ruled against Apple, forcing it to allow app makers to link directly to their webstores through their iPhone apps.  </p><p>Apple is supposed to comply even while it’s appealing. In the meantime, Epic’s ongoing feud with the App Store is netting everyone else some extra bonus rewards. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-ai-business-ed-zitron<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“What a time to be alive,” I regularly say, exclusively ruefully, about drawing breath in the year 2025. I’m sure you do, too. The planet is on fire. The internet has devolved into an AI-generated slop puddle. Everything costs too much, and also it’s all busted. A mass of inconveniences have congealed to form a crisis, but if there’s one silver lining, at least we know where to point the finger: management types who spent the past several decades ushering in this tedious, wasteful world. On the latest Aftermath Hours, we talk about why they need to go.</p><p>This time around we engage in a savvy act of brand synergy by bringing on <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/reality-check/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extremely vocal AI critic</a> and friend of the show Ed Zitron to celebrate the release of <a href="https://aftermath.site/buy-destroy-ai-shirt-aftermath-kim-hu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftermath’s new “Destroy AI” shirt</a>, which we made in conjunction with <a href="https://kim-hu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kim Hu</a>, an incredible (human) artist, and are very proud of. We eventually get around to talking about the extra-shimmery AI bubble, but first: <em>JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure</em>. Ed started watching it recently, and three-fifths of Aftermath have been obsessed with it for years, so obviously we’ve got to ramble like a runaway train about the good (cool powers, clever fights, fun characters), the bad (a season that you can cut the entire middle out of), and the ugly (baby poop jokes) of the incredibly idiosyncratic anime.</p><p>Then we discuss the societal rot AI continues to inspire, with <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/openai-chatgpt-ai-cheating-education-college-students-school.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kids cheating their way through school</a>, normies <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/notalawyer.bsky.social/post/3loltnrk6zs25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">having no idea what hallucinations are</a>, and vulnerable people being <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/ai-spiritual-delusions-destroying-human-relationships-1235330175/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talked into believing they’re god</a>. Still, Ed doesn’t think this thing – or at least, the companies undergirding it – can last. The people in charge have no idea what human beings actually want or need, and that will come back to bite them eventually.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, we discuss <a href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-analysis-details-rockstar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em></a>, which is a departure for the series in that it seems like a romance between two legitimately likable main characters. But can it sustain such an intimate dynamic in a game where you’ll inevitably end up murdering 9,000 dudes? I guess we’ll see!&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can turn “Destroy AI” into an entire designer fashion label.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ed:</strong> We’re in the era of the business idiot. The business idiot controls everything. The business idiot is so excited about AI. Why? Well, AI’s transformational power. What is that power? I need to take a phone call! I will be right back, but when I’m back I will tell you about the power.</p><p>Here’s <a href="https://x.com/levie/status/1919573650547622130" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a tweet</a> from [Box CEO] Aaron Levie: “AI lowers the barrier to getting started on anything, which means people start doing far more. But to do great work still has a long tail of execution, judgment, creativity, and knowledge about the specific domain, which means AI replaces far fewer jobs than we think.”</p><p>What the fuck are you talking about? What the fuck does that mean?</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>That just slid off of my brain.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I started thinking about what I’m gonna have for dinner.</p><p><strong>Ed: </strong>This is exactly it, though. There are people out there that that’s what they want to read. It doesn’t mean anything, but it makes them feel good about… management? They think that management is “I’ve read enough LinkedIn stuff, and I’ve been to enough conferences that I am now manager mode, and my people under me are doing good, and if not, I’ll get them fired. And then they’ll bring me new people that can be fired if I do anything wrong.”</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> “This is definitely not a sign that I’m doing something badly every time and that sometimes the people are just good enough that they overcome all the unnecessary obstacles I place in their path.”</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I have a very good friend who’s in a management position, and I think what differentiates her, specifically, from a bad manager is that she understands that her job is helping individual real human beings do their best possible job at work. And she spends a lot of time, on an individual basis, working with these people so that they can feel empowered to do their jobs and feel enriched by their work.</p><p>I’ve also worked with managers of the kind you described that clearly see me as an anonymous human resource, and I do daydream about throwing a giant steamroller at them.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> That’s what all the going to the gym is for: to help you lift the steamroller. Eventually you’ll be like “Alright, I’m strong enough. Today’s the day.”</p><p><strong>Ed:</strong> But anyway, Clubhouse, fucking pointless, but everyone agreed on it. Metaverse, same deal. Crypto, same deal. AI, same deal, except AI has more of a product. The same theme through all of this is that the people making the calls and telling us what the transformative future will be are not participating in it. None of these people! None of them!&nbsp;</p><p>Now, AI allows them to, to an extent; these middle managers love it because they can make it look like they did a job. It can make them look productive, which usually they’d have to do by being in an office. Usually they’d have be like [faces of consternation] and it’s 7:05 PM when they could have left at 6 PM.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Staring at <em>Minesweeper </em>on their computer screen like “This is the hardest decision I’m gonna make all year! Argh, it blew up.”</p><p><strong>Ed:</strong> Looking at a Word doc and you can’t quite see the words, but if you look closer, it just says, “Notes. Work today?”</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It’s that <em>Spongebob </em>bit where he’s writing for hours and then it’s like “THE–”</p><p><strong>Ed: </strong>The thing is, what’s happening right now was inevitable. It was inevitable that we would eventually get a situation where real people who do stuff would get overwhelmed by people who don’t. And it goes beyond the fact that they want to automate labor. It’s beyond that because they don’t understand what labor they want to automate. They don’t understand what it is they’re trying to do. They’re like “You just write fucking content, right? I can just have AI do this. Suck my asshole.”&nbsp;</p><p>And it’s like, why do you think people read words? “For information, right?” Sure, OK. How do you think words provide that? Is it that they’re written with a purpose? “Yes, but AI can do that.” Can it? Is there purpose behind anything AI does, other than a prompt? No. Why do people like my writing? It’s because I am writing it. It’s because it is my voice, and I’m explaining things so that they understand a message that I have in my head. Same with you.&nbsp;</p><p>I think we’re watching what happens when the people who don’t really understand work control everything. There is no reason to really do this AI stuff. No one’s making the money. It’s popular, I guess, but in the way where if everyone agrees to do something, something is popular.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>The macarena was popular. A lot of things get popular.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ed: </strong>And even then, you didn’t have CEOs being like “Let’s all do the macarena once a day to improve corporate happiness.” But I think if Sam Altman told them to, they’d consider it.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-analysis-details-rockstar"><h3>A Video Game Trailer Maker’s Take On The Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer</h3></a><p>"If this was a better trailer, then people would be that much more hyped.

			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-team-says-stadium-mode-is-very-popular-outlines-future-roadmap/">Overwatch 2</a> team at Blizzard has just unionized, making it the second wall-to-wall union under Blizzard after the <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/world-warcraft-employees-gain-union-recognition-communications-workers-america">World of Warcraft team unionized in July 2024</a>.</p>
<p>It's the latest major step forward for unionization in the video game industry, as almost 200 developers at Activision Blizzard are members of the Overwatch Gamemakers Guild-CWA. They now join the ranks of <a href="https://code-cwa.org/news/workers-bethesda-game-studios-achieve-union">One BGS USA</a>, <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2024/07/01/game-workers-file-to-unionize-with-cwa-canada/">One BGS Montreal</a>, <a href="https://x.com/ZeniMaxWorkers">ZeniMax Workers United</a>, <a href="https://x.com/WeAreGWA">Game Workers Alliance at Raven Software</a>, and the aforementioned WoWGG-CWA.</p>
<p>"<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Nearly 200 game developers behind Activision Blizzard’s hit franchise Overwatch have joined the Communications Workers of America (CWA), becoming the latest group of video game workers at Microsoft-owned studios to form a wall-to-wall</span></em> <em>union</em>," a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/overwatch-game-developers-secure-union-recognition-communications-workers-america">press release</a> from the CWA reads.</p>
<p>"<em>A neutral arbitrator confirmed today that an overwhelming majority of workers have either signed a union authorization card or indicated that they wanted union representation via an online portal. The workers will be members of CWA Local 9510 in Orange County, Calif., and Microsoft has recognized the union.</em>"</p>
<p>While some of the above unions are department-specific, the WoWGG-CWA and the newly formed Overwatch 2 union spread across all departments, from artists to QA to game designers, level designers, etc. The OWGG-CWA will now join its fellow unions in negotiating their first contract, a process that the CWA previously accused <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/microsofts-bargaining-delays-leave-video-game-workers-without-union-contracts-two">Microsoft of dragging its feet on</a>.</p>
<p>Bargaining delays were one of the reasons the ZeniMax Workers United union members cited for overwhelmingly voting in favor of giving strike powers to their bargaining representatives. At the beginning of last month, the vote was announced, with 94% of members voting 'yes' to strike authorization. They have yet to announce if a strike will be called as negotiations continue.</p>
<p>In a report from <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-blizzard-team-4-union-microsoft-1851779922">Kotaku</a>, Blizzard test analyst Simon Hedrick cited the <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/">mass layoffs</a> that started 2024 as to what drove him to seriously consider unionizing, and that "<em>u</em><em>p to that moment I’d been really happy in what I was doing.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>People were gone out of nowhere and there was nothing we could do about it</em>," Hendrick said. "<em>What I want to protect most here is the people</em>."</p>
<p>Unions can't prevent layoffs, but they can give those affected by them the best-case version of a worst-case scenario, and they can also improve the lives of workers in a number of other ways. Hopefully, the new Overwatch union and the other groups under Microsoft will be able to reach a deal sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>"<em>I'm organizing because I believe in this company, our teams, and the work we do together. Unionizing is about having a seat at the table so that we can work with leadership to build better, more sustainable working conditions,</em>" said senior test analyst and organizing committee member Jess Castillo in the previously mentioned press release. "<em>Ultimately, when we're supported and thriving, we can deliver the best possible experiences to our players, which is what brought all of us here in the first place.</em>"</p>

We usually only see hikes when jumping from one console cycle to another. This time around, however, we’re seeing pressure from ballooning development budgets and trade wars bump up pricing for the most premium releases. <em>Mario Kart World</em> is $80, and Microsoft has hinted that the next <em>Call of Duty </em>will be as well. </p><p>Meanwhile, some of the top-rated games of 2025, like <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, are only $50. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mafia-4-old-country-august-launch-ps5-xbox-50-trailer-1851779729&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-4-old-country-august-launch-ps5-xbox-50-trailer-1851779729">That’s the case with <em>Mafia: The Old Country </em>as well</a></span>, another 2K-published “premium game” that’s being positioned by the company as a more focused, cinematic release. It will “provide a linear highly-polished narrative experience that can easily complement the other more persistent games our players also love and engage with on a more consistent basis,” 2K announced this week. </p><p>It seems unlikely that <em>Borderlands 4</em> will drop that low, though it could surprise everyone by sticking to its predecessor’s last-gen price point of $60. An $80 price point seems more likely, though Pitchford said that while he wants his team to get paid and to be able to reinvest that money into future projects, he also wants as many people as possible to be able to pick up and play the game. And I’m sure that regardless of the base price, there will be a $100 or even $120 deluxe edition for the day-one super fans out there. </p><p> “I’ll tell you the truth, I don’t know,” Pitchford told the audience at PAX East. “That is the truth.” It’s hard to see from the Twitch stream whether his nose started growing after he said that. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The set includes two 6.6-foot cables capable of 240W charging with PD 3.1 and QC 4.0 support.

                <p>Blizzard's Overwatch 2 team has unionized. The wall-to-wall union--referred to as the Overwatch Gamemakers Guild--includes nearly 200 developers, ranging from artists and QA testers to writers and engineers. It is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzards-world-of-warcraft-dev-team-has-unionized/1100-6525284/" data-ref-id="1100-6525284">second union to form at the company since last July</a>, when the team behind Blizzard's hit MMO World of Warcraft successfully formed a union of its own. The Communications Workers of America (CWA) announced the union in a press release shared with <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-blizzard-team-4-union-microsoft-1851779922" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a> earlier today, writing that "an overwhelming majority of workers" supported the initiative.</p><p>"Game developers behind Activision Blizzard’s hit franchise Overwatch have joined the Communications Workers of America (CWA), becoming the latest group of video game workers at Microsoft-owned studios to form a wall-to-wall union," the CWA wrote. "A neutral arbitrator confirmed today that an overwhelming majority of workers have either signed a union authorization card or indicated that they wanted union representation via an online portal."</p><p>With the Overwatch 2 team's unionization, the number of unionized game developers working at Microsoft now exceeds 2,000 employees. However, the Overwatch Gamemakers Guild now has to bargain for its first contract--a process that Microsoft has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-and-zenimax-union-votes-to-authorize-a-strike/1100-6530524/" data-ref-id="1100-6530524">accused of dragging out</a>.</p><p>According to Simon Hedrick, a test analyst at Blizzard, the layoffs at the beginning of 2024 were largely what motivated the team to unionize. Hedrick told <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-blizzard-team-4-union-microsoft-1851779922" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a> that "Up to that moment I'd been really happy in what I was doing.” Hedrick of course refers to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-cutting-1900-jobs-from-its-video-game-division/1100-6520601/" data-ref-id="1100-6520601">sweeping layoffs by Microsoft</a> last January, in which the tech giant cut over 1,900 people from its video game division, including Blizzard president Mike Ybarra.</p><p>"People were gone out of nowhere and there was nothing we could do about it," Hedrick told Kotaku.</p><p>In addition to the looming threat of layoffs, the Overwatch 2 team also cited pay disparities, work-from-home restrictions, and wanting certain protections--such as freedom from crunch and guaranteed severance packages--as contributing factors to their unionization. According to Kotaku, Blizzard employees have repeatedly stressed that "improving their working conditions can also lead to better games," while layoffs and uncompetitive pay makes them worse.</p><p>Blizzard UI Artist Sadie Boyd also weighed in on the decision to unionize, telling Kotaku "We're not just a number on an Excel sheet. We want to make games but we can't do it without a sense of security."</p>

		<p>Another shortened week is in the bag, and for plenty of gamers the weekend can’t come soon enough. Game Pass subscribers in particular are getting a lot of good games of late, with Revenge of the Savage Planet now out on there and DOOM: The Dark Ages set to follow next week.</p>
<p>I’ve been playing both those games this past week, as well as the newly announced grand strategy epic of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/08/europa-universalis-5-preview-hands-on-eu5/">Europa Universalis V</a>!</p>
<p><strong>Dom</strong> has been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/08/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review/">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a>… with me, funnily enough. We had a good fun time running around the multiple angry planets in this quirky Metroidvania sequel, but Dom took the lead and played a good bunch on his own as well. And for more of his alone time, there was Tetris and Spirit of the North 2.</p>

<p>While we’ve come to the end of the review train, <strong>Aran</strong> is closer to the start of his, playing the blacksmithing adventure of Blades of Fire – more on that sometime soonish. He’s also started a new save in Football Manager 24 with Ebbsfleet, who he’s dragged to a playoff spot for promotion to League 2.</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> polished off some reviews of Kiborg and Spiritfall, a pair of roguelites with different levels of charm, and has also been really enjoying his time with Atomfall.</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc’s</strong> been playing Oblivion Remastered, “which is great despite an awful loot system and repetitive and hard to navigate caves/dungeons”, and made starts on Split Fiction with his sister, on Sea of Stars for yet more RPG-ing, and Chains of Freedom.</p>

<p>And who’s this? A wild <strong>Reuben</strong> has dragged himself out of his most intense studies to play some games for a bit. He’s been playing older titles while waiting for new ones, finishing FUGA again and about to make a start on FUGA 2, what with the third one coming along soon, and has been refusing to play with “modern controls” or visuals while working through Tomb Raider I-III Remastered.</p>
<p>In total agreement with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/05/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review/">our 10/10 review</a>, <strong>Steve</strong> has been having a fantastic time with Clair Obscur, so much so that he’s doing all the&nbsp;Gestral trials and unlocked all the swimsuits – “for research purposes, of course”. Besides that, he’s still grinding through Lego Star Wars, and enjoyed the throwback that was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/06/captain-blood-review-original-pirate-material/">Captain Blood</a>.</p>

<p>And finally we come to <strong>Miguel</strong>, who had the special task of reviewing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/09/doom-the-dark-ages-review/">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a> and enjoyed it, even if not quite as much as DOOM Eternal. He’s also been carrying on with&nbsp;Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you played this week?</em></p>

At least the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-where-to-buy">Black Bolt and White Flare Pokémon Center preorders</a> avoided a hostile bot takeover this time around. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most dramatic crash this week is <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObXmY?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greninja ex 214/167</a>, crashing by nearly half when compared the the start of this year. We're also seeing some nice price drops across Obsidian Flames and the elusive 151 expansions. Meanwhile, <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1EVR?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dragonite V</a> from Evolving Skies is doing the opposite, nearly doubling in value compared to the start of this year, and the artwork alone always made this card undervalued. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qr2Krn?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charizard V Alt Art</a> is also a banger, depicting a Pokémon battle against Venusaur whilst slowly climbing up in value. But <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnxlX?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rayquazza VMAX Alt Art</a> is quite literally soaring high, scoring an extra $100 in value since the start of this year. Let's dig into all the rest of the biggest Pokémon TCG climbers and crashers of the week.</p><p id="card-crashes"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Card Crashes">Pokémon Card Crashes</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/09/pixel-9-2025-05-09t113825-747-1746803600091.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Whilst we're finally seeing a noticeable climb in Sword and Shield era Pokémon Cards, Scarlet and Violet series cards are settling back down into the realm of reality for the most part. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z7O2x7?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Alakazam ex SIR</a> from 151 is a georgous card, and it's 34% lower in price than the beggining of March. There's absolutley no reason for not having Uri Gellars Grandad claiming a spot in your binder this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bulbasaur was my first starter Pokémon when I first loaded up Pokémon Blue way back when, so this <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3GkpE?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Bulbasaur IR</a> has a special place in my heart. This card has dropped by a massive 52% since mid-March, so there's no reason to not catch this beautiful card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving onto Obsidian Flames, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7O2x7?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ninetales IR</a> has always been one of the best cards of the set. If you agree then it's time to snap this card up seeing as it's crashed by 40% from Feburary so a reasonable $18.17.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">People can complain about Obsidian Flames all they want, but it's <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yDqpr?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charizard ex SIR</a> so cool. Rocking a stained glass look in it's Tera form, it's a show stopper for sure. Granted it's not come down too much since March, but $5 less is $5 saved. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally the biggest crasher this month is <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObXmY?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Greninja ex SIR</a>, which at one point was set to become the most expensive Scarlet and Violet era card. Then Prismatic Evolutions came along and took the FOMO up 10 notches. It's still a class card that's holding it's weight at $275, but imagine reading this and paying $411.62 at the end of Feburary. Oh dear.</p><p id="card-climbers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Card Climbers">Pokémon Card Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/09/pixel-9-2025-05-09t161701-761-1746804035935.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving onto this weeks climbers, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnxlX?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Rayquazza VMAX alt art</a> is one of the main grails of the Sword and Shield era. It was already a $500+ card, but at $649.99 it shows no signs of slowing down. This could arguably hit the $1,000 mark in a few years, so i'd get one fi you can afford it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There can't be enough Kanto love in my book, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qr2Krn?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Charizard V Alt Art</a> smashes it out of the park with this Venusaur battle. The angle is great and it feels like a moving card instead of a static body shot so many Pokémon cards are guilty of (Looking at you, WotC era). It's earned another $40 since January, and there's no reason why this card can't get over $200 before the year is out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1EVR?object_uuid=32a05f7d-a1b4-44ce-91b5-473fb8c89985&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dragonite V Alt Art</a> is one of the highlights of Evolving Skies. It's a fan favorite Pokémon that can look cute as hell or ready to rip another mon's face off. It's a full package that looks nothing like it's pre evolutions, but that's ok because it's Dragonite. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's cute side comes out in this artwork, and that's exactly why it's nearly doubled in value since the middle of January. It's now rocking a solid $225, so make sure to grab yours before it flies any higher. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-biggest-crashers-and-climbers-of-the-week-may-2">Did you catch last week's article</a>? There are some bangers on there too.</p><p id="sealed-boosters"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Sealed Boosters">Pokémon Card Sealed Boosters</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've dedicated your life to pulling chase cards yourself, here's what we can find in stock right now. Just watch out for pricing over MSRP, we're in a wierd spot as Pokémon trainers right now, so don't pay more than what you have too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-release-full-release-schedule-2025">Pokémon TCG full Release Schedule</a> so far for this year too so you don't miss anything.
