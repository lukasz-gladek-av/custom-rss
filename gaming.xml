            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new survey shared on <a href="https://x.com/MGSMGN/status/1969354623007014979">X (formerly Twitter) by user Metal Gear Network</a> (spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/konami-asked-fans-which-metal-gear-remade/">Insider-Gaming</a>) reveals that Konami wants to know which Metal Gear Solid game fans think should get the remake treatment next, now that we're beyond the release of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://questant.jp/q/7DNR3EOO">survey</a> is entirely in Japanese, so unless you can read it or have a translation tool handy, you'll probably struggle to answer the questions to be able to submit your choice. But the key takeaway here is that Konami is clearly trying to gauge what fans want to see next.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The choices presented in the survey are: </p>



<ul>
<li>Metal Gear</li>



<li>Metal Gear 2 Solid Snake</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</li>



<li>Other (with a box to type in your selection)</li>
</ul>



<p>We know that there is more MGS on the horizon, if only through the coming release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-4-peace-walker-mgs5-references-found-in-metal-gear-solid-master-collection-files/">MGS: Master Collection Vol. 2</a>, which is said to include MGS4, MGS: Peace Walker, and MGSV. Those wouldn't be major remakes or touch-ups of the aforementioned titles, though; they'd be in line with the first volume of the Master Collection, which is, they'd just be a means of playing the series on modern hardware. Of course, there's a larger question around what this would mean for MGS4 due to it currently being marooned on PlayStation 3, but that's a whole different topic.</p>



<p> So far, the MGSD: Snake Eater remake has had a strong commercial start, <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-million-seller-day-one/">selling over 1 million copies in its first day,</a> according to Konami. It's also had a strong critical start, with players and critics (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/">Wccftech included</a>) praising the remake for its efforts in updating what many consider to be one of the best stealth-action games out there.</p>



<p>From an external point of view, strong sales and critical reception should be exactly what Konami wanted out of the MGSD: Snake Eater remake, so why not move forward and pick another game in the series to repeat it with? Besides MGS2: Sons of Liberty, MGS3: Snake Eater was the riskiest game to remake, because it's the one that most of the series fans hold in higher regard than the rest.</p>



<p>Just like it did with <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-sells-over-2-million-units-worldwide/">Silent Hill 2</a>, Konami got the most difficult one off the board first, and by all means, knocked it out of the park. There will be high expectations for whatever comes next, but at least we can have some confidence in what Konami is trying to do with the series.</p>



<p>So, which game would you pick to get the same treatment that MGS3 got next? Personally, I don't need any of them to get a remake, I'd just like to be able to play my beloved MGS4 without having to boot up my aging PS3.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has revealed that this year marks its "largest investment" in the Xbox Game Pass subscription service to date, so it's clear the company isn't too fazed by discussions around whether the service is good for developers or not.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-xboxs-increasingly-vital-indie-publishing-operation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, Xbox indie boss Chris Charla confirms that 2025 has seen the biggest investment in Game Pass in the service's history, and he also reveals that Xbox has "signed deals with more than 150 partners to expand the catalog".</p>

<p>Charla says that "the majority" of studios whose games have been included as part of Game Pass "want to bring their future titles to the service", too, so the somewhat ambivalent buzz doesn't seem to be deterring developers who've got experience with the platform either.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-largest-investment-there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand.jpg?itok=zEhnasiB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-largest-investment-there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand.jpg?itok=AxI2P82x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox Game Pass is attracting indie titles like the upcoming&nbsp;<em>There Are No Ghosts at the Grand</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Xbox making its largest investment in Game Pass yet comes after a couple of high-profile industry figures expressed concern that the service might be doing more harm than good for developers, whether they be first-party or third-party studios.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, former Bethesda exec Pete Hines said subscription services were "worth jack shit" without companies making the effort to "figure out how to balance the needs of the service" with those who are "providing the content".</p>

<p>PlayStation boss Shawn Layden appeared to agree, linking Hines' comments on social media platform LinkedIn and asking whether subscription services were "healthy and helpful" for those who make games.</p>

<p>Layden's comments drew agreement <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-shannon-loftis-comments" rel="nofollow">from former Xbox VP Shannon Loftis</a>, who added that game adoption on Game Pass "comes at the expense of retail revenue" and that the service creates "weird inner tensions" among developers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/human-fall-flat-xbox-game-pass_0.jpg?itok=xY9tfjwL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/human-fall-flat-xbox-game-pass_0.jpg?itok=wGw6bsPt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Game Pass hits like&nbsp;<em>Human: Fall Flat&nbsp;</em>haven't stopped some wondering whether the service is good for developers.</figcaption></figure><p>Whether or not Game Pass is actually good for developers is a question that's likely to continue to spark debate, but one thing's for sure: Xbox is still sure the service works. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Game Pass-related.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>While reports are circulating that Disney-owned ABC and late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-fallon-colbert-stewart-trump-kirk-2000627249"><span>in talks to bring </span><i><span>Jimmy Kimmel Live</span></i></a> <span>back on air after the show was pulled last week, more high-profile names from some of Disney’s biggest franchises have spoken out in protest of the decision. While some, like Aunt May actor Marisa Tomei and She-Hulk actor Tatiana Maslany, have </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-abc-disney-boycott-marvel-marisa-tomei-2000627135"><span>called for a straight-up boycott</span></a><span> of the company’s services, some other major players in </span><i><span>Star Wars </span></i><span>and Marvel are simply voicing their support for Kimmel and condemning ABC and Disney’s decision.</span></p> <p><span>Mark Hamill, who has portrayed original </span><i><span>Star Wars </span></i><span>protagonist Luke Skywalker since long before Disney ever got its hands on the franchise, posted on Bluesky that he believes Jimmy Kimmel being pulled from the air in an effort to placate the FCC and the Trump administration will only embolden further attacks on free speech in America, and says that he finds Kimmel “very talented and funny.” This is in reference to comments from ex-Disney CEO Michael Eisner, who expressed similar sentiments </span><a href="https://x.com/Michael_Eisner/status/1969088566098870363"><span>on his X account</span></a><span> and signed off with the same final line.</span></p>   <p><span>Another big </span><i><span>Star Wars </span></i><span>name calling out Disney for this move is Dan Gilroy, a writer whose work on the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/andor-season-2-ending-vgchat-star-wars-rogue-one-10-12-1851780720"><span>Disney+ series </span><i><span>Andor</span></i></a><span> earned him an Emmy. Gilroy wrote a guest column on </span><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/andor-dan-gilroy-jimmy-kimmel-commentary-1236549627/"><i><span>Deadline</span></i></a><span> comparing the real-world actions of the Trump administration to events of the show, which focuses on the Galactic Empire’s tyrannical reign.</span></p>

 <p><span>“As one of the writers on the Disney+ drama </span><i><span>Andor</span></i><span>, we spent six years thinking about a fascist takeover of a galaxy far, far away,” Gilroy wrote. “Six years thinking about ordinary beings as an authoritarian regime comes in for the kill. Many people saw parallels between </span><i><span>Andor</span></i><span> and the real world. I see them as well, particularly in the events of the last week.”</span></p>

 <p><span>On the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cinematic-universe-mcu-best-worst-movie-avengers-1851765913"><span>Marvel</span></a><span> side of things, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pedro-pascal-vanessa-kirby-anxiety-touch-controversy-1851787007"><span>Pedro Pascal</span></a><span>, who plays Mr. Fantastic in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review-movie-marvel-mcu-1851786852"><i><span>Fantastic Four: First Steps</span></i></a> <span>and the upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-4-cast-announcement-stream-mcu-marvel-1851772474"><i><span>Avengers: Doomsday</span></i></a><span>, posted a photo of himself with Kimmel to his Instagram with the caption “Standing with you @jimmykimmellive Defend #FreeSpeech Defend #DEMOCRACY.” Pascal also <a href="https://kotaku.com/mandalorian-grogu-trailer-disney-boycott-2000627542">plays the Mandalorian in&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em></a>.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>Mark Ruffalo, who plays the Hulk in the MCU, has been vocally supporting Kimmel since the decision was made last week, criticizing the Trump administration </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJewRRfp4K4"><span>during a No Kings stream on September 18</span></a><span>, saying this move was an attack on free speech. After it was reported that Disney’s </span><a href="https://collider.com/disney-stock-nosedive-dis-nyse-drop-boycott-reaction-jimmy-kimmel/"><span>stock had dropped</span></a><span> following the calls for a boycott (though some dispute if this seven-percent drop is anything more than a standard fluctuation), Ruffalo warned </span><a href="https://www.threads.com/@markruffalo/post/DO1CP-Jjtsj"><span>on Threads</span></a><span> that “It’s going to go down a lot further if they cancel his show.”</span></p> <p><span>Disney and Kimmel are reportedly currently in talks, looking for a </span><a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/jimmy-kimmel-abc-disney-late-night-comeback-1236524695/"><span>“compromise” to bring the late-night show back</span></a><span>, but there has been no official word on whether these talks have borne any fruit.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Natural History Museum of London is getting a Pokémon pop-up shop experience beginning in early 2026. It’ll have exclusive stuff fans can’t get anywhere else. It’s intended to be part of Pokémon’s 30th anniversary celebration. Why does it seem destined to be yet <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-van-gogh-museum-scalpers-pikachu-card-1850882131">another scalper-infested mess</a>?</p> <p>Fans will need to register for a free ticket to visit the Pokémon x Natural History Museum pop-up store, which will run from 26 January 2026 until 22 March 2026. If you can’t make it to London yourself, the merchandise will be available to buy from the <a href="https://www.nhmshop.co.uk/?srsltid=AfmBOorBseC_DhtYXMqRbGzy3Zxn6ye5OvDqVzxM9dHraX54OsyrcOM7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online Natural History Museum shop</a> as well, according to <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-GB/Go-wild-as-The-Pokemon-Company-International-and-Natural-History-Museu">today’s press release</a>. It’ll include clothing, stationery, accessories, prints, and a brand-new exclusive plush, all of which “are sure to delight fans of all ages.”</p> <p>“The Natural History Museum and Pokémon share a fascination for and focus on the natural world and its creatures, from their evolution to their environment,” reads a press release. “In the Pokémon world, Pokémon can evolve into many forms which allow them to adapt smoothly and perfectly to any environment. Meanwhile, the Natural History Museum’s halls take you on a journey through the evolution and diversity of life on planet earth, from prehistoric dinosaurs to the species we live alongside today.”</p>

 <p>While The Pokémon Company hasn’t teased exactly what the exclusive merch will be, it’s promising “products designed especially for the collaboration.” Whether that’s a fossil-centric approach to the franchise’s creatures or something else thematically appropriate remains to be seen. “Design inspiration has been drawn directly from the Natural History Museum’s iconic building and architecture, as well as the beautiful naturalist sketches that fill the Museum’s archives,” head of Pokémon Europe licensing Mathieu Galante said.</p>

 <p>It certainly can’t go any worse than what transpired in 2023 when Holland’s Van Gogh Museum had its own Pokémon pop-up shop. The frenzy of fans and the race to scalp products online for jacked-up prices left an unfortunate scar on the fandom’s collectors. Have things mellowed out two years later? Hardly. The <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900">steady growth of Pokémon market speculators</a> and the ongoing scarcity of what The Pokémon Company is able to get manufactured when it comes to cards, plushies, and other rare collectibles <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-plush-scalper-reseller-world-championships-2000618087">has left communities exhausted</a>.</p> <p>It’s not yet clear how The Pokémon Company<em>&nbsp;</em>plans to avoid similar issues with the Natural History Museum collaboration. Hopefully, it’s either produced enough stock to meet at least most of the demand, or found a way to limit what people can buy. The 30th anniversary of Pokémon begins February 27, 2026.</p>

                <p>Xbox boss Chris Charla, who runs Microsoft's independent gaming label ID@Xbox, has commented on the state of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Game Pass</a> and what developers are saying about it.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-xboxs-increasingly-vital-indie-publishing-operation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Speaking to Eurogamer</a>, Charla said Microsoft worked with more than 50 developers in 2024 to sign their first Game Pass deals, and 2025 marks ID@Xbox's "largest investment in Game Pass to date."</p><p>"We remain focused on delivering the most exciting and diverse catalogue in gaming," he said.</p><p>Charla went on to say that the majority of developers who have worked with ID@Xbox for a Game Pass deal have come back to Microsoft asking to bring future titles to the service.</p><p>"As a result, we've signed deals with more than 150 partners to expand the catalogue. We continue to engage with hundreds of partners each year to review upcoming titles," he said.</p><p>As for how Microsoft finds games to bring to Game Pass via ID@Xbox, Charla said it can come from any number of sources, including meeting with developers at conferences or even a simple DM. It also comes from workplace conversations, Charla said. "We find them from people all around Microsoft being like, 'Hey, have you seen this game?' And we find them from having friends who make games who say, 'Hey, you need to see my friend's game.' And from people just emailing us!"</p><p>Charla did not, however, comment on the many recent comments from prominent developers about the possible negative effects of Game Pass on the wider gaming industry. Arkane co-founder Ralph Colantonio said Game Pass is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arkane-co-founder-unloads-on-game-pass-calls-it-unsustainable/1100-6532991/" data-ref-id="1100-6532991">"unsustainable,"</a> while former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden said subscription services like Game Pass make developers become a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-picture-part-one-i-dont-know-if-games-are-recession-proof" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"wage slave."</a> Former Bethesda higher-up Pete Hines, meanwhile, said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-bethesda-boss-pete-hines-has-strong-words-about-subscription-services-in-gaming/1100-6534511/" data-ref-id="1100-6534511">subscription services like Game Pass can lead to a "real problem" for the industry.</a> Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has said it <a href="https://google.com/search?q=strauss+zelnick+no+sense+game+pass+gamespot&amp;rlz=1C5GCCM_en&amp;oq=strauss+zelnick+no+sense+game+pass+gamespot&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIJCAEQIRgKGKABMgkIAhAhGAoYoAEyCQgDECEYChigATIJCAQQIRgKGKABMgcIBRAhGKsC0gEINjUwOWowajeoAgCwAgA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">makes no economic sense to put new games on Game Pass.</a> Shannon Loftis, a former executive at Xbox, said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-downside-of-game-pass-according-to-a-former-xbox-boss/1100-6534539/" data-ref-id="1100-6534539">Game Pass eats into retail revenue.</a></p><p>Many others, meanwhile, have said Game Pass has had a major positive effect on their game releases.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> is launching a new Daft Punk Experience, but is adamant the robot rock duo aren't getting back together.</p>
<p>Unlike previous Fortnite concerts - from the likes of Marshmello, Travis Scott, and Ariana Grande - The Daft Punk Experience is instead a "fully interactive playground" in the Discover(y) mode, with multiple rooms in which to enjoy the music and lose yourself to dance.</p>
<p>That includes blasting robots with a soundwave laser in the Robot Rock Arena, remixing songs at Dream Chamber Studios, or making a Lego music video at Around the World. Some form of "afterparty" is also being teased, whatever da funk that might be.</p>
<p>"The band may be no longer, but their music lives on in Fortnite," reads a new blog post on the experience.</p>
<p>And to really hammer it home, the FAQ directly states: "The band is not getting back together". So no, you don't feel it coming - it's the end of the line.</p>
<p>It also states the experience won't feature any new music, as all songs have been previously released. Players will be able to make their own mashups though, but good luck making them harder, better, faster, or stronger.</p>
<p>The experience launches on 27th September at 2pm ET (that's 7pm UK time), but players are advised to join early. It will then be available "for a while" in Discover.</p>
<p>Of course, a Fortnite collaboration wouldn't be complete without a load of stuff to buy, either individually or as part of the Dark Punk Bundle. It includes song emotes, glittery outfits, and some adorable Lego characters so you too can be a Starboy, as well as other Jam Tracks including the duo's collaborations with The Weeknd.</p>

<p>Speaking of Lego, the first ever music-reactive build will be added to Fortnite - it's a lego pyramid that lights up when music is played.</p>
<p>Full details can be found on the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/party-harder-better-faster-stronger-in-fortnite-with-the-daft-punk-experience">Fortnite blog</a>, so you can read up on the experience one more time.</p>
<p>Last week, Epic announced it would be giving Fortnite creators some more digital love by allowing them to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-creators-will-soon-be-able-to-sell-in-game-items-to-make-more-money-but-are-creative-mode-offerings-like-steal-a-brainrot-what-players-want">sell in-game items on their created islands</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>New details regarding Xbox's cancelled Perfect Dark reboot have leaked online through a report on <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/gameplay-details-concept-screens-cancelled-perfect-dark-reboot">MP1st</a>, giving us a little more of an idea of what this game might have tried with its gameplay mechanics, the opportunity its developer The Initiative and Microsoft saw with it, and a few pieces of concept art.</p>



<p>When Microsoft announced that Perfect Dark was going to be the debut game for its new "<em>AAAA</em>" studio, The Initiative in <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-xbox-series-x-s-microsoft-game-awards-2020/">2020</a>, even if there was a sense that it was announced far too early, there was a buzz of excitement from fans. Jump ahead five years, and not only is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">Perfect Dark reboot cancelled, but The Initiative is gone</a>, with the studio and its would-be debut game being one of the many major casualties from Microsoft's <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">massive 9,000+ layoff</a> this past July.</p>



<p>Before any of that happened, per MP1st's sources, Microsoft saw bringing back Perfect Dark as a chance to take advantage of the fact that two other major videogame secret agent-types were missing from the industry, namely 007 and Solid Snake. Of course, that's no longer the case, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> putting the MGS series firmly back in players' minds and IO Interactive working up to its <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-uncharted-x-hitman-qa-narrative-drives-things/">007 First Light</a> release, but back in 2020, both series had been absent from gaming for some time.</p>



<p>Gameplay-wise, the documentation mentions three concepts called the Relentless System, the Reward System, and the Adrenaline System, though only the last of those three were detailed in the documents.</p>



<p>The Adrenaline system would have let players slow down time to dodge incoming bullets, line up their own shots, and move faster than surrounding enemies. It would also have let Joanna Dark do more damage to enemies, heal more, and reduce damage taken.</p>



<figure><figcaption>A piece of concept art from the cancelled Perfect Dark reboot via a report from MP1st.</figcaption></figure>



<p>There's also mention of a vertical slice that would have consisted of "<em>Season 1</em>" for the game, which gives some weight to rumors that the game would have had an episodic-style release, though at this point, who can say if they would have definitively gone that route.</p>



<p>Overall, to say it's unfortunate that this game never came to pass is an understatement, especially since it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-nearly-saved-take-two-deal-fell-through/">almost saved after Microsoft dropped the ball</a>. Yes, Joanna Dark no longer would have had the open window previously granted due to the absence of MGS and 007, but I doubt that anyone would have minded having three great modern stealth-action games to play. </p>



<p>Just <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-initiative-studio-head-leaves-xbox-feels-pride-perfect-dark-remake/">last week</a>, former studio head of The Initiative, Darrell Gallagher, left Xbox, and said he "<em></em><em>couldn’t be prouder of the talented and passionate team I had the privilege assemble and lead</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I leave with nothing but pride in what we accomplished together and excitement for what’s next — both for myself and for the amazing developers I was fortunate enough to work with.</em>"</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-fe-deal-throws-in-a-free-smarttag2-at-record-low-while-apple-never-bundles-airtags-2000627201</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-fe-deal-throws-in-a-free-smarttag2-at-record-low-while-apple-never-bundles-airtags.1304322/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Galaxy Buds 3 FE are a more affordable option to the their Buds 3 Pro counterpart, but what’s the real difference? first up is the drivers. The FE model employ just one 11mm driver in each earbud. With the Pro model, you get a dual-driver setup combining a 10.5mm dynamic driver with a 6.5 planar magnetic driver on each side. So as one would expect, you’ll get better sound on the Buds 3 Pro, but that’s not to say the FE model sound won’t be good.</p>
<p>Both sets of earbuds support active noise cancellation, but that on the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro is more robust—allowing you to fine tune the ANC strength based on environmental factors.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4219/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>SmartTag 2 Included</h2>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4219/">So if those aren’t deal breakers for you, you might as well save some cash. Plus, right now, Amazon is offering the Buds 3 FE for $30 off.</a> The price comes down from $180 to just $150, but that’s not all. Samsung is throwing in a SmartTag 2 free of charge when you order a pair.</p>
<p>These Samsung SmartTags can be a real life saver. We all know how Find My Phone functionality works. If you ever leave your phone behind, it’s not lost forever. You can pinpoint it’s exact location no matter where you are. Well, SmartTags brings that ability to anything you own. Stick it in your wallet or purse so you can always remember where you last set it down. Heck, you can even leave one in your glove compartment so you can always recall what block your parked your car on.</p>



<p>Back to the Galaxy Buds 3 FE, you’re getting a reliable set of earbuds without breaking the bank. This generation Samsung earbuds has an improved design and fit from the previous models. The rounded ear tips help keep them securely in place as you listen all day long.</p>
<p>With ANC turned off, you’ll get up to 8.5 hours of uninterrupted listening time on the earbuds alone. When you add in the charging case’s battery, you can receive up to 30 hours of playtime total.</p>
<p>Connect your Galaxy Buds 3 FE to your multiple devices at once. You can effortlessly switch between your phone, tablet, and PC as your needs change. You could be watching a video on your laptop when a call comes in. Answer it and have the audio come through your earbuds without changing a thing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4219/">This deal is only available through September 28, so make moves on it while you can.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Like lots of canceled games, the more I hear about <em>Perfect Dark</em>, the cooler it sounds. Also is Tom Holland okay? And which Metal Gear should get the Unreal Engine 5 glow-up next? Face the new week with the latest edition of <em>Kotaku</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/morning-checkpoint">Morning Checkpoint</a> at your side. The daily roundup of gaming news and culture breezes you through some of the biggest headlines going around. I stayed up until 3 a.m. this morning reviewing video games because it’s that time of year. I’m very tired but not too tired to contemplate which movies would <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thegaychingy.bsky.social/post/3lze5vfxclk2q">make Carl’s top five in the Criterion closet</a>.</p> <h2>Some more <em>Perfect Dark</em> reboot details leak</h2> <p>Microsoft’s canceled Xbox exclusive <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-reportedly-cancels-that-cool-looking-perfect-dark-1851785531">might have been originally planned</a> as an episodic release. That’s according to a new <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/gameplay-details-concept-screens-cancelled-perfect-dark-reboot">report by<em> MP1st</em></a>. If accurate, that might have made the espionage shooter’s rollout similar to that of <em>Hitman</em> (2016). According to leaked development materials reviewed by the website, The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics were working on the game’s first robust vertical slice right up until it was canceled this summer.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Perfect Dark | Gameplay Details and Concept Art</p> <p>According to the report, as of April this year, The Initiative was still working on the game's Vertical Slice 1.<a href="https://t.co/mSBXCnflwP">https://t.co/mSBXCnflwP</a> <a href="https://t.co/ToSZNR4dKP">pic.twitter.com/ToSZNR4dKP</a></p> <p>— Klobrille (@klobrille) <a href="https://twitter.com/klobrille/status/1969845612549202200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The report also details a planned Adrenaline System which would be a resource that let players pull off <a href="https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-xbox-showcase-gameplay-1851528864"><em>Matrix</em>-like abilities</a> ranging from healing and increased damage to slowing down time for aiming and dodging bullets. Leaked concept art points to an “Eco Sci-Fi” version of Cairo, the setting of an early teaser, as being one of the locations to ship in the first episode of the game. <a href="https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-canceled-take-two-embracer-xbox-crystal-dynamics-2000622400"><em>Bloomberg</em> recently reported</a> that 2K Games was looking to takeover publishing but couldn’t work out a deal with Microsoft and Embracer over rights to the IP.</p>

 <h2>Tom Holland rushed to hospital after botched <em>Spider-Man</em> movie stunt</h2> <p>Tom Holland has been doing <a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-brand-new-day-4-mcu-suit-tom-holland-set-2000616006">cool stunts</a> in London while filming <i>Spider-Man: Brand New Day</i>, Unfortunately at least one of them didn’t go as planned and he’s now recovering. “We were called at 10.30am on Friday to attend to a patient who had sustained an injury at Leavesden Studios in Watford,” an East of England Ambulance Service spokesman told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/36792761/tom-holland-hospital-spider-man-stunt/"><em>The Sun</em></a> yesterday. “An ambulance was sent to the scene, and the patient was transported to hospital for further care.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/tom-holland-hospitalized-spider-man-brand-new-day-1236552019/">According to <em>Deadline</em></a>, Holland suffered a concussion and filming has been paused for a couple of days as a precaution. Hopefully, he can make a speedy recovery even with out the real Spidey’s mutant super healing.</p> <h2>Which <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> should get the remake treatment next?</h2> <p>A poll has been recently <a href="https://x.com/MGSMGN/status/1969354623007014979/photo/2">shared on X</a> which looks to be one Konami intends to send out after a <em>Metal Gear</em>-focused livestream later this week from TGS. The poll asks fans which other <em>Metal Gear </em>games they’d like to see remade, following the recent release of <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>. <em>MGS 2: Sons of Liberty</em> is the obvious choice, though I could see the case for <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> as well.<em> Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</em>, meanwhile, remains trapped on PS3, though fans suspect the <em>Master Collection Vol. 2</em>, whenever it’s ready, will finally port it to modern consoles.</p>

 <h2><em>Nintendo vs. Palworld</em> is currently a debate about mods</h2> <p><a href="https://gamesfray.com/gross-in-palworld-patent-case-nintendo-tells-japanese-judge-mods-should-not-count-as-prior-art-because-they-cant-run-without-underlying-games/">According to <em>Games Fray</em></a>, part of Pocket Pair’s defense in Nintendo’s patent lawsuit is that certain mechanics Nintendo claims as its own were already in use in other games, including versions modded by players. Nintendo is reportedly arguing that mods don’t count as “prior art” because they can’t exist or run separate from the game’s they were made for.</p>

 <h2><em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> nerfs nudity in Japan</h2> <p>The open-world zombie adventure is reportedly censoring certain depictions in Japan. The tweaks include changes to female zombies and the removal of all nudity, according to <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/09/19/157365.html"><em>Game Spark</em></a> (via<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/dying-light-the-beast-is-the-latest-game-to-be-censored-in-japan/"><em> VGC</em></a>). “These changes have resulted in an overall tone down on violent scenes, while still allowing Japanese players to enjoy seamless co-op play with friends playing the overseas version.”</p>

 <h2><em>Tomb Raider</em> remaster patches out AI voice performance changes</h2> <p>The French version of <em>Tomb Raider 4-6 Remastered</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/lara-croft-tomb-raider-francoise-cadol-aspyr-remaster-2000624934">was accused</a> of using AI to alter an actor’s performance. Those accusations appear to have been well-founded now, because Aspyr has gone and removed the AI alterations from the game. “We’ve addressed this issue by removing all AI voiceover content, while retaining the improvements made in the previous update,” the studio <a href="https://support.aspyr.com/hc/en-us/articles/39710879443853-Tomb-Raider-IV-VI-Remastered-Hotfix-for-Patch-2">wrote announcing a surprise hotfix update</a> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tomb-raider-lara-croft-lawsuit-aspyr-patch/"><em>The Gamer</em></a>). “We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. Please reach out to our customer support site with any issues.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149">Our big <em>Borderlands 4</em> review is here</a></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-rival-shadow-vector-cream-vanilla-2000627156"><em>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</em> might be better than <em>Mario Kart World</em></a></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-match-3-rpg-that-started-it-all-is-back-and-we-talk-to-its-legendary-creator-2000626834">The mastermind behind one of the best puzzle games ever talks about trying to bring back a classic</a></p> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

Gameplay-wise, the mode is based around the new ability to form drop-in, drop-out squads (which have friendly fire disabled), while the ability to talk with others adds a fresh layer of social interactivity, as players encounter others and try to work out who's friendly — and who's not. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Experiences of the mode are wildly mixed, as is perhaps to be expected when dealing with something that relies entirely on the online behavior of others. Some have praised the positive experiences they've encountered while playing, but many have highlighted the frequent use of hate speech and slurs, and the targeting of players because of their accent, their age or because they're a woman.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reddit is awash with players trying Delulu and reporting back with their experiences and it's a mixed bag.

The responses detail a list of sexist comments that some women have received, though others state they had more positive experiences. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's been terrible for me so far," wrote Forever_Winter13. "I've been playing solo and there hasn't been one game where I haven't been told horrendous things I don't wish to repeat.

"But there was one group of guys who kept appearing in the same lobbies as me that would purposely hunt down any female voice they heard. They literally would yell 'equality' as they shoot you."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Just as bad for guys," countered PlayfulBus8433.

They let me join them and said they'd help look and we went on a Finding Nemo-style hunt across the map looking for him and calling out for him amongst the groups. We found him haha.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Trophies for an unannounced Tomb Raider: Anniversary PS4 port have popped up online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this may not sound too surprising given we've had a bunch of classic Tomb Raider games remastered recently — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tomb-raider-i-iii-remastered"><u>Tomb Raider I-III Remastered</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tomb-raider-iv-vi-remastered"><u>IV-VI Remastered collections</u></a> released in February 2024 and 2025, respectively — it looks like this may be a port rather than a remaster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How do we know that? Well, we don't for sure, but the trophies — which can be seen on PlayStation trophy tracking site <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/game/Tomb-Raider-Anniversary/trophies" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>True Trophies</u></a> — are limited, and the images are, too, which suggests this is a port coming to something like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/igneditorial/lists/playstation-plus-premium-tier-games"><u>PlayStation Plus game catalog </u></a>rather than a full-on remake.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As Redditor VeldinX explained on their thread "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/1nmlwuc/anniversary_leaked_for_ps4/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Anniversary leaked for PS4</u></a>," "the style of this leaked list tracks with other games released for Sony’s classics catalogue, e.g. the small number of trophies and the design of the images. If it were Saber’s remaster, it would likely have a large, expansive list of things to do, and the images would be in the same style as TR1-6 were."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, this doesn't mean that the team that's been remastering the retro games, Aspyr, isn't also working on a new collection of classics that include Tomb Raider: Anniversary — it only suggests that these particular trophies are for a different game. Either way, we should expect clarification from either Sony or Aspyr soon. Watch this space.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tomb Raider: Anniversary is the 2007 action-adventure game developed by Crystal Dynamics, now owned by Embracer, and published by the defunct Eidos Interactive in 2007 for PC, PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, PlayStation Portable, Wii and mobile phones.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <div> <p>Chrome Boba Fett and the little baby Yoda are here to help you forget all about Disney’s complicity in <a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-fallon-colbert-stewart-trump-kirk-2000627249">a grim attack on free speech</a>. Out in less than nine months, <em>The Mandalorian and Grogu&nbsp;</em>now has its first trailer, and the next<em> Star Wars</em> movie looks both incredibly unnecessary and also lots of fun.</p> </div>  <p>The film stars Pedro Pascal as the Mandalorian bounty hunter, with his Force-sensitive sidekick Grogu looking as adorable as ever. Set after the TV series, the film finds the pair back in the galactic hotseat, navigating post-war tensions between the New Republic (Sigourney Weaver plays a colonel named Ward) and remnants of the Empire (Jonny Coyne plays an imperial warlord). Also Jabba the Hutt’s son Rotta is in the mix too.</p>  <p>Here’s a brief look:</p>   <p>And here’s the official synopsis:</p> <blockquote><p>The evil Empire has fallen, and Imperial warlords remain scattered throughout the galaxy. As the fledgling New Republic works to protect everything the Rebellion fought for, they have enlisted the help of legendary Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin and his young apprentice Grogu.</p></blockquote> <p>The whole 90 seconds flashes by in an instant, but in addition to the aforementioned characters you can also catch a glimpse of some alien guy messing people up with an electrostaff and Grogu speeding around with some other cute god-knows-whats (paging <em>Star Wars</em> lore master Zack Zwiezen). But like I said at the top, it looks fun and not mired down in a bunch of <em>Star Wars</em> naval-gazing mythbuilding, which is a good a thing.</p> <p><em>The Mandalorian and Grogu </em>is directed by Jon Favreau and co-written by Favreau and Dave Filoni, and marks the first in a fresh slate of upcoming<em> Star Wars</em> movies for Disney. With everything else, including a new Jedi-centric tale with <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-new-jedi-order-writer-replaced-rey-delayed-1851747797">Daisy Ridley returning as Rey completely MIA</a>, it’ll either feel like the start of something new or the death knell for the current streaming-wars-burnout incarnation of the franchise. The movie hits theaters on May 22, 2026, and can’t come soon enough for a <a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-abc-disney-boycott-marvel-marisa-tomei-2000627135">company currently facing a boycott</a> from fans and celebrities over the Jimmy Kimmel controversy.</p> <p><em>Update 9/22/2025 10:35 a.m. ET: added more story details.</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-sales-revenue</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-sales-reach-2-5m-as-revenue-climbs.1304256/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to new sales data,&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>has racked up quite a few sales for itself since launching earlier in September, and it's making a pretty tidy packet for its developer and publisher as well.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/borderlands-4-amasses-over-25m-players-since-launch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, data firm Alinea Analytics says that&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>has sold over 2.5 million copies since it was released on September 12th, resulting in revenues exceeding $150 million. That's a pretty impressive set of figures.</p>

<p>Alinea's data claims that around 1.3 million of the game's sales were on PC via Steam, and that over a million players have picked up&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>on both console platforms on which it's available. Honestly, that's a much more even split than I was expecting.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/borderlands-4-sales-shooting.jpg?itok=uV9qzfHf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/borderlands-4-sales-shooting.jpg?itok=cH0_nZ62 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>has sold pretty well.</figcaption></figure><p>If you want some demographic breakdowns, Alinea has those as well. Over half of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s player base on PC is based in the US, and the next most popular regions are China, Germany, the UK, and Canada.</p>

<p>However, on PS5, the story is a little different. Again, more than half of the game's players on PS5 are in the US, followed by the UK, Germany, France, and Canada. Alinea doesn't provide data for Xbox Series X|S players.</p>

<p>According to Alinea's data, 59% of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>players on PC played&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/borderlands-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Borderlands 2</em></a>, while 55% played&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/borderlands-3" rel="nofollow">Borderlands 3</a>&nbsp;</em>and just 22% played the spinoff title&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tiny-tinas-wonderlands" rel="nofollow"><em>Tiny Tina's Wonderlands</em></a>.</p>

<p>Those figures are higher on PlayStation; as Alinea points out, previous&nbsp;<em>Borderlands&nbsp;</em>games have been made available as part of PlayStation Plus, so 81% of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s player base on the console has checked out&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 3</em>.</p>




<p><em>Borderlands 4</em>'s strong sales performance comes despite widespread criticism of the game's performance on PC, which prompted Gearbox head Randy Pitchford to launch into an impassioned (and lengthy) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/randy-pitchford-borderlands-4-performance-comments" rel="nofollow">defense of his game on social media</a>.</p>

<p>Despite Pitchford's comments, 2K and Gearbox have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-pc-performance-top-priority" rel="nofollow">pledged to improve the game's PC version</a>, calling it their "top priority". Presumably, doing so will lead to even more sales for them.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/borderlands-4/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/borderlands-4/9MX6HKF5647G" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-f/" data-ref-id="5000-574203">Silent Hill f</a> is the newest entry in Konami's long-running survival horror franchise, tasking players with navigating the fictional town of Ebisugaoka in 1960s Japan as they attempt to uncover the mystery of a creeping fog that has produced bloodthirsty monsters around every corner. With this change in setting, Silent Hill f manages to be a great onboarding spot for series newcomers while maintaining plenty of familiar themes long-time players will recognize. But whether you're new to Silent Hill or a returning fan, you'll probably want to know how much playtime you can get out of this horrifying adventure. So, here's how long it takes to beat Silent Hill f.</p><h2>How long is Silent Hill f - Campaign length and replayability</h2><p>An average playthrough of Silent Hill f should take <strong>between 12-14 hours on Hard (normal) difficulty</strong>. This includes time spent solving puzzles and exploring at least some of the game's optional paths for additional healing items, upgrade materials, and weapons. However, those looking to advance through the campaign with less resistance can use the Story (easy) difficulty to reduce the combat and puzzle challenges, potentially allowing for a quicker completion.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Silent Hill f - Official Story Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Silent Hill f is a game designed to be played multiple times, though. While you can beat the game just once if you wish, additional playthroughs--which let you carry over your health, stamina, and sanity upgrades--unravel even more story content. Not only do subsequent runs provide fresh cutscenes and boss changes, but they also provide the opportunity to see up to 5 total endings, revealing more and more of the unsettling story surrounding main character Shimizu Hinako.</p><p>Additionally, completionists will find that there are quite a few reasons to keep playing the campaign through multiple times, as getting every trophy or achievement won't be possible in a single playthrough. You'll need to continue into NG+ to keep earning consumable currency known as Faith so that you're able to purchase all the upgrades and omamori (accessories). And any one-off trophies or achievements you missed your first time or two through can always be tried again on a new run.</p><p>With so much replayability, Silent Hill f can provide dozens of hours of entertainment to survival horror enthusiasts. If that sounds like something you're eager to dive into yourself, you can pick up Silent Hill f now on PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC.</p>

            <p>This year has marked Xbox's "largest investment in Game Pass to date", according to ID@Xbox boss Chris Charla.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-xboxs-increasingly-vital-indie-publishing-operation">Eurogamer</a>, Charla discussed the current state of the subscription service in the face of recent criticism, noting positive sentiment from developers and a desire to return for future projects.</p>
<p>"The majority of partners who've had a game in Game Pass want to bring their future titles to the service," said Charla. "As a result, we've signed deals with more than 150 partners to expand the catalogue. We continue to engage with hundreds of partners each year to review upcoming titles.</p>
<p>"Last year, we worked with over 50 teams to sign their first Game Pass deal. This year marks our largest investment in Game Pass to date, and we remain focused on delivering the most exciting and diverse catalogue in gaming."</p>
<p>Xbox has received criticism for Game Pass in recent months. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arkane-studios-founder-calls-game-pass-unsustainable-model-and-one-which-is-damaging-the-industry">Arkane Studios founder Raphael Colantonio</a> described the service as "an unsustainable model that has been increasingly damaging the industry for a decade".</p>
<p>In a back and forth on social media on the "cannibalisation" of sales, Larian director of publishing Michael Douse added "smaller teams with new or riskier" games can benefit from Game Pass, but he prefers "Sony's 'lifecycle management'" method of adding games following initial sales.</p><p>Former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden discussed the perceived profitability of Game Pass in a discussion with <a href="http://gamesindustry.biz/">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. "There's a lot of debates going on," he said. "Is Game Pass profitable? Is Game Pass not profitable? What does that mean? That's really not the right question to ask anyway.</p>
<p>"You can do all kinds of financial jiggery-pokery for any sort of corporate service to make it look profitable if you wanted to. You take enough costs out and say that's off the balance sheet and, oh look, it's profitable now. The real issue for me on things like Game Pass is, is it healthy for the developer?"</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/football-manager-player-numbers-are-through-the-roof-thanks-to-subscription-platforms-like-game-pass-and-netflix-series-boss-miles-jacobson-explains-how">Football Manager boss Miles Jacobson recently told Eurogamer</a> player numbers for the series have skyrocketed since being added to subscription platforms. </p>
<p>"We built a whole business model around it," he said. "You can't just turn around and do this - this was before we launched on the subscription platforms, we'd been talking about it. And we'd been working out what we were going to do for five years - it was a five-year journey before we went with the first experiment, and then we did another experiment, and then we did another experiment, and then we learned from those experiments, and that's when the full strategy was put in place."</p><p>In a broader interview with Eurogamer on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-xboxs-increasingly-vital-indie-publishing-operation">state of indie games on Xbox</a>, Charla noted the breadth of games showcased by Xbox at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a>. "It is just really a recognition by Xbox of the absolute crucial need for diversity in our portfolio," he said.</p>
