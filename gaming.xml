It plays 4K Blu-rays in native 4K UHD (2160p) resolution and supports HDR10, which improves picture brightness.</p><p>It comes with an HDMI cable, but we'd recommend grabbing a second 4K cable if you don't have a spare. That's because the player has two HDMI out ports. The main one is for video and audio, and is the only one you must use, but the second output is dedicated to audio. Separating audio from video output produces a richer, clearer sound, so dual ports are common on dedicated 4K Blu-ray players. It's one of the benefits of using a media player for Blu-rays instead of a game console like the PS5 or Xbox Series X. You can grab an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-High-Speed-HDMI-Cable-1-Pack/dp/B014I8SSD0?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Basics 4K HDMI cable for $6</a> right now.</p><p>The UBP-X700U also has a Coaxial SPDIF, which can be connected to speakers, soundbars, and TVs. In- terms of audio support, the UBP-X700U is equipped with high-end audio enhancements, including Dolby Atmos and DTS:X.</p><p>One of the coolest features of dedicated Blu-ray players like the X700U is picture upscaling. The X700U can read 4K Blu-ray, standard Blu-ray, and DVDs. When enabled, the built-in tech will enhance the resolution of standard Blu-rays and DVDs.</p><p>While we haven't tested the 2025 edition of the X700U, the upscaling feature on previous iterations was quite impressive. Standard 1080p Blu-rays can look pretty darn close to 4K resolution, and 480p resolution DVDs are substantially better. Honestly, without upscaling tech, DVDs generally look terrible on modern 4K and HD panels. That said, upscaled output varies, and sometimes there are jagged edges or noticeable oddities that won't be appealing to viewers looking for an authentic experience.</p></div>                      </div><p dir="ltr">For a higher-end 4K player with built-in streaming and voice assistant capabilities, check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Ultra-Assist-Blu-ray-Player/dp/B07N3PQM5N?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" data-mce-href="https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Ultra-Assist-Blu-ray-Player/dp/B07N3PQM5N?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Panasonic DP-UB820-K</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest in today's whirlwind of Microsoft and Xbox-related news is a rumor that <a href="https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-feels-great-about-xboxs-2025-slate-of-games-with-more-unannounced-titles-to-come/">Phil Spencer</a>, the current chief executive officer of Microsoft's Gaming division will retire following the launch of Xbox's next-gen console. Sarah Bond, who is currently the head of Xbox at Microsoft, is rumored to take his place.</p>



<div><p>This claim comes from <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1940460596995961190">TheGhostOfHope on X</a>, an account that has previously been accurate regarding Call of Duty news. It's also been slightly corroborated by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-retiring-xbox-next-gen/">Insider-Gaming</a>, who claims that Spencer's retirement in the near future is something they have also heard multiple times this year. That said, Phil Spencer is currently 57 years old. He's worked at Microsoft in one form or another since 1988 and joined the Xbox team in 2001. He's been at the head of Xbox since 2014, and in 2022, he was made the chief executive officer of Microsoft Gaming. </p><p>He's climbed the ladder as far as he could, and is near retirement age. That he has one foot out the door isn't the greatest bit of speculation, but it's also not a surprise that this claim would come on the day when there are many changes being announced internally at Microsoft and in its gaming division, even beyond what we've already heard about.</p></div>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>EXCLUSIVE: Phil Spencer will be retiring from his role as CEO of Microsoft Gaming after the launch of the next generation Xbox.</p><p>Phil Spencer is working closely with Sarah Bond and her team to ensure a smooth transition for her take over as CEO of Microsoft Gaming once he… <a href="https://t.co/LDqB4BW8ER">pic.twitter.com/LDqB4BW8ER</a></p></div>— Hope (@TheGhostOfHope) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1940460596995961190?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 2, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Spencer took charge of Xbox after the man he replaced, Dom Mattrick, left a mess of a console launch for him to clean up with the abysmal start to the Xbox One generation. He brought the platform back into the spotlight for positive reasons with his championing of Xbox Game Pass, a service that carried the moniker of 'the best deal in gaming' for years.</p>



<p>More recently, his legacy has been the massive acquisitions he's helped secure, of <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-has-acquired-bethesda-and-all-its-ips-from-elder-scrolls-to-doom/">ZeniMax and Bethesda</a>, then <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-has-been-acquired-by-microsoft-for-70-billion/">Activision Blizzard King</a>, though what people will remember of those acquisitions are the mass layoffs that followed them, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">today's massive cuts</a>. </p>



<p>Ultimately, Spencer's retirement is more of a question of when, not if. We've been hearing rumors about <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-rumored-to-support-backward-compatibility-at-hardware-level/">Xbox's next-gen hardware</a> for some time now, and we know that there's an <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/">Xbox-branded ROG Ally handheld</a> coming at the end of this year. It could be the case that Spencer's retirement will come after the ROG Xbox Ally is out. It could also be that he'll step down after the next proper Xbox console is out. Either way, it seems clear that his time at Microsoft is winding down.</p>

        <p>Together with "several unannounced projects"</p>

  </p>

    

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Microsoft have cancelled their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/perfect-dark">Perfect Dark</a> reboot and closed its development studio The Initiative in the course of this week's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">scything sacrifices to their actually rather healthy bottom line</a>. In a statement, head of Xbox Matt Booty also confirmed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rares-mysterious-nature-sim-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-part-of-xbox-mass-layoffs-according-to-reports">the cancellation of Rare's Everwild</a>, alongside "several unannounced projects". </p> <!--more-->
<p>Booty says this "reflects a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape." For context, Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q3/press-release-webcast">announced net income of $25.8 billion</a> for their most recent financial quarter, with the Xbox division also posting year-over-year revenue growth.</p>
<p>In an email to staff announcing the wider layoffs, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer echoed Booty in styling them a question of "[making] choices now for continued success in future years", and having "the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities." A reported 9,100 people have been kicked to the curb across Microsoft's operations, but as far as I know, no senior leadership salaries are being "disciplined".</p>
<p>While depressing, the cancellation of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everwild">Everwild</a> perhaps isn't surprising, given how long it had been in development, and Rare's reported difficulties settling on a direction for the game. The Perfect Dark reboot was also a troubled project. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-making-a-new-perfect-dark">Announced in 2020</a>, it was still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/that-perfect-dark-reboot-is-still-in-early-development-and-years-from-release-report-claims">"in the earliest stages"</a> of development in 2023, according to one report. But then came a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/perfect-dark-reboot-resurfaces-with-stealth-parkour-and-spy-gadgetry">June 2024 trailer</a> that brought a smile even to Graham Smith's careworn visage. I thought it seemed promising, too, albeit not much like the campy original for N64.</p>
<p>Best of luck to all those affected, and to all those who don't yet know whether they're affected. In other layoff news, Microsoft have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-new-mmorpg-from-the-elder-scrolls-online-devs-has-reportedly-been-cancelled-as-part-of-microsofts-layoffs">taken the axe to a new MMO from Elder Scrolls Online developers ZeniMax Online Studios</a>. There are probably more cancellations to be announced.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success]]></content:encoded>

The trailer showed Perfect Dark to be a first-person shooter with immersive sim elements, as series protagonist Joanna Dark used gadgets, stealth, and melee takedowns to complete her objectives, all the while hinting at a greater conspiracy for players to uncover. Despite the gameplay showcase, Perfect Dark did not ever receive a release window.</p><p dir="ltr">A report from shortly before the debut of Perfect Dark's gameplay trailer stated the reboot of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-is-allegedly-in-bad-shape/1100-6523261/" data-ref-id="1100-6523261">spy FPS was in bad shape</a> and that the project hadn't "really come together" despite Crystal Dynamics being brought in to help development.</p><p dir="ltr">Perfect Dark and The Initiative are just a few of the games and studios to be affected by this new wave of layoffs at Microsoft. While at the time of writing The Initiative is the only studio closure announced, other studios like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cancels-new-mmo-from-elder-scrolls-online-team-in-latest-wave-of-cuts-report/1100-6532915/" data-ref-id="1100-6532915">The Elder Scrolls Online developer ZeniMax Online</a>, Blizzard, Forza developer Turn 10 and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-forza-studios-impacted-by-xbox-layoffs/1100-6532918/" data-ref-id="1100-6532918">Call of Duty Black Ops 7 developer Raven Software have also seen layoffs</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty in an internal email shared by Windows Central confirmed Perfect Dark, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" data-ref-id="1100-6532912">Rare's Everwild</a>, and several other unannounced projects, one of which is reported to be ZeniMax Online's next MMORPG, have all been canceled as part of the layoffs.</p><p>"We have made the decision to stop development of Perfect Dark and Everwild as well as wind down several unannounced projects across our portfolio," Booty writes in the email. "As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, The Initiative. These decisions, along with other changes across our teams, reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape. We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment."</p><p>It's just the latest round of layoffs for Microsoft in recent years.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Microsoft has laid off thousands of workers across its various divisions in the latest cost-cutting measures taken by the corporation, whose 2024 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar24/index.html">revenue exceeded $245 billion</a>, a 16-percent increase over its 2023 revenue. Though the cuts are impacted several of the company's various divisions, Xbox appears to be hit particularly hard. This represents the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/06/24/major-xbox-layoffs-reportedly-inbound-for-the-fourth-time-in-18-months">fourth time in 18 months</a> that Microsoft Gaming has laid off workers.</p><p>"We continue to implement organizational and workforce changes that are necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace," an Xbox spokesperson said in an official comment provided to <em>Game Informer</em>. Alongside the official statement, Xbox PR confirmed that less than 4 percent of Microsoft's global workforce was impacted. However, according to <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/facts-about-microsoft/">Microsoft's official reporting</a>, the company employs 228,000 people worldwide, which means 4 percent of the global workforce accounts for more than 9,100 people. Xbox PR also confirmed to <em>Game Informer </em>that the gaming division is impacted, "but not the majority," and stopped short of providing any additional details. When I requested a percentage of Xbox-specific impact, PR could not provide additional context.</p><p>However, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-thousands-xbox-gamning-1236446010/"><em>Variety </em></a>and several other outlets obtained a memo to Xbox employees from Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer. Notably, Spencer says, "Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger," and "Simply put, we would not be where we are without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted." You can see that in its entirety below.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Today we are sharing decisions that will impact colleagues across our organization. To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness. Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today’s notifications and any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.&nbsp;</p><p>I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we’re seeing currently is based on tough decisions we’ve made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come.&nbsp;</p><p>Prioritizing our opportunities is essential, but that does not lessen the significance of this moment. Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted. These decisions are not a reflection of the talent, creativity, and dedication of the people involved. Our momentum is not accidental—it is the result of years of dedicated effort from our teams. &nbsp;</p><p>HR is working directly with impacted employees to provide severance plan benefits (aligned with local laws), including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources to support their transition. Employees whose roles were eliminated are encouraged to explore open positions across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority review. &nbsp;</p><p>Thank you to everyone who has shaped our culture, our products, and our community. We will move forward with deep appreciation and respect for all who have contributed to this journey. &nbsp;</p><p>Phil&nbsp;</p></div><p>Subsequently, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696877/xbox-perfect-dark-everwild-cancelled-the-initiative-layoffs"><em>The Verge</em></a> acquired a memo sent by Xbox president of game content and studios, Matt Booty. In his memo, Booty confirms Xbox is closing down The Initiative, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/e3-2018/2018/06/10/new-microsoft-internal-studio-announced-undead-labs-ninja-theory-playground">an all-new first-party studio founded by Xbox in 2018</a> in Santa Monica, California. In 2020, The Initiative revealed it was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2020/2020/12/10/the-initiatives-perfect-dark-announced">working on a new entry in the Perfect Dark franchise</a>, which is now canceled as a result of this closure. Booty also confirms the Twycross, England-based Rare, which Xbox acquired in 2002 and has worked on titles like Sea of Thieves and Viva Piñata, has been impacted by this round of layoffs, and its new IP, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/11/14/rare-works-its-whimsical-magic-in-the-new-world-of-everwild">Everwild</a>, which was announced in 2019, has also been canceled. You can read his full memo below.</p><div><p>Following Phil’s note, I want to share more about the changes to the Studios business units.</p><p>We have made the decision to stop development of Perfect Dark and Everwild as well as wind down several unannounced projects across our portfolio. As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, The Initiative. These decisions, along with other changes across our teams, reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape. We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment.</p><p>Our overall portfolio strategy is unchanged: build games that excite our players, continue to grow our biggest franchises, and create new stories, worlds, and characters. We have more than 40 projects in active development, continued momentum on titles shipping this fall, and a strong slate headed into 2026.</p><p>For those directly affected, we are working closely with HR and studio leadership to provide support, including severance, career transition assistance, and where possible, opportunities to explore roles on other teams.</p><p>To everyone across our studios: thank you. Your creativity and resilience continue to define who we are.

            <p>The Last of Us creator Neil Druckmann is stepping away from his creative involvement in HBO's TV adaptation, calling this a "difficult decision".</p>
<p>In a statement shared on <a href="https://x.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1940465773639880781">social media</a>, Druckmann said now season two of The Last of Us had wrapped, he would be moving his "complete focus" back to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>. This includes writing and directing the studio's all new game Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-will-not-be-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-neil-druckmann-says">as well as Naughty Dog's future projects</a>.</p>

<p>"Co-creating the show has been a career highlight," Druckmann said. "It's been an honour to work alongside Craig Mazin to executive produce, direct and write on the last two seasons."</p>
<p>Druckmann added he was "deeply thankful for the thoughtful approach and dedication the talented cast and crew took to adapting" the first The Last of Us game, as well as the ongoing work adapting The Last of Us Part 2 for TV.</p>
<p>The statement noted now was the right time for the Naughty Dog head to step back from the show, before meaningful work on season three begins.</p>

<p>The Last of Us season two aired earlier this year, picking up five years after the events of the season one finale, with Ellie and Joel - played by Bella Ramsey and Pedro Pascal - now living in Jackson. New cast members this season included Kaitlyn Dever as Abby, Isabela Merced as Dina, Young Mazino as Jesse and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-who-catherine-ohara-will-play-in-the-last-of-us-marking-a-significant-change-from-the-games">Catherine O'Hara as a new character for the show, Gail</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to its season two premiere, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-show-renewed-for-season-three-and-the-second-hasnt-even-aired-yet">The Last of Us was renewed for a third season</a>. At this time, showrunner Craig Mazin said: "We approached season two with the goal of creating something we could be proud of. The end results have exceeded even our most ambitious goals, thanks to our continued collaboration with HBO and the impeccable work of our unparalleled cast and crew."</p>
<p>The showrunner additionally confirmed The Last of Us TV team is working on a four season plan, stating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-confirms-four-season-plan-says-no-way-to-wrap-things-up-in-three">there's "no way" the show's narrative can be wrapped up in only three seasons</a>.</p>

<p>As for Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, earlier this year the star of Naughty Dog's next game said she'd received preparation for the role - and specifically the online reaction to it - from Druckmann himself, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-online-backlash-prompted-naughty-dogs-next-star-to-get-bootcamp-ing-from-neil-druckmann">following the online abuse previously kicked up around The Last of Us Part 2</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="PowerA 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/413a1c80020e8/powera-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Like the Switch 1 before it, the Switch 2 will no doubt play host to dozens of third-party controllers over the course of its (hopefully) long lifespan. First out of the gate is PowerA with its Advantage Wired Controller, which I received in a rather jovial <a href="https://powera.pxf.io/c/205546/1256186/15385?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.powera.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo%2Fnintendo-switch-2%2Fcontrollers%2Fwired%2Fadvantage-wired-controller-for-nintendo-switch-2-mario-time-nsgp0527-01%2F" rel="sponsored noopener">Mario Time</a> theme. You can also get a <a href="https://powera.pxf.io/c/205546/1256186/15385?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.powera.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo%2Fnintendo-switch-2%2Fcontrollers%2Fwired%2Fadvantage-wired-controller-for-nintendo-switch-2-mushroom-kingdom-nsgp0526-01%2F" rel="sponsored noopener">Mushroom Kingdom</a> themed variant along with a <a href="https://powera.pxf.io/c/205546/1256186/15385?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.powera.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo%2Fnintendo-switch-2%2Fcontrollers%2Fwired%2Fadvantage-wired-controller-for-nintendo-switch-2-black-nsgp0523-01%2F" rel="sponsored noopener">standard black design</a> – y’know, if you’re boring (joking!).</p>
<p>Boasting a similar layout to Nintendo's official <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design">Pro Controller</a>, the Advantage pad features offset analogue sticks, two mappable ‘AGL’ and ‘AGR’ buttons on the backside, and a handy headphone jack on the bottom. Really, the only major change in terms of layout is the placement of the start, select, home, GameChat, and capture buttons, which are all housed beneath the d-pad and right analogue stick.</p><div><figure data-videoid="-13CJKg9tJk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-13CJKg9tJk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c0dc7knoxgl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-13CJKg9tJk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>To be honest, this alone was enough to throw me off my game; I’d often go to reach toward the centre of the pad to hit the home button, miss, and instead give the image of Mario a good ol’ fondle (Sorry, Mario) before realising the home button is actually down toward the bottom.</p>
<p>Having all of these buttons gathered together in one place <em>is</em> convenient in a way, and it does allow the artwork to really shine if you go for one of the themed variants, but it definitely plays havoc with about thirty years’ worth of muscle memory in which controllers at least housed the start and select buttons in the centre. Why fix what isn’t broken, y’know?</p>

<p>As for those mappable buttons on the back, these don’t function like the ‘GL’ and ‘GR’ buttons on the Pro Controller. Well, they <em>do</em>, but you can’t assign inputs to them quite as easily. With Nintendo’s own offering, you can simply hold down the home button and assign inputs via the quick settings menu, but that isn’t available for PowerA’s controller.</p>
<p>Instead, you need to hold down the additional ‘PRGM’ button on the back until the LED light on the bottom turns dark blue. Then, you hit the button you want to remap and then assign it to either ‘AGL’ or ‘AGR’. It’s pretty manageable in practice and won’t take long to figure out after your first couple of goes, but it would’ve been nice if it supported quick remaps via the settings menu like the Pro Controller.</p>

<p>In terms of build quality, this is very much a budget controller, so it’s <em>incredibly</em> light at just 143g. For comparison, the Pro Controller is 235g, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-online-gamecube-controller-the-return-of-the-king">GameCube controller</a> is 210g, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/8bitdo-ultimate-2c-bluetooth-controller-probably-the-best-budget-switch-pad">8bitdo’s Ultimate 2C Controller</a> is also 235g. Combined with the mandatory wired setup, the lightweight design makes lengthy gaming sessions an absolute breeze – no need to worry about discomfort or loss of battery life at all.</p>
<p>On the flip side, it’s… well, <em>too</em> <em>light</em>; to the point where it comes off as being pretty cheap. It feels like there’s barely anything inside the device, and you can tell by just tapping on the exterior with your finger: it sounds very hollow. This is exacerbated by the buttons, all of which give off very loud ‘clicks’ when pressed.</p>
<p>The worst of these are those aforementioned back buttons, which when pressed, sound like they’re reverberating throughout the interior of the controller.</p>

<p>Looking at the analogue sticks in a bit more detail, I don’t have a great deal to complain about here. They’re perfectly smooth and functional, with decent travel and good grip. Again, they sound pretty loud when hitting the casing on the outside, which you’ll definitely notice if you’ve been using the Switch 2's official Pro Controller, but otherwise, they’re good.</p>
<p>I can’t say the same for the d-pad, though. It’s slightly thicker and more rounded than Nintendo’s own offering, and it feels weirdly spongy when pressed. Needless to say, this makes more precise inputs a bit tricker on some retro games, and I wouldn’t even consider using it on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>.</p>

<p>All in all, this isn’t a controller I’d recommend if you’re after a daily driver for the Switch 2. Your best options at the moment are Nintendo’s own Joy-Con 2 or Pro Controller. That said, if you’re after something cheap and cheerful for the player two in your life, this is a perfectly adequate option for you. Yes, it may feel a bit too light for some, the lack of rumble and motion control support is frustrating, and the wired setup sure isn't for everybody, but it’ll come in handy in a pinch if you’re looking for some local multiplayer fun.</p>

<p>We previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-qa-devs-reveal-tons-of-info-on-this-exciting-wuxia-sandbox-rpg/">interviewed</a> Everstone Studio in September 2022, learning that there would be separate single player and multiplayer modes in Where Winds Meet. Indeed, now the developers have confirmed that there are some MMO-style features, such as: </p>



<ul>
<li><em>Build or join a Guild to unlock a wide range of group activities—from intense guild wars to challenging multiplayer dungeons and epic raids. </em></li>



<li><em>Prove your might in competitive duels, or step into a shared, ever-evolving world with thousands of fellow adventurers.</em></li>
</ul>

The cuts to Turn 10 are reportedly very significant, with "nearly 50%" of staff affected, Schreier said.</p><p>Raven Software is the main co-developer on Activision's upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> alongside Treyarch.

"We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come."</p><p>Xbox boss Matt Booty confirmed the cancellations of Perfect Dark and Everwild in a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-closing-down-xbox-studio-the-initiative" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">memo to staff seen by Windows Central</a>, while also saying "several unannounced games" are being axed as well. Booty also confirmed The Initiative is closing up shop, and that all of these initiatives took place to "adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape."</p><p>Despite all of Microsoft's latest layoffs and game cancellations, Booty said Microsoft still has 40+ games in "active development" and a "strong slate" heading into 2026.</p><p>Xbox has been shedding staff on a semi-regular basis for the past few years.

<p>"You want to see something cool?"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Fans of the cult 2015 movie <strong>Turbo Kid</strong>, rejoice! The upcoming Metroidvania sequel to the post-apocalyptic action movie is coming to Switch on 5th August 2025.</p>
<p>We first heard about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/turbo_kid">Turbo Kid</a> in February 2024, before it launched on Steam in April of that year. Now, the wait is over for Switch owners as you'll be able to pedal through the wasteland next month.</p>
<p>Developed by Outerminds, Turbo Kid takes place in a futuristic version of the '80s, where neon lights aren't necessarily a good thing. The world has crumbled; water is hard to come by and the wasteland is ruled by tyranny. So, what do you do? Grab your BMX and get biking.</p>
<p>Accompanied by gorgeous pixel art and a fantastic electronica soundtrack from Le Matos, even if you've never seen or heard of the movie, it's one to keep an eye on. Here's a rundown on what to expect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pedal. Slash. Explode. Repeat. -</strong> Rediscover the Metroidvania you should have grown up with. Blaze your trail through a mutant-infested wasteland, upgrade your arsenal of absurdly deadly weapons, and leave a trail of pixelated guts in your wake—all from the seat of your trusty BMX.</p>
<p><strong>BMX Combat -</strong> Who needs a horse when you have a bike with attitude? Call your BMX anytime to boost through maps, unlock shortcuts, smash enemies, or just pull sick tricks. It’s the first true Metroidvania where two wheels matter (no need to fact-check that).</p>
<p><strong>Slash, Shoot, Splat -</strong> Machetes? Of course. Turbo Glove™? Absolutely. From electric blasts to saw blades, your toolkit is overflowing with over-the-top destruction. Rip through enemies with style and turn every screen into a spray of beautifully deranged pixel gore.</p>
<p><strong>Freedom to Explore, Freedom to Wreck -</strong> Set just after the events of the film, forge your path through a twisted world filled with bizarre characters and unexpected choices. Who you help—or hurt—will shape your journey across multiple playthroughs.</p>
<p><strong>All Killer, No Filler -</strong> Love lore? It’s here. Hate it? Skip it. We built Turbo Kid with pure gameplay in mind: no unskippable cutscenes, no walls of text—just fast, fluid action and flexible storytelling that works whether you’re exploring or speedrunning.</p>
</blockquote>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/perfect-dark-cancelled-developer-the-initiative-shut-down-as-part-of-microsoft%E2%80%99s-layoffs.1234302/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-closing-down-xbox-studio-the-initiative">Windows Central</a>, which has been corroborated by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsypjg3yg22e">Bloomberg</a>, the latest casualty from Microsoft's massive 9,000+ employee layoff today is Xbox Game Studios team The Initiative, a team that was founded for the purpose of making a new Perfect Dark game. That Perfect Dark game is now cancelled, and The Initiative has been shuttered.</p>



<p>Windows Central had previously hinted towards this while reporting that <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">ZeniMax Online's unannounced MMORPG had been cancelled</a>, but has now confirmed the news after obtaining an email from Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty. Booty's memo also confirms what had already been reported around <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">Rare's Everwild being cancelled</a>, and adds that "<em>several unannounced projects</em>" have also been cancelled as part of today's layoffs. </p>



<div><p>"<em>Following Phil's note, I want to share more about the changes to the Studios business units</em>," Booty begins, referencing <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">an email sent out from Microsoft Gaming chief executive officer, Phil Spencer</a>.</p><p>"<em>We have made the decision to stop development of Perfect Dark and Everwild as well as wind down several unannounced projects across our portfolio. As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, The Initiative. These decisions, along with other changes across our teams, reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape. We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment</em>. <em>Our portfolio strategy is unchanged: build games that excite our players, continue to grow our biggest franchises, and create new stories, worlds, and characters. We have more than 40 projects in active development, continued momentum on titles shipping this fall, and a strong slate headed into 2026.</em></p><p><em>For those directly affected, we are working closely with HR and studio leadership to provide support, including severance, career transition assistance, and where possible, opportunities to explore roles on other teams. To everyone across our studios: thank you. Your creativity and resilience continue to define who we are. I believe in the strength of our teams and the direction we're taking on the path ahead</em>."</p></div>



<p>The cancellation of Perfect Dark also brings an end to the partnership Xbox had with <a href="https://wccftech.com/crystal-dynamics-being-available-for-perfect-dark-was-too-precious-of-a-resource-to-pass-on-says-xgs-head/">Crystal Dynamics,</a> who was working on the project alongside The Initiative.</p>



<p>Players who grew up with the first Xbox consoles recognize Perfect Dark as one of the series that helped make the Xbox a household name. While the last official Perfect Dark outing failed to impress, the excitement around its reboot could not have been higher for fans. The Initiative was described as a team of industry veterans, all excited to bring back the beloved stealth series. We even got to see some fairly impressive gameplay last year, seemingly indicating that the game was progressing well and that we'd see it on shelves within the next two years.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Now, we'll never know what the final product would have looked like, as the failings of Microsoft's executive branch continue to devastate thousands of people across the video game industry.</p>



<p>While there have already been major cuts confirmed today, more are still inbound. Forza Motorsport studio, Turn10, has<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsynuplq222l"> reportedly lost 50% of its staff,</a> and several Call of Duty studios, including Raven Software, have also suffered layoffs as part of today's cuts. We'll continue to update our stories and report on the cuts as more details are confirmed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pre-orders are now live for Darrington Press' latest board game, <em>Solar Gardens</em>. The tabletop publishing arm of Critical Role's latest project is a strategic, tile-placement board game set in a solarpunk sci-fi city where building a garden helps build sustainable energy for the future.</p>

<h2>The <em>Solar Gardens</em> Pre-Order Announcement</h2>

<p>According to a press release, S<em>olar Gardens</em> is a tile-drafting board game that brings players into a utopian future. One where you transform city rooftops into verdant, sustainable gardenscapes with a combination of renewable energy and imaginative design.</p>

A single game takes about 30-45 minutes to complete. Players take turns drafting and placing tiles on a map. Each tile represents greenery, solar panels, turbines, rainwater collectors, cultural hubs, and more. Players must strategically place these tiles to boost energy production, biodiversity, and aesthetic appeal, to create a living rooftop ecosystem.</p>

<p>Each playthrough of the game introduces new challenges. It encourages both competitive and casual players to experiment with different strategies in each game. If you want to play out the fantasy of building a beautiful future, or just want to beat your friends in landscaping, this game provides.</p>

<p><em>Solar Gardens</em> was designed by Eric Slauson (<em>MonsDrawsity</em>, <em>Kaiju Haiku</em>) and Alex Cutler (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/skate-summer-gets-padded-up-for-kickstarter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Skate Summer</em></a>, <em>A Place for All My Books</em>) and illustrated by Daniel Clarke. Echoing its overt environmentalist themes, the game is produced with biodegradable, plastic-free materials and will use paper stickers to hold its contents together in transit.</p>

<p>Lastly, each copy of the game sold will help fund reforestation in US national parks through the National Forest Foundation's Sapling Program.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Solar Gardens is the latest tabletop game published by Darrington Press, joining a catalog of critically acclaimed, bestselling products including <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/queen-by-midnight-review-im-prettiest-princess" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Queen By Midnight</a>, </em>the gaslamp fantasy RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/candela-obscura-core-rulebook-review-comprehensive-guide-to-newfaire-and-horror" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Candela Obscura</em></a>, and the runaway fantasy TTRPG hit, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/daggerheart-review-narrative-forward-yes-and-ttrpg-that-is-force-to-be-reckoned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ready-or-not/news/">Ready or Not</a> has been a huge hit for Void Interactive over on Steam, getting <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/ready-or-not/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">good reviews</a> from critics and consumers alike. However, players have turned against the developer, with the game getting pelted by negative reviews over the past week. The reason? Void removed some material from the game in order to get it certified for its console port.</p><p>"Throughout this console port process we've done our utmost to only make changes when they are flagged as absolutely required by our first party partners, and any changes aim to remain faithful to the original tonality of the game, so there is no reason to be alarmed," Void said in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1144200?emclan=103582791466271488&amp;emgid=526472884483260567" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>. "Our age rating as it stands for console is ESRB M-rating, PEGI 18, and USK 18 to give an idea. Still, there are other game content requirements that console platforms have in order to exist on their systems, and a portion of these changes will be visible on the PC version."</p><p>Void went on to describe the changes of the level of gore, but insist for the most part, everything will still be in tact. For example, dismemberment still has a large presence in the game, but is a little more limited.</p><p>"When alive enemies are shot they can undergo dismemberment; however, once they are dead no further dismemberment occurs. (Note: The level of dismemberment itself when it occurs was not actually toned down)," it added. "Ultimately, we consider this an okay compromise considering our gameplay design already dissuades use of lethal force anyway."</p><p>Many players vehemently disagreed.</p><p>"Loved the game. Absolutely intense to run against people. But with the recent compliance of censorship for console I won't recommend playing anymore," one said. "I absolutely love this game, but censoring it is a bad move. They should have just made a seperate console version," said another, echoing the decision.</p><p>The influx of these responses has lowered Ready or Not's recent rating--its rating based exclusively on reviews posted in the last 30 days--from "very positive" to "mixed." However, not every fan feels that these changes are a deal breaker.</p><p>"The hate is not warranted, there are some bugs but there small if any, I just got this game and am loving it so far," a player said. "I got this game for me and my brothers and it's a great time."</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ready or Not</a> is currently on sale until July 10 with the base game by itself for $25 and the base game and the DLC bundles for $39. </p>

            <p>
Three former senior Ubisoft employees - including one-time chief creative officer and second-in-command Serge Hascoet - have received suspended prison sentences and fines from a French court after being found guilty of harassment prior to their departure five years ago.
</p>
<p>
Hascoet - along with Ubisoft's former editorial boss Tommy François and game director Guillaume Patrux - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-ubisoft-execs-stand-trial-in-france-accused-of-harassment">appeared in a French court earlier this year</a>, accused of psychological and sexual harassment during their time at the company. All three left Ubisoft in 2020, as part of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-more-top-ubisoft-executives-resign-as-publisher-renews-commitment-to-fostering-an-environment-its-employees-can-be-proud-of">wave of resignations and dismissals</a> among senior employees and executives, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-report-on-ubisoft-reveals-more-shocking-sexual-harassment-allegations">serious allegations of sexual misconduct become public</a>.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jul/02/three-ubisoft-video-game-chiefs-guilty-enabling-culture-sexual-harassment">reported by the Guardian</a>, Francois has now received a three-year suspended prison sentence and a €30,000 fine after being found guilty of sexual harassment, psychological harassment, and an attempted sexual assault. During the trial, it was alleged Francois had restrained a female employee while trying to kiss her on the mouth. He was also accused of forcing a female co-worker to do handstands while she wore a skirt, alongside other incidents.
</p>
<p>
Hascoët - who faced accusations of racist comments and other behaviour during the trial - was found guilty of psychological harassment and complicity in sexual harassment by the court, receiving an eight-month suspended sentence and a fine of €45,000. Patrux has been handed a 12-month suspended sentence and a fine of €10,000 after being convicted of psychological harassment. During the trial, it was alleged Patrux had punched walls, mimed hitting staff, and set fire to a colleague's beard with a cigarette lighter, among other things.
</p>
<p>
Back in 2020, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-weeks-of-devastating-sexual-harassment-allegations-ubisoft-boss-yves-guillemot-is-asked-how-much-he-knew">asked how much he knew of the issues taking place in his company</a> prior to the sexual misconduct allegations becoming public, Ubisoft CEO and co-founder Yves Guillemot said, "I have never compromised on my core values and ethics and never will" in a carefully worded statement. "It has now become clear that certain individuals betrayed the trust I placed in them and did not live up to Ubisoft's shared values," he added.

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/video-digital-foundry-delivers-its-technical-analysis-of-street-fighter-6-on-switch-2</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Switch 2 arrived with a bunch of titles that had to perform well if they were going to be worth your time. Arguably, none were more in need of a silky smooth frame rate than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6: Years 1-2 Fighters Edition</a>, which had to be top notch if it was ever going to appeal to the fighting fans.</p>
<p>We had a blast with the title in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">our review</a> last month, with the performance in all modes (apart from World Tour) being a particular highlight. But for those who want the specific numbers, the experts over at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI6KBxxvdXo">Digital Foundry</a> have finally joined the fight to give a detailed rundown of all the tech specs in Capcom's latest.</p>
<p>Kicking things off with image quality, DF's Thomas Morgan states that the Switch 2 version "punches well above its weight". The Switch 2 puts up <strong>960x540p</strong> resolution in docked mode, with the DLSS upscaler boosting things to <strong>1080p</strong>. The analysis notes that you may encounter some flickers here and there, but it's a "win on balance" in the grand scheme of things, and even appears crisper than the Xbox Series S.</p>
<p>Naturally, the image quality pales in comparison to the PS5's 4K offering, but the textures are a notable upgrade from the Series S and fall closer in line to what you'd find on the PS4.</p>
<p>Some settings are missing on Switch 2 — the depth of field effect, 'Crowded' background NPCs, no movement for physics-based particles — though DF emphasises that these are "never game-breaking".</p>
<p>The portable mode opts for a <strong>640x360p</strong> resolution, with DLSS reconstructing it up to <strong>720p</strong>, and lighting and shadows take a big hit because of it, winding up closer to the base PS4 edition. There's a docked/handheld comparison in the above video around the 8:20 mark that's well worth a look if you want to see the changes in action.</p>
<p>The World Tour modes are deemed "less polished in their visual delivery overall," with regular NPC pop-ins and reduced frame rates for characters at range. That said, DF is quick to point out that Switch 2 is "not alone in presenting these problems, rather, it inherits them from the other console releases".</p>
<p>In terms of frame rate, things are locked at a "perfect" <strong>60fps</strong> in both docked and handheld in the fighting rounds, but they do drop to around 45fps in the pre-fight hype sequences — not that it affects the game at all. The World Tour mode, as expected, is not as smooth, with the unlocked frame rate reaching anywhere from <strong>30-60fps</strong>, and getting capped at 30 in the side-on battles.</p>
<p>All in all, then, it sounds like a generally strong technical experience on Switch 2. You can see all of this analysis in action in the above Digital Foundry video, but for our thoughts on the game, you'll find our full review below.</p>

            <p>The current custodians of the World of Darkness tabletop <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> universe are bang up for doing more video game adaptations like the troubled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>, according to White Wolf brand marketing manager Jason Carl. In fact, they may be working on a few already, with Carl naming Mage: The Ascension, Changeling: The Dreaming and the Dark Ages setting as deserving of "the Bloodlines treatment".</p>
<p>People who've been keeping up with the vamps and their video game misadventures may find that last phrase a bit rich. For clarity, I assume that by "Bloodlines treatment" Carl means "we're going to make a big 3D RPG with a lot of lore". Rather than "we're going to delay it so often it becomes a running joke, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/brian-mitsoda-has-been-fired-as-narrative-lead-on-bloodlines-2">fire the original narrative director</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-again-and-hardsuit-games-are-no-longer-developing-it">hand it to a different studio</a> with no real track record for RPGs, then tell people it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2-is-more-spiritual-successor-than-sequel-to-a-a-competently-good-game-by-2004-standards-say-paradox">more spiritual successor than sequel</a>". </p><!--more-->
<p>White Wolf are the official licensing and publishing entity for all World Of Darkness adaptations. They were acquired by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a> outfit Paradox Interactive in October 2015, and are now co-publishers for Bloodlines 2. As for the World of Darkness itself, this is a sprawling modern <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gothic">Gothic</a> fiction analogous to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, which encompasses several apocalypses and several table-top RPGs.</p>
<p>While the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines</a> is by far the most famous World Of Darkness video game adaptation, there are plenty more out there - 2003 hack-and-slash Hunter: The Reckoning and, much more recently, a bunch of Werewolf games, plus some mobile projects. In a new interview with PCGamesN, Carl made no bones of White Wolf's desire to keep cranking out the spin-offs.</p>
<p>"Who says we're not already?" he joked in a new interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/world-of-darkness-games">PCGamesN</a>. "The answer is yes. All of those supernatural creatures have their own stories to tell, and many of them are just waiting their turn and for the right story to come along.</p>
<p>"It's not just Hunter and Werewolf," Carl went on. "It's no secret that, when we set up our in-house publishing business, we've been exploring many of the other World of Darkness games that people have been waiting for and that are underdeveloped. We've got our eyes on Mage, we've got our eyes on The Dark Ages, we've got our eyes on Changeling; we're spending a lot of time thinking about these three, and other games that people have been waiting for."</p>
<p>Carl is himself a former tabletop RPG game designer, having started out at D&amp;D creators Wizards of the Coast in the 1990s. In the chat with PCGN, he was especially enthusiastic about adapting Mage, a tabletop game that first released in 1993 and is, as you may guess, all about sorcery.</p>
<p>"I have spent considerable time thinking about what Mage would look like in a new edition," he said. "The world we live in today is very different from what we imagined it would look like when the White Wolf team were building those previous editions of Mage, and I think we're all looking forward to the challenges of figuring out how Prime and Paradox work in this world, as opposed to the world we thought we were going to get."</p>
<p>I'm not that familiar with Mage, but I gather from the White Wolf wikis that <a href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Prime_(MTAs)">Prime</a> is one of the nine spheres of magic - it "governs the raw energy of reality". While <a href="https://whitewolf.fandom.com/wiki/Paradox_(MTAs)">Paradox</a> "is the collective force of consensual reality fighting back against the enlightened will of the mage."</p>
<p>This certainly seems adventurous, for a magic system, in that I can't quite picture how you'd translate all that into an everyday fireball spell. How am I supposed to splat cellar rats with *checks notes* an "Odyllic Force"? My goodness, could this be an arcane institution with <em>implications for things beside combat and levelling up</em>? I am pleased by the prospect of a video game based on such wild notions. Almost as much as I am sceptical of White Wolf's big promises, given their and Paradox's handling of the "spiritual successor" to Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines.</p>
<p>"There's no obstacle or gatekeeping function that would prevent any of these from making it out into a videogame and getting the Bloodlines treatment," Carl concluded. "It's a question of time, resources, the right development partners, and story." I don't know, Carl. The first three of those seem like pretty significant obstacles. They seem like much the same obstacles Bloodlines 2 has been smashing its pointy chops against since 2019, in fact. Maybe at least ship your new Vampire game - due in October, despite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/layoffs-at-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-studio-as-paradox-promise-rpg-will-still-release-in-october">a recent round of layoffs at developers Chinese Room</a> - before you make any bets on the rest of the World of Darkness.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-world-of-darkness-rpgs-deserve-the-bloodlines-treatment-say-white-wolf-especially-mage-the-ascension]]></content:encoded>

In the email, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/everwild-rare-xbox-july-layoffs-canceled-series-x-s-pc-1851785509&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/everwild-rare-xbox-july-layoffs-canceled-series-x-s-pc-1851785509">Booty confirmed that<em> Perfect Dark</em> and other projects</a></span> were being canceled. He also confirmed that The Initiative, the team behind the<em> Perfect Dark </em>reboot, was being shut down. </p><p><em>“</em>We have made the decision to stop development of <em>Perfect Dark</em> and <em>Everwild </em>as well as wind down several unannounced projects across our portfolio. As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, The Initiative,” said Booty. </p><p>“These decisions, along with other changes across our teams, reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape. We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment.”</p><p>Booty told staff that if they were “directly affected” by the layoffs and studio shutdown, they could apply for other roles within Xbox and that HR would “provide support.” </p><p>The cancellation is part of a larger round of layoffs at Microsoft. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-to-lay-off-as-many-as-9000-employees-in-latest-round/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-to-lay-off-as-many-as-9000-employees-in-latest-round/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Around 9,000 people are reportedly losing their jobs</a></span>, with many Xbox employees affected by the cuts. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer explained in a memo to staff that the layoffs “end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness.”</p><p><em>Perfect Dark </em>was first revealed via a short teaser trailer back in December 2020. It was set to be a reboot of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/perfect-dark&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/perfect-dark">original N64 game</a></span>. The new <em>Perfect Dark </em>was being developed by The Initiative, a studio located in Santa Monica that was created by Xbox in 2018. About a year after its first teaser, it was announced that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/square-enixs-crystal-dynamics-also-working-on-the-new-p-1847735646?_gl=1*1gfo1da*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTE0NjgxMTEkbzQ4MCRnMSR0MTc1MTQ3NDE3MSRqNTIkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/square-enixs-crystal-dynamics-also-working-on-the-new-p-1847735646?_gl=1*1gfo1da*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTE0NjgxMTEkbzQ4MCRnMSR0MTc1MTQ3NDE3MSRqNTIkbDAkaDA.">Crystal Dynamics was helping</a></span> develop the <em>Perfect Dark</em> reboot. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/xboxs-perfect-dark-reboot-is-still-years-away&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xboxs-perfect-dark-reboot-is-still-years-away" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In 2023, an IGN report</a></span> claimed that development on<em> Perfect Dark </em>was a bit of a mess, due to poor management and creative differences between the teams. At one point, it restarted development and shifted to Unreal Engine 5. </p><p><em>Kotaku </em>has reached out to Xbox for more information. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-xbox-showcase-gameplay-1851528864&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-xbox-showcase-gameplay-1851528864">In 2024, Xbox revealed the first gameplay for <em>Perfect Dark</em></a></span>, and the response was mostly positive. The game looked great, with gorgeous visuals, a slick art style, and gameplay that seemed like a combination of <em>Deus Ex, Dying Light,</em> and the old <em>Perfect Dark</em> games. However, the gameplay trailer didn’t include a release date. And now it seems this cool-looking reboot won’t ever see the light of day. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/xbox-reportedly-cancels-that-cool-looking-perfect-dark-1851785531]]></content:encoded>
