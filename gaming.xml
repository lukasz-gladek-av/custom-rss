<p>"The Kingdom Come kind of simulation ... there's so many options, you can change the world, it's super great," Badowski continued. "We'd like to follow this trend as well. So these are our next steps for sure, and it's kind of a similar challenge to what we have in The Witcher 3 because of the open world and storytelling here, freedom of choices. But at the same time, we would like to build very fleshy, very well-motivated characters. So it's kind of in contradiction from time to time. That's a great design challenge."</p><p>Badowski doesn't think Larian's D&amp;D blockbuster Baldur's Gate 3 has as much in common with the CDPR style. "It's turn-based so it's a different kind of game, and the way you interact with characters is totally different," Badowski explains. "Because there's freedom of choice in Larian's work, it pushes you to use different tricks than ours. But I think we observe each other, and there are not that many games like that, so ... we see how players react to those tactics."</p><p>CDPR co-CEO also expressed admiration for Baldur's Gate 3, even though it's different from what the studio wants to do with The Witcher and Cyberpunk. "We definitely are not going to make a game like Larian did," Nowakowski said. "That's the kind of game they can make. But a lot of stuff with how the characters can interact with the world and what it does was for sure some inspiration to us."</p><p>CD Projekt Red just released a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-tech-demo-wasnt-actually-the-game-says-cd-projekt-red/1100-6532043/" data-ref-id="1100-6532043">gorgeous-looking new tech demo</a> for The Witcher 4 as part of State of Unreal 2025, though the actual game still seems to be a while off.

Like the famed developer's other projects, it looks stylish and <em>weird</em>, but don't expect it to be out for quite a while, as Suda said that it was looking to avoid facing off against some stiff competition. While he didn't name "that game" specifically for the nebulous release window of Romeo Is a Dead Man, there's a good chance that he was alluding to Grand Theft Auto 6.</p><p>"That’s kind of obvious, isn’t it?" Suda51 said to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/romeo-is-a-dead-man-hasnt-got-a-firm-release-window-because-every-publisher-wants-to-make-sure-to-steer-clear-of-that-one-games-release-date" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "That one game had its release date announced, right? Every publisher wants to make sure to steer clear of that one game’s release date. But what if we were to flex a little and release it on the same day? Yeah, nope--just thinking about that is way too scary. Alright then, see you later."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Romeo is a Dead Man - Announce Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Several other games are wary of being caught in GTA 6's wake, as the next entry in the series is expected to be a sales juggernaut. The recent delay from 2025 to 2026 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-gta-6-delay-and-switch-2-launch-could-impact-video-games-in-2025-and-beyond/1100-6531553/">could also have a negative impact to the tune of $2.7 billion on the video game industry this year</a>, but analysts have predicted that GTA 6 will contribute to a jump in hardware sales when it's released in May 2026. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick recently commented on the new launch date and expressed confidence that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-exec-suggests-no-more-delays-says-recent-push-is-less-than-6-months/1100-6531629/">another GTA 6 delay is unlikely</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Romeo Is a Dead Man is shaping up to be another memorable adventure from Suda51. The game puts you in the shoes of FBI Space-Time special agent Romeo Stargazer, who travels the universe to hunt down fugitives and bring them to justice by using over-the-top methods. It'll be out--presumably way after GTA 6--on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S next year.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> team is gearing up for the first patch since its release earlier this year. Actually, it is working on two patches at the moment, with those who are part of the Steam Beta getting first dibs.</p>
<p>The first of these two patches will focus on "quests, major bugs and blockers, and quality of life fixes," the developer said. Those on the Beta path will be able to experience these changes from today, 5th June. The rest of us will then follow next week, on 11th June.</p>
<p>A second patch will be released at a later date, though we don't know when just now, and this chap will be focused on Oblivion Remastered's performance.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> may be getting a next gen update alongside a port to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>On YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyhMv3N8UKk&amp;t=597s">Nate the Hate's Xbox Showcase Predictions video</a>, the leaker stated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a>' cowboy classic will receive the update and a port to Nintendo's latest console release later this year. It follows reports of a Switch 2 port from last month, adding to its veracity.</p>
<p>Nate the Hate previously stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-imminent-reports-suggest">Switch 2 reveal would be imminent back in January of this year</a>, and also noted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-release-acclaimed-first-party-game-on-another-platform-report-suggests">Xbox would be bringing more of its third-party games to other platforms</a> before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-hi-fi-rush-on-ps5-and-the-xbox-multi-platform-story-so-far">Hi-Fi Rush's departure to the PS5</a>. There's a track record of accuracy there, though given these are still leaks take them with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>He elaborated this Switch 2 port of Red Dead Redemption 2 would come "a few months" following the release of the Nintendo Switch 2, speculating a late summer / early autumn window. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Given that the Switch 2 is out today</a>, that means if this is true the timer starts… Now.</p>
<p>This comes following another report by <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/exclusive-red-dead-redemption-2-for-nintendo-switch-2-may-arrive-this-year-1544753/">GameReactor</a>, stating a Switch 2 port will be coming later this year. So this isn't a rumour out of the blue, there are multiple voices stating it'll happen in the near future.</p>
<p>Take Two CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-reportedly-set-for-switch-2-as-take-two-boss-praises-nintendos-console">recently praised the Switch 2</a>, and the industry giant has multiple other games set to release on the platform including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/nba-2k24">NBA 2K</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wwe-2k24">WWE 2K</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven't had a chance to play it, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-review-9">Red Dead Redemption 2 is a fantastic open world game</a> that absolutely earned its consumer and critical acclaim since releasing back in 2018. If it does come to the Switch 2, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-can-the-new-nintendo-console-handle-it">it'll join Cyberpunk 2077</a>, which could make the console a grand starting point for a dive into vast open worlds.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Echoes of Elysium doesn't begin the way you'd expect a survival game to begin. At least, you don't physically start where you'd expect to be in a survival game. Mostly, you'd expect to be plopped into a forest of some sort, with nothing but trees and possibilities in front of you.</p>
<p>The possibilities part remains, but instead of trees, you enter into the world of Echoes of Elysium on a ship, floating in the sky, ready for you to get everything moving. Starting high in the sky is jarring, if nothing else, and it immediately sets your relationship with the opening hours of Elysium in a different light than your relationship with the opening hours of most survival games.</p>
<p>That's because it's pretty cool. Your mileage may vary on how much you like that, but at least when I first looked around at a big blue sky, with flying islands on the horizon and crafting materials floating upwards through the air, I thought it was a cool way to kick off a survival game.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>I also have a sense that any game that starts you off with a jetpack can't be that bad, but this whole opening, while cool, is where the issues with its setting immediately appear.</p>
<p>As part of its inclusion in the June 2025 Steam Next Fest, I got to check out the demo for Echoes of Elysium ahead of the demo's release. I want to say off the top that there is plenty I like about Echoes of Elysium, and I know that this is just a slice of a game that, when it does arrive, will launch into early access.</p>
<p>It's not going to be finished, it's going to evolve and change, and everything I might have a problem with could be gone from the game in a year. Also, the version I've been playing in this demo is specifically focused on building and crafting, so there's not much to do beyond exploring, gathering resources, and building your ship.</p>
<p>That said, as jarring and exciting as it is to begin your journey already in the sky, it's just as jarring when I started to feel the pain points with being anchored entirely to your ship, with the game's current pacing structure.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>You can't go anywhere. At least, at the beginning, you can't. Your ship has no fuel, so you need to go through a multistep process to make fuel, and then you can fly around, and still get nowhere. Your ship moves so slowly when you start that it might as well not be moving. And when you get to the islands, at least in this demo, there isn't much to do.</p>
<p>The saving grace is the fact that you can perform this bunny-hop with the jetpack, by using it to gain some distance and then cutting it to rebuild stamina while you fall for a short time, and then activating your jetpack again. Executed correctly, you'll never run out of stamina and can travel longer distances than you probably should be capable of without a ship. But at least it's faster than your ship.</p>
<p>There is a benefit to being slow, which is the fact that the game is easy on the eyes. The art style reminds me of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-falconeer-stuck-holding-pattern/">The Falconeer</a>, a game I loved playing primarily because it was nice to just calmly fly around and take in the sights. I can still appreciate that in Echoes of Elysium, but it would also be nice to get somewhere, even in the demo, just to see a glimpse even, of what it looks like to be tens or even hundreds of hours in, with a more complete ship and everything else the game has to offer.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>It sounds like I'm complaining a lot, and maybe I am, but the truth is that nothing I've played so far in Echoes of Elysium has me extremely worried, or thinking that the game is bad. I just think even with this version of the game that's just focused on building and crafting, it's too slow to start, and that developer Loric Games will need some time to build it and work out pacing issues.</p>
<p>I think it has a very strong foundation and is already shaping up to be a pretty good game, to be clear, that has a strong setting and a good art style. On a conceptual level, I appreciate that you're anchored to your ship and that your experience in the game depends almost entirely on how much time you put into making your ship exactly the way you want it.</p>
<p>Everything funnels into making your ship, or (eventually) ships, exactly how you want them. It's nice to immediately have a connection to your base of operations in that way, and I felt immediately engaged in wanting to play longer just to build up my ship, rather than explore more of the narrative or do plenty of quests. Not that there's a lot of that in this demo, or any, from what I saw, but my time with the demo was perpetually looped within its opening hours.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>I hit several bugs that soft-locked my progression and made me restart my game, which didn't always fix them, a couple of freezes, and a hard crash back out to my desktop. Things like enemies and resources clipping into the ground on islands, my ship clipping into the bottom of an island, which meant I couldn't reach it when I jumped off of it (I also couldn't pilot it out). Location-based text that did not disappear from the middle of the screen, well after I had left the location; these were all issues that happened at least twice, but nothing bothered me too much.</p>
<p>It's an early access title, it's not going to be perfect, and while I saw all these issues, they weren't ruining gameplay sessions by happening constantly in the time I put into the demo.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>If you like MMO survival crafting games and a bit of ship building, then it's worth your time to check out the demo when it's available, but for now, the sky being the only limit to Echoes of Elysium is both a bit of a blessing and a curse. Hopefully, one day it's just a blessing.</p>

There are four of them: magic, fire, lightning, and holy. When Recluse hits an enemy with a Magic attack, a Magic elemental residue will appear around the enemy. You can tell which kind of residue an enemy has by the color of your targeting reticle. Blue is magic, red is fire, yellow is lightning and gold is holy.</p><figure id="" data-id="53bf5a0e7222bdabc2b65d5ff528c71c" data-recommend-id="image://53bf5a0e7222bdabc2b65d5ff528c71c" data-format="jpg" data-width="960" data-height="540" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Recluse attacks enemies while standing amongst rubble." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Recluse attacks enemies while standing amongst rubble." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="53bf5a0e7222bdabc2b65d5ff528c71c" data-recommend-id="image://53bf5a0e7222bdabc2b65d5ff528c71c" data-format="jpg" data-width="960" data-height="540" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Recluse attacks enemies while standing amongst rubble." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Residues can also be collected from teammates as well</strong>. If they get hit with a fire attack, they’ll accumulate fire residues. Elemental Defense works in tandem with Recluse’s Character Skill called Magic Cocktail, as it augments her offensive power and helps restore FP.</p><h2 id="h125297"><a id="2"></a>Ability: Magic Cocktail</h2><p>Recluse’s character skill is Magic Cocktail. Here, she absorbs the residues to create a unique spell that doesn’t cost FP to unleash on enemies or give support to allies. The cocktail’s composition is entirely dependent on the combination of three residues absorbed. You can tell which residues you have by the three smaller icons on top of the character Skill icon.</p><p>For example, two fire residues and a holy one creates a torch that raises max HP and reduces status ailment buildup in allies. Having three separate elemental residues results in the most powerful cocktails. For example, a Magic/Fire/Lightning cocktail creates a giant gravity orb that pulls in enemies before exploding, dealing massive damage.</p><figure id="" data-id="33dfff0ca684a14fd8ccd6a637b28b35" data-recommend-id="image://33dfff0ca684a14fd8ccd6a637b28b35" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1073" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Recluse attacks an enemy in a courtyard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Recluse attacks an enemy in a courtyard." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="33dfff0ca684a14fd8ccd6a637b28b35" data-recommend-id="image://33dfff0ca684a14fd8ccd6a637b28b35" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1073" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Recluse attacks an enemy in a courtyard." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You don’t necessarily always have control of which elemental residues appear. However, it can be manipulated through coordination with your teammates. If your entire squad is decked out with fire elemental weapons, then you’ll be able to cast fire elemental cocktails frequently. But if one of your allies has a holy weapon, then you’ll sometimes absorb holy residues from enemies, leading to some variations on what cocktails you’ll create.</p><p>This ability is also the key way of restoring FP in the middle of a fight. Every time Recluse absorbs residues, she’ll replenish her FP. This keeps her from becoming a sitting duck and lets her keep the offensive pressure on. You will still need to manage your FP carefully, however, as running out completely means you’re going to have to use a consumable item or wait for an ally to get hit so that you can absorb their residue.</p><h2 id="h125298"><a id="3"></a>Ultimate Art: Soulblood Song</h2><p>Recluse’s Ultimate Art is Soulblood Song, which causes her to create a red sigil with blood runes on the ground. While in the sigil, you and your allies will restore HP and FP by attacking any enemies within its range. This will help increase your squad’s survivability.</p><figure id="" data-id="e709906dfc88da5751cb5af6c9cfc057" data-recommend-id="image://e709906dfc88da5751cb5af6c9cfc057" data-format="jpg" data-width="960" data-height="540" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Blood surounds Recluse and her enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Blood surounds Recluse and her enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->cc</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e709906dfc88da5751cb5af6c9cfc057" data-recommend-id="image://e709906dfc88da5751cb5af6c9cfc057" data-format="jpg" data-width="960" data-height="540" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Blood surounds Recluse and her enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The most opportune time to use Soulblood Song against a boss is when its stance is about to break and it doubles over, leaving it vulnerable to critical hits. This allows Recluse to maximize the amount of time Soulbood Song is out on the field while the boss is briefly incapacitated. This attack can also be augmented with other effects through passive buffs dropped by bosses, such as increasing Recluse’s max HP.</p><h2 id="h125299"><a id="4"></a>A look at Recluse’s attributes</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>HP</strong>: D</li><li><strong>FP</strong>: A</li><li><strong>Stamina</strong>: C</li><li><strong>Strength</strong>: D</li><li><strong>Dexterity</strong>: C</li><li><strong>Intelligence</strong>: S</li><li><strong>Faith</strong>: S</li><li><strong>Arcane</strong>: C</li></ul><p>As expected, Recluse’s FP and intelligence are her highest stats, which makes sense since she’s a magic-based character. Her best weapons include staves which scale perfectly with her high intelligence.</p><p>Since her HP and stamina stats are low in comparison, she heavily relies on her teammates to distract enemies while she builds up elemental residues and casts spells. Additionally, Recluse should take full advantage of consumable and throwable items like Starlight Shards and elemental pots. The former lets her replenish FP in a pinch while the latter like Fire Pots and Lightning Pots let her create residues to mix Magic Cocktails and restore FP.</p><hr><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A DQ finish meant the champion retained, cementing the first instance that a MITB winner was unsuccessful in their cash-in attempt. Punk’s actions afterwards made the moment even more stunning.</p><p>As Show attacked Cena, the champ slinked into the corner and watched, agonizing over whether he should help.

After an entertaining contest, Bryan won! Vanquishing Cena clean—sans shenanigans—is no easy feat, but the real shocker came post-match.</p><p>The MITB briefcase holder Randy Orton walked down the ramp, teasing a cash-in.

Before it was Tiffy’s time to cash in her Money In The Bank briefcase, 37 other superstars had done the same. There are only so many new ways to shock the WWE Universe, but Tiffany Stratton did just that.</p><p>On the January 3 episode of Smackdown, Tiffy’s friend Nia Jax defended her WWE Women’s Championship in a match against Naomi. As the contest was coming to a head, Stratton’s music hit, and she ran down to the ring holding her briefcase in one hand and the ref’s hand in another.</p><p>Despite the telltale signs of a cash-in, Tiffy instead hit Naomi in the head with her briefcase, aiding Jax to victory as she’d done several times previously.</p><p>We were swerved. And then, we were swerved again. As Bianca Belair went to check on Naomi, Jax attacked Belair and set her up for The Annihilator. Before she could execute it, Stratton whacked Jax with the briefcase, Belair followed up with a massive Kiss of Death and Tiffy took advantage, landing the Prettiest Moonsault Ever on Jax for the 1-2-3.</p><p>Betraying a friend—who was also the champion—with a cash-in is something we’d never seen. The soft face turn and exuberant crowd reaction helped solidify the moment in MITB lore.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Ubisoft gave its Call of duty rival just four months before confirming it would discontinue support. <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-au/article/1EywTnGrZdDqCoxKs2zNhZ/ubisoft-discontinues-development-on-xdefiant" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Almost half the team lost their jobs</u></a> as Ubisoft made a swath of cuts across its San Francisco and Osaka studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Producer Mark Rubin, who led development fo the game having previously worked on the Call of Duty series at Activision, called it a "sad day" in a lengthy statement posted to <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1930403826378649786" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>X/Twitter</u></a> earlier today. After thanking his co-workers for making a "really fun and terrific game," he announced he's decided to "leave the industry" for good.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"In case everyone doesn’t know, the team behind XDefiant was all let go at the end of last year and I know many people have moved on to other studios, which is great, and I hope that for all of those still looking, that they find something quickly," Rubin wrote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As for me, I’ve decided to leave the industry and spend more time with my family so unfortunately you won’t be hearing about me making another game. I do care passionately about the shooter space and hope that someone else can pick up the flag that I was trying to carry and make games again that care about the players, treat them with respect and listen to what they have to say."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rubin said the team made "remarkable" progress despite "very little marketing," claiming that despite a lack of advertising, XDefiant "still had the fastest acquisition of players in the first few weeks for a Ubisoft title" just from word-of-mouth promotion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But unfortunately, with little to no marketing, especially after launch, we weren’t acquiring new players after the initial launch," he added, before claiming Ubisoft's in-house game engine "wasn't designed for what [XDefiant] was doing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We had other issues, though, as well that we tried to be transparent about. For one we had crippling tech debt using an engine that wasn’t designed for what we were doing, and we didn’t have the engineering resources to ever correct that. I do personally think that in-house engines are not the valuable investment that they used to be, and they are often doomed to fall behind big engines like Unreal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This tech debt included the dreaded netcode issues that we could just not solve given the architecture we were dealing with," he added. "And so, for many players with solid network connections (in both speed and consistent reliability) the game played well but if your connection had even the smallest amount of inconsistency the engine just couldn’t handle it and you would have a bad experience. Normally, you should be able to weather those bad moments on your network. But this was a major issue with XDefiant."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">XDefiant Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rubin also lamented the lack of resources to make content. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Another issue we had was having the right resources to make content for the game. What we saw at Season 3 wasn’t even enough content in my mind for launch. There were some really cool features coming later in Season 4 or even 5 that would have completed the game in a way that I felt it should have been for launch. I can say everyone’s (devs, HQ leadership, etc.) heart was in the right place, but we just didn’t have the gas to go the distance for a free-to-play game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In October 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xdefiant-dev-says-we-have-done-very-little-marketing-so-yes-our-numbers-are-down-denies-support-could-end-after-season-4-if-player-count-doesnt-improve"><u>Ubisoft insisted it wasn't shutting XDefiant down</u></a>, then announced it would be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-is-discontinuing-xdefiant-in-2025-new-purchases-disabled"><u>shutting XDefiant down just a few weeks later</u></a>.

There are bugs and glitches in Oblivion Remastered just as there are in almost every video game upon release, particularly Bethesda games. Now, Betheda is sharing the first update for the game to address some of these issues.</p><p>Through the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2623190/view/536603447519088660" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official Steam page</a>, Bethesda laid out the contents of Oblivion Remastered's Update 1.1. This is the first of two separate updates that Bethesda plans to launch in the near future, although the second one doesn't have a date attached to it yet. Update 1.1 and its follow-up will be released on the Steam Beta first before being shared with Oblivion Remastered's console counterparts.</p><p>Update 1.1 is out today, June 5, on Oblivion Remastered's Steam Beta, and the wider rollout of the update will begin on June 11. The initial update is intended to tackle the major bugs that have come up, although some of the glitches addressed--including the disappearance of Vincente Valtieri's hair and High Chancellor Ocato's immobile arms--are unintentionally funny. The second planned update will concentrate on improving the game's performance.

Immediately after the trailer aired, people on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/1l3icpc/i_think_the_actor_for_the_james_bond_game_is/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://x.com/search?q=patrick%20gibson%20james%20bond&amp;src=typed_query" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">elsewhere</a> said they think Irish actor Patrick Gibson is playing the role. He's known for his roles in The Tudors, Shadow and Bone, and Tolkien. Most recently, he played a young Dexter Morgan on the Dexter prequel series Original Sin. Indeed, Gibson certainly looks the part. But anything is possible.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/GameRoll_/status/1930385920907227230" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The new James Bond is 100% played by Patrick Gibson.<br>He’s an Irish actor who I know as playing Dexter in Dexter: Original Sin.<br>He’s a PHENOMENAL actor and I’m sure he’ll be GREAT as Bond! <a href="https://t.co/q58Cn0eQE7" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/q58Cn0eQE7</a></p>  — GameRoll (@GameRoll_) <a href="https://twitter.com/GameRoll_/status/1930385920907227230?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>As of yet, however, IO Interactive has yet to announce who is playing Bond in First Light.

This is a brand-new character, but some of the Bond series veterans like M, Q, and Moneypenny will appear in First Light as well.</p><p>Like Bond himself, actors playing those roles have yet to be confirmed, nor do we know who's playing the mysterious character Isola or any of the "whole new cast of villains."</p><p>First Light tells the story of how James Bond became 007, picking up with Bond when he was a 26-year-old recruit from the Royal Navy. Like the movies, First Light will tell a globe-trotting story focused on action and espionage.</p><p>First Light launches in 2026 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch 2, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/after-working-its-magic-on-zelda-and-splatoon-it-turns-out-monolith-soft-also-aided-development-of-mario-kart-world<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Monolith Soft has officially announced the company helped with the development of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>The developer, which previously assisted with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon-2">Splatoon 2</a> <a href="https://x.com/MONOLITHSOFT/status/1930459571275084157">has stated on social media</a> it developed the "fields and character designs" for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> racing game.</p>
<p>The studio has a history of open world video game development, becoming something of an expert in that particular area given the time spent on recent Zelda titles as well as its own Xenoblade releases. As such it makes sense why Nintendo would bring Monolith Soft over for Mario Kart World given <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-reinvents-the-series-and-feels-like-switch-2s-killer-app-after-an-hour-of-hands-on-play">the games' shift to a non-linear format</a>.</p>

<p>In 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-now-fully-owns-xenoblade-studio-monolith-soft">Nintendo became the sole owner of Monolith Soft</a> after years of holding roughly 80 percent of the company since 2007. In 2011, Nintendo would increase its stake to 97 percent of the company, after which those working there contributed to popular Nintendo series like Animal Crossing, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon">Splatoon</a>, and Zelda.</p>
<p>In recent years, Monolith Soft has largely been known for its ongoing Xenoblade series. In 2022 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-3">Xenoblade Chronicles 3</a> was released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xenoblade-chronicles-3-review-a-jrpg-masterpiece">to high critical praise</a>, and would continue this trend in 2025 with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</a>.</p>
<p>The original version of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a> was something of a technical marvel in the Wii U, and its Switch version brought <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-switch-tech-review">that same quality packaged with various visual updates</a>, dynamic resolution scaling, and greater environment detail among other tweaks and improvements.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Last night, we got our first good look at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>'s upcoming James Bond game, 007: First Light. While the developer has said that First Light - or as it was previously known, Project 007 - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-a-fresh-faced-whipper-snapper-of-a-james-bond-in-007-first-light">will serve as an origin story for the spy</a>, and not be a "gamification" of any of the films that have come before, last night's trailer still had a fair few nods to Bonds of the past.</p>
<p>Please note, I will be talking about events from the James Bond series generally below, <strong>so please be aware of potential spoilers for the films and books if you haven't already enjoyed them for yourself</strong>.</p>

<p>First up, there is this Bond's facial scar. As you can see in the trailer above, this young Bond may be fresh faced when it comes to life as an agent, but he has clearly had a few scrapes already, earning himself a long thin scar down his cheek.</p>
<p>While the Bonds in the films have not boasted a scar like this, the book version of Bond did. Ian Flemming wrote that Bond had a three-inch long, thin vertical scar running down his right cheek. You can see some artwork of this book-based Bond below.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Meanwhile, given his overall look in the game, many have surmised that the actor playing James Bond in First Light is Patrick Gibson from Dexter: Original Sin (I have asked IO if they can confirm this).</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Paramount</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In addition to this physical trait, there are also multiple other nods to the James Bond book and film series scattered throughout First Light's trailer that hint to the story, such as Bond's parents dying in a climbing-related accident.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the trailer says 009 is a "master manipulator", which made me think this was a little tease for him being a bit of a bad egg that fooled and betrayed his country a la Sean Bean's 006 from GoldenEye. A little number flip there from IO?</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>On the cars and gadget side of things, because of course Bond is going to have cars and gadgets, First Light again is honouring the series that has come before.</p>
<p>In IO's trailer, Bond can be seen entering Q branch, where he selects one from a number of watches. This watch obviously does more than tell the time, and triggers a blast from a nearby motorbike, which again is in keeping with Bond's watches from the series.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>IO</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While in the Sean Connory era, Bond often sported a Rolex Submariner, in many of the later films he changed things up a bit, with the agent wearing watches such as a Pulsar LED digital and a Seiko 0674 LC at times. </p>
<p>In 2006's Casino Royale, which marked Daniel Craig's first outing as the MI6 agent, Vesper Lynd commented on Bond's watch: "Rolex?" she asks. "Omega," he replies. Bond's watches are a big deal, and in First Light, <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/1930380893811610084">IO has partnered with Omega</a> once again.</p>

<p>Speaking of partnering with a known Bond-brand again, of course we will see the agent in an Aston Martin in First Light.</p>
<figure>

<p>This vehicle is slicker than Moore's bus from Live and Let Die, but it is the same as the actors' yellow Aston Martin DBS from The Persauders, so another little nod to the series' legacy.</p>

<p>Additionally, we can see IO's Bond chasing down a red sports car in the First Light trailer, which reminded me a bit of the playful chase between Pierce Brosnan's Bond and Xenia Onatopp in GoldenEye.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>MGM</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Setting the scene further, then, we also saw a chess game being played during last night's trailer. Now, we don't clearly see <em>who </em>is playing chess here, so it could be Bond flexing his prowess like he often does at cards. And is that a martini, shaken not stirred?</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>IO</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That said, in From Russia with Love, there is a scene where Bond baddy Kronsteen plays chess, so as soon as I saw this moment in the First Light trailer, I thought of that. Essentially, baddies play chess, right?</p>

<p>There is a clip towards the end of the trailer where a speed boat zips through some islands very much like those from The Man With the Golden Gun (Khao Phing Kan, but known also as James Bond Island, no less). This is one of my favourite James Bond locations, so I was pleased to see this pop up. </p>
<figure>

<p>Also, the Junks in this scene are much like those of Scaramanger's.</p>

</figure>
<p>Last up for this piece (I am sure I will be doing more, because guys, it's Bond!), the music played over the trailer was the theme from On Her Majesty's Secret Service. You can have a listen to it below. </p>

<p>007: First Light is set for release in 2026. Towards the end of last year, IO said it hopes its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-developer-says-james-bond-game-will-hopefully-be-the-start-of-a-trilogy">upcoming James Bond origin story will be the start of a trilogy</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/iois-james-bond-game-name-officially-announced-ahead-of-full-reveal-this-week">007: First Light will also feature again later this week during IO's own showcase</a>, which is scheduled for Friday, 6th June, at 6pm PDT. That's 2am on 7th June for those of us in the UK.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Oblivion's a notoriously buggy game, so it probably shouldn't have been too much of a surprise that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">Oblivion Remastered</a> was also pretty damn buggy. While a lot of those bugs are the kind of charming nonsense TES 4 is beloved for, Bethesda and Virtuos have now confirmed that the remaster's got two updates incoming to fix its more serious problems.</p>
<p>Having scrolled through the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2623190/view/536603447519088660?l=english">patch notes</a> for the first of these updates, which releases in Steam beta today, there's one fix that's stood out, because the thing it outlines has been haunting my dreams.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The first of these, Update 1.1, releases via Steam beta on June 5 and focuses on "quests, major bugs and blockers, and quality of life fixes". It'll be available across all platforms as of June 11.</p>
<p>The second update, meanwhile, will aim to improve the game's performance. It doesn't have a date yet, just a "we will share more details when we are able".</p>
<p>One of Update 1.1's quest fixes is designed to stop "Vicente Valtieri losing his hair" during the Dark Brotherhood mission A Knife In The Dark. I ran into this glitch while reviewing the game, and while it wasn't that much of an inconvenience, returning from a mission to find the usually dapper vampire assassin had gone full Ross Kemp was definitely an experience. Especially when his hair then miraculously grew back by the next time I visited for a chat.</p>
<p>Among the patch's other interesting fixes are ones for High Chancellor Ocato's "arms not animating", Thieves Guild NPCs just not showing up at all, and Savlian Matius getting stuck after the castle courtyard fight when you're re-taking Kvatch. I think I narrowly avoided that last one, as I recall Matius seemingly very reticent to follow my hero into the castle, despite all his chatter about time being of the essence in saving the count.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-comes-with-a-below-average-display-and-disappointing-hdr-support-new-in-depth-analysis-reveals.1208082/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 comes with a below-average display that fails to deliver an acceptable HDR experience, according to a new in-depth analysis.</p>
<p>The new analysis by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GamingTech-YouTube" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamingTech</a>, which can be watched in full below, takes a good look at the new Nintendo system's display, confirming it comes with a maximum peak brightness of around 400, 450 nits. Measuring the brightness in Zelda: Breath of the Wild returned a maximum value of 420 nits, but in Cyberpunk 2077, it is locked to 450 nits, likely the maximum peak brightness the display is capable of. This peak brightness is not even close to providing a proper HDR experience, which is made worse because we are talking about an LCD display that fails to display black correctly due to the back lighting and the constant black level rise of 0.5 nits.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2's HDR support in docked mode fares a little better. The system-level calibration is found to be adequate, and in games like Cyberpunk 2077, the system delivers an HDR experience on par with that of the other versions of the game. In other games like Zelda: Breath of the Wild, the HDR experience is rather disappointing, as the game looks washed out due to its aesthetics and the lack of contrast.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches today worldwide. A <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-day-one-update/">day one update</a> has also been rolled out in all regions, enabling network features, access to the new eShop, and more.</p>

            <p>In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sword-of-the-sea">Sword Of The Sea</a> you ride a magical blade across shifting dunes of golden sand. It looks like a combination of the jetbike desert-crossing of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sable">Sable</a> and the meditative hiking of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/journey">Journey</a>. Which makes sense when you learn the art director from the latter game is leading the team. I like the look of it. Surfing is cool and so are swords, so I'm happy to see it's coming out in just a couple months, as announced at last night's State of Play show by PlayStation.</p>

<p>It's due out on August 19th this year, say developers Giant Squid. You might know them as the creators of peaceful ocean diving game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/abzu">Abzu</a>, or the speedy running and slick archery of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-pathless">The Pathless</a>. To my shame I have played neither of these. But then, neither of them has you kickflipping across a mysterious fantasy landscape on a giant medieval weapon. I think maybe this is the one for me, yes.</p>
<p>When the game was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sword-of-the-sea-is-a-new-desert-surfing-adventure-from-the-devs-behind-abzu-and-journey">first announced in 2023</a>, the sword you ride was described as a "snowboard, skateboard, and hoverboard all in one". As for the story, it seems as mystical as the game looks.</p>
<p>"You are the Wraith," explained creative director Matt Nava in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/24/introducing-sword-of-the-sea-a-new-game-from-giant-squid/">a blog</a>, "resurrected in a desolate world and tasked with restoring life to it as you explore submerged ruins and the vibrant, varied cultures within. Surf through sinking tombs, mysterious shipwrecks, and petrified battlefields – and bring giant shoals of fish and creatures back in the process. But beware- this land is also home to massive leviathans that will stand in your way."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The latest PlayStation 5 system software update, released yesterday, introduced a rather major fix alongside the minor enhancements documented in the official update note.</p>
<p>As initially reported on the<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1l3ane7/it_seems_like_todays_ps5_software_update_fixed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;PlayStation 5 subreddit</a>, and later confirmed by Sony itself to Digital Foundry, the latest system software update fixed a known VRR issue that caused stuttering in games running at 120 Hz with unlocked framerate like The Last of Us Part 1 and 2, Kingdom Come Deliverance II, and Diablo 4. The stuttering issues would present themselves even in games that do not have 120 Hz modes but take advantage of the system-level feature that works in the 48Hz to 60Hz range, and even in this case, the issues have been reportedly fixed, as Elden Ring no longer starts stuttering after 20 minutes of play like it did before. It's definitely surprising not to see this rather major PlayStation 5 issue getting fixed highlighted in the patch notes, but still, it's very good that Sony finally addressed this issue to offer on its current-generation systems the same smooth VRR experience that has been provided by the Xbox Series systems.</p>

<p lang="en">Sony PR contacted me yesterday to confirm that - as already detected by some - the latest PlayStation firmware resolves the VRR hiccup issue. When I find a spare moment, I'll test it out.</p>
<p>— Digital Foundry (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:sdkjeb6sj3aqwwtwnbuusybk?ref_src=embed">@digitalfoundry.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:sdkjeb6sj3aqwwtwnbuusybk/post/3lqttdmj5k22n?ref_src=embed">June 5, 2025 at 9:47 AM</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As mentioned above, yesterday's <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-system-software-update-25-04-11-40-00/">PlayStation 5 system software update</a> did not introduce any major new features to the console, introducing only improvements for messages and usability on some screens. The latest update, which introduced some new features, was released back in April. It reintroduced the PlayStation 30th Anniversary UI and the Audio Focus feature, which allows players to better hear quiet sounds and voice chat in games.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> got a concrete release date at last night's State of Play. You'll be able to play it on PC on September 25 this year, which is also when it arrives on consoles.</p>
<p>As for what you're in for, a fresh trailer made pretty clear that protagonist Hinako Shimizu is going to have a bad time of things, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-has-been-deemed-too-freaky-for-australians-for-now">freaky</a> flower monsters and creepy scarecrow-inspired doll things with the mangled posture of your average veteran office worker all seeking to hurt her as she runs around cracking skulls with a pipe.</p>

<p>As you can watch above, things are all fine for Hinako and her mates until a fog decsends on the town of Ebisugaoka, cue a 10/10 creepy laugh and the start of things going <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">spookily pear-shaped</a>. Konami producer Motoi Okamoto provided a bit more info in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/silent-hill-f-launches-september-25-ps5-gameplay-revealed/">PlayStation Blog post</a> released alongside the release date reveal trailer.</p>
<p>"As Hinako tries to survive the now fog-wreathed town," he wrote, "she will be faced with decisions that will shape her ultimate fate. Will she choose to embrace elegance and beauty? Or will her path lead her to madness and horror?  Is she doomed to succumb to the insanity unfolding before her, or can she face her fears and find a way to escape?"</p>
<p>Okamoto cites the game as having "four pillars". These main goals were letting folks explore an "authentic depiction of 1960s Japan", crafting monster design and the soundtrack to focus on the "juxtaposition between beauty and terror", developing puzzles that are "grounded in psychological anguish and suffering", and putting together a "unique" combat system.</p>
<p>"The encounters are as challenging as the obstacles that Hinako must overcome in life," the producer wrote of that last part. "The combat will have a heavier focus on melee and be more action-oriented compared to last year’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2</a>."</p>
<p>The spin-off, penned by Ryukishi07, is designed to work as both an entry point to the series for newbies, and reward veterans with plenty of easter eggs. Last night's showcase also featured the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pragmata-still-exists-and-capcom-say-the-sci-fi-action-game-is-coming-in-2026-for-real-this-time">Pragmata</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-lights-announcement-trailer-shows-a-young-bond-being-bond-bondly">007: First Light</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nioh-3-is-coming-in-2026-but-once-again-it-looks-like-us-pc-gamers-will-have-to-wait">Nioh 3</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We're going to have to deliver on a lot of other really awesome genres."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Progress towards that goal has, so far, been steady. Festival continues to attract big name music acts to headline its seasons with new player skins and music drops. Lego Fortnite Odyssey, a survival crafting experience, has a solid player core. But Rocket Racing has largely been retired, and newer shooter-centric modes such as Reload have found more success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During its State of Unreal show this week, Epic Games noted that a third-party experience in Fortnite had momentarily overtaken Epic's own core modes for the first time, something that would have seemed impossible just a few years ago. But Epic Games' own non-shooter modes currently show no signs of replicating this success, with player numbers well below that of the developer's main Battle Royale and Zero Build playlists, let alone Reload or the game's Fortnite OG throwback offering.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked by IGN whether engagement for modes such as the musical Fortnite Festival and various Lego Fortnite experiences were where Epic Games wanted them to be, Epic Games executive vice president Sax Persson replied: "I don't think we're ever happy."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think the shooter modes have done well," Sweeney added. "I think we've not yet achieved the magic that we've been hoping to achieve with the music gameplay. It's funny, we brought in the Harmonix team, [they] joined Epic, built Rock Band and Guitar Hero in the past, they're an awesome team, and they've been riffing on approaches to that genre and Fortnite. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They've also been bringing in all kinds of music items into Fortnite with Jam Tracks, which have not only a song, but all the beats associated with them, and ability to play them on your instruments."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Music has done extraordinarily well in Fortnite, but ironically, not so much in music games.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, despite Fortnite's hugely-popular musical live events generating massive interest and player numbers in the millions, Epic has not yet found a formula that generates regular engagement of the same kind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Music has done extraordinarily well in Fortnite, but ironically, not so much in music games," Sweeney noted, "more just in Battle Royale and elsewhere. Our next step is to figure out music at a large scale. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think as Rock Band and Guitar Hero themselves achieved in their day, which was a decade or two decades ago, there's an opportunity for a music game with tens of millions of monthly active users that people just absolutely love and come to every evening or weekend for the coolest concert and competitive gameplay of all sorts."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How about Lego, then, the brand that's perhaps now the most deeply entrenched within the Fortnite ecosystem, and the offering that's most popular of all Epic's non-shooter modes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think Lego is interesting, Persson said. "We are super proud of [the] journey and it has a really dedicated fan base. But is it as big as we would want it to be? No, we would love to have it bigger and figure out a way to get more Lego fans to see that this exists."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fortnite Revealed for Nintendo Switch 2 - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, it sounds like Epic is still facing the issue that Fortnite currently remains a brand associated with being a battle royale more than anything else.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"What's our primary challenge? Our primary challenge is Fortnite is Fortnite, and historically Fortnite was a shooter game," Persson continued. "It is not a shooter game anymore. It is the everything game, and we need to tell that story better than what we've done."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One solution to this will be the forthcoming rollout of improved capabilities for third-party teams working within Fortnite's Unreal Engine-powered editor, UEFN, Sweeney said. Epic currently has a better toolset than other creators, but this will change over time — to the point that Epic's own battle royale seasons will eventually (now in 2026) be made with the same tools as any creator could have access to. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When we develop our modes, we're working with C++ and the entire Unreal Engine, [while] creators working with the toolset that we built, it's Verse and some APIs," Sweeney noted. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Our big task now is to get the two of those development frameworks to converge so that we, Epic, and creators are working in the exact same tools with the exact same capabilities and creators will have way more power at their disposal there, and that's been the thing that we've been working so hard on for the last two years."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"I would say we're only successful with Fortnite as an ecosystem"</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But why not just settle with being a brilliantly successful battle royale? For Epic Games, the future of Fortnite as a continued experience — and source of enormous income for the company — rests on its continued evolution and ongoing cultural relevance, amid the ever-changing landscape of popular video game tastes and genres.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I would say we're only successful with Fortnite as an ecosystem," Sweeney concluded. "If somebody else actually beats us at our game, and builds something that's bigger and cooler and better than battle royale... I think there's a high probability of that happening. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If you look at the shooter genre, it evolved with new game types coming out over time based on what was possible with the current technology," he added, noting the evolution of shooters from simple games of Deathmatch to modes with larger player counts and vehicles. "Battle Royale just happens to be the best shooter genre yet invented — and thanks to both the Japanese movie makers and [PUBG creator] Brendan Green for discovering the magic there. But it's definitely not the last. There'll be more and it'll get even better and new technologies are going to make things that are currently impossible, possible, and I think that's going to unleash unexpected surprises and creativity."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been a busy week for Epic Games, which has been talking about the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ai-prompts-will-soon-let-a-10-person-team-build-a-game-like-breath-of-the-wild-where-the-ai-is-doing-all-the-dialogue-and-you-just-write-character-synopsis-tim-sweeney-predicts">future of AI in its Unreal Engine and in Fortnite</a> following the recent release of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnites-ai-darth-vader-has-only-been-live-for-an-hour-and-already-epic-has-patched-out-him-saying-fk">very chatty AI-powered Darth Vader</a>. We've also heard from Epic and The Witcher 4 developer CD Projekt Red on that eye-catching Witcher 4 demo — and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-the-witcher-4-tech-demo-what-the-witcher-4-will-actually-look-like-we-asked-cd-projekt">whether the final game will actually look anything like it</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/james-bond-fans-think-theyve-worked-out-secret-identity-of-007-first-light-actor<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of secret agent James Bond haven't taken long to decide who they think is the (not so) mysterious actor playing the role in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/007-first-light">007 First Light</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game's new trailer, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/007-first-light-reveals-new-young-james-bond-with-the-walking-deads-lennie-james-set-to-co-star">revealed at Sony's State of Play broadcast</a>, shows off a notably younger-looking Bond, fresh out of the Royal Navy and keen to earn his 00 agent status. But who is playing the title role?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Minutes after the trailer aired, fans on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesBond/comments/1l3icpc/i_think_the_actor_for_the_james_bond_game_is/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> began guessing that Dexter: New Blood star Patrick Gibson was the behind the new Bond — and he certainly shares a strong similarity with the character in the trailer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I clocked it THE SECOND I saw the dirty smirk of his," wrote one 007 aficionado. "Yeah I peeped that as soon as I seen it," said another.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Watching the trailer and knew the face looked familiar," said a third. "After about a minute or so I screamed 'DEXTER.' I'm pretty sure it's him."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aged 30, the Irish actor is just a few years older than the 26-year-old version of Bond he looks set to portray in the upcoming game — and, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-007-io-interactive-young-bond-for-gamers-trilogy">if IO Interactive gets its way, several sequels</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if Gibson looks familiar to you too, well, the actor already has a swathe of TV and film roles under his belt, including appearances in Shadow and Bone, The Tudors, and The OA. But it's his role as a younger version of Dexter Morgan in prequel series Dexter: Original Sin for which he's most famous.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/05/gettyimages-632417032-1749114309513.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Patrick Gibson. Photo by Francois G. Durand/WireImage.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Curiously, 007 First Light developer IO Interactive is yet to confirm Gibson itself — though IGN has asked the studio if it can comment on the internet's speculation. Gibson also, for now, appears to keeping schtum.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A press release issued alongside Gibson's apparent debut in 007 First Light's trailer describes the game as as globe-trotting story-driven action-adventure game where you can choose how to navigate various challenges — either with brute force or 007's trademark charm. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer showed Bond cracking a couple of deadpan jokes as he got himself out of (and into) trouble. Gibson's acting chops as the antihero Dexter look set to be put to good use.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">007 First Light is due to launch at some point in 2026 for Nintendo Switch 2, PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-controller-patent-points-to-sequel-for-million-selling-game-fans-believe<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A fresh patent for a new Nintendo game controller has set tongues wagging that a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ring-fit-adventure">Ring Fit Adventure</a> sequel is on the way for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://www.tmdn.org/tmdsview-web/#/dsview/detail/EM700000015103981-0002" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patent</a>, dug up by the appropriately-named <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social/post/3lqqsrllafc2x" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Patents Watch</a>, was filed at the end of May 2025 and published online publicly this week — albeit with all of its images currently redacted. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo is named as the owner of the patent, which is listed as being for "video game controllers (accessories)." Most importantly, Nintendo employee Fumiyoshi Suetake is mentioned as the controller's specific designer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Suetake was a key figure in the development of the original Ring Fit Adventure, which launched in 2019 for Nintendo Switch and has now sold more than 15 million copies. The game is packaged with a pilates ring-style accessory, which players squash and stretch while exercising. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The appearance of Suetake's name on the patent is a big clue that the currently unannounced controller may be a new Ring Fit accessory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, Nintendo Patents Watch pointed out that Nintendo recently extended the patent on its original Ring Fit Adventure controller, suggesting the company still wanted ongoing legal protection for a product that was already available.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And finally, manufacturing giant Foxconn, a long-time Nintendo partner, has previously noted it is helping to develop new "force sensing technology" for a gaming firm, and has published a diagram showing what looks to be an updated Ring Fit controller.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/04/bafkreidkbktitwbjvzjyseyohlrddpxn7m3xkw6suig4pqhscjkqrpn5bq-1749033044234.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Foxconn diagram showing a controller, left, similar to the Ring Fit Adventure device.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this points to a new Ring Fit Adventure game on the way, with a Switch 2 launch seemingly likely. If nothing else, it'd make sense that Nintendo wanted a sequel to such a successful game — even if sales of the original Ring Fit Adventure were fuelled by gym-hungry owners stuck at home in 2020, exercising in front of their TV.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Ring Fit Adventure offers an inventive fitness RPG that doesn’t quite have all the moves," IGN wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/10/17/ring-fit-adventure-for-nintendo-switch-review">Ring Fit Adventure review</a>, which praised the game's "fun and challenging blend of exercise and RPG mechanics."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo Switch 2 is out now and we have plenty to help get you started. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-updates-for-mario-zelda-pokmon-switch-games-now-live-including-unavailable-super-mario-3d-all-stars-here-are-all-the-patch-notes">From ARMS to Zelda, here are all of the new updates to Switch 1 games</a>, and here's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game-you-can-buy-right-now">every Nintendo Switch 2 launch game you can buy right now</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
