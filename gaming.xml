Also, we looked at 24 games coming out in this fairly packed month that we can’t wait to try, shared the details on Nintendo’s current Mario Day sale which has some pretty great Switch games available at a nice discount, and covered a big change that the upcoming <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 </em>is making to <em>THPS 4</em>, which has some fans concerned.

In fact, you might have to go back to 2002’s <em>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind </em>to find another first-person fantasy role-playing game that so utterly captivated me with its world. I’ve seen some people grouse that it’s not as full-featured as the likes of <em>Skyrim</em>, but I actually <em>like </em>that about it! Developer Obsidian knew what it wanted to achieve with this game and focused its resources where they mattered most: on creating a world that’s fun and rewarding to explore; on developing combat that’s hard-hitting and offers all kinds of player agency; and on a narrative that has deeply developed themes, expressive choices, and the potential to experience significant consequences. I didn’t realize just how significant until I failed to prevent a catastrophe in the game’s second area, and you know what? I’m glad I made this huge mistake. Let me explain. <strong>(Spoilers concerning the second area of</strong><em><strong> Avowed</strong></em><strong> follow.)</strong> - Carolyn Petit <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avowed-steel-garrote-cave-fior-mes-iverno-burns-1851767974&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-steel-garrote-cave-fior-mes-iverno-burns-1851767974">Read More</a></span></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/localthunk-the-balatro-timeline-solo-dev/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Recently, the solo developer behind Balatro, one of 2024’s most highly awarded games, opened up about his journey in a blog post. In an article dubbed ‘The Balatro Timeline’, LocalThunk took a deep dive into the end-to-end history of what it took to make Balatro, which was released in February 2024 to an overwhelmingly positive reception.</p>



<p>LocalThunk explained about the very origins of Balatro – which was first named ‘Joker Poker’ – in this timeline walkthrough. He also gives readers a transparent insight into the toll that creating the game had on his mental and physical health, which is something many gamers never realise.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-my-sleep-and-my-heart-are-getting-worse">‘My Sleep and my Heart are Getting Worse’</h2>



<p>In The Balatro Timeline, LocalThunk tracks back through three years of development history, going back to December 2021, when the first concept of what would become known as Balatro surfaced. It was being pieced together alongside a full-time IT job, and back then, LocalThunk couldn’t ever imagine it becoming as successful as it has.</p>



<p>The full account of this stunning development journey is a wonder to read, and it paints a clear picture of just how impactful these things can be on developers – especially solo developers.</p>



<p>LocalThunk explained that his mental and physical health were put to the test during the creation of Balatro, with the situation becoming much worse as the launch got closer and the attention around Balatro started ramping up <strong>fast</strong>.</p>



<p>For instance, it was noted that in August 2023, just six months before the launch of Balatro:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This is when my sleep and heart started having issues. </p>



<p>I really struggled with my physical and mental health from this time onward all the way up to launch. This was entirely because of the stress around dealing with the public, players, and the pressure to get everything done before February 2024.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>By October 2023, things were getting much worse for LocalThunk:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My sleep and my heart are getting worse. Every few nights I need to sleep sitting upright on the couch because sleeping while lying down kept getting interrupted by my heart. </p>



<p>I stupidly thought that I couldn’t handle going to the doctor while dealing with all the dev and business stuff swirling around at the time. I felt totally overwhelmed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Everything from signing with a publisher to hiring lawyers to hammer out contracts is detailed <a href="https://localthunk.com/blog/balatro-timeline-3aarh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in The Balatro Timeline</a>. It’s an account of the highs and lows of solo development, but fortunately, it ends on a jubilant note.</p>



<p>LocalThunk revealed that he made $600,000 in just a couple of hours on Steam alone, and on launch day, he sat down to celebrate with a bottle of champagne and some burgers.</p>



<p>Nice.</p>

<p>When you think about it, the keyboard is the most complex video game controller in common use today, with over 100 distinct inputs arranged in a vast grid. Yet even the most complex keyboard-controlled games today tend to only use a relative handful of all those available keys for actual gameplay purposes.</p>
<p>The biggest exception to this rule is a <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/genre:typing/">typing game</a>, which by definition asks players to send their fingers flying across every single letter on the keyboard (and then some) in quick succession. By default, though, typing games tend to take the form of extremely basic typing tutorials, where the gameplay amounts to little more than typing out words and sentences by rote as they appear on screen, maybe with a few cute accompanying animations.</p>

<p><em>Blood Typers</em> adds some much-needed complexity to that basic type-the-word-you-see concept, layering its typing tests on top of a full-fledged survival horror game reminiscent of the original PlayStation era. The result is an amazingly tense and compelling action adventure that also serves as a great way to hone your touch-typing skills.</p>
<h2>See it, type it, do it</h2>
<p>For some, <em>Blood Typers</em> may bring up first-glance memories of <em>Typing of the Dead</em>, Sega's campy, typing-controlled take on the <em>House of the Dead</em> light gun game series. But <em>Blood Typers</em> goes well beyond <em>Typing of the Dead</em>'s on-rails shooting, offering an experience that's more like a typing-controlled version of <em>Resident Evil</em>.</p>
<p>Practically every action in <em>Blood Typers</em> requires typing a word that you see on-screen. That includes basic locomotion, which is accomplished by typing any of a number of short words scattered at key points in your surroundings in order to automatically walk to that point. It's a bit awkward at first, but quickly becomes second nature as you memorize the names of various checkpoints and adjust to using the shift keys to turn that camera as you move.</p>

<p>When any number of undead enemies appear, a quick tap of the tab key switches you to combat mode, which asks you to type longer words that appear above those enemies to use your weapons. More difficult enemies require multiple words to take down, including some with armor that means typing a single word repeatedly before you can move on.</p>
<p>While you start each scenario in <em>Blood Typers</em> with a handy melee weapon, you'll end up juggling a wide variety of projectile firearms that feel uniquely tuned to the typing gameplay. The powerful shotgun, for instance, can take out larger enemies with just a single word, while the rapid-fire SMG lets you type only the first few letters of each word, allowing for a sort of rapid fire feel. The flamethrower, on the other hand, can set whole groups of nearby enemies aflame, which makes each subsequent attack word that much shorter and faster.</p>

			<p>MercurySteam's upcoming action/adventure game has received several new gameplay videos from a few outlets who were able to play it in advance of its release. It certainly looks like there's some inspiration from Sony Santa Monica's God of War Norse mythology reboot.</p>
<p>Following its <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-is-a-new-action-adventure-from-mercurysteam-out-on-may-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiling</a> in late February, this game has received a barrage of news ahead of its May 22 launch. The developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-will-focus-strictly-on-weapons-and-your-skills-instead-of-magic-and-rpg-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">talked</a> about the game's focus on forging and wielding melee weapons rather than using flashy magic spells. Likewise, they wanted to put the player's skill first rather than rely on RPG-like stats. However, the weapon's stats will matter, depending on the materials you used while crafting it. There are many different combinations to experiment with.</p>
<p>Later, the Spanish team known for the Castlevania: Lords of Shadow trilogy <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-detailed-requirements-upscaled-4k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the full PC system requirements for Blades of Fire:</p>

<p>In this game, players will step into the role of Aran de Lira, firstborn of the King's Ward and the only one capable of crafting weapons to challenge the evil Queen Nerea, who has cast a spell that turns all other steel weapons into stone. Forging is a big part of the game, allowing players to choose from seven weapon families and more than thirty unique Forge scrolls. In combat, they'll be able to target specific body parts, and wielding the right weapon against the enemy's armor will be critical. There are over fifty enemy types in total, each with different attack styles, weapons, and armors.</p>
<p>Blades of Fire will be released soon for PC (as an Epic Games Store exclusive), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

		<p>Tripwire Interactive left it until pretty much the last minute, but has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/killing-floor-3">Killing Floor 3</a> has been delayed until later in 2025.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/31/killing-floor-3-launches-on-25th-march-25-with-closed-beta-in-february/">Previously expected for launch on 25th March</a>, Killing Floor 3’s delay does not have a new release date. While still expected to arrive in 2025, anyone who pre-ordered the game will automatically receive refunds on Epic, Xbox and PS5, while US-based PS5 pre-orders will be prompted to choose and Steam pre-orders are free to cancel manually. <a href="https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?threads/killing-floor-3-general-faq.2340844/">See here for more details</a>.</p>


<p>“After taking the time to gather and discuss feedback from our recent closed beta, we’ve realized that we missed the mark,” the team explained on a certain social media cesspool. “Our goal isn’t just to make Killing Floor 3 an ambitious step forward for the franchise, but also to maintain the core experience that you’ve come to know and love.</p>
<p>“With the full support of our parent company Embracer Group, we’re working together on a timeline to address many of the common issues players had during the beta, including performance/stability, UI/UX, lighting, and weapon feel. While it’s too early to say which fixes will be implemented by launch, we can confirm that an update allowing you to independently select your perk class and character is planned for post-release.</p>
<p>“We look forward to another opportunity to show you a more polished version of Killing Floor 3, and when we’re ready to share more details, you will be the first to know. Until then, we thank you for your continued patience and overwhelming support.”</p>


<p>Killing Floor 3 takes the already dark war against the Zeds and jumps forward 70 years from Killing Floor 2, with a new army of Zeds on the march from megacorp Horzine. You’re part of a group known as Nightfall which is trying to fight back.</p>
<p>Of course, that’s all just a narrative wrapper for the 6-player co-op in which you face off against waves of incoming Zeds. There’s six Specialist character classes, each with complimentary abilities and roles, and an array of weapons that you’ll be able to upgrade and adapt, both through the overarching player progression and by buying equipment between waves. The M.E.A.T. System returns as well, ramped up to give even more guts and gore, which is sure to make wielding a katana rather visceral.</p>

<p>We went <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/killing-floor-3-preview-beta/">hands on with the recent Killing Floor 3 beta test</a>, saying “Killing Floor 3 might not be reinventing the horde shooter wheel, but it is taking that next step with the well-established formula. There’s modern touches like being able to mantle over cover and clamber up to higher vantage points, aiding in how manoeuvrable you are and shifting some of the requirements for the level design.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-leaks-reveal-battlefield-4-vibe/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Just as we all expected, the recent behind-closed-doors playtests for Battlefield 6 (not a confirmed title) have resulted in countless leaks hitting social and streaming platforms worldwide. The first tests took place this week, and participants were quick to screengrab as much as possible and leak it all over the internet.</p>



<p>What has emerged is something quite tantalising. It looks as though the Battlefield 6 leaks are uncovering a Battlefield 4 – or dare I say it, <strong>Battlefield 3</strong> – vibe, and I am truly here for every ounce of it. This could be the return of peak.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-back-again">Battlefield Back Again</h2>



<p>Battlefield has struggled in recent years; that much is obvious. The series has undergone a tumultuous time that began after Battlefield 1 hit the market and became one of the best-selling games in the franchise. It was all kind of downhill from there.</p>



<p>In 2021, Electronic Arts released Battlefield 2042, the worst game in the series by far, which flopped <strong>hard</strong> at launch.</p>



<p>Recently, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/">Battlefield Labs</a> playtest sessions have given way to stacks of leaks for Battlefield 6. That was fairly predictable, and some have theorised that it was engineered by Electronic Arts as a way to earn free publicity.</p>



<p>In the Battlefield 6 leaks, we’re seeing a present-day theatre of war populated by traditional soldiers, vehicles, and locales. It’s a back-to-basics shooter with recognisable weapons and a clean UI that’s entirely representative of the heyday of the Battlefield franchise. We can see classic destructive elements, snippets of the class system, and the no-holds-barred action sequences unfold. </p>



<p>In 2011, the team released Battlefield 3, and in 2013, Battlefield 4 came out. For many, those two titles represent the peak of the franchise – and I count myself among that crowd.</p>



<p>It’s important to stress that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/someone-is-streaming-battlefield-labs-for-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield leaks</a> we’re seeing are from a pre-alpha build of the game, and everything is subject to change. That’s why they’re testing things now and standing up a community-led feedback pipeline.</p>



<p>It has been far too long since a Battlefield game dominated the market, but Battlefield 6 could hit the spot for gamers eager for a broader, more ambitious first-person shooter title. If it’s anything like Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4, including a campaign and a couple of side options and added modes, it could be a smash hit.</p>



<p>Let me know what you think about the Battlefield 6 leaks in the comments, or join the discussion on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/wwe-2k25-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wwe-2k25-review-in-progress.1128783/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/wwe-2k25-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Few sports are more primed for the whole “being a video game” thing than professional wrestling, but it’s kinda weird when you think about it: the WWE itself is more akin to an elaborately choreographed fight or dance sequence in a movie than it is an actual competition, whereas the goal of the games based on it is to fight to win.  But inherent contradictions aside, I’m enjoying my time with WWE 2K25 so far – just a couple of days in – thanks to its much-improved Showcase mode and generally great game feel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When I step into a new version of an annualized game like this, the first thing I try to do is get the lay of the land. Even though I’ve been playing wrestling games since the N64 days, my first stop is the tutorial because, unless things have gone very wrong, something is always a little different (this year, for instance, sees the long-requested return of Chain Wrestling) or I’ve forgotten how to do some very important, very specific button sequence you need to be able to do. WWE games have had a good introduction for a while now, especially compared to other sports game franchises (Hi, Madden!), and WWE 2K25 is no exception. This is an incredibly detailed tutorial that will walk you through everything you need to be a champ in the ring, with in-depth explanations of what moves do and how to do them. The Performance Center is a great teaching tool whether you need a quick refresher or you’re learning to do an Irish Whip for the first time. This may seem like an odd thing to spill ink over, but every version of a game is someone’s first – or maybe their first in a while – and I’m glad Visual Concepts seems to remember those people.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once I’d refreshed my memory, I spent a while just looking around. WWE 2K25’s got an absolutely stacked roster, whether you’re here for classics like Bret “Hit Man” Hart, wrestlers-turned-movie-stars like Dave Bautista/Batista and Dwayne Johnson/The Rock, megastars like “Stone Cold” Steve Austin, or weirdos like Doink the Clown. I also appreciate that there are several versions of the same dudes from across their history in the WWE. Why yes WWE 2K25, I <em>do</em> need a handful of Triple Hs, each with their own different stats, thank you! Did you know that, compared to the modern version of The Rock, the 1997 version is considered a bum? Me neither, but that’s what the stats say! Remember what Rhea Ripley’s visual style was in 2020? Or 2017? When was the last time you thought about “Ravishing” Rick Rude? This stuff is great, and what’s better is you can edit just about every aspect of these wrestlers, from how the crowd reacts to them to tweaking individual stats and changing out moves if you don’t like Visual Concepts’ take on them. The ability to tweak individual wrestlers is not new, but as this roster gets bigger, it’s good to be reminded of how impressive all of it is.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What’s captured most of my attention so far is this year’s Showcase mode.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Among other new things in WWE 2K25, so far I’ve briefly toyed with intergender matches, The Island (I mean, who among us <em>hasn’t </em>wanted to impress Roman Reigns?), and new MyRise storylines. But what’s captured most of my attention so far is this year’s Showcase mode, which follows the Bloodline and the Anoa’i, Fatu, and Maivia families. Paul “The Wiseman” Heyman hosts the thing this year, and he’s clearly having a <em>very </em>good time providing the backstory that explains who the players are and why these matches are significant. There’s a lot of archival footage here, as in years past, though the problem of blurring out some folks’ faces (maybe due to rights issues?) persists. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless, Showcase feels better than last year’s version (partially because this time we’ve got full ring entrances and the mid-match commentary is really excellent, and here for every match) and a fun twist this time around is that you’re sometimes asked to change the outcomes of matches members of these families lost in the real WWE storyline. If what I’ve played is any indication of the whole, there are also no longer any cuts to match footage that interrupt your gameplay. Big moments are instead recreated in-game, which means they play out more organically, even if you’re not following the checklist. So far, I’m having a blast doing things like beating the ever-loving snot out of Hulk Hogan with Yokozuna.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Bruises, blood, and sweat are more realistic.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The other thing that’s stood out is just how good it all looks. The WWE series has always been a looker, but this year Visual Concepts has managed to make things noticeably prettier than ever. Bruises, blood, and sweat are more realistic, and you can tell how long a match has been going, who is winning, and where the guys in the ring are taking the most punishment at a glance. It’s really impressive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s kind of where I am with WWE2K25 as a whole as we head into the first weekend. There’s a lot left to do before I can slap a number on this bad boy, but it looks fantastic, feels pretty great (just like WWE 2K24), and there’s a lot of it. An upscale wrestling buffet, if you will. What I’ve had so far is scrumptious, but there’s still a wide selection of dishes on the table, and your boy’s gotta taste test ‘em all. Better get back to it – that circle’s not gonna square itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Are you playing? Let us know what you think so far!</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN WWE Game Review Ever</h3></div></output></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you're looking for a definitive answer on which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Weapons">weapon type</a> will get you the fastest hunt times every time because it's just <em>that</em> good and overpowered, there isn't one. The truth of it is that you should choose what feels good to play with for <em>you. </em>If you're not carting, are consistently hitting the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Monster_Hunter_Wilds_Monsters">monster</a>, and having fun while doing it, that's what matters the most. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a lot that goes into making a build for any given weapon successful, like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Best_Armor_Sets">armor,</a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Decorations">decorations</a>, and a <em>particular </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Artian_Weapons">Artian weapon</a> for the particular monster you're up against, and those are the most important aspect, but if you're looking for weapon types that just might help you get those hunt times down, these are great ones to try. This tier list of best weapons in Monster Hunter Wilds was created by Frankensteining IGN's community tier list, online sentiment, my own opinion based on difficulty to master, and some current speedrun time averages.</p><div id="monster-hunter-wilds-weapons-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3><h3>Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title1">Monster Hunter Wilds Best Weapons Tier List</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The "best" weapons in Monster Hunter Wilds are Sword and Shield, Great Sword, Long Sword,  Gunlance, and Bow, in no particular order, but the rest of the weapons are absolutely viable. These just stand out above the rest for a variety of reasons, which we'll describe below. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>S-tier: 
</strong>These are the best of the best for both damage output and relative ease of use to get there. The Gunlance is the most technical weapon here, but its benefits are worth it according to the community. </p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Sword_and_Shield_Guide_and_Tutorial_">Sword and Shield</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Great_Sword_Guide_and_Tutorial">Great Sword</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Long_Sword_Guide_and_Tutorial">Long Sword</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Gunlance_Guide_and_Tutorial">Gunlance</a></li><li><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Bow_Guide_and_Tutorial">Bow</a></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A-tier: </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">A-tier weapons have the potential to be as good as S-tier weapons in the right hands as they tend to be a bit more technical and less forgiving, or they fall just a tiny bit short.

It's long been grossly underrated as solely the "beginner" weapon, and while it's easy to pick up and get to it, it's also one of the most versatile, consistent weapons in the game that can deal a ton of damage once you get your combos and movements down. Not only is it incredibly mobile even in the middle of attacks, allowing you to stick on monsters like mud on a Jyuratodos, but it can <em>also</em> guard and deal punishing damage. It can even <em>perfect</em> guard incredibly easily, letting you perform quick, powerful counter slashes and proc an Offensive Guard buff if you have that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Equipment_Skills">Equipment Skill</a>. For support hunters, it can even use items without putting it away, letting you administer life-saving Lifepowders and buffing items for your whole party in a flash. Whether you prefer to evade or block, deal slashing or blunt damage, or even attack from above, the Sword and Shield has got it all--even a Power Clash. The only thing it's missing is an Offset attack. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Great Sword</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Monster Hunter developers have said the first weapon they tool in new games is the Great Sword, and it shows. It can take advantage of Wilds' new Power Clashes and incredibly satisfying Offset attacks, and its kit in general is quintessential Monster Hunter satisfaction in a nutshell. It will take more getting used to than the Sword and Shield, as it's quite slow, and mishits can be punishing, but the introduction of Focus Mode makes it easier than ever to aim.  If you're looking for the highest damage output in a single strike, the Great Sword is a <em>great</em> pick, and those True Charged Slash hits look <em>so </em>satisfying. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Long Sword</strong></h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Long Sword is consistently Monster Hunter's most popular weapon for good reason. It's fast and fairly easy to pick up, with a fun, flashy, and satisfying playstyle that relies on its powerful perfect-evading counterattack, the Foresight Slash, to quickly build up the Spirit Gauge to deal max damage. It's also got amazing reach, considering its size, so slicing off tails is a breeze with the Long Sword. It takes some management to maintain a maxed Spirit Gauge, but doing it is well worth the incredible damage output the Long Sword can accomplish when you're in a flow with it. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Gunlance</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To be honest, I know little about the Gunlance, but IGN's community tier list contributors, speedrunners, and people around the internet seem to love it in Monster Hunter Wilds. I have found it much more difficult to pick up than the other S-tier weapons, but if you master it, it's got amazing defense with its huge shield capable of Perfect Guards and <em>explosive</em> power in exchange for some mobility. In Wilds, the Gunlance can now fire two Wyvern's Fire shots, which also have longer range. Its new attack, Wyrmstake Full Blast, is also incredibly powerful! </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Bow</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though the bow isn't doing too hot in Tempered Arkveld speedruns, many agree it's an amazing pick in Monster Hunter Wilds, and I've seen it often voted as the strongest weapon in community polls. It certainly <em>feels</em> powerful, even despite its minor Focus Strike nerf since the Open Beta Test. So, what makes it S-tier? The Bow has a new move in Wilds that <em>guarantees</em> your shots will hit its intended target <em>and</em> crit: Tracer Ammo. Wilds also makes it so the Bow never runs out of its damage-boosting or ailment-inflicting coatings, further increasing its damage potential. Finally, if you perfect your dodge timing, the Bow's Discerning Dodge replenishes your stamina so you almost never need to stop attacking! The Bow is mobile, strong, and its Focus Strike looks rad, what more could you ask for? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Remember, this is all just for reference, and we recommend sticking with your preferred weapon. For example, if you're skilled with the Light Bow Gun, knowing exactly where to aim with what ammo and dodging every monster attack, you're going to get better times than with the Great Sword if you keep whiffing your True Charged Slashes and can't time your Offset attacks consistently. Any weapon takes time to get good at! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What weapon do <em>you</em> think is the best in Monster Hunter Wilds?

There are also two customizable modes for the C and Z buttons, including a classic Dreamcast mode. It also uses 2.4 Ghz wireless technology via a dongle that can be inserted into a Dreamcast or other compatible devices. This makes it well-suited for fighting games on the Dreamcast, like Street Fighter Alpha 3, Soul Calibur, and Marvel vs Capcom 2.

While most of these reports are very dry with technical jargon, they do indicate that Switch 2 will support near field communication, or NFC, which is how the Amiibo figures were able to connect with Nintendo's previous console to unlock new in-game content. It's also been confirmed that the radio-frequency identification (RFID) feature is located in the right Joy-Con, just as it was in the first Switch. While that's not 100% confirmation that Amiibos will continue to be utilized with the Switch 2, it certainly seems likely that they will. </p><p>The FCC filings indicate that Switch 2 will support Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) networks with up to 80MHz of bandwidth. That's an upgrade from the original Switch's Wi-Fi 5 capabilities, but not as fast as Wi-Fi 6E or Wi-Fi 7. These reports also confirm that Switch 2 has two USB-C ports, one at the top and one at the bottom. The system can be charged through either of those ports.</p><p>A previously released Japanese patent application revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-patent-application-seems-to-confirm-switch-2-joy-con-feature/1100-6529310/" data-ref-id="1100-6529310">Switch 2's Joy-Cons will have mouse-like capabilities</a>.

It's not entirely clear what that means for Switch 2 yet, but hopefully more answers will be shared soon.</p>

            <p>
The battle to reboot Capcom's Resident Evil franchise for the big screen is over, and Sony has been crowned the victor. But while the ink may still be fresh on the deal, Sony's wasting no time: it's already confirmed its new Resident Evil movie hits cinemas on 18th September 2026.
</p>
<p>
Word of a Resident Evil movie reboot first surfaced back in January, with Zach Cregger - writer and director of 2022's wonderfully unpredictable Barbarian - attached to the project. At the time, four studios - including Warners Bros. and Netflix - were reportedly vying for the rights to the lucrative franchise, but Sony (as <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/resident-evil-zach-cregger-sony-release-date-1236313985/">relayed by Deadline</a>) has now won out.
</p>
<p>
The kerfuffle for Resident Evil is perhaps not especially surprising given previous live-action movie adaptations collectively generated a staggering $1.2bn at the box office. And Sony's interest is <em>particularly</em> not surprising, seeing as it was a major beneficiary of all that money under its previous deal to inflict Paul W. S. Anderson's Resident Evil films upon the masses.
</p>
<p>
And this isn't Sony's first attempt at a reboot either. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-resident-evil-movie-reboot-is-called-resident-evil-welcome-to-raccoon-city">also released 2021's underwhelming Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City</a> - but while the studio's track record with the franchise isn't exactly encouraging, there's at least some reason to be optimistic. The fact Cregger is onboard to write and direct is an intriguing proposition, especially given his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-movie-reboot-writer-zach-cregger-will-keep-adaptation-faithful-to-the-games">apparent keenness to keep his Resident Evil adaptation faithful to the games</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"I've been a rabid fan of these games for decades, and to be able to bring this amazing title to life is a true honor,” Cregger told Deadline following Sony's win. Constantin Film is producing and co-financing the movie, with PlayStation Productions also on board.
</p>
<p>
Will Sony's latest attempt at a reboot do justice to Capcom's esteemed - and let's be honest, utterly preposterous - survival horror series? With the next Resident Evil movie now pencilled in for a September 2026 release, we'll know soon enough.

            <title><![CDATA[Carmen Sandiego Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/carmen-sandiego-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/carmen-sandiego-review.1128729/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/carmen-sandiego-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Revisiting a game series from your youth is like exploring the basement in your childhood home. As you sift through the boxes and shelves, old memories come flooding back — which is exactly what happened as I started playing Carmen Sandiego, the latest game in a multimedia series that spans four decades. When the master thief appeared onscreen in her iconic trenchcoat and fedora, I was eight years old again, my face inches from a computer screen as I used my nascent knowledge of math, geography, and history to solve Carmen’s latest caper. 40 years later, Carmen Sandiego gives me that same thrill of solving puzzles by collecting clues, even if some of the modern additions to the visual novel-esque interface miss their mark.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As a former child gumshoe whose grasp of geography was gleaned from tracking down the world’s worst criminals as they scurried around the globe, I was more than ready to revisit the Carmen Sandiego-verse with the release of this eponymous new adventure from Gameloft. Though it takes some story cues from the animated Netflix series that wrapped up in 2021 — and emulates its cartoony visual style — it’s not necessary to know anything about Carmen’s backstory with the evil organization VILE to enjoy her latest quest. Significantly, this is the first time in the long-running series that players get to step into Carmen’s shoes and don her famous fedora, but it doesn’t make a real difference to the crook-hunting formula.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the series got its start as an edutainment game, modern Carmen Sandiego is a mix of puzzle-solving, quick-time events, a dash of third-person top-down exploration, and (of course!) the occasional trivia question. In some ways, the newer elements make the world feel bigger and more exciting than its early DOS iterations; there’s more to do than simply click on icons representing key locations, parse through dialogue, and answer questions that wouldn’t be out of place on a fifth-grade final exam. That said, I wouldn’t have missed new activities like hang-gliding and grappling from rooftop to rooftop if they weren’t included.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>In some ways, the newer elements make the world feel bigger and more exciting than its early DOS iterations.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As you follow VILE thieves from one country to the next, you’ll need to collect two types of clues: those that help them figure out where to go next, and those that help narrow down the list of suspects in the ACME detective agency’s database. In the ’80s and ’90s, Carmen Sandiego games relied on physical almanacs full of geographical and historical facts to help answer the in-game trivia questions and figure out what their clues meant. This time around, all of that information is kept within the game itself.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Carmen Sandiego - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout the campaign, you’ll find pieces of data like airport codes, exports, national languages, government structures, and more. This self-built almanac comes in handy when you’re on a VILE villain’s tail and need to decide what to do next. Typically, you’ll have a handful of clues to go by — a color or pattern on the flag, the spoken language, or whether residents drive on the left or right side of the road. You’ll use those clues to determine your next city from three provided choices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, you’ll use personal information to narrow down the criminal behind each caper. The reimagined ACME Database makes this process smooth and streamlined; you can easily filter out suspects based on details about their hair and eye colors, hobbies, favorite foods, and fears. It’s quite satisfying to whittle down a list of 30-something suspects until there’s only one remaining and issue a warrant for their arrest. Just make sure you have the right person, otherwise it’s game over for Carmen (and time to start over for you).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s quite satisfying to whittle down a list of 30-something suspects until there’s only one remaining.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Clues are found by exploring key spots throughout a variety of exotic locations around the globe, from New Orleans to Barcelona to Singapore to Brisbane, with a few stops in between. This is similar to how the early games worked, but there’s a bit more room for exploration and making choices this time around. In some places, Carmen gets to wander around, question multiple witnesses, and seek out local trivia that could come in handy later. You don’t get to choose which activities happen in which location, but there’s more action involved than there used to be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every case has several chapters with individual heists connected by an overarching villain. The cases start out at the scene of the crime, whether that crime is the theft of a Japanese bullet train, or the replacement of a city’s free Wi-Fi hotspots with paid “Vi-Fi” versions. In each city, you can visit three locations to collect clues that bring you one step closer to solving the case.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Mysteries Abound!</h3><p>Games that give your brain a workout.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s how it works in practice: As you visit each of the in-city landmarks and districts, such as Singapore’s Merlion statue, or a viking-themed museum in Reykjavik, you’ll need to complete pre-determined activities to uncover that location’s clues. Sometimes, that means walking around and questioning suspects and witnesses, often picking up some geographical fun facts along the way. Other times, you may have to complete a hacking or lock-picking puzzle or use Carmen’s hang glider or grappling hook.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of these gameplay elements are more fun than others. Completing puzzles to hack safes or boost wireless signals was satisfying, but the more physical activities are mostly on rails and not particularly thrilling. I have a particular beef with the grappling hook mini-game, which requires a simple button press as icons align on your screen. The problem is, those icons sometimes move erratically, so grappling is either way too simple or frustratingly obtuse. There’s also a hang-gliding activity that’s perfectly… fine, but I’d rather have fewer gameplay elements that are more fleshed out than some forced action that feels like filler. I would have been perfectly happy with more brain-teasers instead.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I would have been perfectly happy with more brain-teasers.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Though not as unforgiving as the 1985 iteration, it is possible to fail cases in Carmen Sandiego. The clock is always ticking. You typically have five or seven days to solve each case, and all of your activities take time — as does flying from one city to the next. If you missed a critical clue and ended up flying to Singapore when you’re supposed to be in Buenos Aires, you just wasted 11 hours. If you run out of time, the thief gets away and you have to start the case over. However, I never really felt the time crunch in the main campaign; I typically had at least a day left over, if not several.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are other ways to fail cases in Carmen Sandiego, and these represented more of a threat in my playthrough. If you’re pickpocketing a VILE lackey and get noticed, you’ve just missed out on a key piece of evidence. Missing one clue won’t blow your case, but do that a few times and you won’t have enough information to make an arrest. Most of the time, I could pinpoint the exact moment when I blew it — I was too slow when following a mark, I didn’t pay close enough attention to actions that required precise button presses. Other times, I found myself at the end with several suspects still in my database and no idea where I missed a clue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though I did make some mistakes, the main campaign isn’t exactly what I’d call challenging. But considering the series’ history as a children’s educational resource, I may not be the target audience. I could see parents and kids playing through Carmen Sandiego together and having a great time as children build critical thinking skills and parents brush up on elementary-school geography. And though it’s on the simpler side, Carmen Sandiego never feels dumbed down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For my fellow olds looking for more of a challenge, you’re in luck. Aside from the main campaign, you can explore the ACME Files for what we’re told are cold cases dating back to the ’80s. These cases have adopted the modern systems for filtering out suspects and jetting around the world, but they’re presented in a retro, pixel art style — and injected with questions that might make you feel like you’re back in school and your teacher just slapped a pop quiz on your desk. Quick, what’s the biggest island in the Caribbean? Which country was the biggest producer of wheat and rice back in 1985? What’s 4x13x80? (Thankfully, despite what my teachers told me, I do have a calculator in my pocket everywhere I go.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The ACME Files use a simplified interface that made me feel like I was back in front of my family computer in the early ’90s frantically paging through a physical book to find the answers. This time around, Google was my almanac. That might make the retro cases seem easier than those of the campaign, but they’re actually more difficult, particularly the time crunch. I actually did run out of time in the ACME Files, and watching those last few hours tick away filled me with a determination to do it better next time. Overall, these cases are a smart addition that add variety to the experience and provide some comforting fan service.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The historical cases pull from the same list of cities as the main campaign, and it’s only a few hours before you’ve seen everywhere in the world that Carmen Sandiego can visit. I’m not sure why they couldn’t have expanded her global reach in the main campaign, but it results in every environment feeling a bit repetitive after a while. Still, there are often new facts to find upon revisiting, so every city is always worth another look.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe it’s the nostalgia goggles, but none of these shortcomings bothered me enough to make me want to stop playing. Each chapter is paced really well, so it always feels like you’re making progress. I love games that make you think your way out of problems, and for the most part, that’s exactly what Carmen Sandiego demands of the player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a shame, however, that the campaign ends rather abruptly. There’s another caper coming in a free DLC release later this year, but it was jarring to gear up for the final mystery and see “Coming Soon” in the menu of a completed, publicly released game. The story doesn’t feel like it’s reached a natural conclusion yet, but there’s still a good 15 hours of content between the campaign and the ACME Files — even more if you complete all of the cold cases from way back when. After my initial confusion, I took this as an opportunity to explore more old cases and await the day when I can complete Carmen’s adventure.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Both Monster Hunter Stories games are 30-40 hours, on the low end, and the plethora of optional content can double those figures.</p><div title="6521793 - Monster Hunter Stories Double Pack preorder guide" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2287" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6521793 - Monster Hunter Stories Double Pack preorder guide" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CXW2C84K?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CXW2C84K?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CXW2C84K?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Monster Hunter Stories Collection</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CXW2C84K?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0CXW2C84K?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CXW2C84K?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$33.55 (was $60)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Monster Hunter Stories Collection's release coincided with the standalone launch of the enhanced port of the original game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/monopoly-app-banking-ditches-play-money-for-digital-play-banking<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hasbro has announced yet another new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/monopoly-hasbro-100th-anniversary-edition-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Monopoly</em></a> board game. The latest take on the iconic game, Monopoly App Banking, is a radical departure from prior versions. It replaces paper play money with a Play Bank card and a smartphone app.</p>

<h2>The <em>Monopoly App Banking</em> board game announcement</h2>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/623716/hasbro-monopoly-app-banking-board-game-availability" rel="nofollow">The Verge</a>, <em>Monopoly App Banking</em> attempts to simplify gameplay by replacing the cash and banker with a free mobile app that handles all in-game transactions. Each player gets a token and a matching bank card. This card and any associated property cards, are scanned by the mobile app to automate transactions.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monopoly-app-banking-board-artwork.jpg?itok=wtHTuvaC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monopoly-app-banking-board-artwork.jpg?itok=36IHePe5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In addition, <em>Monopoly App Banking</em> makes some changes to the original game board. Valuable properties like Park Place and Boardwalk are replaced with chocolate factories, VR rollercoasters, and dinosaur parks. Lastly, the app will contain mini-games that can be played to earn perks. According to the report, this is to help "hold the attention of younger players."</p>

<p>On paper, <em>Monopoly App Banking</em> is an attempt to bring its gameplay in line with a modern audience. The original experience is getting <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-has-big-plans-for-monopoly-in-2025-including-new-box-and-official-expansions" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official expansions</a> after all. However, the game is getting pushback from parents. As the New York Post highlights, parents use Monopoly as a teaching tool for their kids. The play money helps them understand basic math and fiscal responsibility..</p>

<p>Furthermore, the locations on the board being changed from conventional real estate into more fanciful properties has drawn some ire. Not only will kids not learn math or simple banking lessons, it is in service of buying not real-world investments like property but indulgent distractions like chocolate or amusement parks.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is the issue of technology being implemented into the board game. Certain board games are treated as an alternate for screen time with children. This new version of <em>Monopoly</em> not only requires it for play, it contains additional distractions with mini-games.</p>

<p><em>Monopoly App Banking</em> will be available this August at an MSRP of $24.99. The associated mobile app is free to download.</p>
