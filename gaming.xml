            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> developers FromSoftware are planning to release some DLC for the action RPG by March 2026. That's according the latest financial report of FromSoft parent company Kadokawa, which has attached a window to the add-on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Nightreign</a>'s promo material had already hinted would be in the pipeline.</p>
<p>Call out to the people who're deep in the night of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-deep-of-night-is-nigh-so-heres-a-big-patch-with-more-balancing-tweaks-than-a-tightrope-walker">Nightreign's last addition</a> so they hear. Tell them to scrabble around for a light switch so they can read the info. Remind them not to accidentally fondle a big boss as they paw along the walls. Actually, I'm sure they'll remember that anyway, since it's s-oh no.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We'll have to start without them. As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-performed-well-beyond-initial-expectations-fromsoftware-parent-company-says-and-dlc-could-take-it-even-further/">GamesRadar</a>, flip to page 16 of the <a href="https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/9468/ir_material_for_fiscal_ym13/190133/00.pdf">report's presentation</a>, which covers the six month period that ended on September 30th.</p>
<p>"FromSoftware is currently developing ELDEN RING NIGHTREIGN DLC (planned for release in FY2025), ELDEN RING Tarnished Edition (planned for release in 2026 for Nintendo Switch 2), and The Duskbloods (planned for release in 2026)," reads the future outlook section. While it'd be cool if The Duskbloods does end up migrating from Switch to PC in time, the Nightreign DLC's the only bit of that which is relevant to us PC folks right now.</p>
<p>Kadokawa's 2024 fiscal year ended on March 31st this year, so we can expect this Nightreign DLC out by March 31st, 2026. That's assuming everything goes to plan, with the company leaving some delay wiggle room here.</p>
<p>As to what'll be in the DLC, extra playable Nightfarers and bosses seem pretty certain. Beyond that, things get a bit more mysterious, especially given the potential for FromSoftware to lean on bosses from previous Souls games. Given the DLC has a bit more riding on it than the likes of that free <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreigns-evil-deep-of-night-mode-gets-a-release-date-but-some-people-are-already-playing-it">Deep of the Night update</a>, I'd be fairly surprised not to see new locales or modes to further spice up the loop of killing whichever new bosses arrive alongside some new boss-beater.</p><p>Maybe they'll add in a map based around Newcastle city centre, and the new bosses are large black-and-white-shirted revellers who bellow 'toon' whenever you get close. You could stick a poison swamp next to Eldon Square, it'd be brill. That's what my fingers are crossed for as the wait for next March begins.</p>

			<p>It makes me so happy to know that the Tales of 30th Anniversary project is a thing. For such a prolific JRPG franchise, so many of the games are either inaccessible on modern hardware, exclusive to Japan, or both. Seeing Bandai Namco put such a serious foot forward in remastering multiple classic entries in the series is incredible, and even more so considering the great entries they’ve chosen to remaster so far.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/15/tales-of-graces-f-remastered-review/">Tales of Graces f Remastered</a>&nbsp;earlier this year was a delight, and now it’s being followed up by&nbsp;Tales of Xillia Remastered – a gorgeous PS3-era chapter in the series that I finally get a chance to dig deeper into.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tales of Xillia Remastered - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fd0VM2d3JNU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While seeing this game’s cover while browsing game shops always piqued my curiosity, back in the day, it never made its way into my collection, so I dived into this remaster blind. The game opens with what is probably the most unfairly skewed protagonist choice I’ve encountered in a game. You’re shown two brief cutscenes, and then asked to pick which character from those scenes you want to continue the story of – Milla or Jude. The problem is that Milla’s scene is pretty vague, showing her sitting in a temple and muttering something about “the spirits leaving” before attacking a ghostly snake and walking away. Jude, meanwhile, immediately presented me with the most fascinating story setup I’ve ever seen in a traditional JRPG. He’s a busy med-student in a huge, bustling medical school – the idea of a medical school in the middle of a fantastical JRPG world of swords and magic immediately lit up my eyes.</p>



<p>I was quick to choose Jude, but the other wrinkle with this choice is that it ultimately doesn’t alter the game all that much. Jude and Milla’s paths intertwine early on, and they end up spending a vast majority of Tales of Xillia Remastered adventuring together as they try to restore the balance between modern society and the ancient mana that fuels it all. The two heroes split up from time to time, but only for brief moments, so while the solo scenes I got with Jude were incredible, I never felt like I was missing any important information by not witnessing what Milla was up to in those moments.</p>

<p>Despite originally being a PS3 game, Tales of Xillia Remastered is downright gorgeous. The game already had breath-taking visual design, with vividly colored environments and beautifully modelled characters, and the smooth frame rate and upgraded resolution of this remaster only serves to further elevate those already incredible visuals. It doesn’t totally register as a modern game, though – a lot of cutscene animations are a little stiff in that classic way. Still, I think there’s a lot of charm to that, and it’s nice to be able to experience a game from it’s era but bundled with the quality of life you’d expect from a modern release.</p>

<p>Combat in the Tales series has always been a highlight for me, and Tales of Xillia Remastered is no slouch in that department. The real-time combo-heavy battles here are a blast, and I really enjoy the more open-ended approach to upgrades and skill progression this game has. There’s a huge emphasis on using skill points to unlock new ablities across a massive web of upgrades, and you can approach it in any order you like. On top of giving you more freedom to customize a single characters build, the character-link system in this game lets certain characters chain together their Artes mid-battle meaning that customising your crew to synergise properly is really important. That link system also adds a sort of rhythm-game quality to combat that I adored. Timing and flow are key, but your AI partners will trigger their linked abilities automatically, meaning it’s less of a mechanical or input-heavy challenge and more about focus and smart character swapping.</p>
<p>While the amount of bonus costume content and customizable soundtrack options packed into Tales of Xillia Remastered are a treat, one bonus I wish was handled differently is the Grade Shop. This is a menu that lets you redeem points to unlock cheat-code enhancers for your playthrough to increase money gained, XP gained, double damage, and more boosts of the sort. These are fun tools to use for making subsequent playthroughs or challenging sections of the game a breeze, but the issue here is that this is the very first thing you see upon starting a new playthrough. Without any context for the game or time spent playing it, it feels weird to be presented with this massive cheat menu, especially when so many of them warn that they can’t be disabled once applied. I would have appreciated this menu being tucked away somewhere in the actual game, and not so front-loaded.</p>

<p>Despite that Grade Shop hiccup, Tales of Xillia Remastered is an incredible game and a wonderful remaster. It only makes me more excited to see which entries in the series get this treatment next, because so far, Bandai Namco has done an incredible job of giving these nearly-forgotten JRPGs a second lease at life.</p>

			<p>Halo Studios has confirmed that Halo: Infinite will receive one final update next week, after which the team will move on. The primary goal will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-remake-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-pc-xbox-ps5-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>, a remake of the 2001 game's campaign, powered by Unreal Engine 5 and slated for launch next year. However, the developers have confirmed that there are actually multiple Halo projects in development; <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-2-3-remakes-in-the-works-halo-7-multiplayer-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to rumors</a>, they might be remaking the campaigns of the second and third installments while also working on the next mainline entry.</p>



<p>The final Halo: Infinite update, titled Operation: Infinite, is scheduled to go live on November 18. To begin with, the developers are giving a 2x boost to the earning rate for both Career Rank and Spartan Points (SP) across all matchmaking playlists. This will make it easier to reach the max level and unlock the coveted Mark VI armor kit, the same one worn by the Master Chief in the game's campaign.</p>



<p>The update also introduces a free 100-tier Operation Pass and a 100-tier Premium Pass, both with no expiration date planned. The free Pass unlocks three new armor sets (Serpin, Seeker, Adamant), as well as coatings, visors, and stances. The Premium Pass, on the other hand, lets players unlock five additional unique armor sets (Artificer, Seedwarden, Kobold, Phoenix, First Vanguard), six weapon models, and over thirty exclusive customizations. Instant unlocks for the Premium tier include the Charged Quill Shock Rifle model and Phoenix Gold weapon coating.</p>



<p>Halo Studios also added over 200 never-before-released customization items to The Exchange, such as armor pieces, attachments, coatings, charms, and visors. Items from all previous Operations, Events, and Fractures will be available here alongside commemorative Halo 5: Guardians bundles.</p>



<p>A new festive map called Yuletide will be found in the Quick Play playlist, and a new asymmetrical map, Vacancy, is being added to the Ranked Arena, Ranked Slayer, Ranked Doubles, and select ranked rotational playlists. More Ranked Seasons are on their way and will be reset every few months, allowing the best players to claim exclusive Spartan customizations. Moreover, while Operation: Infinite is the final Halo: Infinite update, players can still look forward to a rotating selection of Daily and Weekly Challenges that offer a variety of ways to level up their Career Rank, progress through Operation Passes, and earn Spartan Points (SP). For more info, you can rewatch the Community Livestream embedded below.</p>

<p>Halo: Infinite launched in December 2021 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/halo-infinite-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to a positive reception</a>. The game's free-to-play multiplayer initially garnered acclaim among fans, but the lackluster post-launch support eventually exhausted their excitement.</p>

            <p>November goes on. The cavalcade of belles, brutes and barons that is Videogaming continues its push through the midnight forest. Spiderwebs wrap the axles of the gala coaches in which the optimates of Ubisoft, Microsoft and EA drink from lavender flutes, turning their bloodshot eyes from the QA staff powering their barrows through the ruck. The faces of the common developers are a moth-eaten ribbon of quiet striving and terrible hope. The guards form a torchlit embroidery. Every so often, a torch goes out, and the wych elms generate new fruits. The stones in the road cant against our strides. The skulls of live service games burst beneath our wheels, and the analysts in the pageant wagons moan that the future lies behind us now.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Then, the woods withdraw and we emerge among flowering graves and fallen buttresses - the remnants of a church. The wagons circle and cooking fires spring up in the transepts, as our scouts contemplate the way forward. Five onward roads fan out from a rotten signpost, each named for a day of the week. Some assuredly lead to disaster. The scouts converse in hisses and, failing to agree, turn to you for instructions. Which day do we choose? Which route is safe?
</p>
<h2>Monday 10th November</h2>
<p>The skies above this path appear to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ambrosia-sky">drip ambrosia</a>, the food of the gods, and yet the splashed soil beneath revolts with fungus. The birds creasing the frail sunlight are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3809940/Drill_Bird/">drill-tipped</a> and the clouds appear <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305210/Skyformer/">very changeable</a>. Our wayfinders murmur of a distant <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4122860/ZATO__I_Love_the_World_and_Everything_In_It/">closed city</a> and an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3609980/Yes_My_Queen/">imprisoned queen</a>.
</p>
<h2>Tuesday 11th November</h2>
<p>Even as we study this road, our oldest scout - a one-eyed woman in furs with a staff twice her height - is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/possessors">possessed</a> by the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3906660/Sacred_2_Remaster/">spirits</a> of prog rockers, roused from the neglected graveyard. She regresses to a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2416100/Goodnight_Universe/">state of infancy</a>, capable only of chanting "all in all, you're just another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lumines-arise">block</a> in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3467710/Wall_World_2/">wall</a>."</p>
<h2>Wednesday 12th November</h2>
<p>A hard, bare road, and yet the banks are riddled with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008740/Winter_Burrow/">burrows</a> (pictured) that appear surprisingly welcoming, with postage stamp doormats and tinklesome chimneys. The ghosts of Pink Floyd abandon your moon-touched scout. Regaining her senses, she talks cryptically of a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2555950/Million_Depth/">million layers beneath</a> where swords fly and time stands still.</p>
<h2>Thursday 13th November</h2>
<p>This road is heavily torn and depleted by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assetto-corsa-rally-aims-to-fill-a-colin-mcrae-shaped-void-and-its-out-in-early-access-next-month">curious wheelmarks</a> that speak of some great contest, beyond the ken of our wagoneers. Their chevronned textures overlap to form the impression - or is it more than fancy? - of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3255860/Hymer_2000/">wide eyes and chattering mouths</a>.</p>
<h2>Friday 14th November</h2>
<p>Goblin <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3564740/Where_Winds_Meet/">winds</a> tussle for dominion of this road, but we should perhaps be more worried about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">the muzzle glints and skullfaces</a> that populate the bushes. Sensing your consternation, the scouts propose that we break for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2976880/Tea_for_Sana/">tea</a>.</p>
<p>Does this monstrous forest have an outside? There are rumours up and down the train that this is the final November, that the woods are expanding faster than we can travel through them, that the Maw's latest eruption will be endless. Still, keep going. Think no further than the next footfall and the comrades at your elbow. Also, pls share any images, videos or literature you may know of that concern spooky forests. I am reaching the end of my supply of synonyms for "root".</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> has received a selection of new map conditions that are mixing up the typical experience significantly for players. As part of these new conditions, an underground bunker on Spaceport has been introduced, with a mysterious puzzle that still appears unsolved.</p>
<p>First introduced over the weekend the three major map condition additions are night raids for Blue Gate, Electromagnetic Storms (across Dam Battleground, Spaceport, and Blue Gate), plus the Hidden Bunker on Spaceport. You can also now see the Harvester event on the Blue Gate map, which previously was locked to Dam Battlegrounds.</p>
<p>Now, all of these are cool, but the Hidden Bunker is the particularly intriguing one. This event requires several antennas to be turned on across the map by players, which in turn opens doors in the South West portion of the map.</p>

</figure>
<p>There's good loot in this bunker, sure. However, more intriguingly are data upload terminals and other odd objects that have a portion of the community certain that there's more to find in the Hidden Bunker. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orwml1/hidden_bunker_mega_thread/">A Reddit Megathread on the Arc Raiders Hidden Bunker</a> started picking apart the bunker, pointing out strange machines and wiring spread across the bunker with seemingly no purpose.</p><p>As for the data terminals, people also believed that there was more to this part of the bunker. However, it's worth noting that as of this morning there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-trials-are-the-perfect-way-to-do-ranked-in-extraction-shooters#:~:text=Rather%20than%20some%20kill%2Dfocused,world%2C%20or%20even%20gathering%20plants!">a weekly trial</a> for data uploads, so it's entirely possible that all they're for is a nice bump in XP when used and weekly challenges.</p>
<p>Whether or not players will uncover more secrets in the Hidden Bunker is something to keep an eye on. Meanwhile,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-breaks-another-concurrent-record-as-player-count-soars"> Arc Raiders broke yet another concurrent player record last weekend</a>, showing continuing growth post-release and remaining at the top of Steam's top playing charts.</p>

<p>"I won't look anymore!"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="142703ed0cc7e"><a title="Miyamoto" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/142703ed0cc7e/miyamoto.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JApUMBscKOc">Nintendo</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>It's no secret that Shigeru Miyamoto has taken a bit of a backseat when it comes to game development. The last Mario game he personally oversaw as director was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/super_mario_run">Super Mario Run</a>, and after his most recent experience as general producer on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a>, the creator has largely shifted over to the world of movies.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://casabrutus.com/magazines/issue/no308">Casa Brutus</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/its-going-to-be-fun-miyamoto-discusses-mario-galaxy-movie-and-the-future-of-mario-games/">VGC</a>), Miyamoto hints toward taking even further steps away from game development. He states that while Nintendo currently has other developers leading the charge on new Mario titles, he nevertheless endeavours to play them and deliver feedback on the overall interface.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Nowadays, I have teammates who help maintain the world of Mario, so I entrust much of it to them. Even so, I always personally play through about the first 30 minutes of the game and check the interface thoroughly — to make sure it really feels like Mario.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He then – perhaps jokingly – hints that he may not even do this in the future and simply leave everything to his colleagues, before expressing his wish to remain healthy until Mario's inevitable 50th anniversary in ten years' time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Up through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, I feel we’ve done just about everything we could on the Switch. In the past, whenever a new console came out, we always released a new Mario game, so I do wonder how the current team will take on that challenge.</p>
<p>“But maybe I’ll say, ‘I won’t look anymore!’ (laughs) I just hope to stay healthy until Mario’s 50th anniversary!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Discussion also turns to the upcoming <strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>, which Miyamoto states is in the "final stages of production" while expressing the opinion that "it’s going to be fun". Only time will tell, but the movie's introduction of Yoshi was recently revealed prematurely thanks to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/images-of-yoshi-from-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-have-leaked-online">a product listing from none other than US baking firm Pillsbury</a>.</p>
<p>The movie officially launches on <strong>3rd April 2026</strong>, and it's said that a trailer will debut later this month and play before screenings for <strong>Wicked: For Good</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Obsidian's classic RPG Fallout: New Vegas is about to get an influx of players, to be sure. The second season of the critically acclaimed Fallout TV show will be available on Amazon Prime Video <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-season-2-lands-december-17-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">starting on Wednesday, December 17</a>, and its setting is indeed New Vegas, as the main characters pursue the traitorous former overseer of Vault 33, Hank MacLean, toward the city. Since the show takes place fifteen years after the events seen in Fallout: New Vegas, those who have never experienced the masterpiece game would do well to play it before the TV show airs.</p>



<p>Just in case you need further incentive, a new graphics mod has just been released, and a quest mod will launch a few days before the TV show's second season. The graphics mod, called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/94521?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perfect Skies</a>, was created by doodlum, the main coder behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-gets-true-pbr-with-community-shaders-1-0/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim's Community Shaders</a>. </p>



<p>The modder calls this 'the ultimate clouds mod' and explains that the default game and previous mods previously used clouds from real-world pictures. Perfect Skies, on the other hand, uses computer-generated clouds, avoiding issues such as pixelation and other visual artifacts. Moreover, doodlum developed a proprietary cloud baking system and boasts that it is more advanced than the one featured in Fallout 4 (which launched four years after Fallout: New Vegas and is celebrating its tenth anniversary <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-all-dlc-creation-club-content-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a new edition that comes out today</a>). Perfect Skies features 30 unique cloud variations and 60 4K textures, making up nearly 1GB of cloud textures. That said, the textures are compressed, so the file size is only 220MB.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The quest mod is called Fallout: Long 15 and takes the player character into NCR territory, entering California through Interstate 15. According to the modding team (which already <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/88180" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released a similar mod</a> for the Legion faction called Dry Wells), Long 15 features a huge new worldspace, complete with new quests, factions, and towns. The modders, who have a Patreon <a href="https://www.patreon.com/TheLong15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">page</a>, aim to launch Long 15 on Friday, December 12. A new story trailer will go live between late November and early December.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-10-883/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-883-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-monday-november-10.1348438/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s a whole new week, and that means we can kickstart the next seven days by smashing today’s NYT Connections puzzle. Today’s trickery isn’t too tough to contend with, but that doesn’t mean you don’t want to walk away with the best NYT Connections hints and solutions, courtesy of Insider Gaming.</p>



<p>Read on to get the full list of NYT Connections hints and solutions for today’s puzzle.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-10">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 10)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #883:</p>



<ul>
<li>SINE</li>



<li>CLEAR</li>



<li>PRO</li>



<li>SQUARE</li>



<li>SAW</li>



<li>AB</li>



<li>I</li>



<li>TRIANGLE</li>



<li>BELL</li>



<li>CAME</li>



<li>DRUM</li>



<li>PAY</li>



<li>SUB</li>



<li>SETTLE</li>



<li>RATTLE</li>



<li>CONQUERED</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em><em>Strike up the band!</em> These make noise when hit, shaken, or rattled.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>Financial closure.</em> These words all signal that what’s owed is no longer owed.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em><em>A swift conquest.</em> These four words form a legendary declaration of victory.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em><em>Prepositions from the past.</em> These short words helped Romans express direction, cause, and relation.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 10.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-10-883">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 10 (#883)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– BELL, DRUM, RATTLE, TRIANGLE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – CLEAR, PAY, SETTLE, SQUARE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – CAME, CONQUERED, I, SAW</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – AB, PRO, SINE, SUB</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

<p>ARC Raiders is a stunning, post-apocalyptic extraction shooter with immense potential. It has become one of 2025’s most successful games and is, by numbers, the best-received extraction shooter ever made. In this guide, we’re looking at a portion of the game’s post-launch support model and determining when the next ARC Raiders season and Raider Deck are set to arrive.</p>



<p>If you’re waiting for more free rewards in ARC Raiders via the Raider Deck, read on to find out when it’s coming to the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-new-raider-deck-coming-to-arc-raiders">When is the New Raider Deck Coming to ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p><strong>The next Raider Deck will unlock in ARC Raiders in December alongside the Cold Snap update</strong>. This update is set to bring a new map condition called Snowfall, introduce a special event called Flickering Flames, close the Expedition window, <strong>and </strong>introduce new quests.</p>



<p>This supersized update will be free to download and enjoy, with Embark Studios delivering on the promise to support this game for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>If the Raider Deck is anything like the current Raider Deck, it’ll be something special for players to chase.</p>



<p>To level up through the Raider Deck, you need to complete Feats to unlock ‘blue’ credits, which can then be applied to the pages bursting with rewards in the Raider Deck tab on the main menu. You’ll need to unlock a certain amount on one page before unlocking the next page, but it takes no time at all, as Feats are constantly refreshing as you complete them.</p>



<p>In the Raider Deck, you’ll find everything from hairstyles to outfits, and from boxes full of loot to Raider Credits. There’s a lot to unlock, which is brilliant, considering you’re not paying a penny for what’s contained in the Raider Deck.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Despite ARC Raiders having been on the market for more than <strong>ten days</strong>, the game is still surpassing expectations and climbing on certain platforms. Hours ago, the post-apocalyptic extraction shooter managed to secure a new record on Steam, climbing to a peak of 462,488 players, beating the previous high of 416,517.</p>



<p>The constantly climbing peak is indicative of the quality of this game. The smash hit from Embark Studios continues to turn heads worldwide, and millions of players are flooding the accessible, welcoming platform.</p>







<p>ARC Raiders isn’t your typical extraction shooter. For starters, it’s a third-person shooter with heavy social aspects, and it’s designed to ideally be treated as a PvE game in <strong>many ways</strong>. It has been soaring up the charts since dropping on October 30, and it shows absolutely no signs of slowing down.</p>



<p>Yesterday, the game hit a peak user count of 416,517 on Steam, but in recent hours, that peak has climbed further to 462,488 players. It’s bucking trends, but this multiplayer-only shooter is getting stronger over time, rather than the player count inevitably dying out.</p>



<p>In terms of the record books, ARC Raiders has now beaten Helldivers 2, Sons of the Forest, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, GTA 5, and Starfield. It’s on the cusp of topping Call of Duty, Fallout 4, and Terraria.</p>



<p>This is likely because ARC Raiders still isn’t completely understood by the wider gaming community, and as these users are having their eyes opened to the game’s potential, they’re finding their way into the game.</p>



<p>Embark Studios recently revealed a stunning roadmap for ARC Raiders that promises to keep the game stoked for the time being, but the team has suggested it wants to support ARC Raiders for <strong>a decade</strong>, which is almost unheard of in this business.</p>



<p>Have you started playing ARC Raiders yet? Let me know what you think about the game on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Mirage’s Valley of Memory update is a supersized overhaul that comes with a stack of Trophies and Achievements that you can unlock <strong>for free</strong>. It’s a sizeable expansion that takes players to an all-new region of the 2023 open-world title, presenting them with a splinter story that Ubisoft isn’t charging a penny for.</p>



<p>In this guide, learn how to unlock all Assassin’s Creed Mirage: Valley of Memory Trophies and Achievements.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-assassin-s-creed-mirage-valley-of-memory-trophies-amp-achievements">All Assassin’s Creed Mirage: Valley of Memory Trophies &amp; Achievements</h2>



<p>Fans were surprised when Ubisoft announced Valley of Memory so far after launch, as Assassin’s Creed Mirage received very little in the way of updates after launch, save for the typical New Game+ kind of content.</p>



<p>Here’s the full list of Trophies and Achievements in Assassin’s Creed Mirage: Valley of Memory:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Trophy &amp; Achievement Name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Lost and Found</strong></td><td>Return all stolen goods to Hind</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Once Upon a Time</strong></td><td>Listen to all folktales</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pro Musician</strong></td><td>Collect all Oud melodies</td></tr><tr><td><strong>If I Recall Correctly</strong></td><td>Replay an Animus Sequence</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Perfect Memory</strong></td><td>Complete all sequence challenges</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Playback</strong></td><td>Unlock all Animus Sequence rewards</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Taste Your Own Medicine</strong></td><td>Poison a Poisoner</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Like a Local</strong></td><td>Complete all the AlUla territories</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Make a Break</strong></td><td>Escape the AlUla prison</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Turn the Page</strong></td><td>Say goodbye to Is’haq</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Give it the Slip</strong></td><td>Escape the AlUla prison undetected</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p>It’s not a huge list, but considering Valley of Memory is a completely free expansion, it’s a decent list of Trophies and Achievements to chase. Fans were mostly surprised that Ubisoft decided to tack this expansion onto Assassin’s Creed Mirage, which is more than two years old at this point.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Mirage: Valley of Memory will be released as a free-to-download update on all platforms on November 18. Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’ll be playing the new expansion.</p>

<p>Find out if the Switch game you want to play is compatible</p>

<p>Since the launch of the Switch 2 in June, Nintendo has released game upgrades, updates, and system firmware patches to make more games compatible with its new hybrid system.</p>
<p>It's not always been the easiest to keep track of every update, and to help make this process a little easier, a new website has now gone live.</p>
<p>It allows you to check the compatibility of Switch software on the Nintendo Switch 2. It's as simple as <a href="https://switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com/en-US">typing a Switch game into the search bar</a>, and it will reveal if it's "supported" or not. Nintendo also notes how search results include both physical and digital versions of software.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067iugwyt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>This search functionality extends to apps, and each search may or may not include additional information such as recent patches. Other searches will result in "incompatible" or "unsupported" as you can see in the screenshots below - with Nintendo even acknowledging specific issues.</p>
<p>So, instead of having to refer to the official PDFs or other search methods on Nintendo's website, you can now simply enter the game title in the search bar and find out if the software you want to play is compatible on the Switch 2.</p>

<p>When Nintendo initially revealed Switch game compatibility for the Switch 2, it mentioned at the time how not every game would be supported at launch, but explained how the work to make more games compatible was ongoing.</p>
<p>This new search page means you can now regularly check the status of games that may not yet be compatible with the Switch 2 and see if there are any updates.</p>

What if we could dream it together?</p><p><em>Reverie in the Moonlight</em> is an action game where, with the help of your stuffed animals, you try to defend yourself from the monsters attacking you night after night.</p><p><strong>Nightly Visits</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Little Tete’s nights are restless. His dreams are full of horrible monsters attacking him. But then, one night, he meets <a title="Platforms > Luna [68 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/cloud/luna">Luna</a>, and she teaches him how to use his plushies to defend himself.</p><p><strong>Cute But Strong</strong></p><p>When faced with a monster, Tete can only do one thing: run away. His plushies, however, can actually fight and defeat monsters. Different animals play different roles, with some focusing on short-range attacks, some on long-range shots, and some on supporting their allies. There are 40 types to choose from, so find your favorites and help them protect Tete from the monsters.</p><ul><li><strong>Ham Jr.</strong> – Runs left and right, hitting monsters that get too close with a stick.</li><li><strong>Snoozy-G</strong> – Enjoys sleeping, napping, and resting. Monsters that hit it are slowed down for a while.</li><li><strong>Striped Angel</strong> – When it sees someone in trouble, it always wants to help. It heals Tete up from a distance.</li></ul><p><strong>Collect and Strategize</strong></p><p>After the monsters’ attack is over, you can shop with the gold you found. You can get new plushies and even buy special items that can make you stronger. Some of them will also give you new weaknesses, so it’s up to you to strategize and prepare for the next attack in the best way possible. There are more than 100 items in the game… Will you be able to collect them all?</p><p><strong>Change Clothes to Change Strategies</strong></p><p>So, you’ve played the game’s story to the end. Well done. But this is just the start!</p><p>You can change Tete’s clothes, choosing from more than 20 costumes. Each one makes him stronger in some ways and weaker in others. If you want to help Tete defeat his nightmares, you’ll have to find the right plushies and items to go with each costume!</p><ul><li><strong>Moonlight Wizard</strong> – Plushies with long-range attacks become stronger, but Tete can only use those. Defending yourself becomes harder, so you’ll have to defeat monsters before they can get close.</li><li><strong>Nap Cloud</strong> – Increasing attack power becomes difficult, but plushies that don’t move around attack twice as fast. Try to find as many stationary friends as you can.</li><li><strong>Doggy Friend</strong> – Tete can only use dog plushies. If you want to win, you’ll need to make good use of their fast respawn speed.</li></ul></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/reverie-in-the-moonlight-launches-november-25]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><em>November 9, 2025 marks the 15-year anniversary of Call of Duty: Black Ops' release. Below, we look at how it departed from previous Call of Duty campaigns and defined developer Treyarch’s contributions to the franchise going forward.</em></p><p dir="ltr">During the infancy of Activision's Call of Duty franchise, Treyarch was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/03/19/the-other-call-of-duty" rel="nofollow ">the other Call of Duty studio</a>. Comparisons between Treyarch and series creator Infinity Ward were common on internet forums, and a general sentiment among fans and <a href="https://www.vg247.com/ea-partners-boss-acti-has-blown-up-infinity-wards-talent-ea-in-this-game-to-win" rel="nofollow ">even some industry figures</a> was that the former was the franchise's "B-team."</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch's 2006 game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-3-review/1900-6161282/">Call of Duty 3</a> was a competent World War II shooter, but it was quickly overshadowed the following year by Infinity Ward's Modern Warfare--a downright revolutionary game that set a new standard for first-person shooter campaigns and online multiplayer modes. Treyarch's subsequent game, 2008's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-world-at-war-review/1900-6201010/">World at War</a>, threw the series back in time and mostly played like a World War II re-skin of Modern Warfare.</p><p dir="ltr">In 2010, Treyarch made a sharp turn with Call of Duty: Black Ops, shifting the studio--and the franchise as a whole--toward an entirely new direction.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4598898-1613wmd_frags_global.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598898" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="5120" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4598898-1613wmd_frags_global.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598898"></a><figcaption>The twisty story of Call of Duty: Black Ops jumped between different points of time and perspectives.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4598898-1613wmd_frags_global.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For the first time, Call of Duty ventured into a new historical period, with the Cold War era offering Treyarch several thematic and storytelling opportunities to explore. Rather than telling another boots-on-the-ground story of soldiers in the trenches, Treyarch opted to craft a complex espionage thriller, breaking conventions that previous games in the series established.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike the usual passive and silent protagonists in Call of Duty, Black Ops' Alex Mason was fully voiced, and the campaign centered entirely on his personal journey. Mason faced Fidel Castro and John F. Kennedy--unusual for the series at that point, which avoided depicting real-life historical figures.</p><p dir="ltr">The bulk of the nonlinear story of Black Ops (which is technically a World at War sequel) focuses on Mason attempting to piece together his scattered memories, a result of brainwashing by the game's villains. We see his distorted perspective on events, placing us in the role of an unreliable protagonist, and it's unclear through his eyes what's real and what isn't--for once in Call of Duty, we as the player question the reality of what we see through the main character's eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">As GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-review/1900-6283818/">Black Ops review</a> described, "The blurry edges of your consciousness conceal information that must come to light, and the erratic visual effects and eerie audio echoes that accompany your interrogations sometimes bleed into your mission memories, which creates a great tone of uncertainty that plays out in surprising and satisfying ways."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4598896-1596black_ops_ak47.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598896" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="5120" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4598896-1596black_ops_ak47.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598896"></a><figcaption>One noteworthy new setting that Black Ops brought to Call of Duty was the jungles of Vietnam.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4598896-1596black_ops_ak47.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The narrative shifts between different characters, taking us through sequences like a bloody prison break from a gulag and brutal missions in the jungles of Vietnam, weaving an intricate story of paranoia and political intrigue. Plot twists are abundant, and all threads eventually converge for an explosive finale.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops takes the Michael Bay action movie sensibilities of Infinity Ward's Modern Warfare campaigns while fitting them into the molds of political thrillers like The Manchurian Candidate. Previous Call of Duty games drew clear visual inspirations from World War II movies such as Saving Private Ryan and Enemy at the Gates. Similarly, Black Ops took notes from Vietnam War films, including Apocalypse Now and Platoon, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIa2OEmb0v0">one sequence essentially lifting</a> the famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCW9NsrV6VM">Russian roulette scene from The Deer Hunter</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">But despite its setting and the incorporation of real-life figures, Black Ops lacks a meaningful message about Cold War politics. It offers no critiques or insight on the powerful people pulling the strings--John F. Kennedy is just the guy who gives you your mission, and Fidel Castro is a "bad guy" for you to kill. And the story doesn't engage with the atrocities of the Vietnam War--instead, the Vietnam setting is just another opportunity for you to shoot nameless expendables.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4598895-john_kennedy_at_table.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598895" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4598895-john_kennedy_at_table.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598895"></a><figcaption>Despite including President John F. Kennedy as a character, Black Ops has nothing to say about him or any real-life politicians.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4598895-john_kennedy_at_table.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The campaign, which includes story contributions from The Dark Knight writer David S. Goyer, is filled with gratuitous violence, over-the-top slow-motion action, and idiotic clichéd moments like a character <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1fCv475ilw">dramatically donning his sunglasses indoors</a> before an electric guitar riff plays. It is ultimately a thrilling theme park ride themed on the 1960s, with historical figures as its animatronic figures to sell the illusion.</p><p dir="ltr">Even so, the Black Ops campaign was a bold shift for Treyarch and the Call of Duty series. While Infinity Ward and fellow Call of Duty studio Sledgehammer Games have jumped around different subseries and stories within the franchise, Treyarch has stuck to the Black Ops storyline ever since, launching its seventh Black Ops entry this month.</p><p dir="ltr">With each subsequent Black Ops game, Treyarch doubled down on the twist-filled and complex nature of its narratives. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-3-review/1900-6416302/">Black Ops 3 in particular went off the deep end</a>, with an incomprehensible story involving cybernetic neural interfaces and nanotechnology. With 2020's Black Ops Cold War, the subseries returned to its roots, featuring a back-to-basics espionage thriller story that involved brainwashing and a brief appearance by Ronald Reagan. And now with Black Ops 7, the series is heading back to the far-flung future for a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-official-gameplay-reveal-trailer/2300-6466256/">campaign full of trippy, mind-bending visuals</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">I haven't even gotten a moment to touch on Black Ops' multiplayer modes, which were chock-full of fun new features like the top-down Smash TV-inspired Dead Ops Arcade, the franchise's first theater mode, customizable emblems and weapons (novelties that disappeared in future installments), and compelling Wager Matches with modes like One in the Chamber and Gun Game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4598894-moon_screen_earth.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598894" data-ratio="0.551" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4598894-moon_screen_earth.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4598894"></a><figcaption>The Zombies mode in Call of Duty: Black Ops took players to locales as far as the moon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4598894-moon_screen_earth.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Whereas Treyarch used to build on Infinity Ward's work, the other Call of Duty studios have since taken cues from Treyarch's work on Black Ops. By expanding on the Zombies mode from World at War for Black Ops, Treyarch established the Easter egg-filled cooperative mode as an essential third pillar for Call of Duty moving forward, even being included in non-Treyarch entries like Infinite Warfare, WWII, and Modern Warfare 3. And in Infinite Warfare, Infinity Ward actually utilized the wall-running and boost-jumping movement system from Black Ops 3, in a rare case of role reversal between Infinity Ward and Treyarch.</p><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that Black Ops 1 released during a tumultuous time for the franchise--in between the release of the 2009 blockbuster hit Modern Warfare 2 and Black Ops, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fired-infinity-ward-execs-sue-activision/1100-6252851/">Activision dismissed the studio heads of Infinity Ward</a>, leading to litigation and an exodus of employees from the studio. It would take years for Infinity Ward to rebuild, requiring assistance from Sledgehammer Games for Modern Warfare 3 and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-dev-infinity-ward-absorbs-tony-hawk-dev-neversoft/1100-6419405/">absorbing fellow Activision studio Neversoft</a> while making Call of Duty: Ghosts. Whether Treyarch aimed to or not, the studio proved with Black Ops that it could fill the void left by Infinity Ward, and it’s just as capable of putting out a game-changing entry in the franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty: Black Ops will be remembered for bringing us Nuketown, the numbers, and Frank Woods, all permanently etched in the tapestry of Call of Duty's larger history. But more than anything, Black Ops 1 should be admired for throwing more at the wall than any Call of Duty game that would follow.</p>

This will no doubt include keeping certain characters under wraps until the opportune moment.</p>
<p>Well... sadly, it seems someone's let the cat out of the bag a little bit too soon... or should that be the Yoshi out of the bag?</p>
<p>Yes, over on the <a href="https://shop.topsmarkets.com/store/tops-markets/products/83425108-pillsbury-ready-to-bake-yoshi-egg-sugar-cookie-dough-9-1-oz">Tops Markets</a> website, the US baking company Pillsbury has uploaded a new product that blatantly shows two images of Yoshi from The Super Mario Galaxy Movie. One shows the character taking centre stage on the front of the package with Mario himself striking his best 'Galaxy pose' in the background.</p>
<p>The other is on the back, showing Mario atop Yoshi's back as they soar through space. We also get a glimpse at some of the potential planets from the movie along with what we're assuming is a loose take on Rosalina's Observatory. And is that... Bowser Jr..? Yes, yes it is.</p>
<p>You can check out the images in the embed below, or head on over to the Tops Market website for a look at the original uploads in more detail.</p>

<p>Of course, these new images also corroborate an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/its-official-the-mario-movie-sequel-is-based-on-mario-galaxy">earlier leak from 'Old Spice'</a>, which showcased a similar image of Yoshi alongside a separate product featuring Luigi. This was back in September just prior to the official teaser trailer from Nintendo itself.</p>
<p>It's also been claimed that a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/a-trailer-for-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-will-debut-this-month-its-claimed">trailer for the new movie will be broadcast this month</a> ahead of <strong>Wicked: For Good</strong>, with speculation pointing to a potential Direct presentation either on or before 21st November 2025.</p>
<p>If this is indeed the case, then we reckon it's a pretty safe bet to say that Yoshi will show up in some capacity.</p>

<p>Our first look at Yoshi and Bowser Jr. from The Super Mario Galaxy Movie comes from, well, a grocery chain. The film, set to release April 3rd, 2026, has yet to get a full trailer, but the new listing may hint at it coming sooner than we thought.</p>



<p>Illumination and Universal Pictures went big with The Super Mario Bros. Movie back in 2022. The first film based on a Nintendo IP in decades, it became the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt6718170/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highest-grossing video game adaptation</a>&nbsp;of all time. A sequel was quickly greenlit and, earlier this year, was revealed to be called The Super Mario Galaxy Movie. Story details were thin outside of using Super Mario Galaxy, but we now have some more content from an unlikely source: slice-and-bake cookies.</p>



<h2 id="h-first-look-at-yoshi-and-bowser-jr-from-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-leaked-online">First Look at Yoshi and Bowser Jr. from The Super Mario Galaxy Movie Leaked Online</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The leak comes from an unlikely source: Tops Markets. The East Coast grocery chain put up a new listing for “Pillsbury The Super Mario Galaxy Shape Sugar Cookie Dough”. It’s still up, <a href="https://shop.topsmarkets.com/store/tops-markets/products/83425108-pillsbury-ready-to-bake-yoshi-egg-sugar-cookie-dough-9-1-oz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">linked here</a>, if you want to look at it, but it’s out of stock. On the box, we have the best look at Yoshi, who is at the end of The Super Mario Bros. Movie via a cracked sewer egg. His design differs a bit from his video-game counterpart with smoother texturing and flatter eyes. </p>



<p>On the back, there’s a fun little maze to fill out. We do get to see some of the worlds Mario and Yoshi will be traveling to, though it’s hard to tell if they come from Super Mario Galaxy or its sequel. However, one icon should be familiar to fans: Bowser Jr.’s graffiti tag. The character, the son of Bowser (played in-film by Jack Black), had yet to be revealed, so his inclusion here is all but confirming his appearance. </p>



<p>A trailer for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored to come out soon</a>, possibly with the upcoming Wicked: For Good film. With April 2026 almost here, marketing is set to start and, unfortunately for Nintendo, happened a bit too early. Regardless, we have yet to see Yoshi and Bowser Jr. in action, but it’s good to know some new faces are along for the intergalactic ride.</p>



<p>What do you think of Yoshi’s look in The Super Mario Galaxy Movie? Are you going to be picking up the Pillsbury cookies? When do you think the trailer will come out?

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> has once again smashed its own concurrent peak user count on Steam, topping 400,000 for the first time this weekend.</p>
<p>Last week, we reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-passes-250000-concurrent-players-on-steam-alone-breaking-records-for-the-extraction-shooter-genre">Arc Raiders had surpassed a peak concurrent player count of 250,000 on Steam just a day after its release</a>, and then again on 1st November when it topped 328,062 simultaneous players, making it the most popular Steam release for a PvP extraction shooter ever.</p>

<p>Now, over the weekend period, Arc Raiders has broken its own record once again, hitting a new high of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/">416,517 concurrent users</a> on Steam, making it the fifth biggest game on Steam over the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>Based on data from Alinea Analytics, market analysts believe around 69.2 percent of the game's playerbase is on Steam. That means roughly 30 percent of its playerbase - 17.3 percent on PlayStation, and 13.5 percent on Xbox - are not accounted for in that figure.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-may-have-already-sold-25m-copies-according-to-industry-analyst">As for why Arc Raiders is so popular</a> when other extraction shooters haven't reached such highs in terms of sales or player count? As Connor reported earlier in the week, market analyst Rhys Elliott of Alinea Analytics believes that "Arc Raiders is great because it focuses on community - NOT because it's an extraction shooter".</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-40-hours-and-counting-arc-raiders-has-me-convinced-extraction-shooters-are-brilliant">Eurogamer's Arc Raiders' preview</a>, we wrote: "Arc Raiders is, simply put, a third-person extraction shooter. It is a factory that mass produces tense moments, by its own nature a source of intense anxiety: high stakes, devastating losses, rapturous victories. Pulling back, it's a game of gradual self-refinement, both of your inventory full of resources and your characters abilities, and likewise your own know-how."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a> has struck down co-op survival horror shooter Misery with a DMCA alleging copyright infringement.</p>
<p>After Valve said it had no option but to take down the game before it too was subject to a copyright claim, the Misery team - chiefly consisting of a solo developer called Maewing - <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2119830/announcements/detail/598542531394798467">claimed</a> it was "under attack!", insisting Misery is "a completely different concept, happening in the fictional Republic of Zaslavie, and it has nothing to do" with GSC's Stalker 2.</p>
<p>"It has nothing to do with the Stalker universe, Chernobyl, etc. Misery uses no characters, plot, storyline, assets, monsters, music, code, etc., from their games. It is all either originally created or legally licensed. We also think that this is an abuse of power against small independent developers by a large corporation, and it should not be a thing," the team wrote of its game, which released on Steam on 23rd October.</p>
<p>"We do not pose any threat to GSC or their IP, we do not compete with their games, nor do we use any of their IP. Of course, Misery was inspired by many things, including games, movies, and books, but filing a DMCA strike for that is wrong. We also want to remind GSC that their games draw heavily from Roadside Picnic and the Stalker movie by Tarkovsky, and they do not own the copyright on depressive Soviet-era buildings, playing guitar, vodka, radiation, or abandoned locations, or even the poo."</p>

<p>As a consequence of the claim, the game has disappeared from the Steam storefront.</p>
<p>"We are 100% sure this misunderstanding will be resolved, Misery will be back on Steam very soon, and we will see many amazing updates and new content," the team added. "This is very unfortunate and painful for us, both mentally and financially, but the development continues, all the updates will be delivered on time, and soon we can play Misery again."</p><p>The message from Valve included screenshots comparing Misery to Stalker 2, including side-by-side comparisons of a gloomy, Soviet-era neightbourhood from Stalker: Call of Prypiat and a similar environment in Misery. Another side-by-side comparison shows characters in both games sitting around a fire wearing gas masks, playing guitar.</p>

<p>The team closed on imploring people not to review-bomb GSC, writing: "do not insult them or other people in comments, especially for their nationality! We do not want or support that".</p>
<p>However, in the privacy of its members-only Discord channel, the developer was considerably less polite <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1or39zs/comment/nno4g7j/">and posted a screed of pejorative slurs</a>, prompting a follow-up apology.</p>
<p>"[After the DMCA strike], some people found my old posts and comments that included inappropriate and offensive statements," the developer said (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/stalker-dev-gsc-game-world-dmcad-a-stalker-inspired-indie-off-steam-and-the-devs-are-crying-foul-this-is-an-abuse-of-power-against-small-independent-developers-by-a-large-corporation/">PC Gamer</a>). "Many are rightfully upset, and I completely understand why. First of all, I want to acknowledge and take full responsibility for my past words. What I wrote was immature, thoughtless, and wrong. It does not represent who I am today or what I believe in, and I deeply regret posting it.</p><p>"I do not support any form of extremism, violence, or discrimination against any group of people. I truly value and respect our players and friends from all countries and backgrounds. As for the DMCA strike we will handle it calmly and professionally. There is no basis for it, and I believe Valve will review the situation fairly."</p>
