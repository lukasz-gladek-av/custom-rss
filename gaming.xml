			<p>In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war. This one line all the narrative reasoning you need for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a>. It’s exposition, it’s emotional grounding, and it’s explanation for the hours you’re about to spend soaked in the gore of many thousands of enemy xenos.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 - The Angels Of Death" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/buT5yuGwg8s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Straightforward it might seem, but there’s also an emotional connection here that overrides the guns, the chainswords and the gruff militaristic interplay between the characters. This is a game utterly enamoured with the world of Warhammer 40,000, Games Workshop’s most popular franchise, and which, in turn, will speak to those that are similarly enamoured with it.</p>


<p>You could raise questions about the lack of female characters, the one-note emotional range, or indeed a story that thinks that character development is frivolous window dressing. You could, but you shouldn’t. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a> is the most spectacular, the most faithful and the most enjoyable video game adaptation of this beloved setting – a setting that, when it was created in 1987, was just as deliberately flawed and hyper-sensationalised as the ultra-violent social satire of RoboCop.</p>


<p>Space Marine 2 is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2011/09/12/review-warhammer-40000-space-marine/">the continuing story</a> of our hero Titus. It’s been over 100 years since the conclusion of the last game saw him branded a heretic and despatched to the Deathwatch, a suicide squad sent to deal with the worst threats in the galaxy.</p>
<p>Called to the planet Kadaku in the midst of a Tyranid invasion, your team are deployed to unleash a bio-virus designed to attack the xenos. Titus is the only survivor, though only through the timely intervention of the Ultramarine chapter. Reinstated, and newly reborn as a stronger, faster and more resilient Primaris marine, Titus leads a new team into the heart of the alien infestation, giving you the excuse to cut down Tyranid after Tyranid after Tyranid. It’s an objective that never gets old.</p>
<p>Titus is a brusque, but likeable, central hero, and some of the most interesting elements of the narrative are to do with how he’s perceived by his fellow Ultramarines. Certain parts of his past have been erased from the company’s records, and that makes for a few noteworthy moments amongst the gung-ho missions. This isn’t particularly a game with bags of character development, which is a shame when there’s so much fantastic writing set within the 40K universe, but it does the job it needs to.</p>

<p>Saber want you to constantly move forward. You’re a nigh-on indestructible warrior, and they’ve built your ability to survive into the combat system. You have four blocks of armour, each of which will regenerate after a small amount of time.</p>
<p>If all your armour has gone then you’ll begin to lose health, with the most obvious way to reclaim it begin to dole out some damage of your own, refilling any health and a portion of the shields you’ve just lost. Beyond that there’s the standard medkits, or your teammates can revive you, but the whole point of Space Marine 2 is to wade forward, straight into the gaping maw of the Tyranid threat, and by Jove, you’re going to do it.</p>
<p>It’s quite amazing just how well balanced the combat and its built-in healing system is. Any number of times I’ve been on the brink of death, a sliver of health keeping Titus upright, and still I’ve been able to triumph, building health and armour back through timely executions and parries. You are one of the galaxy’s toughest troops, and Space Marine 2 makes you feel like it.</p>
<p>It’s also surprising how fast and frenetic that combat feels, when you’re a soldier that’s been stuck in the thickest, most tank-like armour mankind has created. You stomp around the different landscapes at a pace that’s just about fast enough not to drive you insane, but the moment that one of those vile Tyranids appears everything seems to accelerate. They’re <em>much</em> faster than you are, and as they rush at you with their lethal blades your focus shifts as you try to survive the deadly dance.</p>

<p>Space Marine 2 looks absolutely stunning, and it’s even more impactful if you’ve grown up with the franchise, formative years spent hanging around in Games Workshop and lusting over the biggest and most expensive models. Those huge models look incredible, an early appearance of a Thunderhawk craft then setting the tone for impressive neo-gothic industrial buildings, alien locales and the terrifying swarms of aliens that you have to deal with.</p>
<p>Saber are rightly very proud of their swarm tech, and just as we saw in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/04/26/world-war-z-review-wwz-ps4-xbox-pc/">World War Z</a>, it’s a hugely effective way of making encounters feel insurmountable, with the resulting exhilaration when you do scrape though a truly euphoric reward. The sense of scale at times is breathtaking, and when it’s combined with the level of detail found throughout the game, Space Marine 2 is an alien-infested feast for the senses.</p>
<p>The team have also thought about longevity and come at it from multiple angles with both PvE and PvP options. You can play through the Campaign in online co-op with up to two other players, and as with most games, the experience is even better with real people to go into battle with. It allows you to co-ordinate with each other, focus in on specific enemies, and just bicker between yourselves about who was really better when the results page shows that you did the most melee damage.</p>
<p>While Gears of War certainly cribbed from Games Workshop’s world, Saber are here returning the favour, and playing in co-op feels as natural with Titus and his cohorts as it did with Marcus and Dom. If you don’t have enough Space Marine-orientated friends the AI is serviceable enough, and while they’ll be found stood around at times when there’s definitely aliens to shoot, you can at least always rely on them to heal you when you’re down. That might make them better than your friends.</p>

<p>With the campaign behind you, there’s then the Operations mode, pitting&nbsp;you and your squad against a batch of aliens in a set mission structure, and with multiple classes to choose between.&nbsp;This is a further treat for 40K fans, with Assault troopers nestling up to Snipers, Paladin, Heavy, and the standard Tactical marines as well.</p>
<p>Playing Operations grants you experience, which in turn allows you to level up each of these hero types, granting perks, new weaponry and alternative cosmetics to personalise your trooper with. Just as with the real models, you can go to town here, and make them as different as possible to your friend’s trooper, though there’s a disappointing little dose of microtransactions for some of the other Space Marine chapters’ colour schemes.</p>

<p>If you’d rather be blasting real people, there’s also Eternal War, which is the 6v6 PvP mode pitting Space Marines and their fallen Chaos Marine brethren. Pre-release this has been the portion of the game we’ve had the least amount of time with, but even with that caveat, it’s already a good dose of chunky fun.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>"In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war." So goes the infamous&nbsp;<em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6bc2812a-69f3-4947-89d3-4c79996f4d0f" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000">Warhammer 40,000</a>&nbsp;</em>opening screen, but if you want to understand&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="669ee953-b128-427d-8ca6-11ed47ab3529" href="https://techraptor.net/games/space-marine-2"><em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2</em></a>, it's not the far future to which you must journey. Instead, you must travel to the not-so-distant past.</p>
<p>Specifically, you should go back to the seventh console generation, the days of the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3. That's where&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>dwells, which is appropriate enough given it's the sequel to a game from that very era.</p>
<p>Unlike the Tyranids that Demetrian Titus faces,&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>seems fairly content not evolving too significantly. It offers the same kind of hack-and-slash-come-shooter thrills you'll find in the original, but there are a few new quirks here that alter the formula, for better and for worse.</p>
<h2><em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>Feels Like a Throwback</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review-jump-pack.jpg?itok=1tUeLcia 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review-jump-pack.jpg?itok=pY3Av7Ej 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Many of the original&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/node/31982"><em>Space Marine</em>'s </a>pieces of wargear make a return in&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Pretty much every facet of&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>feels like a callback to the era that spawned its progenitor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's got everything you'd expect from an early-2010s third-person shooter: boxy, two-dimensional level design, a&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="996bd110-ba62-4ea1-ac45-607c1c48e361" href="https://techraptor.net/games/halo-infinite"><em>Halo</em></a>-style regenerating armor system, and big manly men in power armor murdering scores upon scores of monstrosities.</p>
<p>I'll try to avoid starting every sentence in this review with "much like the first game", but it'll be difficult, because&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>often comes across like more of a remake than a sequel, albeit one with Tyranids in place of the first game's Orks.</p>
<p>If you've played&nbsp;<em>Space Marine</em>, you'll know the drill. You and your two Space Marine buddies must journey to various vast, imposing Imperial facilities to dispatch droves of Tyranids in combat that veers between ranged blasting and up-close-and-personal chainsword speed dating.</p>
<p>You'll have a variety of weapons to choose from, but you can only carry two guns at a time (plus, occasionally, a third heavy weapon), and your objectives are pretty much exclusively "press that button", "fall off that ledge", or "ride that elevator".</p>
<p>I'm on record as a fan of throwback Xbox 360-era shooters, though; I was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/evil-west-review">a big fan</a> of&nbsp;<em>Evil West</em>, and so it's no surprise that&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>offered similar comforts. For all its flaws (and it has many), I enjoyed immersing myself in the nostalgia of a bygone era with Saber and Focus' game.</p>
<p>Much like with&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/evil-west"><em>Evil West</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s lack of modern trappings reads like a refreshing return to basics. You won't find a skill tree (except in the multiplayer mode), and there's no open world to be seen. Instead, it's just you, your enemies, and the holy wargear blessed by the Emperor.</p>
<h2>Combat in&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>is Fun, but Awkward</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review-dodge.jpg?itok=znMW6UK5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review-dodge.jpg?itok=j42eGV3_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Space Marine 2</em>'s parry and dodge mechanic is a little clunky.</figcaption></figure><p>That's not to say there's nothing new here at all. While the combat closely resembles that of the original&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Space Marine</em>, Saber has seen fit to throw in a couple of innovations, not least a system that has you dodging and parrying enemies based on colored prompts.</p>
<p>This system is perhaps the biggest change from the original, so I'm sad to report that it never quite felt right to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a particularly big Tyranid (or Chaos Marine later on) approaches with designs on your gene-seed, they'll throw out attacks that must either be dodged or parried, which generally works fine when you're one-on-one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem here is that's not really how&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s combat works. At any given moment, you'll be facing off against scores upon scores of slavering monsters, and watching for parry or dodge symbols in chaos (no pun intended) like that is difficult.</p>
<p>There's also the issue that in order to lend a sense of weight to proceedings, your Space Marines' attacks are heavy and ponderous, which means you'll often be locked into animations and blindsided by a parry or dodge prompt you've got no way of responding to.</p>
<p>In practice, I found that this system resulted in just waiting for enemies to strike and reacting appropriately, which didn't feel very 'Space Marine'. I'm supposed to be charging in for the glory of the Emperor, not gloomily hoping Lictor-senpai will notice me so I can return its flirtations.</p>
<p>Happily, hacking through hordes of Tyranids or Chaos cultists still feels great. The chainsword still packs a real punch, and the bolters feel exactly as heavy and impactful as they should, which is a big plus in&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s favor.</p>
<p>If&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>had leant further into its power fantasy strengths and ditched the parry system, I'd be wholeheartedly recommending it. As it stands, though, this system feels to me like a strange, clunky imposition rather than a game-changer.</p>
<h2><em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>Has a Great Sense of Place</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review-location.jpg?itok=tiol8Puu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review-location.jpg?itok=yiM83LWP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Space Marine 2</em>'s austere cathedral-like interiors look great.</figcaption></figure><p>Between fights in&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, you'll mostly be wandering through ruined industrial facilities, religious buildings, and swampy jungles. There's not a lot to do when you're not carving up enemies, but that feels appropriate; these are the Emperor's chosen, after all. They're not administrative assistants.</p>
<p>Developer Saber has done a great job of rendering&nbsp;<em>40k</em>'s oppressive, almost comically brutal world writ large. Interiors have that unique&nbsp;<em>40k&nbsp;</em>mix of claustrophobia and grandiosity, and when things open up, some of&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s vistas are truly jaw-dropping.</p>
<p>The characters, too, look great. Titus and his Ultramarine compatriots feel like walking suits of armor, tech-priests look appropriately alien, and when Chaos Marines join the fray, the alien otherness of the Immaterium feels genuinely intimidating.</p>
<p>If you love the immersive, grimy maps of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/warhammer-40000-chaos-gate-daemonhunters"><em>Warhammer 40k: Chaos Gate - Daemonhunters</em></a>, or even the cold industrial environments of something like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/warhammer-40000-mechanicus"><em>Mechanicus</em></a>, then you'll likely appreciate what Saber and Focus have done with&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s worlds.</p>
<p>It's a good thing the environments look so pretty, too, because the story that takes place in them is utterly unremarkable and bog-standard. Titus remains a fairly flat and boring protagonist, and the best&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>can manage in terms of character arcs is the old, tired "I have come to trust you as my leader" trope.</p>
<p>To be fair to Saber and Focus, some of that is down to the material. Space Marines aren't exactly the most exciting characters in the&nbsp;<em>40k&nbsp;</em>setting, after all; they're stoic fascist enforcers, so obviously, they're not going to be cracking wise every few minutes.</p>
<p>Still, I feel like&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>is less engaging on this level than its predecessor. That may also be down to&nbsp;the choice of enemies. Tyranids are much less charismatic than Orks, so it's less fun to cut through their ranks.</p>
<p>On that front, there's a very, very cruel tease towards the end of the story that threatens to make things far more interesting, but&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>is over before it can go anywhere with said tease. Better wait for&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 3</em>, I suppose...</p>
<h2>Try Not to Play&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>Alone</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review-chainsword.jpg?itok=3lH5MRiR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review-chainsword.jpg?itok=u8rvSSSx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>wants you to bring your buddies along for the ride.</figcaption></figure><p>Throughout the entirety of&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>, I got the sense that Saber and Focus really, really didn't want me to play alone.</p>
<p>The campaign offers support for two extra players who take the roles of Titus' squadmates Gadriel and Chairon, and there are also a range of extra missions designed to fill in some of the gaps in&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s story (just six at time of writing, but more are promised).</p>
<p>While the campaign can largely be enjoyed solo, those aforementioned missions pretty much carry the prerequisite of playing with others. It's possible to experience them with bots at your side, but they're clearly designed for multiplayer.</p>
<p><em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>positions these missions as optional, but given that they feature entire boss encounters that you won't find in the main campaign, I have a sinking suspicion they were cut from the story in order to shore up the multiplayer offering.</p>
<p>The missions themselves are perfectly fine. They offer more of&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s indiscriminate xenos murder, and there aren't many cutscenes to interrupt the action either.</p>
<p>The aforementioned unique encounters are also great; they play to&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s strengths, although they, too, are better with other players rather than bots.</p>
<p>I'm just not sure how much longevity&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>has as a live service-adjacent game.</p>
<p>Focus and Saber have promised it will feature <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-no-microtransactions">no microtransactions</a>, and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-roadmap">robust roadmap</a> has also been put in place for the next year. Six missions feels a touch paltry, though, and I can see players getting tired of&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2</em>'s straightforward, no-frills action sooner than the two studios might envisage.</p>
<h2><em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review-conversation.jpg?itok=AWZWPyK9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review-conversation.jpg?itok=ieO8nEUh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You're probably not playing&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>for the story.</figcaption></figure><p>Never was a game more appropriately named than&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em>. It feels very much like "another&nbsp;<em>Space Marine&nbsp;</em>game", so if you enjoyed what the first one had to offer, you'll probably get along with this one as well.</p>
<p>That does, however, prompt the question of whether waiting 13 years for something that feels so similar to its predecessor was worth it. I'm a big fan of the first&nbsp;<em>Space Marine</em>, but honestly, I was hoping for a little more movement than this.</p>
<p>Nevertheless,&nbsp;<em>Space Marine 2&nbsp;</em>has its thrills. At its best, it's uncomplicated, horde-slaying fun, and it offers a fascinatingly well-rendered look at the&nbsp;<em>40k&nbsp;</em>universe. That may well be enough for you, and if so, you'll find a lot to like here.</p>

He was offered the chance to return to his Ultramarine brothers, but instead punished himself for his mistakes in the first game and joined the Deathwatch. Eventually, he’s forced back into the Ultramarines at the start of <em>Space Marine 2</em>. Here he’s put in charge of two new characters as their squad leader and helps the Imperium of Man push back a deadly alien threat known as the Tyrannids. All the while, Titus’ squad is suspicious of his past, his motives, and his tendency to question leadership.<br></p><p>The main plot of <em>Space Marine 2</em>’s campaign, which will take most players about 10 to 12 hours, is focused on how Titus, his squad, and the Imperium will win the war against the alien invaders and another, worse threat that emerges in the second half of the game. And this aspect of the story is totally serviceable and fine enough. I was curious how things would wrap up and how the heroes would save the day or fail. And if you love <em>Warhammer 40K</em>, there’s probably some neat lore to be found in the campaign, which can be played solo or with two other players.<br></p><p>But rather than all that high-stakes interstellar conflict, it’s actually the story of Titus and his squadmates slowly starting to trust each other and learn from one another that’s the more compelling narrative hook of <em>Space Marine 2</em>. The end of the game, which I won’t spoil, definitely left me wanting more adventures with Titus and his squad and hopefully, we’ll get to play those adventures in the future.<br></p><h2 id="h519660"><a id=""></a><strong>Difficulty problems and awesome guns</strong></h2><p>Between the cutscenes and dialogue is a whole lot of combat and action, which is <em>Space Marine 2</em>’s meat and potatoes. And the good news is <em>Space Marine 2</em> is a joy to play. Like the original game and unlike most modern shooters, <em>Space Marine 2</em> rewards players for being aggressive.<br></p><p>If an enemy damages you, the easiest way to recover is to quickly attack enemies to re-up your health. Wait too long, though, and you’ll have to heal using a medpack. Likewise, you have armor that can be replenished by executing aliens who are staggered or by counter-attacking an enemy. This system rewards you for being aggressive and deadly, which means you’ll quickly start acting like a Space Marine. Well,<em> you might</em>.<br></p><p>My biggest problem with <em>Space Marine 2’</em>s campaign (and the rest of the game) is that some ranged enemies on higher difficulties can become incredibly annoying. These few baddies can single-handedly melt your entire shields away and kill you in a matter of seconds on the game’s Veteran difficulty, which it implies is the best way to play. When I eventually got annoyed by a single, random alien dropping me from halfway across a battlefield, I dropped the difficulty down to normal. And sadly, this sometimes led to fights being too easy.<br></p><p>It’s frustrating that a few enemy types can disrupt <em>Space Marine 2</em>’s difficulty and super warrior fantasy so much. I hope a future patch either gives you a bit more health on Veteran or nerfs some of the ranged attacks so players can actually feel they are a big, hard-to-kill, and aggressive man-tank. For now, I’d recommend playing on normal or hiding behind walls during large fights to avoid alien snipers.<br></p><p>Thankfully, as the game progresses, these ranged enemies become easier to manage as new, less annoying enemies replace them in most fights and you gain access to better weapons. And there are a lot of guns to find and use in <em>Space Marine 2</em>, from fully automatic SMG-like bolt guns to slow and heavy-hitting snipers and even plasma guns, too. Each of these guns feels powerful but different, and offers its own advantages and disadvantages. I appreciated that while playing the campaign, I never felt like <em>Space Marine 2 </em>was forcing me to use a specific weapon. (Outside of one intense sequence involving flamethrowers…)<br></p><p>Oh, and you don’t even have to use guns. <em>Space Marine 2</em> includes a basic but functional melee combat system that lets you block, parry, dodge, and strike enemies either one-on-one or while facing a massive group of baddies. In <em>Space Marine 2</em>, any weapon can get the job done if you use it correctly, so you can choose whichever one you want. It really comes down to your preference. Are you more of a chainsword guy or a melter gun dude? All that matters is you help your fellow soldiers kill thousands of aliens.<br></p><h2 id="h519661"><a id=""></a><strong>So many aliens, so little time</strong></h2><p>And yes, there are thousands of aliens to kill. Thousands. Saber Interactive developed <em>Space Marine 2 </em>and is using its Swarm Engine—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/world-war-z-is-almost-the-left-4-dead-successor-ive-wan-1834174006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/world-war-z-is-almost-the-left-4-dead-successor-ive-wan-1834174006">first seen in <em>World War Z</em></a></span>—to power the<em> W40K</em> sequel. And this engine is really, really good at tossing hundreds of enemies at you at the same time.<br></p><p>Not every single combat encounter in <em>Space Marine 2</em> is a last stand against thousands of insect-like Tyrannid aliens, but there are plenty of these moments and I didn’t mind at all. Mowing down hundreds of aliens climbing up walls and cliffs with a giant automatic bolt gun never gets old.<br></p><p>Later on, when the game’s story shifts and introduces a new enemy to deal with, these large crowd moments become a bit less common and are replaced with more standard third-person shooting action against tanky soldiers. It’s a shame that what might be the most unique quality of <em>Space Marine 2</em>, its massive crowds of deadly aliens, is partially left behind in the second half of the campaign and replaced with more generic shooter combat. Thankfully, the alien crowds made up of hundreds of individual Terrannids trying to rip your face off are a big part of the game’s Operations mode.<br></p><h2 id="h519662"><a id=""></a><strong>The real reason to play Space Marine 2</strong></h2><p>When I wrapped the main campaign of<em> Space Marine 2</em> I found myself disappointed by how little progression there was as I completed missions. You can choose which weapons you start the next level with, but that’s it. No skills trees, no upgrades, and no perks. None of that. Don’t worry, though, because all of that stuff and more is in Operations, which is basically a separate game attached to <em>Space Marine 2</em>. In fact, I’d argue the best part of <em>Space Marine 2</em> is not its heavily advertised campaign but instead this great multiplayer mode.<br></p><p>The Operations mode is connected to the main story of <em>Space Marine 2</em>, letting you see how some missions were completed while Titus and his squad were off doing something else. And like the campaign, Operations is an action-packed third-person shooter built around completely linear levels, which you play either alone or with two other players.<br></p><p>However, in Operations, you pick a class of Space Marine—each with their own unique abilities—and create loadouts that you can swap between at certain points in missions. These loadouts are made up of weapons that you can upgrade over time, making them deal more damage, fire faster, or hold more ammo. Eventually, you can even unlock weapon variants that look cooler and have their own special stats. Similarly, as you complete missions and earn XP, you level up your Space Marine and get access to new skills and perks via a skill tree as well as the ability to fully customize your soldier.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="a11396188244f6b9beddcb2eb23d2659" data-recommend-id="image://a11396188244f6b9beddcb2eb23d2659" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image shows how you can customize your Space Marine.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you are someone who loves painting actual <em>Warhammer 40K </em>figurines, then the customization options in <em>Space Marine 2 </em>are going to make you drool and you’ll likely grind away in the various missions just to earn resources to unlock more paint jobs and patterns.<br></p><p>There’s a lot to Operations and after playing for a few hours I came away impressed. My only concern is that this mode lives or dies based on how much new content is added to it over time. Sure, for now, the eight missions you can play and replay are fun enough, but three months from now will I still want to play the same levels over and over again? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-road-map-free-content-new-missions-modes-1851633332&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-road-map-free-content-new-missions-modes-1851633332">Saber Interactive has already promised</a></span> new missions, weapons, and enemies are coming to Operations over the next 12 months, so hopefully this already content-stuffed mode will only grow more. If that’s the case, it’s likely that a year or two from now I’ll still be playing <em>Space Marine 2</em>’s Ops mode either alone or with random players via matchmaking.<br></p><p>There’s also a PvP mode in <em>Space Marine 2</em>, which I didn’t get much time with but also didn’t seem like the thing I’d care about in this kind of game. It works and maybe you’ll dig it, but to me the moment everyone is a big Space Marine, the combat stops feeling special and starts playing more like a so-so <em>Gears of Wa</em>r knockoff. I’m far more interested in co-op action and fighting off massive waves of enemies, so I’m more excited for the already-announced horde mode to be added in 2025.<br></p><p><em>Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</em> is a surprisingly big game. It features a robust and well-made blockbuster campaign that is only held back by some difficulty balancing issues, a really awesome and in-depth co-op PvE mode that offers a lot of replayability, and a PvP mode that is fine and might be fun for some. The complete package is very enticing and I think that, even with some of its flaws and some minor performance issues on console, <em>Space Marine 2 </em>is probably the best <em>Warhammer 40K </em>game ever made. <br></p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The popular tech stock, NVIDIA ($NVDA), suffered its largest drop in a single day, losing $279 billion. While this is a massive loss for the company, it helps to put Microsoft in a winning position for the <em>market cap crown</em> as the two continuously battle it out. </p>



<h2 id="h-nvidia-is-taking-a-huge-loss-why">NVIDIA Is Taking A Huge Loss… Why?</h2>



<p>It would seem as if NVIDIA is facing an immense loss, as the company reportedly also lost <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-lost-500-billion-three-days/">$500 billion over just three days</a> back in June. At the time, that news didn’t, by any means, even put a dent in the company, as they were declared the world’s biggest company by market capitalization earlier this year.</p>



<p>But the losses seem to keep coming. Why?</p>



<p>Well, for one, the hype around AI is starting to die down. At one point, AI was the biggest topic in the world. And while it is still in discussion, many are starting to suspect the stock hype around it to lack any real substance. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>With the company constantly making high-end GPUs, many other companies and tech enthusiasts were excited about the future of AI. But just this week, reports surfaced that OpenAI is seeking additional investments from major tech companies in hopes of staying afloat. </p>



<p>It would seem as if ChatGPT’s worth was never raised above being anything but a search engine. </p>



<p>Microsoft even took a hit when it came to the realm of AI, as the company’s Windows Recall AI feature was deemed a “privacy nightmare” by many. </p>



<h2 id="h-rumors-surfaces-regarding-nvidia-and-us-department-of-justice">Rumors Surfaces Regarding NVIDIA And US Department Of Justice</h2>



<p>A recent rumor also surfaced online regarding NIVIDA and the US Department of Justice. Supposedly, the government organization has issued a subpoena to NVIDIA. Nothing has been confirmed, but many speculate it is on anti-trust grounds.</p>



<p>So, what does this mean for the future of NVIDIA? More importantly, what does this mean for the future of tech?</p>

                <p>Acer unveiled several new laptops this week during a press event at IFA Berlin, but the most interesting hardware it unveiled is a conceptual one. The company posted a short trailer for what it calls Acer Project DualPlay: a gaming laptop that comes with its own detachable controller.</p><p>Similar to how the Joy-Cons detach from a Switch console, the controller can be easily popped out of the laptop--as demonstrated in the video below--and separated from the cradle for when you want to do so co-op gaming. The controller forms part of the underside of the trackpad when inserted back into place, and the laptop also features pop-up speakers on the side.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vI2fyCh6KNo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vI2fyCh6KNo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The obvious benefit to this idea is that it gives a user less hardware to carry about with them, as most controllers can take up a fair amount of space due to their design. Acer says the controller on its DualPlay concept can be quickly detached from its electromagnetic lock by placing two fingers on the release button located on top of the keyboard, so it should be a secure fit for when you're doing non-gaming tasks on the laptop.</p><p>It also has quite a lot of RGB lighting, because nothing says gaming hardware like a constant flow of rainbow lights around the chassis of a device. For now, the DualPlay remains an idea with a snazzy trailer. It's not clear if Acer will ever put it into full production, and right now, it has several other gaming laptops coming out soon in its Predator and Orion lines. On top of that, the company also revealed several new gaming monitors and its first entry into the handheld gaming PC space.</p><p>The Acer Nitro Blaze 7 looks like an interesting alternative to the bulkier <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-deck-review-redefinition/1100-6500986/" data-ref-id="1100-6500986">Steam Deck</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-plans-to-release-a-second-gen-rog-ally-later-this-year/1100-6520628/" data-ref-id="1100-6520628">Asus ROG Ally</a> models on the market, as it measures 25.6cm in width, 11.3 cm in depth, and 2.25cm in height. Internally, it's packing a Ryzen 7 8840HS chipset, 16GB of RAM, and a 1080p 144hz display.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24235365/acer-ifa-2024-project-dualplay<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Out of all the new laptops Acer announced at IFA today, <a href="https://news.acer.com/project-dualplay-novel-gaming-laptop-concept-with-detachable-controllers-for-dual-player-experiences">Project DualPlay</a> pops out the most. It’s a concept laptop that Acer says gives gamers more ways to play on the go, but looking at the design, I’m not sure which gamers it’s talking about.</p><p>For Project DualPlay, Acer took its Predator gaming laptop and added a cutout beneath the keyboard to hold its custom gaming controller face-down. The back of the controller doubles as the laptop’s trackpad. A button at the top of the keyboard releases the controller and causes two 5W speakers to pop out from the sides of the laptop. The controller can be further separated into two gamepads, Nintendo Switch-style. </p><p>Acer’s press release says Project DualPlay lets a second person join you just as easily as detaching the controller.<em> Street Fighter 6 </em>is called out specifically as well as first-person shooters, though the latter only makes sense if the game supports split-screen play. You can also just use it for single-player games, of course.</p><div><figcaption><em>Acer’s Project DualPlay gaming laptop concept.</em></figcaption> <p><cite><em>Image: Acer</em></cite></p></div><p>Unfortunately, we didn’t get to see Acer’s concept in person at IFA, so that leaves me with a few questions. Mostly: is the controller any good? If a second person is using the controller, how pleasant is it to game on a laptop with a gaping hole where the trackpad should be? </p><p>None of the press photos show someone using the laptop with the controller removed. </p><p>Plenty of PC games have controller support, and many people prefer using a controller over a mouse and keyboard. So there’s something to be said for having a controller that fits right into your laptop rather than having to cart one around.</p><p>Project DualPlay is just a concept for now. But how much extra would you pay for a laptop with the controller built right in?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Quick disclosure: I worked with Mojang and Microsoft on a book about Minecraft's first 15 years, shortly before joining Rock Paper Shotgun. As such, I am now obliged by the eternal laws of journalistic accountability to state that anything Minecraft-related is rubbish. But even if that weren't the case, I would describe this as pretty dismal.</p><!--more-->

<p>It's partly Hollywood-trailer-itis - they're doing that condescending thing where they slap a bass drop or local equivalent on every punchline - but it's mostly that they've monstered Minecraft's matchless visual direction, with a photorealistic spin on the original block aesthetic which makes me think of those fan mods that insist on forcing ray-tracing and hair physics into a game that is famously low-tech and simple.</p>
<p>I'm sure the film's visual direction represents many hours of skilled labour, and I empathise for the artists who are now reading the Youtube comments, but it all just seems so unnecessary. The original Minecraft didn't make waves because you could see your reflection in every Piglin's eyeball. I'm not sure it'll be "more appealing to a mainstream audience", either - if you've never played Minecraft, I suspect this will seem very disposable, another matinee CGI fest among many, but with a strange emphasis on right angles. Imagine if they'd taken a few cues from the LEGO movies or even the Spider-Verse films, and folded in different aesthetics from all across Minecraft's evolution in the hands of developers and players.</p>
<p>The cast includes Emma Myers from Addams Family spin-off Wednesday,  Danielle Brooks from The Colour Purple, Jason Momoa playing Jason Momoa But Comically Non-Macho, and Jack Black playing Steve, Minecraft's OG default character. I don't have any particular strong feelings about how Steve should be portrayed, but I am quite tired of Jack Black being Jack Black. They should have cast him as a Creeper. Anyway, here's some blurb:</p>
<blockquote><p>Welcome to the world of Minecraft, where creativity doesn't just help you craft, it's essential to one's survival! Four misfits--Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison (Momoa), Henry (Hansen), Natalie (Myers) and Dawn (Brooks)--find themselves struggling with ordinary problems when they are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into the Overworld: a bizarre, cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. To get back home, they'll have to master this world (and protect it from evil things like Piglins and Zombies, too) while embarking on a magical quest with an unexpected, expert crafter, Steve (Black). Together, their adventure will challenge all five to be bold and to reconnect with the qualities that make each of them uniquely creative...the very skills they need to thrive back in the real world."</p></blockquote>
<p>The Minecraft movie was announced in 2014, and has been through several rewrites and changes of project leadership. Like many Hollywood productions, it also saw delays during the pandemic lockdowns. It'll hit cinemas next year. I'm morbidly interested to hear about how they worked out the visual direction, but I don't think I'll be buying a ticket.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sektors-mortal-kombat-1-fatality-channels-marvels-iron-man-heads-out-of-this-world<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a> developer NetherRealm has released a gameplay trailer for upcoming DLC character Sektor, showing off her Fatality and Animality.</p><p>Sektor arrives as part of the Khaos Reigns expansion for Mortal Kombat 1, the latest game in the gory fighting game franchise that's sold over four million copies. The expansion adds new story mode chapters available from September 24, along with Kombat Pack 2, which itself includes six new DLC characters: Cyrax, Sektor, and Noob Saibot (available on September 24), and guest fighters Ghostface (Scream franchise), T-1000 (Terminator 2: Judgement Day), and Conan the Barbarian (post-launch release timing to be announced at a later date).</p><p>It’s Sektor who is the focus for this new gameplay video, though. It shows off the character’s abilities and moveset (flamethrower, missile strikes, and rocket thrusters for enhanced movement and hovering ability), and clips of cutscenes that shine a light on the story fans can expect.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Here’s the set-up, courtesy of publisher Warner Bros. Games:</p><blockquote>In Fire God Liu Kang’s New Era, Sektor grew up immersed in Lin Kuei culture – her father was its master armorer, and her mother was a leading warrior. This vast knowledge of weaponry and formidable martial skills passed down from her parents make Sektor a kombatant like no other. Sensing a kindred spirit, Sub-Zero shared with her his grand vision for the Lin Kuei's future and chose her to become his most trusted lieutenant. Now Sektor will force the Lin Kuei to evolve and those who cannot change will be eliminated.</blockquote><p>The highlight of the video, though, is a look at one of Sektor’s Fatalities. Here, Sektor channels Marvel’s Iron Man, complete with cool sci-fi in-suit headshot, as she drags her hapless opponent into orbit before heading back, their body burning up on re-entry.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/04/mk-main-1725458259235.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Sektor's Fatality in Mortal Kombat 1 has big Iron Man vibes.</figcaption></figure></output><p>NetherRealm, of course, is no stranger to the superhero genre via its Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe crossover fighting game franchise. We haven't seen a new game in that series for some time — perhaps it's time for a return, with James Gunn's new DCU set to kick off soon.</p><p>Meanwhile, the video also teases Sektor’s Animality, the finishing move that lets her to morph into a rhinoceros. Animalities are part of a free update for all Mortal Kombat 1 owners set to go live alongside Khaos Reigns on September 24.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

			<p>Today, Warner Bros. Games released a brand-new trailer for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-announces-mortal-kombat-1-khaos-reigns/">Khaos Reigns update</a> for Mortal Kombat 1, which showcases Sektor, one of the upcoming fighters. Sektor is one of six playable characters that will be added to the game with the new expansion, with the trailer showcasing Sektor's moveset and abilities as well as Sektor's story in Mortal Kombat 1.</p>
<p>In this new trailer, we get to see Sektor's deadly weaponry and her expertise in utilizing them, such as the capability to use a flamethrower, missile strikes and even rocket thrusters to demolish her opponent. Specifically, the rocket thrusters can provide Sektor with extra mobility, allowing her a few seconds in the air to attack while hovering. This short trailer also showcases the upcoming addition of Animalities, explicitly showing Sektor's animality in Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns.</p>
<p>Compared to some other characters in Mortal Kombat 1, Sektor's fatality is rather tame. While she is still seen to be breaking the bones of her opponent, there isn't as much gore and viscera as there is with other characters, such as Scorpion or Mileena, for example.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns – Official Sektor Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/plWgLXmsRpI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The trailer is three minutes long, giving players a glimpse into her combat style as well as the story of her involvement in the Lin Kuei culture. Both her mother and father were crucial members of the Fire God Liu Kang's New Era, being a warrior and master armorer, respectively. Having both of them as assets in her life helped her become the intense and fiery warrior that she is today, with skills passed down from both parents.</p>
<p>The three-minute trailer shows Sektor's animality, where she can transform into a rhinoceros to gore her opponent and finish them off for good. While Khaos Reigns is a paid update for Mortal Kombat 1, the addition of Animalities is not and will be free to access for all players who want to use them.</p>
<p>Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns will be available on September 24, 2024. With this comes the release of Sektor and the free update of Animalities for all players to access, regardless of whether they own Khaos Reigns or not. The update will be released digitally at 8 AM PDT / 10 AM CDT / 11 AM EDT for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC. Those <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3134000/Mortal_Kombat_1_Khaos_Reigns_Bundle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who pre-order</a> the new expansion will get four new skins based on previous classic aesthetics, such as Wedding Scorpion, Empress Mileena, and Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 versions of Noob Saibot and Sub-Zero.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/death-guitar-preview-amp-up-your-speedruns<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In <em>Death the Guitar</em>, you play as a living guitar who wants to take revenge on the humans who have killed its owner, who was the greatest rockstar of all time. I’ll give you a second to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2474220/Death_the_Guitar/">wishlist it on Steam</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Coming from Japanese indie developer Toroya My Battery Is Fried, <em>Death the Guitar</em>&nbsp;features a simple, sort-of two-tone graphic style. Yet, it drips with style and creativity. It's a 2D platformer that asks you to clear room after room using the power of rock.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you complete a stage, you’re graded by your time and number of deaths, making this a pretty speedrun-friendly game. However, casual platformer fans will also find this game to be in tune with them.</p>

<p>Much like <em>Hotline Miami</em> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/katana-zero-review-zero-to-hero"><em>Katana Zero</em></a>, Death the Guitar is a one-touch, one-kill sort of game. It raises the stakes, but it also pushes you into finding the most efficient route to clear a level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I played two separate preview builds over the summer, and so far, the controls are simple. You can jump and attack with a chord, and at some point, you can equip a special ability, like one that boosts you forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The magic in the game is how your jump and chord affects the world around you. Throughout each level, there are amps. Jumping off an amp gives you more height and an electrified aura to hurt enemies.</p>
<p>Attacking, on the other hand, boosts you forward, destroying enemies and glass walls in your way (not to be confused with the special ability boost, which can be done any time as long as it’s ready).</p>

<p>Amps aren’t the only thing you can interact with, though. Attacking a switch attached to a pulley lets you lower or raise amps, acting both as a platform and a means to crush enemies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, certain kinds of ground are shockable, meaning if you hit it with your attack, a shockwave will travel across. It’s a useful way to kill enemies from afar or below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, these different tools give you just enough options to figure out optimal strategies and paths for each room. As you run through a level, you’ll find all sorts of options to shred enemies with sound.</p>

<p>If you get hit once, you’re sent back to the start of the room, but it’s not as unforgiving as that sounds. These rooms are quick and breezy. After all, practice makes perfect, as any good rockstar knows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The latest demo I played at PAX West culminated with a boss fight that taught me which basic attack does the most damage (spoiler alert, it’s the forward dash off an amp).&nbsp;</p>
<p>It felt like a classic boss in a 2D platformer like <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/sonic-mania-review-breaking-cycle">Sonic</a> </em>or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/mega-man-legacy-collection-review-fun-trip-down-memory-lane"><em>Mega Man</em></a>, where you have to dodge some telegraphed but quick attacks while finding time to get your own hits in. It’s the sort of thing where on your first try, it might take a couple lives. But if you practice it, you can probably do a no-hit sub-30 clear easy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I’m realizing I gravitated toward a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/chainstaff-preview-bony-grappling-hook-we-deserve">lot of platformers</a> this PAX West, but <em>Death the Guitar</em> made my heart pump the most. Maybe it was because I wanted to get on the time leaderboard on the show floor, or maybe it was the pressure of the people behind me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Either way, I’ll be looking forward to <em>Death the Guitar</em>’s eventual release, which is scheduled for some time in 2025.&nbsp;</p>

They're also, if you've never tried one, <em>extremely </em>difficult, and require an intimate knowledge of the game you're trying to blast through. How intimate? Let's take a deep dive behind one to find out.</p><p><strong>The following chapter (by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.twitch.tv/frozenflygone" target="_blank">frozenflygone</a></strong>) <strong>is excerpted from&nbsp;<em>ANY%: A History of Speedrunning</em>&nbsp;by Kat Brewster. The book is crowdfunding now – you can support it here:&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://eu-west-1.protection.sophos.com/?d=vol.co&amp;u=aHR0cHM6Ly92b2wuY28vY29sbGVjdGlvbnMvYW55LXBlcmNlbnQ=&amp;p=m&amp;i=NjU1ZjViOTc0NzgzNmM0NGFiYmUwZGM2&amp;t=dGd2VGtFVllSZ2lZWFRXNWk0VnVxNUNOV1U0U2F6VC9zeTk0RE53SjFCOD0=&amp;h=33569fd401a6482e8ce2921cc364eb0c&amp;s=AVNPUEhUT0NFTkNSWVBUSVYNc3yiWPkyC7ptxJDqsP8EBvWJL6K21KqITdx9hO4HuQ" target="_blank">https://vol.co/collections/any-percent</a></strong></p><figure></figure><p>I’ve always loved 2D platformers, so my very first game in my life that I one-hundred-percented was <em>Super Mario World</em>. I had my dad print out a guide for that game and I had like, 50 pages of it in my closet, getting all the dragon coins, all the secret exits, you know. So platformers have always been for me, they’ve always been something I feel that I’m very skilled at.</p><p>I learned about speed running first from watching [speedrunner] TGH playing <em>Undertale</em> and I was like, I wonder… And I saw his GDQ run, I watched that, and I was like, “Ohh, that’s that’s really interesting. I wonder if he is still streaming that.” And I turned on his stream and no, he was playing this game called <em>Celeste</em>! I was like, this game looks really cool. I’m gonna buy it. So I played it casually and then I bought it for my younger brother, who also loves video games. We played games all the time together, but I was in college and he was at home. When we had both finished the game and he sat down and he was like, “Do you wanna race?” I was like…okay. So, it was like a 2 hour race and he beat me and I was like, “Alright! Let’s race again!” Then it was like an hour and a half and then we raced each other to sub hour and he beat me. We would send our journals back and forth, and then I beat him to sub-50. And then he, you know, he stopped. He ran out of interest. And I just never stopped. I never stopped.</p><p>So it was just me and me and my younger brother Matthew. That was what got me interested in speedrunning. I started out on Switch, then I moved to PC and keyboard. And then I got, you know, sub-40, sub-32. And then I started playing mods and got my run into GDQ and all that. It’s always about having the people. For me it was my brother, and then I met the community, and then I had people teach me what was going on. And then I got to do that for other people and it’s so great. That’s how I started with <em>Celeste</em>. You know, it was a game I was drawn to. It really fits everything I love – its themes and its queerness and all that kind of stuff is really important. And it’s just an amazing community.</p><p>Speedrunning <em>Celeste</em> really ties into the themes of the game, of overcoming things. You’re gonna struggle, you’re gonna fall down the mountain. Sometimes it’s not going to be fun, but at the end of it, you will triumph and you’ll learn things about yourself. And that’s why speedrunning leans directly into the game… It encourages you to speed around it, and it’s a cycle. It’s why it’s still one of the most popular speed running games out there… My run is like, back when I got it I was in the top 200? My run is probably not even close anymore. But the fact that there’s a 24 [m] 58 [s] now is absurd.</p><p>I learned from a tutorial from Programmatic’s Any% tutorial, it’s very famous, while I was going through he did like a second version of it which was cool and I just went through that and every couple of you know, weeks, I’d focus on<br>a different level and I’d go through it. I would do my runs, I’d get a PB and then I’d watch the same video again and be like, oh, I forgot I wasn’t doing this part. Ohh, how do I get this better? OK, let me watch someone with the time who has like 5 minutes faster than me. What are they doing? And then just playing a lot, playing a lot.</p><figure></figure><h2>RUN OVERVIEW</h2><p>In <em>Celeste </em>speedruns, you rely on expert movement, climbing, dashing, jumping and grabbing the walls to traverse a dangerous mountain, collect keys, and reach the top. The run demands extraordinary platforming feats, chaining combos together, and good old fashioned skill. In order to maximize efficiency, runners have created their own taxonomy of different moves.There are a<br>handful of particular moves and skips utilized throughout. Here are a few:</p><p><strong>Dashing</strong>: There are super dashes, hyper dashes, wave dashes, extended dashes, ultra dashes, demo dashes… Dashing is critical. “There’s an important distinction between when you do a hyperdash and your hair is blue…and a hyper dash where your hair becomes red and you get your dash back. We like to call that an extended hyper or an extended wave dash where you end up getting your dash back… If you wait a certain number of frames longer before jumping, it kind of feels like you’re delaying and then you press the jump key, that’s how you’re going to get an extension…there’s something called supers and super dashes, also known as a dash jump, where you don’t hold any direction you just dash and then jump, that’ll get you more horizontal or that’ll give you more vertical height and you can also extend supers just like you extend wave dashes and you can get your dash back.”</p><p><strong>Bunnyhop</strong>: In essence, a short hyperdash followed by a jump that saves you frames. The momentum from a dash combined with a jump (which increases your speed +402 and saves you two frames each) gets you both higher and further. The bunnyhop is included in a number of different combos. Jumping is, in general, pretty important!</p><p><strong>Wall boost or wall bounce</strong>: “Another really, really important piece of speed tech that is super super clutch is called a wall bounce and what happens is…you dash up and then you jump away from the wall and that allows you to get really really high up. We’re going to use that in a ton of places to get our vertical height and our vertical distance.”</p><p><strong>Neutral jump</strong>: “A more niche technique is neutral jumping. [Usually when] you climb up a wall you will eventually run out of stamina. That can be really not helpful for us in some areas where we want to be climbing up and up and up and up! So, there’s a technique called a neutral jump where you are actually going to climb the wall by jumping away with no buttons pressed and then you go back…to the wall and then jump again and that allows you to climb up without expending any stamina.”</p><p><strong>Corner boost</strong>: An advanced jump around corners!</p><p><strong>Search skip</strong>: A left, a jump, a diagonal up jump, and a ledge grab or an up left dash. Sounds simple, right? This allows players to skip picking up a key, which is usually required to progress in the game.</p><h2>Forsaken City</h2><h2>0m 11s</h2><figure></figure><p>“Redhead girl goes very fast. Up a<br>mountain. And also discovers herself<br>along the way. That’s the crux of it.”</p><p>First, skip the intro cutscene. Then head onto Forsaken City. There’s a lot of movement manipulation and routing here to avoid things like unnecessary moving platforms.</p><p>At times, Madeline even dashes through and jumps off of spikes using frame-perfect moves. A guide to movement and some skips for the first level, Forsaken City, is from a TAS run.</p><h2>Old Site Mirror Skip</h2><h2>1m 33s </h2><figure></figure><p>So, this room is really interesting. To activate this cutscene you have to go away from the mirror and then come back to it and then you can skip the cutscene. But there’s a really cool skip where we’ll end up inside the Dream Block. This is a pretty easy to learn skip where we’re going to do an extended hyper and then do an up left dash kind of into the corner. Then we end up inside the Dream Block which is very silly. I don’t really understand why this happens, but your Y-distance is the same and we just get put in the middle of the room. So then you can just dash up!</p><h2>Badeline Fight</h2><h2>1m 49s</h2><figure></figure><p>So, now we’ve got Badeline. Badeline’s gonna be chasing us, and the most important thing is to just keep moving forward if you screw up your intended strat or anything like that just keep moving. Keep moving away from Badeline. She’ll always copy what you’re doing and as long as you don’t sit around and freeze, you can kind of stay out of her way and not die here.</p><h2>Entry Cycle Key Skip</h2><h2>2m 52s</h2><figure></figure><p>So, [let's] talk a little bit about cycles. When you enter the room, that’s what we’ll refer to as entry cycle. We also have something called death cycle and those are different. When you enter a room, when you die in a room, the pattern of the enemies will be different…so you have to be cognizant when you’re practicing to be sure to practice both the entry cycle and the death cycle until you get really really comfortable with going between rooms and you can kind of just prioritize the entry cycle uh stuff like that so…you want to do a super, be sure to extend (it so jump a little bit late) and then up right into the transition…Then you’ll then get your dash back, up right again, and you can climb up to the key! That way you don’t have to climb around.</p><hr><p>[<strong><em>Luke's note</em></strong>: because this is a website and not actually a book, you can watch the run in question below]</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="How To Train A Speedrunner - Celeste" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3H6kFzb8x8Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The first trailer for A Minecraft Movie has dropped, giving us a glimpse of the blocky film adaptation of one of the biggest video games of all time. A Minecraft Movie will be in cinemas from 4th April 2025, for your next dose of video game movie Jack Black.</p>
<p><iframe title="A Minecraft Movie | Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PE2YZhcC4NY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s a lot of things going on this reveal trailer, with four regular world humans pulled into the blocky Minecraft universe. Jason Momoa is the biggest name on the ticket, but there’s also Emma Myers (“Wednesday”), Oscar nominee Danielle Brooks (“The Color Purple”), and Sebastian Eugene Hansen (“Just Mercy, “Lisey’s Story”) who’s definitely channelling some young Paul Rudd, if you ask me.</p>
<p>The four of them will have to figure out how this world works, protect themselves from armies of Piglins and Zombies, get over the weirdly squared-off sheep, and just how high res and detailed all the blocks and lighting are.</p>

<p>But hold on a second. Four people pulled into a twisted video game world? Jumanji called – the newer ones and not the original – and it wants its plot back, please! It would also like one of its acting stars back as well, because Jack Black is back to do more Jack Black things in the role of Steve, an expert crafter who’s presumably been stuck in this world for decades. Come on, film execs. You’re making a movie about using your imagination, and the best you could come up with for you video game movie was to cast an actor who’s literally&nbsp;<em>just</em> been in&nbsp;<em>two other video game movies?!</em></p>
<p>Looking at the early comments on YouTube, and snap judgment are not especially kind to the film. In particular, there’s a lot of comments about having real actors within the very heavily stylised, over-saturated game world, and comparisons to “Minecraft vs Real Life” videos that were common in the mid 2010s. What do you think?</p>
<p>All involved will be hoping to replicate the rampaging successes of other video game movies – not <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/08/the-first-borderlands-movie-reviews-are-in-and-they-dont-hold-back/">Borderlands</a>, though. The gold rush was started in earnest by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/05/13/detective-pikachu-film-movie-review/">Detective Pikachu</a>, which garnered a whopping $450 million, before the first Sonic the Hedgehog enjoyed a $320 million worldwide gross and its sequel $404 million. Everything has now been dwarfed by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/03/10/the-final-super-mario-bros-movie-trailer-looks-like-mad-max-rainbow-fury-road/">The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>, which has a worldwide gross of $1.3 billion. So, of course you’re going to try and adapt Minecraft, which is the best-selling video game of all time, with over 350 million copies sold.</p>

			<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is an upcoming horror game set in the same haunting universe as A Quiet Place. The game is set for release on <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-launches-17-october/">17 October 2024</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. This game is being created by Stormind Games and published by Saber Interactive. Today, a new developer diary was released, talking about the importance of sound design and how it was utilized in A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sound Design in A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SUMKpw_-4fw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For context, A Quiet Place is all about staying as quiet as humanly possible, otherwise you will be captured and killed by horrifying creatures. In this game, you play Alex, someone with asthma, while fighting for her life alongside her boyfriend, Martin. The creatures you are fighting against are completely blind, but have hypersensitive hearing and can hear the smallest of noises. You have to try to stay as quiet as you can while navigating a world full of obstacles and various objects that have the potential to make noise in any capacity.</p>
<p>This developer diary for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead showcases some of the objects you'll have to interact with despite the fact that they can be incredibly noisy and give away your position. This includes rusty gates, cupboards, and even just walking through the city.&nbsp; In the developer diary, Diego Sambataro, the Sound Designer at Stormind Games, takes you through the importance of sound in this game, and how it can make or break your survival.</p>
<p>"The world that we've built mirrors our real world, where different materials not only create different types of noise, but that sound occurs at different loudness." Sambataro says, going on to explain different materials and how they may affect the gameplay: "If you're walking on sand, sound is diffused into the ground and results in quiet footsteps. Walking on compacted dirt may be a little louder. And rusty metal... well, you're going to want to move slowly to keep your volume levels low."</p>
<p>Diego Sambataro explains that every move you make should be deliberate and precise, as the sounds all have different volumes. In A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, you don't know when they're going to scare you the most and throw you off balance. The developer diary for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is just under three minutes long but showcases some of the gameplay elements you can expect to interact with during your time in the game and how the sound will affect you and your survival.</p>
<p>As he goes on to explain, it isn't just surface-level noise you need to be worried about. "Leaves, water, glass, and other materials may be scattered across surfaces, each having their own loudness, which might attract the attention of creatures." It's not only walking that you have to be worried about, though. Even acts like opening doors and trying to scavenge for loot can end your life in a matter of seconds.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/earthion-preview-a-new-game-for-the-sega-genesis.971868/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/earthion-preview-new-game-for-sega-genesis<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>No one is talking about <em>Earthion</em>, but I'm going to do my best to throw it into your line of sight. Consider this: a brand new <a href="https://techraptor.net/genre/shoot-em-up">shoot 'em up</a> (SHUMP) is releasing for the SEGA Gensis, a console that debuted over three decades ago. This SHUMP is retro to the core, rad as hell, and I can't wait to see more: Remember the name <em>Earthion</em>.</p>
<p>Developed by Japanese studio Ancient and published by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/limited-run-games-showcase-gex-more">Limited Run Games</a>, you'll be able to boot up this banger on a physical cartridge and enjoy it the way God intended on that dusty old SEGA Genesis sitting in your closet. Well, it's time to give that bad boy a dusting so you can see why <em>Earthion</em> is so special.</p>
<p>From the show floor of PAX West, we checked out <em>Earthion</em>, so read on to learn more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/earthion-3.jpg?itok=v4eDI8ri 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/earthion-3.jpg?itok=JAsvDUTs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Screenshot courtesy of developer Yuzo Koshiro's Twitter account -- @yuzokoshiro. <em>Earthion </em>as seen running on his CRT screen.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Earthion</em>'s a New Game Running on Old Hardware</h2>
<p>Brand new games running on cartridges designed for long-dead consoles is nothing new; outside of fan-made creations, Limited Run has released certain games with this idea in mind. Knowing this, <em>Earthion</em> has to contend with the limitations of old hardware, but that doesn't stop it from going hard.</p>
<p>SHUMPs put me in an adrenaline-fueled frenzy, and <em>Earthion</em> is no different in that regard. It's about as authentic as it gets, from the visuals and audio down to the gameplay. Its gameplay is simple but elegant and refined, making for a fantastic time.</p>
<p>Take control of a spaceship and blast through space with your standard lasers, or various secondary weapons. You can arm this ship with rockets, extra machine guns, or even a flamethrower. Dodge and weave your way through enemies and avoid getting hit, else you'll lose a precious life.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/earthion-1.jpg?itok=Q7HUrMXG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/earthion-1.jpg?itok=FD24UQSI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Screenshot courtesy of developer Yuzo Koshiro's Twitter account -- @yuzokoshiro</figcaption></figure><p>Sounds like most other SHUMPs, but again, it does exactly what it needs to do. Visually, though, it's outstanding and richly detailed. The spritework is animated to perfection and colors pop, creating one of the best looking SEGA Genesis games (which might be unfair to say as a game coming out in ~2025).</p>
<p>I played the demo twice since it was pretty short, but it was fun enough that it merited even more plays. During the one level I played, a giant ship flies into the screen, presumably an ally, and explodes. This creates a debris field players then need to dodge around as enemy ships come flying in.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/earthion-2.jpg?itok=ObL6WQO1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/earthion-2.jpg?itok=JzoEzZ4O 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Screenshot courtesy of developer Yuzo Koshiro's Twitter account -- @yuzokoshiro</figcaption></figure><p>Soon enough, I arrive at the boss, this strange, robotic ship. It exposes its weak point after shooting some perilous projectiles at me. Shooting this weak spot requires some precision, especially when contending with the projectiles it shoots at you, so it's the perfect challenge for what is presumably an early level of <em>Earthion</em>. Be sure to use the rockets or extra machine guns for extra oomph!</p>
<p>There's only so much one can say about a demo that lasts roughly 5 minutes, but it was enough time for me to know I'm going to love the hell out of <em>Earthion</em> when it releases. For a brand new SHUMP with an undeniably old-school feel, <em>Earthion</em> is one you're going to want to keep an eye on.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-reveals-deliver-at-all-costs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/konami-reveals-wacky-50s-courier-game-deliver-at-all-costs.971865/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-reveals-deliver-at-all-costs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami and developer Far Out Games have announced&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs</em>, a "thrilling action game" based around delivering "highly unconventional cargo" in a wacky late-1950s world.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1880610/view/4597699678395658839" rel="noopener" target="_blank">its announcement post</a>, Far Out Games describes&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>as taking place in a world ruled by rock'n'roll, polka dot fashion, and "the fear of nuclear apocalypse". How delightful.</p>
<p>It's this world you'll be exploring as Winston Green, a courier with the requisite "shady past" all noir-adjacent protagonists need. You'll be delivering packages in a destructible world, driving a variety of different vehicles, and undertaking "bizarre and perilous deliveries".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deliver-at-all-costs-announcement-balloons.jpg?itok=iIPMsyZ9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deliver-at-all-costs-announcement-balloons.jpg?itok=v87v4s_c 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>takes place in a wacky 1950s world full of objects to destroy.</figcaption></figure><p>Deliveries range from "a giant flailing marlin" through to disposing of an atomic bomb "teetering on the edge of explosion", so it's safe to say you won't just be ferrying mundane packages around in&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs</em>' world.</p>
<p>While the world will be chaotic and reactive,&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>does also have a story, and it's one of "mystery and intrigue", according to the devs. You'll meet a cast of "distinct and memorable characters" and watch Winston spiral down into insanity, which feels like an appropriate response to the 1950s.</p>
<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs</em>, which gives a sense of what kind of madcap antics the game will let you take part in, right here.</p>

<p>Although it seemingly won't feature any licensed music, <i>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</i>will offer an original soundtrack to immerse you in the period, as well as 50s-inspired design elements, radio ads, and user interface aesthetics.</p>
<p>In short,&nbsp;<em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>looks rather like what would happen if&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mafia-definitive-edition">Mafia</a>&nbsp;</em>met&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>&nbsp;</em>by way of <i>Totally Reliable Delivery Service</i>, so if that sounds like your cup of tea, then you should be keeping this one on your radar.</p>
<p><em>Deliver At All Costs&nbsp;</em>is set to arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1880610/Deliver_At_All_Costs/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012329" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and Xbox Series X|S, although there's no release date for the game yet. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-the-final-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>After nearly four decades of Zelda games across a ton of different platforms and perspectives, it’s truly hard to predict where Nintendo will take this beloved series. They’ve done open world and end of the world. They’ve had touch controls and motion controls. They’ve been single player and multiplayer. The latest installment, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, is already shaping up to feel like a classic Zelda adventure, and in classic Nintendo form, also features some really cool and unique twists. It’s also the first Zelda game where Zelda is fully playable through the entire story and with that she’s brought a whole new way to experience it.</p><p>By learning “echoes” Zelda is able to quickly build up a collection of objects, creatures, and more that she can use to traverse the world, solve puzzles, and defeat enemies. After some routine world shattering chaos which Zelda is unfortunately blamed for, Echoes of Wisdom opens with a post-jailbreak stealth sequence that plays a bit like the part in Ocarina of Time where Link first sneaks into Hyrule Castle. However, while you might be able to have Zelda brute force this section by just running and hiding, I realized it was immediately much more fun to make the castle guards think they accidentally captured an insane demonic witch who could summon furniture at a whim and torment them with magically materialized objects falling from the sky. Now, I didn’t need to play like this, but hey, it was much funnier that way. A guard tried chasing me down and, in a moment of panic, I summoned a wooden table behind me to block and distract him and probably make him think he was losing his mind or that the place was haunted. I then proceeded to learn more echoes for my permanent collection: a wooden crate, the traditional ceramic pot that Link has destroyed tens of millions of, and more. It immediately made me wonder just how many of these things would become part of Zelda’s repertoire and if I’d be in possession of an entire IKEA catalog by the end of the game. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom - September 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>And that’s where Nintendo’s vision for the next era of top down 2D Zelda games really clicked for me. It’s been eleven years since the excellent The Legend of Zelda: Link Between Worlds was released for the 3DS, a game that notoriously took the rather formulaic and predictable flow of traditional 2D Zelda games and made it much more freeform, allowing players to collect items and defeat dungeons in pretty much any order of their choosing. Since then Nintendo has also completely reinvented the 3D Zelda series. Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom not only gave players a massive open world sandbox to explore at their own pace, they also gave us a seemingly infinite toolset to tackle them. Tears of the Kingdom especially relied on these mechanics, nudging players to build elaborate (or janky) vehicles and contraptions to make their way across the lands and skies of Hyrule. And between Breath of the Wild and Tears, Nintendo gave us The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening, a gorgeously reimagined take on their excellent and uniquely weird 1993 Game Boy game, now with a toyetic and claymation inspired art style. It was about as traditional as 2D Zelda can get and I adored it, but it was also a remake of a game I’d played countless times before, so it didn’t exactly give us a clear vision of where the future of top down Zelda games was heading. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>One of the best parts of being a Nintendo fan is never really knowing what to expect next. </p></div><p>The obvious answer at the time was to remake the Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons games in the same art style since they originally looked and played like Link’s Awakening did on Game Boy. But one of the best parts of being a Nintendo fan is never really knowing what to expect next. Just you when you think they’ll do the most obvious thing, they hit you with a surprise out of nowhere. The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom takes everything they’ve learned from decades of 2D Zelda games, throws in some of the freeform creativity and problem solving from Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, and puts it all together in the beautiful Link’s Awakening remake art style. It’s also solving one of the biggest gripes players have with modern 3D Zelda games by bringing back the traditional dungeons, a key ingredient of this cherished recipe that’s been sorely missing recently. It’s taking all of the best things that the 2D and 3D Zelda games have done and fusing them together to create the future of the series, and so far it’s really working for me. Seemingly every screen in Echoes of Wisdom provided me with an opportunity to approach it in a unique way while still feeling like I was playing an old-school top-down Zelda game. Initially, my impulse was to just slash everything with a sword like I’ve made Link do for most of my life, and I was admittedly a bit frustrated that I couldn’t. It takes a bit to get used to Zelda’s abilities here, but once you find your groove, things start to get really fun and interesting. You could throw rocks at enemies to kill them like some sort of brute savage, but wouldn’t it be funnier to swarm them to death with bats, summon moblins to target them with spears, or my personal favorite: bowling ball them to death with a small army of adorable but dangerous Caramadillos? God, I love these weird little guys. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Zelda does eventually get a sword in Echoes of Wisdom - sort of - by defeating an evil imposter version of Link, taking control of his iconic weapon set, and learning swordfighter form. This form also lets you jump higher and perform spin attacks, but it’s not without its caveats. Zelda’s sword power is on a limited energy budget and once it’s been depleted, she’ll need to replenish it to use it again. It seems like you’ll be able to expand your sword’s energy reserves as you progress through the game, but at the start it can only be used for a brief time before it runs out – at least until you find some more energy again. Nintendo seems keen on making sure Zelda plays differently than Link usually does in these games, and you’ll likely be utilizing her Tri-Rod and its bottomless bag of summonable objects much more often, with her sword being used sparingly and for key moments and conflicts. After all, if you’ve got an ax-wielding Darknut warrior in your back pocket you’re less likely to miss your trusty blade in the moment.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Nintendo seems keen on making sure Zelda plays differently than Link usually does in these games.</p></div><p>Those Darknuts were particularly effective at defeating evil Link, almost to the point where I felt bad doing it. That’s Link! I love that dude! Cornering him with one psychotically possessed Darknut echo, looping around behind him, and spawning another one to catch him off guard proved to be a quick way to confuse and surprise him and deal a bunch of damage, but again, that was by no means the only way to take him down. I probably could’ve bludgeoned him to death with furniture or some other comically horrific way to kill one of my favorite guys. Do whatever you feel you need to do. There’s a limit to what you can summon with your Tri-Rod, with some things costing one point (meaning you can summon several of them) and others using several. I’m hoping you’ll be able to expand your Tri-Rod’s power later in the game, because summoning a small entourage of enemies to roll with you at any time would be really awesome. Or covering half of a screen with pots just because you can.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>One of the highlights of my preview demo was passing the controller back and forth with my fellow IGN Nintendo nerd, Zelda obsessive, and good buddy Logan Plant and seeing how he’d get through puzzles and battles in his own way. We each had unique solutions for problems, and personal favorite things we’d summon and watching somebody else think frantically and react on the fly was so much fun. Things like spiders (complete with climbable webs) and fire items added a chaotic and hilariously unexpected layer to each scenario. A thing you summon won’t attack you or deal you damage, but if it happens to say, light something else on fire, that fire could come back to hurt you. There’s a rules of improv thing happening here that totally works in its favor and created several laugh-out-loud scenarios that rewarded our creativity or stupidity. There was rarely a truly wrong way to solve something here in the same way you could technically cut a loaf of bread with a spoon, but there’s probably a smarter way to make a sandwich. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s a rules of improv thing happening here that totally works in its favor and created several laugh-out-loud scenarios that rewarded our creativity or stupidity.</p></div><p>The Suthorn Ruins dungeon was the perfect proving ground to test all of these toys out. It’s a traditional Zelda dungeon through and through and it looks and feels fantastic. It was truly exciting to finally be back in one of these again. But instead of relying on one newly discovered item or weapon to beat it like you would in an older Zelda dungeon, you’re learning how to summon new things every other minute. You’ve got an entire arsenal to play with, and each room feels rife for experimentation and playfulness. Some puzzles had a clear and obvious answer while others demanded some creativity, and seeing how different people solved them in different ways was a total joy. The speedrunning and sequence-breaking communities out there are gonna have a blast with this game.   </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Traversing the Still World Trailer Stills</h3></div></output><p>This ever-growing library of tools and toys work wonderfully in the overworld, too, which seems absolutely massive by 2D Zelda standards. I am so excited to uncover every single secret on this map. Using your echoes you’ll be able to climb over walls and trees and other obstacles that used to keep you locked to specific paths and routes in the older Zelda games. I’m interested to see how they’ll manage to keep players from rushing to the final dungeon or boss, since as of now it seems like you can climb up and over nearly everything, whether you’re using a spider web or a crude staircase you made out of dirty old beds, which, by the way, will slowly heal Zelda if she sleeps in them long enough, creating a very funny scenario where she takes a nap in the middle of a fight with an enemy if that’s what you feel like doing. I’ve got a lot of questions around how these options will play out in the full game. The final boss battles in most Zelda games are epic and awesome and also generally require a specific sword stab or light arrow for the final blow. Will you be able to kill Ganon by dropping a coffee table on his head in Echoes of Wisdom? Well, who knows, but I’m excited to see players try these kinds of things out. One apprehension I do have is just how you’ll organize your gigantic collection of Echoes as the game progresses. There are a few decent options for selecting items to summon at a whim (like “most used”) but no favorites list as far as I can tell, meaning you’ll often find yourself scrolling through a ton of different objects, creatures, and other assorted nonsense that you might need at any given moment. It’s not necessarily tedious and the gameplay pauses to allow you to find what you need at the moment, but I could see it being a bit cumbersome once you’ve unlocked a few dozen different things in your library. And with nearly every enemy and object in the world seemingly being scannable, you’ll likely have a ton to sort through by the end of the game.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Beds will slowly heal Zelda if she sleeps in them long enough, creating a very funny scenario where she takes a nap in the middle of a fight with an enemy if that’s what you feel like doing.</p></div><p>Echoes of Wisdom is generally incredibly pretty to look at, which is no surprise since it’s using the very charming Link’s Awakening remake art style. The world is teeming with life, quirky characters, and animations, and the town I visited was lovely and I couldn’t wait to meet everyone and snoop around their houses. That said, the Link’s Awakening remake was notoriously taxing on the Nintendo Switch hardware with noticeable framerate dips frequently appearing in the overworld, and while Echoes of Wisdom feels much smoother on that front, there are still moments where it hiccups a bit. It’s not a dealbreaker or anything but it’s worth pointing out. Hey Nintendo, whenever you’re ready to release that Nintendo Switch successor you keep hinting at, we’ll take it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>All in all, Echoes of Wisdom feels like an earnest and clever return to the Zelda games I grew up playing. Challenging, inventive, fresh, and genuinely just really fun. Every new puzzle and conflict is a blank canvas for experimentation, but it’s all wrapped in that distinctively familiar and challenging Zelda game vibe that made me fall in love with these games to begin with. It’s vintage Zelda mixed with the playful and creativity based gameplay that younger audiences are used to building their own stories with these days. It’s not pushing that side of things as far as games like Minecraft, Roblox, or even Tears of the Kingdom does, but it’s also not rigid and specific with the way it makes you approach it. Attempting to juggle several of the core tenets of what makes the Zelda games so special to so many people across so many generations and make them all happy is an extremely tall order. The longer any franchise thrives, the more difficult it becomes to please everyone that approaches it with specific expectations. Every fan has a different reason why Zelda is special to them. But so far, Echoes of Wisdom feels like it’s taking the best elements of the most beloved modern and vintage Zelda games and making them work together in a pretty clever synchronicity. Whether they’ll get along for the whole trip remains to be seen, but right now it feels like a smart move and a truly exciting way to push the classic side of the franchise towards the future.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Borderlands players are no strangers to cracking codes and uncovering secrets in the game franchise, but the latest round of community sleuthing has proven to be especially lucrative. Thanks to a seemingly ordinary card given out at the recent PAX West convention, Borderlands players have received what is arguably the best Shift code in existence, and all it took was a solid grasp of binary language.</p><p>The card in question (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/the-borderlands-series-most-valuable-shift-code-ever-is-now-available-for-everyone-all-thanks-to-genius-fans-cracking-a-secret-code-that-im-baffled-was-solved-so-fast/" rel="nofollow ">GamesRadar</a>) featured a D20 die in the center, and the tabletop icon was flanked by an inconspicuous pattern. Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford posted an image of the card on X/Twitter, hinting that it contained a secret clue in its design, and eventually, <a href="https://x.com/40_BaySt/status/1830194736092807509" rel="nofollow ">user @40_BaySt shared their findings online</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1829729467364716927" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Sorry I didn’t have the strength to make the PAX thing today. I definitely did not want to risk causing any harm by showing up. For those that were there, did you keep your dice cards? We hid a secret code in them.. <a href="https://t.co/3gE1nGZQ6Z" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/3gE1nGZQ6Z</a></p>  — Randy Pitchford (@DuvalMagic) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1829729467364716927?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 31, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The card contained binary code, and once fully decoded, the message was revealed to be a Shift code that could be used to unlock 50 weapons in several Borderlands games and Tiny Tina's Wonderlands. Borderlands 3 players can also use the code to get 10 diamond keys.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/40_BaySt/status/1830194736092807509" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I think my wife figured it out. It's a binary code. Up triangles are 1. Down triangles are O. There are 29 sequences and each sequence is 8 digits. Then you convert the binary to decimal and then to ASCII. Upon doing that you get this... <br>SXFBT-39953-J33TT-3T333-KSHW6.</p>  — Rear Naked Leafs (@40_BaySt) <a href="https://twitter.com/40_BaySt/status/1830194736092807509?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 1, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The code is <strong>SXFBT-39953-J33TT-3T333-KSHW6 </strong>in case you're currently playing Borderlands and want to make use of it.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with it, Shift keys--not the keyboard inputs--can be used on a golden chest located in the Borderlands games, unlocking powerful weapons, shields, grenades, and character mods. These are scaled to your character level, and overall, the keys can be used to add some of the best loot in the game to your arsenal.</p><p>For Borderlands 3 players, the ultra-rare diamond keys can be used to access an entire room of loot, but the catch here is that you can only take one piece of loot from each of the open walls, and there's a time limit in play as well. This is the "most valuable" Shift key ever given, <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1830307657397473586" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to Pitchford</a>.</p><p>In other Borderlands news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-announced-during-opening-night-live-coming-2025/1100-6525977/" data-ref-id="1100-6525977">Borderlands 4 was officially revealed</a> at Gamescom last month.

After debuting to dismal sales just under two weeks ago, Sony made the call to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-new-game-concord-going-offline-after-just-over-a-week/1100-6526235/" data-ref-id="1100-6526235">pull the plug on Concord</a> and delist the title. But in the limited time that the game has left, players are trying to get a rare Platinum trophy by repeatedly killing their own characters in Concord's Rivalry matches.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-players-are-jumping-off-cliffs-in-game-as-they-desperately-grind-for-the-platinum-trophy-before-shutdown" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Rivalry was intended to give two teams of five players a best-of-seven contest to determine the winner. But since both teams get experience points for participating, players have taken to immediately jumping off platforms to their demise. It gives the rival team a win, but it also helps level up the losers as well.</p><p>In theory, developer Firewalk Studios could have added adjustments to Concord that would have made the team-suicide tactic less appealing to players by taking away the benefit. But since the title is only going to be online for an additional two days, it's extremely unlikely that issue will be addressed at all. The real question is whether players have enough time to grind their way to that Platinum trophy before Concord is pulled.</p><p>Sony clearly had grand ambitions for Concord, and the company even lent out the potential franchise to an episode of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deadpool-director-making-a-video-game-tv-series-and-its-not-what-you-think/1100-6525800/" data-ref-id="1100-6525800">Secret Level</a>, Prime Video's upcoming video game anthology series that will premiere in December. Since the game itself will have been offline for months by that time, Concord's spotlight episode will get to be the last reminder of what could have been... at least for the people who aren't chasing that trophy.</p><p>Concord will be taken offline by Sony on September 6. It remains to be seen if it will return, and what form that would take.</p>
