<p>While it might not be the launch title <em>everyone</em> was hoping for, it's still packed with plenty of things to do. This includes a new Knockout Tour mode, a whole world to free roam, and plenty of classic options like Grand Prix, local and online multiplayer, Time Trials, and Battle Mode.</p>
<p>So, how much time have you spent in Mario Kart World so far? What mode have you played the most and what would you rate the game now that you've had an entire month with it (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/of-course-mario-kart-world-is-being-review-bombed">and after that recent patch</a>)?

Many subscribers can get their entire grocery orders delivered. But even if your Walmart doesn't have a full supermarket, it's still nice to be able to get free delivery on random products you'd normally have to drive to the store to buy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>For all the changes that <a href="https://duneawakening.com/">Funcom</a> has made to the world of Dune for the purposes of telling their own story in <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-1-million-copies-sold-creative-director-announces-major-changes-deep-desert-pve-pvp/">Dune: Awakening</a>, the large-scale multiplayer survival game is very faithful to plenty of key aspects of Dune lore.</p>



<p>The Fremen might have been eradicated in Funcom's version of Dune, but their technologies and impact are everywhere, as is the everlasting and iconic weapon, the Crysknife. </p>



<p>You can actually make your own Crysknife in Dune: Awakening, and this guide will show you how to do it. Unfortunately, this is one of the areas where Funcom made some significant changes to the lore that make the weapon more of a collectors item than anything else.</p>



<h2 id="h-dune-awakening-how-to-craft-a-crysknife-guide">Dune: Awakening - How To Craft A Crysknife Guide</h2>



<h3 id="h-ingredients-and-requirements">Ingredients and Requirements</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Before getting into the ingredients required for crafting your own Crysknife in Dune: Awakening, you'll need to have completed the Fourth Trial of Aql. Even if you have the ingredients, the option to craft an Unfixed Crysknife (which is the only kind you can craft) will not appear. Once you've completed the trial, the option to craft a crysknife will appear in your crafting menu.</p>



<p>The basics of crafting a Crysknife are easy, since you only need two items. One is Plant Fiber, the basic grass you pick up practically anywhere on Arrakis in order to craft healing items, and a bevy of other useful pieces of kit. The other, you might've been able to guess if you're a fan of the Dune universe, is the tooth of a sandworm. </p>



<p>That is a little more difficult to acquire, but not too much more difficult. All you need to do is get swallowed up by Shai-Hulud himself. When you respawn after giving yourself up to the worm and dying, you'll find the tooth of a worm in your inventory. It's possible that you'll need to do this twice, since there is also a cutscene that you'll see if you've never died to a sandworm before. </p>



<figure></figure>



<div><p>Critically, though, before you head out to into the desert to jump on some drumsand, make sure you've stored everything in a chest or storage unit in your base. Make sure you have absolutely no equipment on you whatsoever, not in your backpack, not on your person, nothing. You'll respawn, but the equipment you had on you when Shai-Hulud grabbed you for a snack won't. That will stay in his belly and will be lost forever. </p><p>This does not apply to quest items, though, so you don't need to run around emptying your inventory of items you can't be rid of without completing quests if you're hankering to make yourself a Crysknife as soon as possible. Everything else besides quest items that you can't take out of your inventory or off your person, is viable to be lost if you leave it with you when you go out worm-tooth gathering.</p></div>



<p>Once you have 1 Plant Fiber and 1 Worm Tooth, you'll be able to craft a Crysknife.</p>



<h3 id="h-sadly-the-crysknife-is-not-a-viable-weapon">Sadly, the Crysknife is not a Viable Weapon</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>On the one hand, the Crysknife is one of the most powerful weapons in the game, living up to the reputation it is given in the original Dune books. It deals 191.6 points of damage, which is sure to spill the water of anyone willing to stand in your way while you wield the ancient weapon.</p>



<div><p>The problem is that it's incredibly fragile, which is where Funcom's changes come in. It will break after that first swing. It has absolutely no durability and cannot be repaired. This is even the case for any potential Crysknives you may obtain after certain story beats, which is all I'll say without going into spoiler territory. Dune-heads will know that Crysknives are praised for their durability in the books, but that's not the case here. </p><p>It's an incredibly powerful weapon, living up to the legend, but, in Funcom's version of Dune, due to the eradication of the Fremen, it seems that no one knows how to make one that can withstand more than one strike. Or perhaps making it incredibly brittle is just Funcom's way of ensuring you're not walking around with a weapon that does 191.6 damage fairly early in the game. Or, it's a bit of both.</p></div>



<div><p>So yes, you can craft a Crysknife, and just like in the lore, it's not permitted to leave your side, meaning that it'll become a fixed item in your backpack until it's destroyed. Yes, it will still look cool, and yes, it's nice that Funcom has them in the game at all. </p><p>Unfortunately, it's not really something you use unless you want to deliver a powerful one-shot blow to an enemy, whether at a particularly significant moment in Dune: Awakening's story, or if you have some personal vendetta against an enemy that's made you particularly annoyed. You could try it in PvP scenarios, though, due to how hairy those can get, you're better off not leaving yourself unarmed after one strike.</p></div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/games-media-actually-had-a-good-week-for-once.1236231/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The impossible finally happened: We went a full week without a beloved video game publication being gutted or shut down. Instead, The Old Site <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-sale-keleops-go" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ended up in the hands of seemingly benign new owners</a>, and a new home for games writing, <a href="https://www.endlessmode.com/video-games/hi/endless-mode-its-the-new-thing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Endless Mode</a>, sprang forth from Paste’s media mini-empire. On the latest Aftermath Hours, we allow ourselves to experience a small amount of hope for the future.</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by Ethan Gach of Kotaku dot com and Garrett Martin of Endless Mode, two beneficiaries of the only good week for games media in the past century. We talk to both about the state of games journalism and their cautious optimism for the future now that MBA-brained business idiots seem to have moved on from blindly buying up websites for ponzi schemes.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we discuss decidedly less good news: Microsoft just <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laid off 9,000 more workers</a>, many of them in games, resulting in cancellations of multiple promising projects as well as <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-veterans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">general industry brain drain</a>. Finally, prompted by a mailbag question, we talk about the many cool world records we’ve broken, only some of which involve eating a waffle to discover a clue.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can overtake the Joe Rogan Experience on the podcast charts and confuse all the business idiots into believing they got out of the website business at the wrong time, throwing the entire ecosystem into chaos.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Ethan, you’ve been at Kotaku for pretty much its entire up-and-down cycle. Obviously Kotaku has, over that time period and due to a number of factors – none of which necessarily stem from the quality of writing being published – lost readers. What do you think contributed to that, and why was it entirely Jim Spanfeller?</p><p><strong>Ethan: </strong>I can neither confirm nor deny any Mr Spanfeller’s involvement in the success or decline of Kotaku. One of the things that I think is nice about doing subscriptions or having a physical product is, it’s very clear what you’re making and who you’re giving it to and what you can get from them – as opposed to this sort of amorphous internet machine where all of the ad tech is inscrutable to most people and is controlled by very few companies, and you’re increasingly at the whims of forces beyond your control. That’s very different from having a news stand and a direct relationship with people.</p><p>I think so much back to when I first joined Kotaku and what the expectations were – and not realizing at the time that it was kind of the peak of digital media, or maybe right after the peak. It was taken for granted that what people want to do when they’re sitting at work on their computer is visit websites and what people want to do on their phones is visit websites – and that websites are sort of the main distraction. Versus now: People joke about the pivot to video being so dumb and terrible, but that is the content format most people live in. So I think a large part of the decline is just people moving away from a certain medium of getting their information.&nbsp;</p><p>And what you have then is a flight of investors being like “OK, the numbers kept going up here, so we can make money by selling this to the next person. And once the numbers stop going up, we now have to make money off a sustainable business.” And there are far fewer people who want to do that. Kotaku was sold to what is essentially a mom ‘n’ pop media company; Paste is owned by a guy. There are individuals or small groups who might like the idea of running a media business in the same way as I might want to open a restaurant because I like food or I like seeing people. It might be hard to make money that way, but that’s how I want to make the money, because that’s how I want to spend my time.</p><p>I think media is shifting back to needing to rely on people who want to do media to do media and try to make money at it, versus the [mentality] of “We’re flipping houses right now; we’re gonna sell Vice to Disney for billions of dollars.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>The business-brained MBA dummies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ethan: </strong>Right, the dumb money. When that comes into any industry, things start to go off the rails because when any bubble bursts, immediately after the bubble things are worthless. Nobody wants them, or the right people who would want them can’t afford them. There’s an incongruency. The service people need or want is interesting writing. Do the majority of people in the world want to read about a game? 1) They probably don’t play games, and 2) they probably don’t want to read about them. But do millions of people want to read about games? Yes. Do hundreds of thousands of people want to pay to read good stuff about games? Probably. And so I think it’s a matter of finding a sustainable way to do that.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game"><h3>Sid Meier’s Colonization Is The American Video Game</h3></a><p>No game has told the American story better, whether intentionally or not</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/chatgpt-crunchyroll-ai-subtitles-necronomicon"><h3>Crunchyroll Says Anime’s ChatGPT Subtitling Came From Third-Party Vendor, Goes Against Its Policies</h3></a><p>Cyangames’ VR video game anime Necronomicon and the Cosmic Horror Show subtitles had “ChatGPT” smack-dap in its German subtitling

<p>Who needs an OLED TV when you have a widescreen CRT TV?</p>
<p>Okay, genuinely, CRT scanlines are gorgeous and we have a huge soft spot for these chunky units. Sitting on the floor, looking up at the screen as we ran around in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time">Ocarina of Time</a>; pure bliss.</p>
<p>The Switch 2, with its 120fps capabilities and VRR in handheld, is a much more powerful console than the N64 (duh!). So why on earth would we want to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> on a 27 inch CRT TV?</p>
<p>Well, our lovely video producer Zion is here to show you just what playing a Switch 2 on a CRT TV is like, and honestly? It's magical. From newer titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> to retro indie throwbacks like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/celeste">Celeste</a>, Zion's running down the wonderful nostalgia of playing games on an old TV.</p>
<p>Is it the <em>best</em> way to play the Switch 2? No way. Is it fascinating? Heck yes. It takes a fair bit of set-up and it'll vary depending on what kind of TV you have, but if you're interested, check out Zion's video up top and let us know in the comments whether you want to try this out</p>

<p>But new catches, new games, and a new studio are in the net</p>

<figure><a title="Dredge" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4c2c5ca2c7e18/dredge.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Team17</em></figcaption></figure><p>Lovecraftian fishing game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dredge">Dredge</a> was a hit back in 2023, blending unsettling horror and sea creatures with atmospheric storytelling and some good ol' reeling in. Now, after some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/08/reminder-dredges-new-expansion-update-the-iron-rig-is-out-now">paid DLC</a> and free updates, the New Zealand-based developer is ready to move on from the seas and create something brand new — and "No, it's not Dredge 2".</p>
<p>Sharing the news on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/blacksaltgames.com/post/3lt3r7344a22o">Bluesky</a>, the team's next title will be an open-world RPG in a new world and setting. It'll still be dark, of course, but it's something <em>very</em> different from the studio's first shipment.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067rqtmki&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>But that's not the only new announcement; Black Salt has expanded and opened up a second development studio, called Disc 2 Games. "Think bright, colourful and 90's retro!" says the announcement post. Oh, <em>we're thinking, all right.</em></p>

<p>“We’ve taken DREDGE as far as we can technically – especially while continuing to support players on previous-gen consoles,” producer and CEO of Disc 2 Nadia Thorne shared in <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-US/Black-Salt-Games-Announces-New-Studio-and-Next-Projects">a press release</a>. The studio is eager to "turn our attention to something new” and move on.</p>
<p>Programmer and writer at Black Salt Games Joel Mason echoes Thorne's sentiments, saying "It's reaffirming to know that players enjoy the types of worlds that we want to create - and gives us the confidence to try to do it again."</p>
<p>In terms of Disc 2, the studio has apparently been working on their debut game "for a bit over a year now" says technical director Kris Nicholson. And, despite the proposed colourful facade of the upcoming game, creative director Johannes Otte is setting our expectations appropriately; "beneath this polished surface lies a gritty world, waiting for players to immerse themselves in and join our characters in rebelling against.”</p>
<p>This is fantastic news to read in an industry that feels like it's collapsing in on itself sometimes, and we can't wait to see more from both studios.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Metal Gear and Death Stranding creator Hideo Kojima recently echoed Tom Cruise when talking about his future plans, declaring: "I want to keep creating things until I die."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since starting out in the industry at Konami in 1986, Kojima has created a variety of games, including Snatcher, the innovative sunlight-based GBA title Boktai, and the infamous P.T. demo. In a recent interview centering around Kojima’s latest game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/06/26/154443.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game*Spark</a> asked Kojima about his motivations and thoughts on why he continues to make games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m the same as Tom Cruise (laughs)," he said. "My life has been dedicated to creating things. That is my joy. I want to create for as long as my body and my brain keep working. I will think about (stopping) if it begins to inconvenience the people around me, but I want to keep creating things until I die.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/04/gettyimages-2222468111-1751642076261.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Hideo Kojima says he shares one thing in common with Tom Cruise.

On the red carpet, Cruise told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/tom-cruise-making-movies-into-100s-mission-impossible-1236220928/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a> that he will never stop making movies, even quipping that intends to keep making them into his 100s.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Talking of movies, in Kojima’s comment to Game*Spark, he didn't specify creating games, just <em>creating</em>. This suggests that Kojima is open to making something that is not a game in the future. In a recent video interview with French media outlet <a href="https://youtu.be/TfqoXqWsOt0?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brut</a>, Kojima revealed that, depending on how Kojima Productions is doing after it has completed Microsoft game OD and Sony game Physint, he would like to make a movie.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With their long cutscenes and cinematic presentation, some have argued that many of Kojima’s games are already movie-like (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-much-of-kojimas-games-are-actually-cutscenes-we-did-the-maths">we’ve even worked out exactly how much of each Kojima game is cutscenes</a>). However, in the interview with Game*Spark, Kojima addresses this, explaining that even though his games are influenced by movies, he is always focused on making a game first and foremost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I grew up watching movies, so they influence the lighting, character modeling, direction and so on (when I make a game), but I am conscious of the fact that I am not making a movie, and my fundamental approach is to consider what can only be done in a game, including an odd sense of playfulness," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima’s playfulness is evident in some of the unexpected cameos and bizarre Easter eggs you can find in his games, especially if you mess about. Check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/Secrets_and_Easter_Eggs">list of the Death Stranding 2 Easter Eggs, cheats and secrets</a> we’ve found so far, or find out about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-why-is-sam-singing-and-dancing-in-the-hotspring-hideo-kojimas-nostalgic-japanese-comedy-legends-easter-egg-explained">the strange things you can make Sam do in the hotsprings</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Kojima is associated with a movie: an adaptation of Death Stranding itself, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-star-norman-reedus-says-he-would-of-course-play-himself-in-the-upcoming-movie-if-it-was-an-option">which Norman Reedus has said he'd love to star in</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for Kojima Productions.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/tariffs-rising-costs-us-consumers-spending-less-video-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tariffs-and-rising-costs-will-have-us-consumers-spending-less-on-video-games-says-analyst.1236171/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/us-consumers-will-cut-back-on-buying">The Game Business</a> as part of the publication's Summer Game Fest event details a presentation from Circana analyst and executive director, Mat Piscatella, who shows how US consumers are pulling back from spending on entertainment areas, video games included, due to the rising cost of essentials like food and shelter, and the potential impact of tariffs on the price of games and other goods.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Tariffs and Affordability: The US Consumer In Limbo" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F7-9rr_Cuhk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As a Circana analyst, and with the wide range of industries that Circana collects data from, Piscatella has the ability to see the details in consumer spending in the US, and shows clearly how US consumers are concerned over the impact that tariffs will have on the prices of everything, from essential goods like food to the cost of clothes, and, key to Piscatella's specialization, video games. </p>



<p>Whether people are opposed or in support of tariffs, a clear majority (69%) think that tariffs will result in high costs, The Game Business and Piscatella report. To make up for those rising costs, per Circana's data, 30% of consumers will spend less on video games and entertainment subscriptions, with more of their spending money going towards the essentials, as Circana has also tracked that the average cost of food has gone up 2.3% compared to 2024, the cost of utilities has gone up 15.7%, car insurance has gone up 5.4%, and shelter has gone up 4%.</p>



<p>Since the Trump administration first announced its tariffs in April, the response we've seen from players in the US has been a concern for rising prices. Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/">paused pre-orders of the Nintendo Switch 2</a> in the US while it accessed the potential impact of tariffs. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-reveals-the-esa-expects-trumps-tariffs-to-have-a-detrimental-impact-on-the-video-game-industry/">ESA expressed its belief that tariffs will have a "<em>detrimental impact on the video game industry</em>,</a>" and even in The Game Business' report this week, expressed that it has been trying to relay to the Trump administration the significance of the video game industry in the US, and how tariffs could negatively impact what is a $59 billion industry in the US alone.</p>



<p>When pre-orders for the Switch 2 were finally announced, the price of the console stayed the same, but the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-us-hardware-pricing-stays-the-same-accessories-bump/">cost of accessories went up</a>. There's also still the chance that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-president/">cost of the console will increase due to tariffs</a>.</p>



<p>Of course, it's not just the cost of Nintendo products that has a <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-is-considering-a-ps5-price-increase-in-the-us-in-response-to-tariffs/">chance of increasing</a>. With costs going up on essentials, and tariffs looming as a greater threat to raise costs further, the downturn that the industry has been in might not end anytime soon.</p>



<p>When Grand Theft Auto VI arrives, it'll be a much-needed shot in the arm for the video game industry, but it remains to be seen how long the impact of that shot will last.</p>

            <p>In bygone ages, Christian clerics would spend decades hunched over scrolls of vellum and parchment, ornamenting the text with scenes of questing knights, creeping chimeras, spiralling verdure, and perhaps the occasional bare bottom, as a treat. They would sacrifice their wits and tendons to the cultivation of microcosms, planted in the eyes of capital Os, or growing around the bars of capital Es.</p>
<p>Now, you can crap on their efforts by slapping together rad illuminated pages in seconds in a video game editor.

<p>"Fulfil orders from prestigious patrons by making your own designs on pages of medieval books," explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3119540/Scriptorium_Master_of_Manuscripts/">the Steam page</a>. "Create, get paid, and unlock new orders, design elements, and grow your workshop. And with time and practice, your works and fame may reach the Queen herself!"</p>
<p>There are over 1000 scene elements to choose from, all apparently based on real-life medieval manuscript art, and client requests will range from the "quaint" to the "bizarre". You can also take on commissions from let's players, via mechanisms yet to be explained, and "export your in-game designs and create medieval memes to share with your friends".</p>
<p>Memes, eh. Hildegard of Bingen is spinning in her grave.</p>
<p>The playtest includes a stretch of the game's story mode, where you can complete 17 commissions for six clients. There's also a sandbox mode, which includes all the assets from the story. This being a playtest, expect "bugs, rough edges, and weirdness". You might want to try Inkulinati out, too - Rachel (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-you-enjoyed-pentiment-inkulinatis-cheeky-ink-based-strategy-is-a-great-history-lesson">expressed enthusiasm</a> for its monk-on-monk action and "uppity bishop cats".

<p>No one could USB-C this...</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Switch 1 and Switch 2 USB-C" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/75ab9eb41aa1c/switch-1-and-switch-2-usb-c.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>With the launch of the Switch 2, accessory manufacturers have been rushing to bring their products to the market in a bid to offer alternatives to Nintendo's own set, including docks. The latter has been causing headaches for many, and it seems Nintendo has put in place restrictions on the console's USB-C ports.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/695915/switch-2-usb-c-third-party-docks-dont-work-authentication-encryption">The Verge's Sean Hollister</a> has been looking into the Switch 2's USB-C port and was told this was the case after speaking to two accessory manufacturers. What should happen is that, when the console is popped into a dock via the USB-C adapter, it kicks off a series of commands that allow the power supply/dock to output video. That's an <em>extremely</em> oversimplified explanation. That's not happening when you connect the Switch 2 to most third-party docks, however.</p>
<p>According to The Verge's sources, the Switch 2 uses a new kind of dedicated encryption chip and scheme and, upon testing, Hollister saw (as he puts it) "the new Nintendo Switch not behaving like a good USB citizen should".</p>
<p>As a result, companies like Jsaux have told The Verge that it's halted plans to make a Switch 2 dock because they simply can't get around the problem right now. Hollister has found some docks that work so far — the <strong>SIWIQU for Nintendo Switch 2 Dock Station</strong>, AverMedia's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EwdSkzN7Iw&amp;ab_channel=AVerMediaContentCreators">own dock</a>, and Viture's virtual glasses hub.</p>
<p>Others on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1lmbroo/siwiqu_antank_s3_max_dock_works_perfectly/">NintendoSwitch2 subreddit</a> say the same thing about the SIWIQU, but there's understandable caution when very few <em>actually</em> work, and when early Switch 1 docks also caused problems.</p>

<p>Manufacturers expect Nintendo will try to "maintain device and system security" via updates, and the Switch 2 does have extra fans — including a fan in the dock itself — as the console runs a little hotter than the Switch 1. It may well be that there's something in Nintendo's upscaling tech that's causing issues with other docks. Or, it could just be that Nintendo is trying to prevent any potential issues that may be caused by unofficial docks.</p>
<p>It's a more powerful dock all around, and it does much more than the Switch 1's ever did. So it looks like this will be an ongoing battle, though we're sure that we'll see plenty of third-party options pop up in the future.</p>
<p><em>Let us know what you think of Nintendo's potential restrictions in the comments</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Capcom has announced a new Resident Evil mobile game called Resident Evil Survival Unit. Developers Joycity and Aniplex are leading development on it while working in collaboration with Capcom.</p>



<p>Survival Unit is currently being described as a real-time strategy game, though full details on it are still to come at a <a href="https://www.residentevil-survivalunit.com/en">livestream presentation</a> that'll take place next week on <strong>July 10, 2025, at 3pm PT / 6pm ET / 11pm BST</strong>. We at least know that it'll arrive on iOS and Android devices, and that it'll be available in North America, Europe, Japan, South Korea, and Asia.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While a new real-time strategy mobile game might not be the most exciting thing to Resident Evil fans who are just counting the days until <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-started-as-an-open-world-game-before-capcom-realized-it-wasnt-what-fans-wanted-to-see-or-play/">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, what is significant about Resident Evil Survival Unit is that the co-creator of the Kingdom Hearts games, Shinji Hashimoto, is behind the game. He even announced the project during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9WogwxRWbI">Anime Expo Lite livestream</a>, where he expressed that its a project he's been working on bringing to light for some time.</p>



<p>"<em>The title offers a fresh take on the 'Resident Evil' universe,</em>" Hashimoto said, "<em>introducing a strategy game system designed specifically for mobile users. While distinct from Capcom's traditional 'Resident Evil' series, it delivers a unique experience that stays true to the essence of the franchise.</em>"</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>It's been a devastating week for the games industry as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">hundreds of employees</a> have lost their jobs at Xbox as a result of a round of layoffs across parent company, Microsoft - layoffs that have totaled in excess of 9000. It's been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">a depressingly regular</a> story in the video games industry over the past few years, and it's likely things are going to continue in this vein throughout the rest of 2025. It's bleak out there.</p>
<p>Once seen as a recession-resistant field, developers and publishers have been making layoffs in significant numbers for the past few years; you may remember headlines noting 860 layoffs at Epic, 1800 redundancies at Unity. 900 by PlayStation, 530 at Riot - and even a previous 1900 by Xbox.</p>
<p>This week, Microsoft instigated an additional round of layoffs - that makes four rounds in under two years. Microsoft told Eurogamer these layoffs were "necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace."</p>
<p>To help you process these seismic events, we have broken down the updates of the week into headers so you can more easily digest the land as it stands as we head into the holiday weekend of 4th July.</p>

<p><strong>Affected projects and personnel</strong></p>
<p>Rare's fantasy adventure Everwild, announced over six years ago and mostly kept quiet since, has reportedly<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts"> been cancelled</a>. Subsequently, Gregg Mayles - who has been at Rare for a massive 35 years - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-and-banjo-kazooie-director-gregg-mayles-reportedly-leaving-rare-after-35-years">announced his departure from the company</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/perfect-dark-reboot">The reboot of Perfect Dark</a>, developed by The Initiative, <a href="http://eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">has been cancelled</a> as part of the latest round of cuts at Microsoft. The reboot of Rare's series was first announced back in December 2020, and has been in development at The Initiative ever since. After numerous setbacks, Tomb Raider developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-perfect-dark-reboot-will-be-co-developed-by-crystal-dynamics">Crystal Dynamics was brought in to assist</a>; but it seems the project will never see the light of day. Joanna Dark actor Alix Wilton Regan <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/joanna-dark-actor-asks-fans-to-call-for-perfect-dark-to-be-saved-as-adam-jensens-actor-details-financial-loss-due-to-cancellation">implored fans to use their voices</a> to save Perfect Dark, after the game was cancelled by Microsoft earlier this week.</p>

<p>Romero Games, the small Irish game development studio set up by veteran games devs John Romero and Brenda Romero, had its funding pulled by Microsoft, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-next-shooter-project-loses-funding-following-microsoft-cuts">ending development of an all-new shooter IP</a>. Unconfirmed reports suggest the entire development team has been laid off.</p>
<p>Forza Motorsport "is no more", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-motorsport-is-no-more-claims-former-turn-10-employee-following-microsoft-cuts">claims a former Turn 10 employee</a>. Ex-content coordinator, Fred Russell, shared a post on Facebook with images from across his time working on the series, noting: "Turn 10 Studios has shuttered the Forza Motorsport space and the team is no more." <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a> development, it's suggested, will continue.<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsynuplq222l"> Per Bloomberg's Jason Schrier</a>, almost 50 percent of Turn 10 staff has reportedly been laid off.</p>
<p>Chris Linn, senior producer at Zenimax Online Studios, has confirmed the cancellation of an unannounced MMO - codenamed Blackbird - on LinkedIn. "Today was one of the biggest disappointments of my 35 year long career in games. My disappointment isn't primarily for myself, but for my team, and for players that will never get to play the amazing game we were building." Zenimax Online Studios president Matt Firor also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenimax-online-studios-head-matt-firor-announces-departure-following-widespread-layoffs-and-the-cancellation-of-in-development-mmo">announced his intention to step down</a> as a result of the layoffs and the cancellation of the unannounced game.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division">Per Bloomberg</a>, Microsoft's King mobile gaming division is laying off 200 people - that's around 10 percent of the workforce. Non-game specific teams have also been affected. As reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/697111/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-user-research-child-safety">The Verge</a>, employees in Xbox's user research team have been laid off, including head of product for family and child safety Mike Mongeau.</p>
<p><strong>Xbox response</strong></p>
<p>Xbox head <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> addressed this week's job cuts in a memo to staff (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff">IGN</a>).</p>
<blockquote><p>"Today we are sharing decisions that will impact colleagues across our organization. To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business and follow Microsoft’s lead in removing layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness. Out of respect for those impacted today, the specifics of today’s notifications and any organizational shifts will be shared by your team leaders in the coming days.</p>
<p>"I recognize that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before. Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we're seeing currently is based on tough decisions we've made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come.</p>
<p>"Prioritizing our opportunities is essential, but that does not lessen the significance of this moment. Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted. These decisions are not a reflection of the talent, creativity, and dedication of the people involved. Our momentum is not accidental — it is the result of years of dedicated effort from our teams.</p>
<p>"HR is working directly with impacted employees to provide severance plan benefits (aligned with local laws), including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources to support their transition. Employees whose roles were eliminated are encouraged to explore open positions across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority review.</p>
<p>"Thank you to everyone who has shaped our culture, our products, and our community. We will move forward with deep appreciation and respect for all who have contributed to this journey."</p></blockquote>
<p>In an email to staff - seen by Eurogamer, Jason Schrier and <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-is-closing-down-xbox-studio-the-initiative">Windows Central</a> - Xbox's studio head, Matt Booty, added:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Following Phil's note, I want to share more about the changes to the Studios business units," the email reads.</p>
<p>"We have made the decision to stop development of Perfect Dark and Everwild as well as wind down several unannounced projects across our portfolio. As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, The Initiative. These decisions, along with other changes across our teams, reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape. We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment."</p></blockquote>
<p>In a remarkably tone-deaf follow-up to the layoffs, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> Publishing executive producer Matt Turnbull suggested laid-off staff use generative AI to help with the process of finding a new job. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brandon.insertcredit.com/post/3lt4diia3xc2l">A since-removed LinkedIn</a> post read:</p>
<blockquote><p>"I know these types of tools engender strong feelings in people, but I'd be remiss in not trying to offer the best advice I can under the circumstances. I've been experimenting with ways to use LLM AI tools (like ChatGPT or Copilot) to help reduce the emotional and cognitive load that comes with job loss."</p></blockquote>
<p>Turnbull's post continued with a series of generative AI prompt ideas for helping employees find new work, and an invitation to "share with others in your network."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/job-losses-studio-closures-cancelled-games-what-we-know-about-xboxs-devastating-wave-of-layoffs]]></content:encoded>

The first one is out today, and it's utterly adorable.</p>
<p>Shared by <a href="https://www.serebii.net/anime/other/morpeko'sfirstouting.shtml">Serebii</a>, <strong>Morpeko's First Outing</strong> is the first episode of a new series called <strong>Pokémon Summer Stories</strong>, which we can only imagine are cute little adventures focusing on the fun of the summer holiday season. With added Pokémon, of course.</p>
<p>This episode focuses on Shota and his companion Morpeko. Shota joins up with his friends Haru and Takeru, who are all heading to a beach festival to see the Pokémon Bisharp. You can watch the whole 11 minute episode below.</p>
<p>While it's currently only in Japanese right now, that doesn't stop us admiring the lovely animation style and seeing some of our favourite Pokémon looking brighter and more-colourful than ever. Hopefully, as more episodes come out, they'll get an English dub (or subs!).</p>

<p>Pokémon is, of course, no stranger to animation, and there are a few exciting projects coming up for the multimedia franchise. <strong>Pokémon</strong> <strong>Concierge</strong> is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/02/netflix-confirms-new-episodes-of-pokemon-concierge-are-on-the-way">set to return to Netflix with brand new episodes</a> in the future, and British stop-motion animation studio <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/pokemon-announces-collaboration-with-wallace-and-gromit-studio">Aardman are currently working with TPC on a "project'</a>.</p>

But that’s not enough penance! We’ve done <em>so much wrong</em>. So here come another 10 indie games that are going under the radar, this Indie-Penance Day.</p><p>Same situation as before: these are the results of a clarion call released on BlueSky, for indies to submit links about their games via email, selected at random, and included below without my having played them. With something like 300 emails coming in now, it feels very unfair that only a minority of submissions can be picked, but it exemplifies the state of indie gaming. So many games, so few outlets willing to take a punt on covering them.</p><p><strong>So I say to all other outlets</strong>, you’d think that articles like these might be something I “get away with” while the <em>Kotaku</em> team is away barbecuing their flags or whatever it is Americans do today, but the reality is: <em>these articles do really good traffic!</em></p><p>There’s cold, capitalist money to be made in indie coverage! Don’t assume it all needs to be teasers for the trailer for the next <em>Call of Duty</em> skin drops—these Indie-Penance posts often end up in <em>Kotaku</em>’s most successful articles for the month.</p><p>Right, lecture over, let’s get on with cooing at really interesting-looking forthcoming indie games!</p></div></div><div><p>This super-pretty game is about helping two characters—Ben and Abi—separately explore a puzzly, platforming world, in both single-player and co-op. What the trailer above doesn’t make clear is that there’s an extra level to it, where you rearrange the world they’re exploring like a sliding tile puzzle, to change how you approach the challenges.</p><p>The one thing I cannot figure out, however, is why this has a “2" in the title! There’s no evidence of a <em>Lost Twins 1</em>, making this incredibly odd. But who cares, when this game from a three-person Pakistani team looks so lovely.</p><p>  <strong>Developer:</strong> Playdew<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> August 2025<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1752540/Lost_Twins_2/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1752540/Lost_Twins_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Page</a></span> </p></div><div><p>I’m a sucker for a esoteric game name, so <em>Your Holy &amp; Virtuous Heretic</em> draws me right in. That’s then doubled down on when the developer behind it is called ‘i will bite raw coffee beans.’ Fortunately, this super-lo-fi first-person, turn-based RPG looks as weird as its surrounding names. It’s about the occult, magic, technology, and turn-based combat, but combined with free exploration, and I’m just so damned intrigued. There’s a demo if you’re equally curious.</p><p>  <strong>Developer:</strong> i will bite raw coffee beans<br><strong>Release Date:</strong> TBA<br><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2621030/Your_Holy__Virtuous_Heretic/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2621030/Your_Holy__Virtuous_Heretic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam Page</a></span> </p></div><div><p>“Ride a bike into the dark forest,” <em>Vicious Cycle</em> instructs you, as you enter a very spooky-looking first-person puzzle adventure. The game is played in two ways: firstly by riding your bicycle through scary woods, dodging monsters and trying not to be dead; the second exploring on foot, solving puzzles in what look like quite escape-room-inspired ways.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">Microsoft laying off 9,000 people</a> across the company this week, with a significant portion of them coming from its Xbox and gaming business, meant several projects being cancelled before they could see the light of day. One of the more significant cancellations was a game codenamed <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">Project Blackbird</a>, and MMORPG from The Elder Scrolls Online developer, ZeniMax Online.</p>



<p>More details about what this MMORPG would have become have been trickling out since news of the layoffs started to break earlier this week, like how recently, development on the project was progressing well despite some <a href="https://wccftech.com/canceled-zos-mmorpg-was-heading-in-a-great-direction-and-new-engine-had-found-its-footing-says-lead-graphics-programmer/">early issues with the game's engine</a>. Microsoft's chief executive officer of its gaming division, <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-reportedly-loved-playing-zenimax-onlines-new-game-in-march-only-to-cancel-it-in-july/">Phil Spencer, reportedly loved what ZeniMax Online was creating</a>, even going so far as to needing the controller ripped from his hands in order for a meeting to actually continue. </p>



<p>Clearly, though, not even Spencer's admiration of the game could get in the way of <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-xbox-ai-tools-game-development-laying-off-thousands/">Microsoft's larger AI-driven goals</a>, which are reportedly a key factor behind the cuts. </p>



<p>As far as what Project Blackbird would have become, we've already heard a few details from reports that described it as a third-person shooter that would have had a sci-fi setting, with a major focus on player movement as a key aspect of gameplay, with players having the ability to double-jump, dash, make use of a grapple hook, wall-climb. It was as key to the gameplay as shooting would have been, according to reports we've already heard. Now, a new report from <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/canceled-xbox-mmo-project-blackbird">True Achievements</a> goes into even deeper detail as to what Blackbird was going to be, describing elements of its story, setting, and gameplay. </p>



<p>True Achievements corroborates what we've already heard, that ZeniMax Online was building a sci-fi setting and a third-person shooter/action game, and further elaborates on the setting, claiming that players would have stepped into the shoes of a type of character called a Revenant, "<em>an operative working for alien syndicates on a remote, tidally locked planet called Soteria</em>."</p>



<p>Soteria was said to have been an ice planet on one side while the other was constantly sweltering under an oppressive sun, with an area in the middle called 'The Twilight Band' that was actually habitable. There was a sentient AI named PAN, a race of aliens who thought they were better than everyone else, various syndicates that players could side with, an aquatic race of aliens, a furry alien race, and a race of aliens that could purge the depths of your mind for secrets. All solid ingredients for the foundation of a sci-fi world.</p>



<p>Missions could involve up to four players, with some larger missions involving up to six players at a time, each dolled out by the various syndicates you could work for. Humans also fit into the story, with the various alien races understandably cautious about humans after a high-ranking alien officer was killed in a human neighborhood. That's where much of Blackbird's "<em>alien noir themes</em>" came from, as you dug into the mystery behind the murder and rose through the ranks of this sci-fi world.</p>



<p>All together, this MMORPG from ZeniMax Online sounds like it would have been something far more expansive than what it had built with The Elder Scrolls Online, which is one of the worlds largest and most successful MMORPGs. There's never a guarantee that any game will be a hit, but everything we've heard about Project Blackbird so far suggests that it was going to be something incredible. Now, its cancellation remains a stain on the legacy of the current Microsoft leadership and their clear inability to manage talented developers and studios.</p>

"I am going to screw on my happy cap and try to find some upbeat/quirky news, because I feel like we could do with a bit," I declared to the RPS Slack just now, after writing our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-studios-canned-blackbird-game-was-a-nimble-high-flying-shooter-claims-report">eighth layoff/cancellation post</a> this week. The very next thing I click is a link for a game about <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3842300/Hell_Builder/">building hell</a>. Not today, Satan. "Amnesia flying meat orb! Amnesia flying meat orb!" <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qpJsLRhvUk">suggests</a> James. James, you are not helping. Why are you never helping. Oh, what's this? An unbeatably broken <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-bosses">Elden Ring Nightreign bossfight</a>? Perhaps this is the champion who will lead us out of our endless technofeudal apocalypse. No seriously, I think Animus, Ascendant Light is really onto something, here.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The misfiring FromSoft bossfight in question is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-everdark-sovereigns">Nightreign's enhanced Everdark Sovereign edition</a> of the Sentient Pest, which is actually three bosses in one. The basic version of that fight pits you against two huge insects. The enhanced edition adds a massive red moth which swoops in when you kill one of the other two and possesses it, reviving the creature in a powered-up state.</p>
<p>You can damage the red moth by attacking the revived critters. The trouble is, Animus has been going AWOL. Despite a hotfix this week, players continue to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1lrhc2e/we_killed_the_two_so_fast_that_animus_bugged_out/">report cases</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/fromsoftware-is-struggling-to-squash-an-elden-ring-nightreign-bug-that-sees-its-new-third-boss-bug-vanish-from-a-notorious-duo-bug-fight-making-it-impossible-to-win/">Gamesradar</a>) of the battle extending indefinitely because the third boss refuses to show up. The trigger condition for this issue appears to be killing both the original bugs at the same time, but the situation remains murky. A permanent solution is <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1941051928022339943">forthcoming</a>.
</p>
<p>
I enjoy this partly because it suggests Animus is refusing to play favourites between the two other pests, and partly because it feels like Animus has been taking notes from <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/just-walk-out-you-can-leave-running-skeleton">Da Share Zone</a> - and who could blame a From Software boss for wanting to Just Walk Out, Skeleton (co-op player battles if your quick). These magnificent creatures have been getting their faces kicked off for a decade, with Youtubers dedicating whole careers to their dissection, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Nightreign</a> specifically is a live service mincing machine. You could fill a kaiju birdfeeder with all the Sentient Pests players have chopped and shredded so far.</p>
<p>So good on Animus, I say. Good on it for washing its proboscis of the whole stinking debacle. Good on it for divesting from the GaaS industry. I am going to follow in its footsteps by refusing to come to work tomorrow. That'll teach the status quo who's boss.
