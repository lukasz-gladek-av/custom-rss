                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>: Mists of Pandaria Classic will launch July 21, Blizzard has announced, and there will be a new way to get brought up to speed for those who haven't played some of the game's previous Classic expansions.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard has long sold WoW character boosts, and in WoW Classic, started selling them ahead of the arrival of The Burning Crusade Classic. The boosts give players who didn't play the previous expansion a chance (for a price) to jump straight into the new content. This time, however, Blizzard is giving players a way to earn a boost for free, but it will require some legwork.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uYGvtbrDiiw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uYGvtbrDiiw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">One free level 85 character boost will be given to players who defeat the Dreadlord Balnazzar, the first boss of the new Scarlet Enclave raid added in April to WoW Classic's more <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-classic-season-of-discovery-looks-to-make-a-20-year-old-game-surprising-again/1100-6519561/" data-ref-id="1100-6519561">experimental Season of Discovery servers</a>, before June 30. Those who have already defeated Balnazzar prior to the announcement of the promotion will be retroactively awarded a boost.</p><p dir="ltr">The boost can be used to instantly bring a character to level 85 on the game's Cataclysm servers, which will soon transform into Mists of Pandaria servers come the arrival of the expansion pre-patch on July 1. Players will need an active WoW subscription to take advantage of the boost, as it's required to play WoW Classic.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a nice way for Blizzard to attempt to convert some Season of Discovery players to jump into Mists of Pandaria Classic, but given the amount of time and effort required to gear up to take on the Scarlet Enclave raid, the number of players who will be able to take advantage of the free boost seems like it will be fairly small. Perhaps an additional reward will be enough for some players to push through, but for those who can't be bothered, Blizzard is also offering a $80 bundle that includes a paid level 85 character boost, game time, and additional cosmetics. Mists of Pandaria Classic itself doesn't have a box price, but does require a subscription or active game time to play.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW Classic: Mists of Pandaria comes roughly a year after Blizzard brought back the Chinese-themed expansion in the modern version of WoW for a limited time as part of its first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-might-make-leveling-a-new-character-fun-again-with-mists-of-pandaria-remix-event/1100-6522559/" data-ref-id="1100-6522559">WoW Remix event</a>. While still featuring modern WoW's gameplay, the event saw players make new characters and speedrun through Mists of Pandaria content with faster leveling speeds, powerful gems that triggered additional effects in combat, and new limited-time rewards like mounts and armor sets.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-legion-is-getting-the-remix-treatment-blizzard-confirms/1100-6531479/" data-ref-id="1100-6531479">WoW's next remix event will be for the popular Legion expansion</a> later this year. Meanwhile, WoW's long-awaited <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-20-long-years-wow-is-getting-player-housing-in-its-midnight-expansion/1100-6527718/" data-ref-id="1100-6527718">player housing system</a> is still on track to arrive as part of its Midnight expansion.

That's the question Greek highschooler Angelos Mako faced last year when he set out on a journey to rescue his favorite Flash game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3053950/Dungeon_Rampage/">Dungeon Rampage</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, made by Rebel Entertainment. That journey only concluded after tracking down a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeon Rampage</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> programmer who'd long ago left the game industry...who had the only existing copy of its source code on a laptop handed down to his child.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mako's journey reflects the intense preservation effort in the world of Flash games. Ever since Adobe </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/38-000-flash-games-will-live-on-after-flash-support-dies-this-year-thanks-to-flashpoint">ended support for the animation and game-making technology</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in 2020, thousands of games were wiped from the internet. Despite </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-strong-museum-and-kongregate-partner-to-preserve-flash-games">preservation efforts</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeon Rampage</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> vanished into the ether.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over two million people used to play </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeon Rampage</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on Facebook every month. But after a respectable five years of life, the online multiplayer dungeon crawler was shut down in 2017. While some fans attempted to revive it in 2021 via </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/DungeonRampageRemakeV1">Patreon</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, lack of access to the game's source code proved things difficult. Now Mako and Gamebreaking Studios are bringing it back.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Gamebreaking CEO Taylor Hellam, Mako contacted art and creative directors who worked on the original release, who led him to Rebel Entertainment CEO Mike Goslin. Goslin helped the teen locate the last engineer on the project who was solo-maintaining the title for three years (Hellam witheld the engineer's name out of respect for his privacy).</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/over-250-brazilian-devs-have-signed-a-letter-over-alleged-mistreatment-from-gamescom-latam" target="_self" data-discover="true">Brazilian devs publicly accuse Gamescom Latam of alleged mistreatment</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That was when the engineer discovered he still had a copy of the source code on a hand-me-down laptop he had given to his daughter. Mako then took the unusual step of securing the IP rights to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeon Rampage</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and contacted Gamebreaking Studios for support. Gamebreaking is now developing and publishing the revived game.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Reviving Flash games like ">Reviving Flash games like <span>Dungeon Rampage</span> is no simple task</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Making it possible to get </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeon Rampage </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">back up and running has proved to be "quite an archeology project." The title was originally structured like an MMORPG, with Flash being used as a game client connecting to a server-side backend that was responsible for almost everything. When accessing the source code, the team realized the backend was written in an old C++ and PHP code that took a while to work around.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We’ve since migrated the backend to a fully containerized, cloud-based setup complete with CI/CD pipelines, so we’re able to continuously ship and test new versions at any time," Hellam told Game Developer. "The Flash portion of the game also required several updates to function properly. And getting it working with Steam required significant effort as well."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/with-an-ipo-on-the-way-let-s-dig-into-discord-s-revenue-strategy" target="_self" data-discover="true">Discord's rumored IPO has us digging into its revenue strategy</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hellam said that reviving Dungeon Rampage will require turning the free-to-play game into a premium title—one that will still receive free content updates. It's a signifier of how the free-to-play environment has changed since the heyday of Dungeon Rampage. Modern free-to-play games rely heavily on monetization models like "gacha and lootbox mechanics," as Hellam described them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The studio is buoying this monetization change with a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gamebreaking/dungeon-rampage">Kickstarter campaign</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, meant to fund development</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As the game sells, we’ll be able to set funds aside that we’ll reinvest in development, adding new content and features over time," Hellam said. "Our dream is to keep iterating on this game for many years, guided by community feedback."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Developers continue to foster preservation of Flash games">Developers continue to foster preservation of Flash games</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Flash games have been a surprisingly </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/flash-game-preservation-evolves-with-the-elephant-collection">robust field for preservation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

In February of this year, EA </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-deploys-command-conquer-games-source-code-to-the-masses">shared the source code</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for several Command &amp; Conquer games on Github, commissioning a modder named Luke "CCHyper" Feenan to help with the restoration.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Yet, preservation projects around Flash games are a standout.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a> players are facing yet another delay for the beleaguered city builder's first major DLC expansion, with publisher Paradox Interactive having announced a new release window of "Q4" this year - closing in on two years after it was originally due to launch.
</p>
<p>
Cities: Skylines 2's troubles are well documented; the city builder sequel got off a disastrous start in 2023, forcing developer Colossal Order to reprioritise its development efforts amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-fans-complain-of-performance-woes-after-developer-admits-it-missed-target">significant criticism of the game's performance</a>. Initially, the studio had planned to release its first DLC - the Beach Properties Asset Pack - shortly after launch, but it was delayed into the following year, while all other announced DLC (the Urban Promenades and Modern Architecture Creator Packs, and the Bridges &amp; Ports expansion) shifted from Q1 2024 to Q2.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, the Beach Properties' eventual arrival did little to improve the community's goodwill; it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-publisher-refunds-dlc-and-admits-we-let-you-down">slammed by players for its high price and lacklustre content</a>, leading Colossal Order to announced an 'indefinite' delay for all future paid DLC. Bridges &amp; Ports was moved into 2025 as a result, but a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-dlc-gets-further-delays-as-developer-priorities-assets-editor-for-mods">further delay was announced last September</a>, while Colossal Order focused its efforts on completing what it called the "crucial" assets editor.
</p>
<p>
In the months since, Colossal Order has continued to make improvements to the base game and <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/modding/cities-skylines-ii-region-packs">launched some free "region" DLC</a>. But that "crucial" assets editor remains unreleased, and now the studio has opted to delay Bridges &amp; Ports yet again, moving it out of Q2 this year into Q4. "We've spent the last five months working hard on the Bridges &amp; Ports DLC, and towards our upcoming expected release," the studio <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/free-patch-and-updated-plans.1760205/">wrote in a message shared on the Paradox forum</a>. "After reviewing the content ourselves and sharing it with our early access group, we've received consistent feedback: the bridges are super exciting, and the port works well, but there are aspects of the expansion that are not as polished as they could be."
</p>
<p>
"That left us with a difficult choice," it continued, "delay the release once again to add more depth, or release it as-is, knowing players may feel it falls short. We believe the current content is enjoyable, but we're not blind to what's missing, and to bring it to the level you deserve, we need more time... We're assessing feedback from our early access group and mapping out what we want to improve when the expansion launches - which we are now expecting in Q4 of this year. This is still a beautiful expansion, and we're excited about what it will add to your city. We just want to ensure it adds enough to meet your deservedly high expectations."
</p>
<p>
Cities: Skylines 2 players won't, however, be left waiting for new content until the end of this year. Colossal Order has elected to release the free update it was originally intending to ship alongside Bridges &amp; Ports on 11th June, offering "a bit of content that gives a slight sneak peek of what is to come in the expansion". It'll include two new bridges, three leisure piers, and three quays, with <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/free-patch-and-updated-plans.1760205/">more details available in today's forum post</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for Cities: Skylines 2's much-delayed console port, there's still no hint as to when that might arrive. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-console-release-gets-delayed">originally due to launch alongside the PC version</a> back in October 2023, but has remained in limbo since then, with Colossal Order admitting it has struggled to overcome "hardware limitations" impacting performance on Xbox Series X/S and PS5. Back in March, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2s-troubled-console-release-sounds-like-its-still-some-way-off">warned</a>, "We will not have a release before summer", but there's been no update since then.

			<p>Developer Redemption Road Games has <a href="https://x.com/Kingmakers_Game/status/1927416166772801659">announced</a> that Kingmakers, its third-person shooting strategy game that sends you back in time to the medieval era with an assault rifle, will arrive on PC in early access on October 8, 2025.</p>
<p>When Kingmakers was first revealed in <a href="https://x.com/Kingmakers_Game/status/1759943842466582568">February 2024</a>, it had a small viral moment with its admittedly hilarious announcement trailer, where you watch a pickup truck smash through legions of armored knights that can't do anything but ragdoll against modern horsepower. Cut to watching a soldier firing shotgun shells into enemies chasing after him with swords, and Kingmakers immediately appeared to be a fun, chaotic time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingmakers - Early Access Release Date Trailer | tinyBuild Connect 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/52u8LIuzA-Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That moment helped Kingmakers reach more than a <a href="https://x.com/Kingmakers_Game/status/1868768562388910113">million wishlists on Steam</a>, with excitement continuing to build since. It'll be interesting to see how players react when they're able to play it themselves at launch this coming October.</p>
<p>It'll be launching as an early access game, of course, so we should expect that it won't be perfect. But the core concept of being able to run through armies of knights with a gun or a tank looks like it'll be a roaring good time, and hopefully, Kingmakers is able to make that key draw to the gameplay feel as good as it looks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/parrying-bad<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Long before parrying became the topic of the day thanks to <em>Clair Obscur</em>, I was a firm believer in a truth many of you are just now discovering: parrying is bad, and video games should stop having it.</p><p>And look: I get that I’m known on this site for <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-hate-double-jump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unpopular opinions</a> about <a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-camera" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beloved mechanics</a>, but with anti-parry sentiment at an all-time high, you might be feeling more open to my point of view. Many haters of <em>Clair Obscur</em>’s parry system are coming from the pro-parry camp, taking umbrage with the timing or animations compared to other games. But rather than filling your head with <em>more</em> parry thoughts, rather than ranking games with some unnecessary rubric, rather than playing armchair developer to Sandfall and getting into arguments on Steam forums, you could join a righteous cause (mine) and free yourself from this problem altogether.</p><p>Parrying in video games sucks. It features in <a href="https://gamerant.com/soulslike-games-best-parry-mechanics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many games</a> with hand-to-hand combat, giving you the opportunity to deflect an enemy’s attack and, unlike a dodge that just keeps you from taking damage, knock an enemy off-balance or do some damage of your own. I can see why the promise of the parry is appealing, but think about the reality: It is precise and finicky, relying on an audio cue or narrow timing window to perform successfully. If you’re in a hectic combat situation, you already have enough to pay attention to.</p><p>I won’t hide the fact that my stance is informed by the fact that I am terrible at parrying. But I would argue this is not my fault. In real life, I briefly took a fencing class in college, so I understand the <em>concept</em> of what it is to parry, and it is an action I have pulled off with variable success in the physical world. But, whatever the boosters might say, I don’t think this action translates well to video games. In third-person games like <em>Clair Obscur</em>, it can be hard to understand when precisely you should parry; these kinds of games have to give you wind-ups and clues to help you know when to enter into their simulation of objects moving through space. Parrying is inherently a first-person activity; if you are seeing it in third-person it means you’re not part of the parrying situation, and as such have no need to know when someone should parry. Mind your own business!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In first-person games, like my <a href="https://aftermath.site/stealth-game-no-detection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beloved</a> <em>Dishonored</em> and its betrayal via parry inclusion, the sort of calculations you’d do in the physical world are functionally impossible when ported to the virtual. In real life, you inherently sort of <em>know </em>how to work with the length of a sword, how fast it’s moving, how long your own sword is, and how far away you are. The oft-overlooked miracle that is moving your body through space is just <em>what bodies do in space</em>; when you remove the bodies and the space, the whole concept basically falls apart. Video games have to turn parrying into an animation that must be entered into correctly; they have to introduce all those clues you’re required to parse, turning the whole thing into some kind of cruel rhythm game, because there is no way to recreate actual parrying. You lose the spontaneity, the freedom, the responsiveness imparted to you as a bonus gift for having a human body. And you then use that human body to fumble through some cruel shadow of “parrying” with your fingers, cheapening not just the idea of the parry, but the full potential of your human form.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When discussing my stance with my Aftermath colleagues, the conversation quickly devolved into points about iframes and hit boxes; i.e., shit for sickos. Do you want to be a sicko? Do you want to have to not just learn about but <em>care about</em> ticky-tacky coder stuff when you are just a person trying to play a video game? Any mechanic that requires a fine appreciation of code is not a mechanic for the people; it is an exercise in exclusion and elitism. Are those your values? Is that the side of history you want to stand on?</p><p>You don’t need any of this shit. Even if you aren’t like me, a man who doesn’t care for the finer points of video game combat and just wants to look at cool monsters while mashing buttons, surely you must recognize that video game combat is sufficient without the addition of the hateful parry. Consider the <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/compare/MAT.6.28-33#:~:text=Matthew%206%3A28%2D33%20New,arrayed%20like%20one%20of%20these." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lilies of the field</a> and be satisfied with what you have. Acknowledge the abundance already before you. Simplify your life. Reject the parry.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/parrying-good"><h3>Parrying Is The Best Thing In Video Games</h3></a><p>Everybody’s gangsta until somebody parries your bullshit</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/doom-bathroom-renovation-something-awful-for-sale"><h3>Please Know That The House With The Doom Bathroom Is For Sale</h3></a><p>Calling it a 'uniquely remodeled home' seems like an understatement</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hockey-stickhandling-video-game-dangleverse"><h3>This Video Game Is Also a Hockey Training Tool</h3></a><p>Dangleverse, which I've been using to practice hockey off the rink, is in beta right now</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/parrying-good<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gaming, much like life, offers a range of responses to sticky situations, especially in action games. Whether it’s an boss slowly walking toward you or a fighting game rival ready to signal the choir to “<a href="https://youtu.be/GqM_-p_wK_U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">somebody’s getting fucked</a>,” players typically face three choices: freeze — staying locked in place eating shit until their foe drops a combo; flight — playing footsies, creating distance, and reassessing a smarter angle of attack; or fight, meeting the challenge head-on, pressing buttons, and praying you get a couple good hits in edgewise. But there’s a hidden fourth response — fawning, the art of appeasing stress to sidestep conflict, where you play the role of the immovable object to an unstoppable force. You don’t flinch, you don’t dodge, you don’t flee. You stand firm, nullifying attacks with pure precision, proving that you can see through your adversaries' nonsense and that countering it is light work for you. In my twisted mind, this response is the quintessential instinct behind parrying, the ultimate flex in video games.</p><p>Parrying is one, if not the, most satisfying mechanics in video games. Unlike its more reserved cousin, the block, parrying is the golden child of combat-oriented games—the one who earns a spot at the adults’ table at family get-togethers, gets their cheek lovingly pinched by grandma as she dotes on her favorite little pookie bear whenever it recounts moments where it took a high-risk gamble that paid off thanks to its uncanny ability to turn defence into dominance.&nbsp;</p><p>Parrying is my favorite thing in gaming. Although it may not be the safest option in battle, it yields the greatest reward by willingly putting yourself in harm's way and coming out the other end unscathed. The only thing dashed against the rocks in the wake of a well-timed parry is your opponent’s pride.&nbsp;</p><p>As the parry-er, the mechanic is one of the most empowering elements you can earn in gaming. It’s an art that proves your ability to get the proverbial camel through the eye of a needle, shutting down an enemy’s offense before it starts. In the most Pavlovian sense, games like <a href="https://youtu.be/8NqX3Kj6qec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> reinforce a successful parry with a sharp, satisfying clang. This soundbite, like the high-pitch ding of a headshot in a shooter, is like the game patting you on the head for being the smartest (and most disrespectful) player in the room. Congrats, you just effortlessly batted that attack away like it’s nothing. Your dick is huge.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="RULES OF NATURE" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WM33Hr94SKw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Games hold up their end of the deal by rewarding this mastery of fisticuffs. A well-timed parry can leave an opponent wide open for an all-out assault, like <a href="https://youtu.be/QkWa-hxv3A4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Tekken 8</em>’s universal low parry</a>. It can also signal fun times ahead, serving as a flashy preamble to bombastic games like <a href="https://youtu.be/q2MHp6_SSMs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</em></a>, a great equalizer in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/563522/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-ps5-pc-xbox#comments" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a>, a <a href="https://youtu.be/R2Lboca6KUQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">damage multiplier in<em> Sea of Stars</em></a>, or even the only path to victory in games like <a href="https://youtu.be/R2Lboca6KUQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Battle Fantasia</em></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Parries are so quintessential to an action game’s depth that they’ve become a staple across the genre. While not all parries are made the same, many have narrow timing windows, with high scrutiny for what counts as a parry. Some games introduce the elusive perfect parry, which completely dismantles an enemy with a devastating stun effect by countering at the very last second. Games like <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> act as an ideal introduction to the killer mechanic, weaving parrying into its rhythmic gameplay to help players intuitively grasp the timing. This instinct naturally develops over time. Parrying is almost like using The Force, but instead of blindly firing into the Death Star, you’re tapping into the rhythm of an enemy’s attacks, finding the perfect beat to cut in, and executing a devastating counter, turning defence into a dominant dance of health-bar draining syncopation.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="ICONIC Esports Moments: EVO Moment 37 - &quot;The Daigo Parry&quot; (Street Fighter)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/klaWV-szmnY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Witnessing a parry is just as hype as executing one. Case in point: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzS96auqau0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Evo moment #37</a>—the legendary fighting game showdown where Daigo pulled off an almost impossible comeback against Justin Wong in <em>Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike</em>. Instead of holding back and blocking, which would have led to inevitable chip damage and defeat, Daigo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzS96auqau0&amp;pp=ygUNZXZvIG1vbWVudCAzNw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">parried every hit from Chun-Li’s super</a>, Houyoku-Sen, with surgical precision. Fifteen strikes on the ground and mid-air nullified in the FGC’s most remarkable display of a player hard reading their opponent in the clutch, creating the perfect opening to punish and steal victory from the jaws of defeat.</p><p>One of my absolute favorite parries in games is <a href="https://youtu.be/NnkDgq_E1qQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kiryu Kazuma’s Tiger Drop</a> in the <em>Yakuza</em>/<em>Like a Dragon</em> series. Tiger Drop is so absurdly powerful that the subsequent titles use it as the carrot on the stick as one of the final items in its skill tree, with flavor text that casually reminds players that it negates all damage. A fact made even funnier when you remember Kiryu patented it in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mc_hQr-2sk&amp;pp=ygUOa2lyeXUgdnMgdGlnZXI%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fight against two tigers</a>.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Dante VS Vergil DMD SSS motivation" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/p79oSkNMhIY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>And then there’s Dante’s <a href="https://devilmaycry.fandom.com/wiki/Royalguard_Style#Devil_May_Cry_3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">royalguard</a>, a technique that teeters between being a block and a parry (but we’ll count it). The <em>Devil May Cry</em> wahoo pizza man builds up negated damage with a calm, kung fu stance before detonating it straight back onto his enemies. In the manga, Dante himself admits to hating the move, saying its busted style robs him of the joy of testing out his flashy rolodex of weapons and fighting styles in his arsenal. But in battle, it’s the ultimate “nuh uh,” capable of <a href="https://youtu.be/ShFPq_eDS7U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ending a boss fight before it even begins</a>.</p><p>Parrying is the ultimate risk-reward gamble, a mechanic that adds an irresistible layer of challenge to action games. It’s the moment where the player stops being the hunted, flips the script, standing ten toes down against the storm and seizing control. With perfect timing, the player orchestrates the flow of combat, shifting momentum in their favor like a benevolent hand tipping the scales of battle. Parrying is challenging to master, but then again, nothing as euphorically gratifying ever comes easy.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/doom-bathroom-renovation-something-awful-for-sale"><h3>Please Know That The House With The Doom Bathroom Is For Sale</h3></a><p>Calling it a 'uniquely remodeled home' seems like an understatement</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hockey-stickhandling-video-game-dangleverse"><h3>This Video Game Is Also a Hockey Training Tool</h3></a><p>Dangleverse, which I've been using to practice hockey off the rink, is in beta right now</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>It's a big day for Ubisoft's The Division 2, as the game has joined the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Xbox Game Pass</a> library alongside the debut of its new expansion, Battle for Brooklyn.</p><p>The Division 2 is available via Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, and Game Pass Standard. People who subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate get a perk in the form of the free EMS outfit, which itself includes five EMS-themed items.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S65EIG8H3Z4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/S65EIG8H3Z4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The Division 2 comes to Game Pass just as the game's seventh year of live service begins with the Year 7 Crossroads update. This season is all about nostalgia, with new modifiers and gear that are callbacks to the original The Division, Ubisoft said.

However, both games will feature new story elements.</p><p>Outside of the HD-2D graphical facelift, the battle system has been refined, and the games include quality-of-life updates. Square Enix also teases new content for both titles and plans to provide specific details later.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V5_-SwBuzZE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V5_-SwBuzZE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>If you want all three Dragon Quest remakes in one package, Square is launching a digital-only bundle called Dragon Quest HD-2D Erdrick Trilogy Collection on the same day for $99.99.

    <div id="main-content">
  

        <p>I've convinced myself the whole thing is an elaborate prank</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> isn't a real game, right? I mean, I'm sure it is a real game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-gta-producers-next-game-mindseye-has-a-release-date-though-im-not-sure-if-youll-find-it-everywhere">it's meant to be coming out June 10th</a>, that's only two weeks away now, and GTA 3 to 5 producer Leslie Benzies is helming it. It just doesn't feel like a real game. Take for instance the fact that the game's latest trailer, which was released today, is its first proper gameplay trailer. There's been a few teasers over the past few weeks, but absolutely zero extended looks at the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>. That's weird for a game due out in two weeks!
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Plus there's just the game's whole vibe. The UI isn't awful, it just feels like the kind of thing you'd see in maybe the game's first trailer, but then you watch a video titled "All Of The Differences Between MindsEye's First And Second Trailer" and see how it's improved. The gameplay itself looks like something you'd see in a TV show that made a fake video game to have a character play for an episode, there's a CPR rhythm-mini-game for heaven's sake, what's going on here? Are we back in 2009?

<p>
Everything about the narration of the dialogue is generic, wishy-washy nonsense too. They just feel like words to fill a space. Sure, there's some explanations for what you can do in the game, I just don't feel like I've been given a single reason to care. The whole thing just feels like a way to spend a lot of money.
</p>
<p>
There's also user generated content that can be built off of MindsEye, the trailer boldly saying that the game is the "home of infinite entertainment", a very bold claim considering it still needs people to make stuff in it first.
</p>
<p>
MindsEye just has the vibe of someone asking a 12 year old what their perfect game would be despite not knowing a lick of what makes anything good or interesting in the first place.
</p>
<p>
The trailer did also provide a roadmap for future updates, which include a couple of "special" collaborations, more missions, multiplayer, that kind of thing. Nothing that makes me think MindsEye will become a real game, but hey, maybe this thing's the next Fortnite. Probably not.

Industry analysts have been waiting for Sony to follow suit even as the tariff situation continues to shift every other week. </p><p>But so far the company has held its ground. It told investors earlier this month that it had a few months of runway thanks to PS5 inventory that had already been shipped into the U.S. It looks like it’s going to at least get through the Days of Play sale that ends on June 11 before making any larger changes to its PS5 pricing policy. Those might not happen until and unless a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1927421344087523353&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1927421344087523353" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">90-day pause on certain tariffs expires in August</a></span>. </p><p>While competition from Xbox continues to dwindle as Microsoft first-party exclusives go multiplatform, the Switch 2 could steal some of the PS5's thunder this year. With no <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> coming in 2025 anymore, more focus will be on <em>Mario Kart World</em> and whatever else Nintendo has lined up for the fall, especially if Trump’s trade war with China continues and the price of a PS5 or PS5 Pro goes up by $100 or more.</p><p>In the meantime, anyone thinking of picking up a PS5 Pro probably won’t find a better opportunity, especially as big games continue to push the existing console hardware past its limits the deeper we go into this generation. A PS6 is already rumored to be in the works for as early as late 2027. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Why We Gave Assassin's Creed Shadows An 8</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As for the second crossover, it's with indie sensation <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/balatro/" data-ref-id="5000-589348">Balatro</a>. A Balatro-inspired trinket for Naoe and an amulet for Yasuke, both called "Winning Hand," have been added via the update. The items sport a legendary perk that has a chance to trigger a random affliction effect on combo enders. Ubisoft, however, isn't simply giving aways the new item. The patch notes state players will need to "work together to figure out how to get it" but doesn't offer any other clues, so let the hunt begin.</p><p dir="ltr">On the gameplay side of things, update 1.0.5 brings some welcome improvements to the Assassin's Creed Shadows' parkour. A new vertical jump option has been added, allowing players to jump up to nearby ledges or awnings without having to wall-run. Other additions include the option to make it so sprint no longer disengages when parkouring up or down, as well as enhanced distance and height for back and side ejects, making it easier for Naoe to keep to the rooftops.</p><p dir="ltr">Aside from bug fixes, the other major additions via update 1.0.5 are new photo mode features (like the ability to change the time of day and toggle headgear on or off). Assassin's Creed Shadows' preorder quest, Thrown to the Dogs, is now also unlocked for all players, and revolves around helping a loyal canine companion avenge his master. Completing the quest unlocks the Tsuki-maru pet that can be placed in the game's hideout. The full Assassin's Creed Shadows patch notes are below.</p><p dir="ltr">Patch 1.0.5 is just the latest addition to Assassin's Creed Shadows, with Ubisoft having already detailed what's next for the open-world RPG as part of its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-year-1-roadmap-outlines-new-story-content-and-improved-parkour/1100-6531235/" data-ref-id="1100-6531235">Year 1 roadmap</a>. An Assassin's Creed Shadows update earlier this month added a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-assassins-creed-shadows-update-announced-adds-new-story-mission-and-fixes-a-deer-problem/1100-6531312/" data-ref-id="1100-6531312">new story pack</a>, with updates planned for later this year set to introduce new game plus, additional free story content, and the Claws of Awaji expansion.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Shadows Update 1.0.5 Patch Notes</h2><h2>PATCH SIZES:</h2><ul><li>PS5: ~3.31 GB</li><li>XBS: ~19 GB</li><li>MAC: ~9 GB</li><li>PC: ~13 GB</li><li>Steam: ~4.3 GB</li></ul><h2>PATCH HIGHLIGHTS</h2><h2>"Thrown to the Dogs" Quest Unlocked</h2><p>With this update, all players will receive access to the pre-order bonus quest, "Thrown to the Dogs". Help a loyal dog avenge his late master and unlock Tsuki-maru as a pet to place in your Hideout.</p><p>The quest is available in early game, once you have completed "From Spark to Flame". It can be found at the Tennoji Temple, outside of Osaka.</p><h2>SPECIAL COLLABORATIONS</h2><h2>Dead By Daylight Event</h2><p>We're excited to unveil our first special collaboration with this new Dead by Daylight event coming to Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p><p><em>As villagers begin to disappear, Naoe becomes suspicious of the strange presence attacking the local people of Harima. To succeed, you will need to master unique mechanics and confront a formidable otherworldly threat...</em></p><p>This event comes with a new free quest that you can access from the Hideout upon unlocking Yasuke as a playable character. Once the event is completed, you will obtain a free trinket and banner.</p><p>You will also be able to further personalize your two characters with a Dead by Daylight-inspired pack in the store, featuring outfits, weapons, trinkets, and the chance to ride off into the shadows with none other than the loyal steed, Maurice.</p><h3>Balatro Trinket</h3><p>We are also adding a new trinket for Naoe, and an amulet for Yasuke called "Winning Hand" -- directly inspired by Balatro. These new items come with a legendary perk that gives you a chance to trigger a random affliction effect on combo enders.</p><p>Now... you will need to work together to figure out how to get it!</p><h2>PARKOUR IMPROVEMENTS</h2><p>The team has prepared a bunch of improvements to enhance the parkour mechanics. We want to give a big thank you to all our dedicated parkour players for their ongoing feedback since launch.</p><p>Here are the main changes:</p><h3>New Vertical Jump</h3><p>We're adding a brand-new parkour interaction allowing both Naoe and Yasuke to jump and grab any ledge, awnings or overhangs within reach, reducing the need to rely on vertical wall-runs. To trigger it, simply press the jump button as you approach low overhangs, and your character will make the jump.</p><h3>Sprint Toggle Lock</h3><p>As long as the directional inputs are maintained, sprint no longer disengages when using Parkour Up or Parkour Down.</p><h2>Enhanced Back and Side Ejects</h2><p>We've also enhanced the distance and height of side &amp; back ejects, favoring foot landings over hand landings. This includes new animations for Naoe when performing height-gaining side ejects, extending her capacity to remain high-up during parkour.</p><h2>NEW PHOTO MODE FEATURES</h2><p>Photo Mode is receiving its biggest update for an Assassin's Creed game, with the addition of new features to better customize your shots and make the most out of capturing the beauty of Feudal Japan.</p><p>These include the following options:</p><ul><li>Change the time of day</li><li>Play around with numerous poses and facial expressions</li><li>Toggle headgear on/off</li><li>Play music while editing your shots</li><li>Sticker colorization</li><li>New customization frames</li><li>Save Custom Filters</li><li>Reset only one parameter</li><li>Tweak camera speed</li><li>Improved preview mode</li><li>Fullscreen (PC only)</li></ul><p>We hope you enjoy these new customization options! Don't hesitate to share your new Photo Mode shots online using #ACPhotoMode for a chance to be featured on our social media channels (@AssassinsCreed).</p><h2>LIST OF BUG FIXES</h2><h3>General</h3><ul><li>Fixed the issue where players had a persistent New Item notification in their inventory. <em>We did it!</em></li><li>Addressed an issue where some players were given a new save file at level 60, with gear and all objectives uncovered.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the desynchronization warning for 'killing civilians' would appear without any reason.</li><li>Fixed an issue where romancing Lady Oichi before romancing Rin could cause a breakup.</li><li>Fixed various localization issues.</li></ul><h3>Balancing</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where the Samurai Daisho and Ronin occasionally gave an extremely high amount of Mon regardless of their level, disincentivizing other methods of gaining Mon.</li><li>We have also partially rebalanced the Mon economy to encourage more world exploration and gameplay activities to earn Crafting Materials and Hideout Resources instead of purchasing them through merchants.</li><li>In pursuit of this, we've bumped up the cost of Crafting Materials and Hideout Resources sold by Merchants and lowered the quantity available each season for each Merchant.</li><li>If you still want to purchase them, we've increased the amount of Mon acquired from completing contracts.</li></ul><h3>World</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where Yagoro would become trapped in a Kofun and not return to the hideout.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could remain stuck inside the construction site at Osaka Castle.</li></ul><h3>Quests</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where players could not exit the quest "Vision of Realms" if they selected 'Quit to Memories' and loaded their progress from the Animus Memories menu.</li><li>Fixed an issue where quitting during the "Nobutsuna Sensei" quest caused Yasuke to become stuck in the flashback.</li><li>Fixed an issue where Yaya doesn't join "The League" after being successfully recruited.</li><li>Fixed progress issues in the "Showdown in Sakamoto" quest that happened if Katsuhime previously died.</li><li>Fixed an issue in the "Wake Up Call" quest where the "troublemaker" couldn't be hunted down.</li><li>Fixed an issue in the "Find Local Dishes" quest where Narezushi could not be obtained from merchants.</li><li>Fixed an issue in the "Wolves and Foxes" quest where players were not able to speak with Hattori Hanzo. <em>I guess we'll let you talk to him now.</em></li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not progress in "A Peculiar Guest".</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not complete the "Missing Missive" quest due to being unable to retrieve the letter.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the game would crash during the "Temple of the Horseman (An Eye for an Eye)" quest.</li><li>Fixed an issue in the "Diary of Lady Rokkaku" quest where Katsuhime's letter would sometimes disappear. <em>You got mail!</em></li><li>Fixed an issue where the game incorrectly believed Katsuhime was dead and players could not complete the "Diary of Lady Rokkaku" quest.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not complete the "Diary of Lady Rokkaku" quest due to Naoe and Katsuhime being attached to surrounding water. <em>They just wanted to go on a little swim!</em></li><li>Fixed an issue where players could not complete the "Diary of Lady Rokkaku" quest due to Katsuhime dropping into the water and swimming to shore.</li></ul><h3>Stealth</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue where the Shinobi Bell effect was blocked by line of sight from NPCs.</li></ul><h3>Combat</h3><ul><li>Adjusted an issue where the +600% affliction buildup engravings was a text error.

It’s a 1:1 replica straight from the TV show, complete with a screen that runs Fallout animations, an FM radio, and a working clock. At $199.99, it’s a bit of a splurge, but man, if you’re a fan, it’s the kind of thing that makes you stop and stare every time you walk past it. Before I break these deals down, let's take a look at what Magic: The Gathering and Pokémon TCG wins i've found this morning:</p><p id="mtg-final-fantasy-bundle"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="MTG FInal Fantasy Bundle">MTG Final Fantasy Bundle Walmart Preorder</h2></p><div catalogid="840f5339-ee1a-4f4f-9923-f0b63792a061" id="221751"><div id="221751" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>MTG FInal Fantasy Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the only preorder I can find from a big box retailer this morning, and it's actually cheaper than the market value over on TCG Player right now. Imagine that? If you're planning on picking up Final Fantasy at launch, this is a no-brainer.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MTG Final Fantasy TCG Player Preorders</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards">MTG: Final Fantasy</a> is set to be the biggest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-your-first-look-at-over-a-dozen-new-cards-from-magic-the-gatherings-upcoming-final-fantasy-set">Magic: The Gathering</a> set ever, which is a shock to absolutley no-one. Preorders are drying up at retail, but there's plenty of choice available on TCG Player right now. I've found all the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-preorder-restock-latest-amazon">preorders</a> listed so far (including prerelease boxes) alongside massive cases on booster displays.

I've even found some pricing on cases of sealed product for those looking to rip open a tonne of boosters, so get on it before the market value on these products shoot up.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">MTG Spider-Man Single Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunatley there's no listings for Spider-Man single cards right now considering we're a few months out from release, but I've managed to round up the listings for cards currently sitting on TCG Player waiting for presale allocations, so keep your eyes peeled.</p><p id="slashing-legends-tin"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title=" Slashing Legends Tin"> Slashing Legends Tin In Stock At Walmart</h2></p><div catalogid="840f5339-ee1a-4f4f-9923-f0b63792a061" id="221750"><div id="221750" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3> Slashing Legends Tin</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Featuring a new promo, Journey Together and Surging Sparks boosters alongside Obsidian Flames and Paradox Rift, this is arguably one of the best Pokémon TCG tins people can buy for retail value right now.

Almost everything is way above MSRP and seems to becoming the new normal for big box retailers. I could write a whole article and why this is and what should be done to stop this practice, but here we are. If you have your heart set on opening booster packs, have at it, but you might want to check out the sections below to save money.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TCG Player Has The Same Products For Less</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">TCG Player and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-pokemon-tcg">Pokémon TCG</a> secondary collectors market is significantly cheaper than big box retailers at the time of writing.

A Chapter based on Scott Cawthon’s legendary animatronic horror series <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-by-daylight-is-finally-getting-a-five-nights-at-freddys-killer-and-hes-voiced-by-matthew-lillard">will finally, officially arrive in Dead by Daylight</a> June 17, marking the end of a long wait and the beginning of another year of more crossovers, quality-of-life fixes, and more. It’s a collaboration years in the making, and we got a first look at how it’s shaping up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN sat down to interview Dead by Daylight Creative Director Dave Richard and Killer Designer Jason Guzzo ahead of the upcoming Chapter’s public test build (PTB), which launches today at 9 a.m. PT / 12 p.m. ET, to learn more about how this latest collaboration stays true to the looks and lore of Five Nights at Freddy’s. Alongside learning more about how the new Killer, Springtrap, uses doors, cameras, and jump scares to terrorize Survivors, our chat revealed more details about some of the other horror icons Behaviour would love to add and exactly how much Markiplier they watched to prepare for the new update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Eager Nintendo Switch 2 fans will also be happy to know that Behaviour confirmed with IGN separately that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-every-nintendo-switch-game-with-compatibility-issues-on-nintendo-switch-2">Dead by Daylight's startup issues on the device</a> will be resolved by the time the new console launches next week, June 5. Meanwhile, the team has an explanation behind why they opted out of including a new Survivor this time around, but if we’re lucky, Freddy Fazbear’s time in Dead by Daylight is just getting started.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/27/dbd-ketchup-ch36-character-art-killer-vf-dynamicpose-1920x1080-1748353673542.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Springtrap comes to Dead by Daylight. Image provided by Behaviour Interactive.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Heading into the PTB, how are you feeling about how Springtrap looks and feels to play compared to other past Killers in previous PTBs.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dave Richard:</strong> Jason will be able to answer that in more details, because, of course, he's the main designer on this. I feel excited. I feel confident. We know that this is the top-requested franchise and Killer. It has been for many, many years, so a little bit stressed as well. There's a lot of hype, there's a lot of expectation, but the team did great to be authentic and to create a very, very cool Five Nights at Freddy's experience within the Dead by Daylight metrics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jason Guzzo:</strong> I mean, I think Dave put it pretty well, I have not been at behavior for 23 years and on DBD since the beginning, so I think my stress is a little higher than his. For him, it's like, 'Oh, this is just part of the, part of the flow.' But for me, this is, this is my third Killer. So yes, I did Chucky and Dracula previously, but being able to kind of be trusted with FNaF on DBD was so awesome. I'm really excited about it. It takes us almost a year to do a Killer, so it's really cool to finally be able to say, like, 'Oh, here's what we're doing,' and everybody can see it and play with it and let us know... hopefully their view on it aligns with ours, and hopefully they love it as much as we did.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Just reading over some of the details I saw beforehand, this seems so authentic to Five Nights at Freddy's and what the gameplay is in that series, which I didn't expect. I didn't expect to see doors, cameras, and even jump scares. Were there discussions about playing as other animatronics, or was it always Springtrap the team had their eyes on?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> Obviously, it's not something we can answer easily on, like, all the inner workings that we have with our different partners. There were many, many iterations of what this Chapter could be, and we ended up here, and it's great, and that's all I can share.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>This is the first time players get to play a spring trap in a video game, which I'm sure for the Five Nights at Freddy's community is huge. Can you talk about what it's like creating original gameplay for this character with such a limited blueprint to base things off of?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Guzzo:</strong> That's a great question. Really, like, as you implied, the gameplay from FNaF is very different from DBD - drastically different. So really, the goal was to say, 'What's the experience of FNaF? What the - my favorite word in the whole world - what's the vibe? That's the millennial word: 'What's the vibe?' So, I mean, I watched, no joke, about 70 hours of content. I won't name names, but the king of FNaF. Everybody knows who it is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> Shoutout to Markiplier. Yeah!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Guzzo:</strong> [Laughs] I mean, I love him now. I hadn't really watched him before, and now I've watched so much of his FNaF stuff, and I'm subscribed. I watch all of his new videos and stuff. It won me over. But no, it was really cool to be able to kind of see, not only just the gameplay. I'm going to be honest: I don't love jump scares as a player. I love horror movies. Horror games with jump scares... I'm a bit of a baby about it, but it was cool to not only just watch the gameplay, but watch, of course, the streamers' reactions and the people playing it in the community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When you watch people playing live, you see the community interacting. Also, just seeing what people react to... because you can make a game like FNaF, and you go, 'Oh, it's all going to be jump scares,' and people just kind of ignore that, and they kind of focus on something else. So, being able to watch somebody play, and watch people play, and read all the lore - because Five Nights at Freddy's lore is crazy - and just say like, 'Well, what are people reacting to, and how can we kind of adapt that to into the context of DBD?' There was a lot of back and forth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was a lot of cooks in this kitchen on this Chapter because everybody has ideas for FNaF. It's the big one. Everybody wanted to make sure that it was as authentic as possible, and, of course, everything went through Mr. Scott Cawthon. So, yeah, it was really cool to do all that research and take a ton of notes and say, 'What can we mess with and what can we do, and how can we enhance DBD with a flavor - or with the vibe - and the experience of FNaF.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> I have to jump back to the very start of that question, when you talk about the announcement and how people reacted. I had the chance to reveal it was Springtrap at PAX, and in that room there was almost 1000 people, and they shouted so loud that the floor was shaking. It was just... it just amazing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It's super exciting and a big moment for everyone right now. I spoiled it a little bit, but can you guys give me more detail about what players can expect from Springtrap in the PTB, a little more specifically? How does your version of this Killer and that new map do the character justice?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> Jason, that's all for you. I just want to say real quick that, going back to your previous question, you know, the task that the team had was quite challenging. To distill that vibe and to have the mechanics of a single-player experience where you're the Survivor transformed into that duality, that you can create that fear, or you can experience it in another kind of way, in a very different kind of game. Before we jump into the mechanics of it, absolutely, we wanted jump scares. That's part of the vibe. Absolutely we wanted to create these moments of hunting corridors and of surveillance. Then the thing I'm really happy about, and Jason, you'll be able to describe, but that whole door thing was not an afterthought, but it was a thing that you came up with afterwards, and it made it through, and it's absolutely brilliant.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Guzzo:</strong> Wow. The creative director, calling me brilliant [laughs].</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> You can end the interview now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Guzzo:</strong> [Laughs] So, he is primarily a projectile Killer. The power kind of comes in two flavors. There's two halves of it. I'm gonna attempt to ramble and go on tangents a little bit, but I promise I'll get to where I need to be in a second. One of the things that I wanted to do with this one was, as mentioned, FNaF is like a Survivor game, right? In the context of DBD, you're playing from the Survivor's point of view. You're sitting in the security office, and you're managing the battery, and you are trying not to get yourself killed. So, I wanted to kind of step back and say, 'How can we enhance the Survivor side of the gameplay for this Chapter?' Because that's kind of what people know from FNaF.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obviously, we couldn't just say, 'Oh yeah, all four people stand still and open and close doors and manage a battery' - that's not DBD. What we came upon was the idea of, 'Well, the security doors, they're pretty iconic, and obviously the security office is super iconic.' Where we landed was that the security office is this transitional space for both Survivors and Killers. There are doors that are spawned around the map. Each has a camera and a number. So, you know kind of which camera is which or which door is which.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Survivors, when they interact with the door, they're given the camera view with the battery, and they see the little map of the cameras in the corner. You can flip through them, see what's on the other side of any door. If you find a door that you like, if it looks safe on the other side, or if you're going to save somebody, or whatever it is, you can hit our input and you get a little canned animation, almost like a cinematic. It's not pre-rendered or anything, but it's very hands-off. I kind of equate it to a super short theme park ride, where you see, in first-person, your Survivor walks through the security office and looks around, and it's spooky. Then the door opens on the other end of the room, and you leave, and then now you're on, potentially, the other side of the map. It's basically a teleport, but it's very thematic.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/27/dbd-ketchup-ch36-character-art-killer-vf-marketingpose-1920x1080-1748353727087.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Springtrap wielding his pizza knife. Image provided by Behaviour Interactive.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The trick here is that even though it's a safe space - or it feels like a safe space - it is not. The Killer doesn't have access to the cameras but can enter the doors and can look around at any of the other doors he likes and teleport to it. He gets the same thing: He gets kind of a movement through the security office, but if his path happens to cross paths with a Survivor, they get a little jump scare, and he grabs them, and he walks out of the door, carrying them. It feels really thematic, and the animation is so good. It's so good. The anim team killed it. The first thing I said was, 'Can we do a grab Killer?' We have melee and M1 Killers. We have range Killers. Can we just do a Killer that's all based around grabs? Because grabs in DBD are inherently kind of jump scares. We wanted to lean into that a little bit. Obviously, it's not the only thing you can do - that'd be kind of boring - but we did lean into those kinds of things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the other half of his power is his projectile. He has a big old fire axe that he can lob. It's a very unique arc. It's not like anything we've ever done with a projectile Killer before. It's not built for sniping. It's not designed around sniping. It's not balanced around sniping. It's really to do some really gnarly trick shots, and we've already had some people pulling off some crazy things internally. It's been really fun to watch. We wanted to marry those two things with the door gameplay, and 'How can we expand on that, and how can we expand on this idea of him being the grab Killer?' One of the things that we did is, if you hit a Survivor with your projectile, you can chase them down, and you hit M1, and really, I mean, it's a thematic thing. We're basically just skipping a step. Normally, they would fall down, and you would pick them up, but we're doing that all in one shot. You get in close, and you hit your basic attack, and Springtrap very violently grabs the axe, spins you around, you get a nice little jump scare animation, and then he's carrying you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The axe functions in a couple of different ways: He can disable cameras and doors and get a little bit of an AoE with stuff, but that's all my tangents to describe the whole Power. We really did our best to be as authentic as possible when it came to both sides of the aisle, so to speak, when it comes to the Survivor experience of using these cameras and sneaking through these doors and seeing the security office and still being this menacing, lumbering beast. You can't even call him a man or a robot. He's a monster, right? We tried to be as authentic as possible in making him feel like he's both pretty stompy and loud, but also can show up right behind you and - Boo! You know what I mean? [laughs].</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It's going to be really interesting to see Springtrap marry Five Nights at Freddy's into Dead by Daylight itself. When you guys were coming up with ideas for Springtrap, was the upcoming Five Nights at Freddy's 2 movie something the team had to keep in consideration? Was Behaviour able to pull any elements from that film or the first film when creating its version of its character?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> Great question, and the answer is no. Actually, it was all about, for us, the classic experience of the game, especially the first titles, that we wanted to recreate. We often go for that in Dead by Daylight, as you can see. We go for the classics. What creates a little bit of nostalgia as well, and then make it more modern, or whatever it requires to be in Dead by Daylight in today's flavor. Of course, the movie was out, the first installment, and it is also based a lot on that aspect, with some changes, but we were really focused on the games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So, at what point during conversations with Scott Cawthon, did you both say we've got to get Matthew Lillard in here for this?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> It actually came directly from Scott. We had discussion about the different outfits that we could create for Springtrap. It's a discussion we have with partners all the time, like, 'What's your comfort level? We want to respect that. Do you want us to create new outfits like the Blight, or do you want to keep to the specific? Do we have the rights to this and that,' etc., and he actually suggested it. We were thinking, 'We have to stick to the games,' and he said, 'Oh, we absolutely need the Yellow Rabbit from the movie. That would be awesome.' Like, f**k yeah. Yeah, it would. Then having, on top of that, Matthew Lillard's participation and being able to - I didn't personally hang out with him - but part of the team did, and he's just fantastic to work with. He's done fantastic work on making this character alive in our game. It's just awesome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Guzzo:</strong> I mean, he's an icon, right?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Freddy Fazbear's Pizzeria Is Coming to Dead by Daylight - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A horror icon in the game, portraying this massive character.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> Yeah, I mean, if you if you squint... maybe you're Shaggy [laughs].</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Moving over to a different topic now, I've seen some express disappointment that this next Chapter doesn't come with a Survivor. Can you talk about whether there were ever conversations about including a Survivor and why you ultimately chose not to include one this time around?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. So, in early discussion in our planning, and how we wanted to tackle this Chapter and what we had access to when we started this, having a Survivor was, for many reasons, challenging and not a perfect fit that we wanted to make happen. So, yes, I understand the disappointment, like, 100%, but in our mind, we were in the first game, where, at that point in the story, security is anyone. It's the player. It's you, right?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We know that this evolves in the FNaF timeline to something else, but that's kind of the vibe we're going for. I'd like to say... maybe we'll get the chance to do it eventually, or do something else. I definitely think that would be really cool, especially [knowing that] FNaF is vast. It's a large franchise, and that's something we've done before, with big licenses. We've done more content after the first release. So, maybe that would be a possibility. That'd be cool.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Dead by Daylight will let players freely run and hide around Freddy Fazbear's Pizza restaurant. Without spoilers, can you talk about some of the details in the map that you're proud of and excited to see players uncover in the PTB?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> The map is truly amazing. It's one of those buildings that we faithfully recreated, of course, in the metrics of Dead by Daylight. It's comparable to [Raccoon City Police Station] as in it exists. It's something that players already lived in some ways, without necessarily roaming around in that fashion. Being able to do so and to see that in the contemporary fashion and the DBD style is a lot of fun. We've packed it with surprise, and yeah, I'm not spoiling anything, but there's a lot of you know hints about the lore of FNaF, about cool moments that happen. There are some extra jump scares in there. There's a lot of a little surprises like this. You know, we aim to delight with this level of detail, and this one serves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I saw Behaviour mention in another interview that it took some time to make the Five Nights at Freddy's collaboration happen for so many different reasons. Part of what took so long involved a desire from both Cawthon and the Dead by Daylight team to establish what was important and how to please fans on both sides. Can you talk about what that process was like and which elements took the longest to nail down?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> I can't, I can't answer this. I don't have the knowledge of it. If [Game Director Mathieu Cote] was here, you would be able to say so. But usually, we don't also talk about the process with partners.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>This is the collaboration fans have wanted to see for so long. How do you feel about the reception so far, and what is it like for the team specifically to finally give this to players who have been asking for it?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Guzzo:</strong> What else can you say other than it's amazing? Obviously, people are, I don't want to say nervous, but there's always a bit of trepidation when you work hard on something, and then you're putting it out into the world. We all know people on the internet have opinions, but overall, we're all really excited. We've been staring at this for, you know, 40-plus hours a week for almost a year, and we've played it to death. We're just excited to, not necessarily even see how people feel about it, because, you know, you're never going to make everybody happy, but more like, see how people explore it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Springtrap Is Dead by Daylight's Newest Killer - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As a game designer, I like to approach my designs as like… I want to give you tools to play with and figure out and kind of make your own moment-to-moment. That's a big thing that we talk about with DBD a lot - those moment-to-moment... moments. Those moments that you talk with your friends about. 'Oh, do remember when that happened, and this happened,’ etc, etc. So, we really wanted to make sure that, like I said, with like the extra Survivor gameplay, we wanted to give players the tools to really have a lot of those super fun, cool moments and the jump scares and the laughs. That's the best part; when we do a play test and I'm sitting and watching people play and they're laughing and s**t-talking each other, that's when I know I've succeeded, personally. As soon as people don't talk about bugs or whatever, because, you know, bugs come up, and they're just focused on having fun and laughing and calling each other names and everybody's joking around... that's when the magic happens.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's cool to see it internally, and then when we put it out there, go on Twitch or YouTube or whatever it is, and just watching people have those moments on kind of a much bigger scale. So yeah, the team is super excited, obviously. We've also been waiting to do this for 10 years, right? It's not just the community that's been waiting for it. We've been waiting to do it. So, it's cool that we're finally able to do it, and we can kind of bring that to the community.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> I've been there a little bit longer, obviously, on the project, and I was talking with other colleagues yesterday, and they actually asked a similar question. They're like, 'Well, OK, so now you've done it. What's next? Is this the top?' Then, I was reflecting, I'm like, 'Well, pretty much every Chapter we do in, the latest and greatest is the most important thing we're working on.' I understand that FNaF is huge, and it's been highly requested, and after it, there's going to be a new top request, and there's still a lot of universes to explore. Either they're original or they're licenses, so this will happen again. We're definitely not done.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>When did Five Nights at Freddy's first come up as a topic for you guys, where you said 'We'd love to have this in Dead by Daylight.'</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> For me, I wouldn't be able to target the year exactly, but I didn't know Markiplier, and I was actually... this is a long story. I'm going to try and make it short. So, I wasn't watching a lot of streamers, and a colleague just said, 'Oh, you should look at the videos that Markiplier does. He's really funny.' Of course, I watched FNaF videos, and this is where I actually learned a lot about FNaF, that I was really interested in the franchise, that I learned about Markiplier. I had a lot of fun with it, and it triggered this idea, and this want. Then it really solidified when the community started asking for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So, it wasn't even necessarily like everybody was clamoring for Five Nights at Freddy's. It almost started just from organically seeing Markiplier.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> I have to say that this is a very personal view on the matter. Of course, what I do on the project, I look around on anything horror to get inspired by it. So, I can't say that when I saw Markiplier play, it was like, 'Yes, this needs to be in DBD, and the power should be like that.' Absolutely not because it was very early on, and DBD at that point was... what's the word. We were less on the team, and of course, big things like FNaF were not necessarily as possible, but when it crystallized into something that we needed to do, it definitely was because the community was asking for it. Yes.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 25 Best Horror Video Games Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Is there a crossover that members of the Dead by Daylight team would love to see happen? NO restraints.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> There’s a few that Mathieu Cote already said that we like to say because they’re kind of obvious. You know, Pennywise would be amazing. There are other kings of horror that would be amazing to have. You could guess any one of them, I’m thinking. Frankly, I just want to collect them all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Guzzo:</strong> Dave treats DBD like Pokémon [laughs]. Just to be clear, this isn’t a hint about something that is being worked on. As far as I know, it’s not something that is being discussed above me, but my dream – and probably my favorite horror movie – is the obvious one: The Thing. I would love to get The Thing into DBD. I have been here for two and a half years, and I have been on a crusade to figure out how to get The Thing into DBD.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It has a lot of potential design problems. It’s an internal thing of trying to figure out how to make that character work, but yes, that would be my… I don’t want to say my dream Chapter because every Chapter has been a dream so far. I got to do Chucky and Dracula and Springtrap. I don’t know who on this team gets to talk about being on some of the biggest licenses on the planet, but The Thing is the one that I am on a crusade to get done at some point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> That’s really cool. Yeah, it’d be a nice one. The other ones that we always share, too… they could be mostly a joke, but I think there’s a way to make it work, especially now in the timeline: Cujo. Christine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A popular theory floating around about an upcoming Chapter involves some faded letters on a recent roadmap you published. Have you seen this theory floating around, and is there any chance we could get you to comment on it?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard: </strong>I haven’t seen it. I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Is there anything else you’d like to add about the upcoming PTB, Five Nights at Freddy’s, or the future of Dead by Daylight?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard: </strong>So many things. Jason, I’ll let you start. It’s your baby.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Guzzo: </strong>We love this game. We love the franchise. If you love FNaF, we want you to feel welcome to coming into DBD and seeing what we have to offer. I’m going to be honest: It might not be the Chapter that you think it is. I think it being so requested and so loved by the community for so long that there have been… trust me, I did the research, there is a lot of really interesting and cool community concepts on how we could have done FNaF.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> And we can only do one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Guzzo:</strong> And we can only do one, and obviously I’m not just going to be like, ‘Oh, this guy, JoeSmith123 on Reddit has a really good idea, let’s just steal that.’ It might not be the Chapter you expected, but know that we went in not just to make something that, like, ‘Oh this is like the big one. We’re going to sell a million – a billion billion billion copies of this DLC,’ or whatever. We went in wanting to be as authentic as possible and, with Survivors having a little bit extra gameplay in this Chapter, we really wanted to make sure we were authentic to the franchise but also honor the community of that game, and make sure they understand that, when you come to DBD, you might recognize the faces, but you’re going to get a new experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I hope everybody likes it. I genuinely do. I don’t do this because it’s an easy job. I don’t do this because it’s glamorous – although I get to do an interview with IGN, I guess that’s pretty glamorous to be honest [laughs] in terms of being a game dev – but I do it because I love horror. I’ve been a horror fan my whole life. Working on a horror game is very literally a dream come true, even though, as mentioned before, I don’t really like playing scary games because I’m a big baby, but I love working on them and I love the genre. I try to watch new horror movies two or three times I week, and my wife has to also watch them, too bad for her [laughs]. Just understand that this is coming from a place of love and a place of respect as much as possible. I hope everybody loves it. I hope everybody loves playing it as much as I loved working on it. I think that’s the best way I can put it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Richard:</strong> Good stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

As you might have guessed, the studio is always thinking about the next Killers and Survivors it can add to its lineup. What you might not know, though, is that some members of the team have their sights set on specific names.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I have been here for two and a half years, and I have been on a crusade to figure out how to get The Thing into Dead by Daylight.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Killer Designer and horror aficionado Jason Guzzo has helped bring infamous Killers, such as Chucky, Dracula, and Springtrap, into the Entity’s world in the past. Any crossover marks an important moment for Behaviour and its fans, but Guzzo says the one franchise he’d bend over backward to make happen is The Thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As far as I know, it’s not something that is being discussed above me, but my dream – and probably my favorite horror movie – is the obvious one: The Thing,” Guzzo said. “I would love to get The Thing into [Dead by Daylight]. I have been here for two and a half years, and I have been on a crusade to figure out how to get The Thing into Dead by Daylight.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Springtrap Is Dead by Daylight's Newest Killer - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Guzzo reiterates that his desire to work on a The Thing Chapter isn’t a hint at what’s to come, and there are a few factors that might keep such a collaboration from ever materializing. He acknowledges the “potential design problems” that come along with creating a playable video game version of what is essentially a complicated mimic murderer. That said, it’s still the one series he is “on a crusade to get done at some point.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dead by Daylight Creative Director Dave Richard, meanwhile, points out that conversations about dream Killers are nothing new for the Behaviour team. While a name like Pennywise comes up as one villain he feels would “be amazing,” Richard doesn’t want to stop there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There are other kings of horror that would be amazing to have,” Richard tells us. “You could guess any one of them, I’m thinking. Frankly, I just want to collect them all.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are obviously many monsters who have yet to appear in Dead by Daylight, but some of the not-so-obvious names have come up in discussions, too.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Frankly, I just want to collect them all.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“The other ones that we always share, too,” Richard added, “they could be mostly a joke, but I think there’s a way to make it work, especially now in the timeline: Cujo. Christine.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cujo, of course, is the titular rabid dog from Stephen King’s novel and its 1983 movie adaptation. A dog Killer would be quite out of character for a game that primarily features human characters like Ghost Face and Michael Myers, but it’s not exactly impossible. Richard’s reference to King’s Christine, meanwhile, would see a killer car join the roster if Behaviour could ever figure out how to make it work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If one thing is for sure, it’s that Dead by Daylight is showing no signs of slowing down as its barrels toward its ninth anniversary. The Five Nights at Freddy’s Chapter will officially launch come June 17, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-by-daylight-is-finally-getting-a-five-nights-at-freddys-killer-and-hes-voiced-by-matthew-lillard">adding Springtrap and a pizzeria map into the fold</a>.
