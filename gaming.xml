            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>The <i>Gears of War </i>franchise has a long history as one of Xbox’s most beloved properties, but the times are changing. Though it has seen life on PC in the past, <i>Gears of War: Reloaded</i> marks the time the series has made the move to a Sony platform. Yep, this substantial remaster of the first game in the franchise is finally available on PS5 (as well as Xbox and PC) with all the bells and whistles you’d expect, so it’s time to pick up a chainsaw and start chewing through the Locust horde.</p> <p>If you’d like to go online with <i>Gears of War: Reloaded</i>, however, you’ll probably want to link up with your gaming posse. Blasting bodies apart with shotguns is better with friends, after all. So, let’s see if <i>Gears of War: Reloaded</i> has crossplay support and whether or not you can carry your progress between platforms.</p>  <p>If you’re looking to jump into gory gunfights together with friends, I’ve got some really great news for you! <b><i>Gears of War: Reloaded</i></b><b> offers full cross-play support</b>, meaning you can team up with anyone across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC ecosystems. Regardless of platform, you’ll all need to be signed into your Microsoft accounts to make this happen, but <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/account">that’s easy enough to set up</a>.</p>

 <p>Crossplay is available for both co-op and competitive multiplayer modes, so you and some friends are free to tackle the campaign or frag nerds online. But whatever you do, just don’t kill me. I’m really bad at <i>Gears</i> multiplayer, so you have to be nice. Mom said so.</p> <h2>Does <i>Gears of War: Reloaded</i> have cross-progression?</h2> <p>In another twist of good news in a world filled with bad news, <b><i>Gears of War: Reloaded</i></b><b> also supports cross-progression</b>. With this feature, your progress can transfer between any platform on which you own the game. So, if you started on PC and decided you wanted to swap over to PS5, that’d be no problem at all! You’d just need to re-buy the game on Sony’s platform, and then you can pick up right where you left off.</p> <p>Cross-progression works for both your campaign and multiplayer progress, so you’ll lose nothing when swapping back and forth. Again, you’ll need a Microsoft account to use this feature, but that’s to be expected.</p> <hr> <p><i>Gears of War: Reloaded</i> is available August 26 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p>

        <p>"Any assertion that Roblox would intentionally put our users at risk of exploitation is simply untrue," Roblox said</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The U.S. state of Louisiana is suing Roblox, alleging it facilitates "the sexual exploitation of Louisiana's children".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://aglizmurrill.com/Article/322">statement</a>, Louisiana Attorney General, Liz Murrill, claimed Roblox "endangers the safety of the children" of the state, writing: "Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritises user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety.</p>
<p>"Every parent should be aware of the clear and present danger posed to their children by Roblox so they can prevent the unthinkable from ever happening in their own home."</p>
<p>The legal papers then names several "highly inappropriate" Roblox mini games such as Escape to Epstein Island, Public Bathroom Simulator, and Diddy Party.</p>
<p>"These games and others are often filled with sexually explicit material and simulated sexual activity such as child gang rape. A recent report even revealed a group of 3,334 members openly traded child pornography and solicited sexual acts from minors," the Louisiana announcement says, <a href="https://hindenburgresearch.com/roblox/">citing a 2024 report</a>.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Roblox is violating Louisiana law - choosing profits over child safety. It's basically open season for sex predators on this platform. <a href="https://t.co/fGSQ8IFgWw">pic.twitter.com/fGSQ8IFgWw</a></p>— Attorney General Liz Murrill (@AGLizMurrill) <a href="https://twitter.com/AGLizMurrill/status/1956343934877090064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 15, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>The lawsuit claims that while Roblox requires children to have permission from their parents or guardians to open an account, the company "does nothing to confirm or document that parental permission has been given, no matter how young a child is. Nor does Defendant require a parent to confirm the age given when a child signs up to use Roblox".</p>
<p>"[Roblox] has access to biometric age verification software that requires the user to take a photo of a government-issued ID along with a real-time selfie photo that is then verified through artificial intelligence," the AG adds. "However, while Defendant utilises this software for other purposes, Defendant intentionally does not utilise this feature when new accounts are created."</p>
<p>In a press conference announcing the lawsuit, Murrill said: "So [Roblox] have chosen profits over child safety. It's basically open season for sex predators on this app. For this reason, and all of the others that we've talked about today, Roblox is violating Louisiana law, and that's why we filed this lawsuit."</p>
<p>Roblox <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/roblox-responds-to-louisiana-ag-lawsui">said</a> it does not comment on pending litigation, but stressed "it would like to address erroneous claims and misconceptions about our platform, our commitment to safety, and our overall safety track record".</p>
<p>"Every day, tens of millions of people around the world use Roblox to learn STEM skills, play, and imagine, and have a safe experience on our platform. Any assertion that Roblox would intentionally put our users at risk of exploitation is simply untrue. No system is perfect, and bad actors adapt to evade detection, including efforts to take users to other platforms, where safety standards and moderation practices may differ. We continuously work to block those efforts and to enhance our moderation approaches to promote a safe and enjoyable environment for all users."</p><p>It added that it is constantly innovating safety tools and launching new safeguards, has taken an industry-leading stance on age-based communication, and serves players of which 64 percent are aged 13 or over. It also dedicates substantial resources to help detect and prevent inappropriate content and behaviour, and collaborates with law enforcement and government agencies, as well as mental health organisations, child safety organisations, and parental advocacy groups "to keep users safe on the platform".</p>
<p>"We know safety is critically important to families, and we strive to empower our community of parents and caregivers to help ensure a safe online experience for their children. This includes a suite of easy-to-use parental controls to provide parents with more control and clarity on what their kids and teens are doing on Roblox," the statement concludes.</p>
<p>"We aim to create one of the safest online environments for users, a goal not only core to our founding values but contrary to certain assertions, one we believe is critical to our long-term vision and success. We understand there is always more work to be done, and we are committed to making Roblox a safe and positive environment for all users."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>If you’re the kind of person who likes quirky platformers with a whole lot of charm and whimsy, you may have your eyes set on <i>Ruffy and the Riverside</i>. In this bizarre 3D platformer, you’re cast as the titular character who possesses the ability to copy and paste textures, allowing you to change the world around you to solve puzzles and reach new areas.</p> <p><i>Ruffy and the Riverside</i> can be a whole lot of fun if you’re able to brave its frenetic gameplay and art style. But you may be wondering how long it’ll take you to reach the end of this rowdy adventure and how much extra content there is to dive into. Let’s answer that for you below.</p> <p><b>If you’re just mainlining </b><b><i>Ruffy and the Riverside</i></b><b>‘s campaign, you can likely reach the end of the game in about 6-8 hours</b>. This makes it notably shorter than some similar 3D platformers, but its wacky gameplay and clever puzzles ensure that not a moment is wasted. Even so, you may wish for a few extra hours when you realize how brief the main quest is, especially if you really click with the Swap ability and enjoy blasting textures all over the map.</p>

 <p>Luckily, there are a lot of optional things to do in <i>Ruffy and the Riverside</i> that can extend your time with the game, especially if you’re aiming to obtain all of its trophies or achievements. You’ll need to find a variety of optional secrets and collectibles, as well as swap textures over a thousand times. But given that a large part of the gameplay loop involves the Swap ability, you’ll be well on your way to that one anyway.</p> <p>Whether you’re looking to push through the campaign or track down every secret, you can get started doing so right away. <i>Ruffy and the Riverside</i> is available now on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, and Windows PCs.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/fairgame-canceled-according-to-michael-pachter/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fairgame-has-been-canceled-too-according-to-michael-pachter-who-says-sony-has-%E2%80%98lost-its-way%E2%80%99.1271772/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter is back <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WuLcrpCkkc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with another episode of his Pachter Factor podcast</a>, and he brings some interesting news: Fairgame$ might have been canceled. </p>



<p>While discussing Sony's switch toward live service games, which he criticized because of wrong moves such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-vastly-overpaid-for-bungie-says-pachter-unlike-microsoft-take-two-for-activision-blizzard-zynga/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">buying Bungie for a lot more than they were worth in his opinion</a>, the analyst casually said that Jade Raymond had been let go and her game, titled Fairgame$, canceled. </p>



<p><em>Sony went, "Oh, we need some of that", except that they bought Bungie to do it." Bungie made Halo. They're obviously very talented. They made Destiny. Destiny was good. It had ongoing in-game spend. But they paid 3.6 billion for it. They didn't buy a mobile publisher like Scopely for 4.9 billion, which has 3 billion or 3.5 billion of revenue. Bungie has 300 million in revenue. They didn't buy Niantic, which has 1.5 billion of revenue. They didn't buy people who know how to make live service games. And then they turned all their console developers into live service developers, which resulted in Concord being shut down and the studio being shut down. Which resulted in Jade Raymond being let go and her game Fairgame$ cancelled. </em></p>



<p>Raymond's departure from Haven Studio (which she <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-jade-raymond-haven-new-playstation-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founded</a> in 2021) was officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/haven-studios-founder-jade-raymond-leaves-the-playstation-first-party-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in May, but we only learned back then that the game had been delayed from 2025 to 2026. Fairgame$ has been described as a 'competitive heist experience' in development for both PlayStation 5 and PC. Needless to say, if this cancellation were to be confirmed, it would be another major blow to Sony's foray into the live service category, after the cancellation of <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concord</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-canceled-naughty-dog-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Last of Us Online</a>.</p>



<p>In his podcast episode, Pachter directly attacked Sony, arguing that they have lost their way and 'don't know what they are doing' anymore.</p>



<p><em>They are bad managers. They don't know what they're doing.</em> <em>They should do what they're good at and they should buy what they're not good at. And so to buy what you're not good at means you don't buy Bungie, because Bungie makes console games. Sony's good at that. Buy King, buy Zinga, buy Supercell, buy Peak Games, buy somebody who knows how to make live service free-to-play games. Buy Respawn. We didn't know that Vince Zampella could do it, but he did. But no, I think Sony has lost its way.</em></p>



<p>For its part, Sony recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-admits-live-service-push-isnt-going-smoothly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acknowledged</a> that its live service efforts haven't gone smoothly, but it also promised to learn from its mistakes.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ratshaker-playstation-store-horror-hltb-psn-2000618066</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/if-you%E2%80%99re-on-the-lookout-for-a-short-worthwhile-horror-game-check-out-ratshaker.1271751/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>If you look at <i>Ratshaker</i> on the PlayStation store, you might be inclined to write it off as one of hundreds of shovelware games on storefronts designed for easy trophies. I know I did at first. But then, I saw the game gaining traction across multiple subreddits where plenty of users seemed to agree that it’s actually a surreal horror title worth the low cost of entry — I checked it out. I’m glad I did.</p> <p>While <i>Ratshaker</i> may have a low-res visual style, brief runtime, and fairly easy trophy list, it manages to rise above the trappings of shovelware to be something that diehard horror fans can appreciate. The game tasks you with, well, shaking and squeezing a rat to solve some basic adventure-style puzzles around a home where something horrible has happened. Yeah, it’s fucking weird.</p> <p>But while <i>Ratshaker</i>‘s simple premise initially leans toward being quirky and funny in its delivery, don’t let that fool you. As you further explore the home and peel back what happened there, <i>Ratshaker</i> reveals some truly unnerving events that may stick in your head for a while. If that sounds up your alley, here’s how long it’ll take you to beat this bizarre experience.</p>

 <h2>How long does it take to beat <i>Ratshaker</i>?</h2> <p><i>Ratshaker</i> is a cheap game with a short runtime, so you shouldn’t go in expecting an epic adventure. Instead, <b>you’re treated to an immensely strange horror mystery that will take about an hour to unravel</b>. But the brief time you spend with <i>Ratshaker</i> will feel like enough. It’s a game that doesn’t <i>need</i> much time to tell its story, which ends up far more unsettling than you may expect, even after engaging with its disturbing opening.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000618068" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618068"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618068">© Screenshot: Sunscorched Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>If you’re also playing <i>Ratshaker</i> for its fairly easy platinum trophy, be aware that there are missable trophies throughout the adventure. And you’ll technically need to see both the real ending and a secret ending to earn the platinum trophy, but you can do both on one playthrough if you manage your saves right. Following a guide can help you not miss out on these trophies if you’re not eager to play <i>Ratshaker</i> twice.</p> <p>Even if you’re not seeking the easy platinum trophy, I’d argue that the low price and ominous vibes make <i>Ratshaker</i> a good grab for any horror fan who appreciates weird shit. It’s available now on PS5 and Windows PCs, with a release on additional platforms planned for later this summer. Shake that rat.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dead-take%E2%80%99s-best-scares-come-from-real-life-performances.1271745/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Dead Take</em>, the second game from <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24146692/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review-metroidvania-platformer">Tales of Kenzera: Zau</a></em> developer Surgent Studios, is a quiet horror game where the monster is ambition and the lengths a person will go for stardom. Like a lot of horror games, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/695811/verso-and-astarion-walk-into-a-video-game">Dead Take</a></em> relies on jumpscares to get the heart pumping. But playing this game, my deepest, most upsetting scares didn’t come from the startle of a sudden knock but from the performances of the game’s actors.</p><p>In <em>Dead Take</em>, you play as Chase Lowry (Neil Newbon), a struggling actor who has come to the creepy mansion of Hollywood producer and kingmaker Duke Cain (Abubakar Salim), to look for his friend, Vinnie Monroe (Ben Starr), another struggling actor. The game mixes the exploration and puzzle solving gameplay of a <em>Resident Evil</em> game with a narrative delivered almost entirely via full motion video cutscenes, or known to us Olds as FMVs. I know FMV games have been around for a while, but this is my first, it felt novel in a way video games hadn’t made me feel in a long time.</p><p>As you journey through the mansion, the main thrust of the game is piecing together what happened to your friend Vinny. You do that through finding snippets of videos — interviews, auditions, and video messages — and splicing them together to create wholly new videos through the use of a fancy schmancy AI editor. These new videos reveal plot elements and puzzle solutions which all sound rather like the normal course of a video game until you realize these performers are acting their <em>asses off</em>.</p><p>Throughout <em>Dead Take</em>, you watch Vinnie try to secure a role in Duke Cain’s next big picture, something he is hungry to the point of desperation for. When a concerned call from Chase interrupts an audition, and Duke questions Vinnie’s commitment, Vinnie brutally insults Chase.</p><p>I like to inhabit the characters I play in video games. After all, they’re mostly blank slates on which you can project your own thoughts and feelings. The character you pilot becomes a proxy for you even when they have their own personalities. I can’t do that in <em>Dead Take</em>.</p><p>Watching real, flesh and blood people act is so much more engrossing than hearing them act with the action mapped onto polygonal bodies. I played both <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23818692/baldurs-gate-3-starting-guide-tips-how-to">Baldur’s Gate III</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23767669/final-fantasy-xvi-review-ps5">Final Fantasy XVI</a></em>, in which Newbon and Starr gave excellent performances. But watching them act, they’re on another level.</p><p><sub>This is only a sample of what to expect from Starr.</sub></p><p>Starr <em>scared </em>me in this game. A couple of jumpscares got me real good, and even the quiet, unsettling mansion created an atmosphere where I literally jumped at my own shadow, but Ben Starr is the scariest thing in this game. There’s a moment when, during yet another audition take, he starts screaming at his costar like Christian Bale <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090205081725/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/bale-turns-american-psycho-with-expletiveladen-tantrum-on-set-1544988.html">that one time</a>. It was so well done, so reminiscent of all the times I’ve had run-ins with violent, abusive men, that I forgot he was acting.</p><p>Not all the performances are bone-chilling depictions of what it’s like selling your soul to become the next big thing. There’s some humor in there too. Sam Lake, known for his work (<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-game-awards-alan-wake-2-herald-of-darkness-1851085691">and dance moves</a>) on Remedy’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23934662/alan-wake-2-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Alan Wake</em> series</a>, gives a hilarious appearance playing a washed up director. Because of plot shenanigans, Ben Starr and Neil Newbon are two British men, playing American actors pretending to be southern, and it is quite funny when those three-layers-deep accents occasionally break.</p><p>But don’t get me wrong, this game is all about the scares. Without FMVs, <em>Dead Take</em> would be a perfectly fine but forgettable game. Through the use of technology that peaked in the days of the LaserDisc, it’s become one of my favorite horror games ever. I don’t mind horror games, but I don’t seek them out. I’m glad I sought out <em>Dead Take</em>.<br><sub><em>Dead Take</em> is out now on Steam.</sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/760213/dead-take-review-fmv-horror-game-ben-starr]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/off</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-off-switch-a-worthy-remaster-of-a-weird-cult-classic-rpg.1271730/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="OFF Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158073/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Though it may feel like the ‘quirky’ branch of indie JRPGs has become a played out trope by now, it wasn’t too long ago that a confusing, humorous, and parodying take on the standard template was seen as a novel concept. One of the most significant examples of this was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/off">OFF</a>, a simple freeware RPG Maker project that caught fire on Tumblr in the late 2000s and inspired the development of games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/omori">OMORI</a>, <strong>Yume Nikki</strong>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a>.</p>
<p>Now, developer Mortis Ghost (along with Fangamer) has put out a modestly tweaked remaster of the game for Switch and PC, introducing the classic to a new generation while also polishing up some of its rougher edges. I’m pleased to say that this remaster has largely stuck the landing—the original game feels like it's barely aged a day, while the few additions genuinely enhance the overall experience.</p>
<figure><a title="OFF Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158069/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Let’s first briefly review what’s been changed or tweaked here. In addition to the expected resolution and visual asset sharpening, this rerelease also features a brand new soundtrack, six new optional bosses, a new zone, and rebalanced combat. It’s no comprehensive overhaul, and it debatably isn’t even the best version of the game, but everything new here is welcome and justifies the (low) price tag. All the same, it would’ve been nice to have seen a bit more to round out the package more, as the completely free and still accessible original release offers an experience that’s pretty close to what you can get here.</p>
<p>The narrative in OFF follows a mysterious protagonist named 'The Batter, who traverses a Wonderland-esque world to “purify” various spirits that he believes are a blight on the weird society you explore. If you're expecting a traditional RPG narrative, you won't won’t find one here as OFF is content to pitch you a disorienting, funny, and occasionally scary plot that proves to be quite memorable. Combine this with multiple endings, and you’ve got a story that manages to set itself apart from most of its genre peers, even if its gameplay largely falls in line with them.</p>
<figure><a title="OFF Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158082/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Throughout the game, you guide the Batter and your varying party through dungeons packed with loot, battle weird monsters, solve (very!) esoteric puzzles, and interact with the strange citizens of this dreamlike world. If it were any longer, OFF would feel a bit too simplistic for its own good, but the snappy five-hour runtime ensures the pacing is brisk as you progress through the different zones. The gameplay is quite competent and satisfying, then, even if it feels a bit predictable in its execution.</p>
<p>Combat follows a similar familiar pattern, then, featuring a breezy ATB structure where characters and enemies can make a move once their own action bar fills up. Depending on how you command your crew, you can easily ‘steal’ turns from foes by smartly dispatching or interrupting those whose bar is about to fill. It’s nothing you haven’t seen before, but OFF does a good job of making its encounters feel dynamic without overstaying their welcome. Plus, those of you who cut your teeth on <strong>Final Fantasy</strong> will be pleased to know that combat speed can be increased in this remaster by adjusting a setting in the pause menu, though autobattle from the original release is bizarrely absent here.</p>
<figure><a title="OFF Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158072/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Puzzles go quite a bit further than you’d expect in a typical RPG, often testing your observation skills by demanding that you really interact with the world to wring out all the clues you can. Mortis Ghost stated that <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/myst">Myst</a> was a big inspiration for the game, and it's noticeably present in the various logic and memory teasers you encounter. Some of these puzzles are a bit frustrating given how obtuse their solutions can be, but it feels <em>great</em> when you finally stumble upon the answer you’ve been chasing for a while.</p>
<p>Visually, OFF goes for a very basic, but effective visual style that highlights the strange and often grotesque enemies designs. There’s a warped, almost Lovecraftian style to many of the spooky specters you face, and OFF loves to throw random photorealistic references into the exaggerated and cartoonish world to keep you wondering what the heck is going on. Beyond these more macabre aspects, the monochromatic world designs and retro-inspired sprite work prove to be competent, if not a bit uninteresting.</p>
<p>One of the more controversial aspects of this release is the soundtrack, which was redone form the ground up due to copyright issues and the original composer, Alias Conrad Coldwood, being <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/offthegame/comments/1hmf8gj/i_emailed_acc_asking_about_the_new_soundtrack_in/">cautious of signing contracts around the music</a>.</p>
<figure><a title="OFF Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158079/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The new OST — which has Coldwood's blessing — pulls together tracks from a variety of composers, most famous among them being Undertale and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a>’s very own Toby Fox, and the final result is certainly <em>different</em>, but it’s hard to say if it’s better. On one hand, it feels like the somewhat clashing variety of styles on display fits the confusing energy of OFF in a way that the original soundtrack didn’t. On the other hand, there’s something quite distinct about the whispering, lo-fi vibes of the original and its absence here robs OFF of a bit of its quirky charm.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>OFF is a decent remaster of a great game and ultimately stands as a worthy return to this watershed moment in the ‘weird’ side of the indie RPG scene. Its memorable story, engaging combat, and challenging puzzles all combine to make for a brisk and enjoyable RPG adventure that no fan of the genre will want to miss. Even though the additions in this remaster feel a bit minimal, OFF is overall well worth batting for.</p></section>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-child-safety/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/louisiana-is-suing-roblox-over-child-safety-concerns-as-stock-drops-10.1271703/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The state of Louisiana is suing Roblox over child safety concerns as the company’s stocks fall 10% in a matter of days.</p>



<p>It’s been a wild couple of days for the gaming giant Roblox, which has faced criticism and backlash following a slew of concerns about child safety. </p>



<p>Roblox has faced continuous allegations over the years about its lack of infrastructure to protect children, and “vigilante” users have decided to step in to catch predators.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, Roblox posted a <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/more-on-removal-of-vigilantes-from-roblox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lengthy statement</a> to its website defending its decision to ban such users, claiming that those users have taken “actions that are both unacceptable and create an unsafe environment for users.” The statement was released around the same time as one popular user named ‘Schlep’, who catches predators on Roblox, was banned on the platform for such activities.</p>



<p>As allegations and concerns persist, Louisiana’s top prosecutor, Attorney General Liz Murrill, has filed a lawsuit against Roblox, accusing the platform of failing to do more to protect children.</p>



<p>The 42-page filing states that tens of millions of users can easily create accounts with false birthdays, and the system is easily passed by adults posing as children.</p>



<p>The suit outlines several different games within Roblox, including “Escape to Epstein Island,” referencing convicted sex offender&nbsp;Jeffrey Epstein, a game called “Public Showers,” where users can roleplay and relax together, and over 600 games relating to Sean “Diddy” Combs / P Diddy.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time that Roblox has faced criticism, either, and the company has been slated for not doing more to protect children. In 2019, a 19-year-old <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/paedophile-groomed-150-children-engage-16258877" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">groomed 150 children using Roblox</a>. In June 2021, 18-year-old Ron Machluf was <a href="https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/18-year-old-indicted-for-luring-underage-girls-online-using-roblox-671550" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">indicted</a> for using Roblox “to lure and commit sexual offenses against several girls between the ages of 7 and 12.”</p>



<p>In a more recent case in 2024, a 21-year-old Chilean man was <a href="https://www.sgvtribune.com/2024/08/21/man-suspected-of-sexually-exploiting-girl-online-from-afar-caught-at-lax/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">arrested</a> at LAX airport “on suspicion of contacting a minor for a sexual offense” after meeting a 13-year-old girl on Roblox and booking an Airbnb near her home</p>



<p>The continuous allegations have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/chris-hansen-confirms-going-after-roblox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prompted Chris Hansen to investigate Roblox’s issues</a>, saying that he’s “already interviewed law enforcement investigators and victims of this horrible activity.”</p>

Before we get into our plans, though, let's recap the week.</p>
<p>It was a pretty quiet one in Nintendo Land, with not so much as a whiff of a Direct — which is weird, after the last three weeks of showcases. Nintendo revealed an all-new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/mario-kart-world-announces-summer-vacation-skill-test-event">event in Japan</a>, announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a> would soon be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-expands-switch-2s-gamecube-library-next-week">arriving on the GameCube NSO library</a> and just <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/could-this-mysterious-super-mario-40th-anniversary-x-account-be-legit">maybe set up the social media account</a> for Mario's upcoming 40th anniversary. Oh yes, and we went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/first-impressions-pokemon-legends-z-a-is-an-attempt-to-catch-the-hardcore-again">hands-on</a> with a little-known curio called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I’m knee-deep in yet another fighting game binge, so this weekend will be a mix of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_ball_fighterz">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvel_vs_capcom_fighting_collection_arcade_classics">Marvel Vs Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics</a>. I’ve still yet to purchase the latest character pass for Street Fighter 6, but the temptation to play as Sagat is slowly but surely starting to overwhelm. Maybe I’ll cave by Monday, we’ll see. Have a good one, folks!</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I polished off the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mina-the-hollower">Mina</a> demo in one tasty sitting, and have been noodling about with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/legend_of_zelda_oracle_of_seasons">Oracle of Seasons</a> ever since — it's funny how all that GBC inspiration can get you in the mood for... more GBC, isn't it? I also seem to have blinked and somehow racked up a backlog of 2025 games that I'd like to see to before the year is out. Chilling with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_bookshop">Tiny Bookshop</a> and swooning with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/date_everything">Date Everything!</a> it is, then.</p>

<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>I'm like Jim has been the past two weeks — in between multiple things but never quite settling on one. UFO 50 is only adding to the problem with its huge 50 game library. And <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pipistrello_and_the_cursed_yoyo">Pipistrello</a> is amazing, so I'm glad I can dip in and out of that as I please. It'll keep you top-down fans more than occupied until Mina the Hollower arrives.</p>
<p>September and October are <em>stuffed</em> though, so maybe it's a good thing I don't feel like playing much right now. Have a good one!</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>I've been playing a fair bit of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ritual_of_raven">Ritual of Raven</a>, a farming-meets-programming game that just came out. It's very interesting! I'll admit that the learning curve is steep, but since I'm learning programming anyway (in Love2D, with Lua) it's basically homework.</p>
<p>I also FINALLYYYYYY completed <strong>PEAK</strong> this week. Got to the top of the mountain after dying 4 times on the way up. Now I just have to do it again, right? Easy...</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sonic_mania">Sonic Mania</a> is one of the best Sonic games ever, and while there were hopes it would get a sequel, a few years ago, it was revealed how <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/07/sonic-mania-2-didnt-happen-because-sega-wanted-to-move-beyond-pixel-art">Sega was eager to move beyond pixel art</a> and ultimately it didn't go ahead.</p>
<p>At the time, Sega worked with Headcannon and Christian Whitehead "to consider concepts for the next generation of Classic Sonic", and now, after all this time, Whitehead <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cfwhitehead.bsky.social/post/3lwhbnncp6s2y">has shared concept artwork</a> of what could have been, including a look at the Kanga Clanga Badnik "as it appears in the 2.5D prototype".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is now the 8th anniversary of Mania so time to dig up some Sonic trivia... This year, it's Kanga Clanga! (aka the Kangus). This lovable robo-roo originally lived in the outback but now entertains us all in Pinball Carnival Zone!"</p>

<p>"Kanga Clanga Badnik, as it appears in a 2.5D prototype Evening Star worked on after Sonic Mania. It is balancing on its tail and kicking forward with its springy roo feet! Sonic is knocked to the left with significant kinetic force."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Along with this, Sonic Mania composer Tee Lopes has uploaded a funky 'Outback' beat for "the game that never was":</p>

<p>Sonic Mania was eventually followed up by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/sonic_superstars">Sonic Superstars</a>, with Whitehead and his studio Evening Star moving onto the development of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pennys_big_breakaway">Penny's Big Breakaway</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/asus-teases-extraordinary-xbox-controller-reveal/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asus-teases-%E2%80%98extraordinary%E2%80%99-xbox-controller-reveal.1271664/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Asus recently joined forces with Xbox to produce the ROG Xbox Ally, an upgraded gaming handheld device with stacks of processing power, battery life, and a clean Xbox-themed UI. That’s not all that the tech titan has up its sleeves when it comes to collaborations, as a new Xbox controller fused with Asus <strong>in some way </strong>was just teased.</p>



<p>In a new trailer uploaded recently, Asus suggested that ‘something extraordinary is coming’, showing a snippet of an instantly recognizable Xbox controller with an Asus ROG touch.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-asus-xbox-controller">What is the Asus Xbox Controller?</h2>



<p>While we know <strong>plenty </strong>about the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X, the controller is a new concept to everyone.</p>



<p>In a 13-second clip uploaded to YouTube, the ROG team promoted a teaser for a grand reveal set to take place at Gamescom in just a few days:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Get ready to experience the future of gaming at #ROGGamescom2025. Stay tuned. 🎮⚡" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WyRyHC0t6zc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It’s impossible to glean much from the video, but we can see it’s an evolution over the standard Xbox controller, with a couple of extra buttons sitting around the grips. The Xbox button is smaller than on typical controllers, and a ROG RGB logo sits front and centre.</p>



<p>The share and start buttons also look new and are flanked by two <strong>extra </strong>face buttons.</p>



<p>Based on recent upgrades made to controllers in the gaming space, I’d predict that whatever this is, it has ‘Hall Effect’ thumbsticks, short-actuation triggers and shoulder buttons, perhaps fused with switchable stops, and high-polling, low-latency mechanics.</p>



<p>If nothing else, it’ll be an upgrade over <a href="https://rog.asus.com/uk/controllers/rog-raikiri-pro-model/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the ROG Raikiri Pro</a>, an Xbox controller with a built-in OLED display, tri-mode connectivity, and customization options via Asus’ Armoury Crate software.</p>



<p>What do you hope the reveal is? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The Battlefield 6 beta is back and taking the world by storm (again). Despite a few niggling changes that have left some players a little dismayed, the ongoing playtest is indicative of the hype surrounding this title, which is set to be released in full on October 10.</p>



<p>As the beta unravels, we’re seeing some trends emerge, and none of them is more wholesome than the selfless mission to become the best medic in Battlefield 6. Folks are going entire games without dealing a shred of damage, emulating <em>Hacksaw Ridge </em>and giving up their game to save as many players as possible.</p>



<p>I recently stumbled across a contender for the title of Best Battlefield 6 Medic.</p>



<h2 id="h-playing-the-medic-in-battlefield-like-never-before">Playing The Medic in Battlefield Like Never Before</h2>



<p>Battlefield 6 is nothing without classes, and for the most part, players are doing what the classes are made for. The Support folks are dropping ammo bags galore, the Engineer troops are taking out tanks, Assault soldiers are leading the fight from the frontline, and Recon fighters are sitting back in the hills and windows of crumbling buildings.</p>



<p>In my opinion, it’s the Support players who are living their role, leaning on the dual function of restocking ammo and providing revives to keep the battlefield flowing.</p>



<p>I was recently sent an image from a friend who is living out the role of conscientious objector in Battlefield 6.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>While playing a game of Breakthrough on Liberation Peak, this user lived and breathed the Support class, refusing to kill a single enemy (and only dying four times!) as the match unravelled.</p>



<p>Instead, this player flew around the map with reckless abandon, reviving <strong>564 players </strong>and netting a whopping 56,575 XP while doing so. His buddy fell in second place, securing 395 revives but unfortunately taking the lives of seven enemies.</p>



<p>Phenomenal effort.</p>



<p>Have you secured a score that can rival 564 revives in a single match? Let me know how you’re playing Battlefield 6 on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PETA has gone after Nintendo over Mario Kart World, requesting that the gaming titan make one change to Cow by removing the character’s brass nose ring. In a letter sent to Shuntaro Furukawa, Nintendo president, PETA stressed that ‘nose rings are forcibly pierced through one of the most sensitive parts of a cow’s body.’</p>



<p>The argument is that Cow’s nose accessory in Mario Kart World is ‘glossing over real-world violence’ and should be removed.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-peta-bothering-nintendo">Why is PETA Bothering Nintendo?</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.peta.org/news/peta-mario-kart-world-controversy-cow-nose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post published hours ago</a> (at the time of writing), PETA explained what the deal was with it chasing down Nintendo over a design decision in Mario Kart World:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We know Mario Kart World is just a game—and that’s exactly why Cow’s nose ring needs to go. Mario Kart is supposed to be a fun escape, not a reminder of the painful tools used on cows in the meat and dairy industries. No one wants to think about animal suffering while zipping around a race track.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team wrote, ‘No cow in the <em>real world </em>who is forced to wear a nose ring would ever sport Cow’s goofy grin in Nintendo’s game.’</p>



<p>I advise checking out the PETA link above with care—it’s a short jump from the article to some gruesome images, which is a classic shock move for the organization.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time that PETA has challenged developers or publishers. In January 2024, I secured an exclusive statement from the organization regarding a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peta-animal-cruelty-in-palworld-statement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vegan outcry against Palworld</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>PETA has already heard from many Palworld fans who have no interest in eating ‘Pals’ and want a vegan guide created for the game. It’s ‘Veganuary’ after all, and gamers want to help animals by eating vegan in their game worlds and outside.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>PETA has also petitioned against Hunting Simulator 2 and Animal Crossing: New Horizons. The latter claim was that players are encouraged to be ‘abusive towards fish and insects.’</p>



<p><strong>Seriously</strong>.</p>



<p>Do you think there’s any weight to PETA’s petition against Nintendo? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a post on social media, Chris ‘To Catch a Predator’ Hansen has confirmed that he’s working with law enforcement, victims, and activists to investigate Roblox in the wake of the recent child abuse controversies.</p>



<p>In recent months, Roblox has faced scrutiny from the world as constant concerning cases have surfaced, and as the game grows, so too do the allegations and lawsuits.</p>



<h2 id="h-roblox-faces-to-catch-a-predator-treatment">Roblox Faces To Catch a Predator Treatment</h2>



<p>Chris Hansen, who is best known as the face of To Catch a Predator, a documentary-style show that trapped and captured child predators, is taking on Roblox. In a recent post on social media, the television host and investigator revealed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You may have heard that my streaming crime network TruBlu and I are investigating the exploitation of children on the popular gaming platform, Roblox.</p>



<p>It’s absolutely true and we’re deep into it. I’ve already interviewed law enforcement investigators and victims of this horrible activity.</p>



<p>We have collaborators, some people who have been working in this space, including Schlep, who have committed to help us in this endeavour.</p>



<p>Will Roblox actually say anything about it? Will it make any changes? We’re going to do our best to hold them accountable.</p>
</blockquote>



<figure></figure>







<p>It was rumored a couple of days back that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/chris-hansen-roblox-plans-documentary-predator-claim/">Hansen was getting involved</a> with the ongoing scandal and backlash against Roblox. This might be the profile boost that the situation needs, with Hansen’s legitimate television network weighing heavily into the claims that the Roblox Corporation isn’t doing enough to protect children.</p>



<p>Roblox is one of the (if not <strong>the</strong>) most popular games in the world right now. It has racked up hundreds of millions of players exploring a diverse ecosystem of games, most of which are created by the users themselves. There’s a dark underbelly to the world of Roblox, and it’s one that parents are becoming increasingly aware of.</p>



<p>Do you think this effort by Chris Hansen will drive change in the Roblox space? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Playable at the World Championships</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a></strong> isn't out until October, but this weekend there's a Switch 2 demo at the 2025 Pokémon World Championships.</p>
<p>The first impressions are now rolling in, and we've put together some thoughts so far – starting with a 'hands on' from our senior video producer Zion Grassl. Although it might not be for everyone, we're thinking the hardcore fans will be pleased with how it's shaping up.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/">Nintendo Life:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"While I’m still trying to temper my excitement and expectations for the overall city exploration, I’m relieved to report the combat, from what I've played, feels like just the thing the series needs to take it into the next generation."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:186394 @ 1755358786 -->
<p>So, what did other outlets have to say about the demo? Here's what's been said so far:</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/759788/pokemon-legends-z-a-battle-real-time-preview">The Verge:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"The demo, which I played ahead of the 2025 Pokémon World Championships in Anaheim, California, was split into two parts lasting around 10 minutes each, both seemingly early in the game and heavily focused on the new battle system... It’s a big departure from nearly 30 years of <em>Pokémon</em> games<em>.</em> I’m used to thinking about <em>Pokémon</em> like a chess match, slowly and several steps ahead; in <em>Z-A</em>, I had to think about the same type matchups and stats and everything else, but quickly and on my feet. It took me some time to adjust."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-battle-system-first-impressions">IGN:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"I can see the potential, but with just twenty minutes of experiencing the early game, it’s much too soon to tell if this real-time battle system will scratch the strategy-itch Pokémon games usually do for me."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-preview-active-battle-mechanics/">Polygon:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"The combat felt fresh, and I was only able to see the beginning of it. I wanted to get right back into another epic battle. I wanted <em>more</em>. And this is all based on a relatively small representation of early-game hours. I can only imagine how much more engaging the combat will feel with a full party of Pokémon, all rocking fleshed-out movesets, as you go up against a formidable foe."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/hands-on-pokemon-legends-z-a-proves-legends-is-still-pokemons-most-exciting-series/">VGC:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>" Arceus was a game that brought back so many fans, specifically because it departed from the main series formula, and Z-A is an even bigger departure. It will take much more time with the new battle system to get to grips with the new way of taking down Trainers, but we’re thoroughly sold on Rogue Mega Pokémon battles already."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.serebii.net/pokemon/">Serebii.net</a></h3>
<p>And to round things off, here's what Serebii.net webmaster Joe Merrick had to say about this demo (<a href="https://youtu.be/8bjZLO8cKyw">via Serebii on YouTube</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's still early, and it's hard to say how well the new systems will work in an overall game, but from what I played here, it seems like it's a cool evolution of the Pokémon Legends formula and it has me wanting to go back and play more, which is a good sign in my view."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This demo is available to the general public at the World Championships this weekend, but you'll need to have registered your interest on Nintendo's website with a Nintendo Account, and it's "first come, first served". You can find out more in our post about this demo:</p>

Meanwhile, Digital Foundry has shared its technical breakdown from the first weekend of Battlefield 6's open beta, and the early verdict is very good.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDVDQbgL3Rs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oDVDQbgL3Rs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>That's not to say that the open beta was flawless. In the opening minutes alone, DF broke down some of the issues with the destructible environments. There are occasional glitches, including pieces of rubble floating in air without being connected to the structure around them. Battlefield 6's buildings appear to fall apart using a state-based system rather than registering unique damage or breaking points. Yet it's still an improvement over Battlefield 2049 and Battlefield 5.</p><p>Visually, DF saw the best results when running the SSGI option on PC, which allowed for more natural lighting, and suggested that this feature should be included for PlayStation 5 Pro. Unsurprisingly, the PS5 Pro performed better than the standard PS5, but the gap wasn't as great as it was between the Xbox Series X and the Xbox Series S. In a side-by-side comparison, the S noticeably struggled to keep up with the on-screen details that the X handled more smoothly.</p><p>Even in the beta's current state, DF said that Battlefield 6 "is very shippable at the moment" and added that it has "a level of mechanical polish that feels top-notch." However, DF added that the game could really use some raytracing embellishments and that it doesn't feel innovative in the way that some of the previous titles have.</p><p>Among players, one of the current complaints is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-reveals-rush-is-limited-to-12v12-and-people-are-upset/1100-6533943/" data-ref-id="1100-6533943">the size of the 12v12 Rush mode</a> is too small, but the final game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-maps-are-too-small-players-say-but-bigger-ones-are-coming/1100-6533900/" data-ref-id="1100-6533900">bigger maps</a> may solve that issue. Regardless, Battlefield 6's beta has already passed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-beta-eclipses-call-of-duty-player-record-on-steam/1100-6533822/" data-ref-id="1100-6533822">Call of Duty's concurrent-player record</a>, as well as the record of the previous Battlefield games on Steam. The second Battlefield 6 open beta will conclude on August 17.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O | Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">One of Sega's announcements at EVO was the release date for the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of VF5 REVO, now titled VF5 REVO World Stage. The title isn't just a multiplatform rebrand--it will be receiving a host of new updates like cross-platform play, with the crown jewel being a brand-new, dedicated single-player experience akin to the Quest Modes seen in past Virtua Fighter games.</p><p dir="ltr">I've been consistently surprised at the amount of effort Aoki and his team have been putting into updating and revitalizing this classic title, and seeing the new single-player mode was a clear sign that they'd been listening to player feedback for such an addition. But there's still one thing I needed to know: What about all the extra character customization items and decorations from Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown that hadn't made their way into REVO?</p><p dir="ltr">"We've heard from players that they want more of the items they saw in the previous releases," Aoki said. "So, in World Stage mode, there is a tournament. As you proceed, you'll be able to earn some of those customization items. I do feel like there needs to be more new items, but for now, there are no plans."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550567-ss_2e8cd29e74239fe87dded592f9238a337410cb0d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550567" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550567-ss_2e8cd29e74239fe87dded592f9238a337410cb0d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550567"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550567-ss_2e8cd29e74239fe87dded592f9238a337410cb0d.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">An element where the Virtua Fighter teams have been stepping up their game has been community engagement. Besides opening an official Discord and running a global tournament series, the team has also been polling players on subjects like what controllers they use, what type of stages they dislike, and--most prominently--a global character popularity poll, with the results displayed on the official VF website.</p><p dir="ltr">I asked Aoki if the polls offered up any surprises. "We did do the poll around the time the first tournament for VF5 REVO was held in Chicago, at Frosty Faustings. Seeing the players there, I really felt that the characters that are relatively unpopular in Japan tend to be popular in the West. For example, Aoi was pretty popular, Brad was very popular, Eileen was very popular. Those Western characters usually are not on the top of the list in Japan. In Japan, it's more like Akira, Jacky, Pai, [and] Sarah. It was interesting to see, and I think that was reflected in the poll as well."</p><p dir="ltr">With the launch of VF5 REVO came the game's first major balance update in over a decade. Does the team use things like polls, online play data, and other analytics to decide on gameplay tweaks?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550569-ss_b8854174b3cc234e5bc8ec49573ee8b5ca1b018e.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550569" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550569-ss_b8854174b3cc234e5bc8ec49573ee8b5ca1b018e.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550569"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550569-ss_b8854174b3cc234e5bc8ec49573ee8b5ca1b018e.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We're not really thinking about things like who to make weaker or stronger, but to put everyone on a similar level," Aoki replied. "How do we balance characters and keep what makes them distinct? Previously, a lot of players said that Taka-Arashi was too strong. But we tried not to make him specifically much weaker, but bring everyone to his level."</p><p dir="ltr">Aoki also says that further tweaking is unlikely in the near future. "There are no plans for changes right now. But as time passes, we might get to a point where we say, 'Oh, maybe we should make some balance changes, when the timing is right.' But at the moment, there are no plans. Currently, I feel like the gameplay is in a complete state, but we'll see how it goes."</p><p dir="ltr">While Virtua Fighter titles have appeared as sub-games in many of the Yakuza/Like a Dragon titles, an official series compilation has never happened. I wondered if Aoki's legacy Virtua Fighter team had ever considered doing a Capcom Fighting Collection-style release of Virtua Fighter and similar Sega fighting games, such as the Fighting Vipers series and Last Bronx. "I've definitely seen those compilations and thought, 'We should do something like that.' …By doing that, we could bring back the old fans in addition to bringing in new fans. It's something to consider."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550570-ss_d8cc60fa4b89a81d78b394cdf3e5aa8895aa0d18.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550570" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550570-ss_d8cc60fa4b89a81d78b394cdf3e5aa8895aa0d18.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550570"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550570-ss_d8cc60fa4b89a81d78b394cdf3e5aa8895aa0d18.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While VF5 REVO <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDp345gGlJ8">had a full tournament</a> as part of the Evo Extended Lineup, what many VF players at the event were hoping to see was the New Virtua Fighter Project. Sega did not disappoint, with a gameplay showcase trailer in the Evo Arena on finals day debuting to cheers and awestruck gasps (and my frenzied screams of delight). With my anticipation continuing at a fever pitch, I was eager to chat with producer Riichiro Yamada about the upcoming game.</p><p dir="ltr">Though only a select few characters have been shown so far, those that have, such as Akira and Wolf, have seen some big changes to their appearance. They also look markedly older, potentially indicating the passage of time in the VF world. I asked Yamada if he could tell us a bit more about these changes. "We can't say much just yet, but yes, the time has passed on. The setting for VF5 was roughly around the year 2006. This game is not a parallel world or an alternate universe--it's based on a certain timeline."</p><p dir="ltr">Yamada also elaborated on how they're approaching character design this time around: "So up until now, the characters have been designed based on their combat style, with a short backstory for each character. We're redesigning them now based on their lifestyle, why they are fighting, what they are fighting for. That's the new approach that we've been taking."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550571-ss_66ed24c38e69d3364e96b68fd86cd943a24db064.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550571" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550571-ss_66ed24c38e69d3364e96b68fd86cd943a24db064.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550571"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550571-ss_66ed24c38e69d3364e96b68fd86cd943a24db064.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">One of the most talked-about elements of what's been shown so far--and that's been generating even more buzz with the Evo gameplay showcase trailer--has been the realism and fluidity of the combat animation, with details like characters having distinct guarding animations for specific attacks. "We really want people to be able to see the changes that we've made," says Yamada. "Virtua Fighter up until now might have been seen as very plain, not very flashy. However, we don't want to change it up too drastically--we want a cool, flashy sense of realism. Change it, but don't lose the essence."</p><p dir="ltr">"In the process of creating this game, I'm always thinking, 'What can we progress? What can we evolve? What can we make improvements on?' When I was a child, I used to watch kung-fu movies. Those movies make people and their combat look very exciting. I really wanted to bring that element into the game--the flow, like the smoothness, all the things I used to see in those classic kung-fu movies, you know, make people excited by watching those. That's the approach I've been taking right now."</p><p dir="ltr">"Before we released those trailers, I didn't know how the users would respond," he continues. "But seeing everyone enjoying it, I'm really relieved to see that players are excited."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="890327394" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

skills executed with directional movements. Only one game in the series--Virtua Fighter 3--significantly altered the control scheme by adding a fourth button. With the new Virtua Fighter making some clear visual changes, I wondered if the game would try anything new with the control scheme. "We're trying a lot of different things as we're fleshing out gameplay," Yamada answered. "But VF started as an arcade game, with deliberately simple controls. Punch-kick-guard is easy for players to grasp. So while I can't give specifics, the concept that I have in mind is 'anyone can play anyone can play easily, without any stress.'"</p><p dir="ltr">This being a game by Ryu ga Gotoku Studio--a team known for its storytelling prowess and character-building--many are expecting a heavy emphasis on story this time around compared to previous titles. "Previously, VF lacked much of an in-game narrative. Again, I can't say too much, but I would like people to look forward to how we put the narrative and gameplay elements together at the finish line."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/samadams.bsky.social/post/3lwbtrctwwk2t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grim month</a> for the field of criticism: the New York Times <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/maxtani.bsky.social/post/3lvle3phwms2u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reassigned veteran critics</a>, WaPo’s <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alanzilberman.bsky.social/post/3lvcmz6zvf22c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took a buyout</a>, Vanity Fair elected to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/vanity-fair-cut-back-coverage-hollywood-focus-mark-guiducci-1236487458/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eliminate reviews</a>, and Associated Press <a href="https://bookriot.com/associated-press-to-end-weekly-book-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did the same</a> with its book reviews. It’s beginning to look like curtains for criticism—at least of the traditional sort—but do not conflate the mercurial winds of economic change with a lack of need. On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we talk about that.</p><p>This time around we’re joined by our former Kotaku colleague <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dreamcastaway.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harper Jay</a> for a discussion of criticism’s role in a world that seems determined to reject it—or at least cast it out of mainstream publications, as well as many video game publications. What does it mean for institutions to cede this ground to fandoms and social media? What do we lose when we cease to respect the expertise that goes into well-considered critical work—or even eliminate the idea of “critic” as a legitimate role or job altogether?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we talk about the news of the week: Unionized workers at Arkane, a Microsoft-owned studio, released a statement <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-azure-arkane-israel-palestine-genocide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decrying the company’s complicity in Israel’s genocide</a> of Palestinians—a subject that hits close to home for Harper, who until very recently worked at Double Fine, another Microsoft studio. Finally, Gita explains why Eevee is the best Pokémon design (it’s a prism through which to view the infinite possibilities of childhood, obviously).&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can hire so many in-house critics that we’ll have to build a whole other house just for them.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> We’ve been talking a lot about fandom and the way people discuss things online – and the flattening of a whole bunch of different ideas that could be considered attempts at criticism, but mostly turn into arguments or policing people for not demonstrating sufficient ideological purity or whatever. And then we have publications ceding that ground and effectively saying that the traditional notion of a critic is something they’re no longer interested in. As a result, you could potentially say that the idea of being a career critic is going away, or becoming something you can only do on YouTube or whatever. What are your feelings on that dynamic shift?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Harper: </strong>It’s wrong. It’s wrong in the sense that anybody can call themselves a critic in the same way that anybody can say that they’re a journalist. The answer is: No you fucking aren’t. That’s a mean thing to say, and it’s not a question of their intentions; it’s a question of their ability. Which is not a popular sentiment to share, but the reason that newspapers have people who are critics is because it is a talent you develop just like anything else. It’s just like with people who say “I’m a journalist” and then just put “BREAKING” in front of all their tweets, that’s not the same thing as being a reporter. There are processes, there’s a body of knowledge that you have, there’s a tradition that you are connected to, there are standards that you hold yourself to.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s cool, and it’s often very good, that someone can jump on YouTube and make two hours of something that is incredibly personal and moving, and it’s right there; in some ways, there’s no barrier to entry. Anyone can do it. But also, the reason that you have positions at outlets or newspapers – and the reason why getting rid of them is bad – is because you’re ceding that process to people who do not have experience or training or standards.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> When I was working at Vice, I shifted pretty hard into criticism in a form I really enjoy—I wrote <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/when-joss-whedon-was-our-master/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Joss Whedon thing</a> and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/aaron-sorkins-liberal-fantasy-runs-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Aaron Sorkin thing</a>—and I literally could not have written those things without [editor] Tim Marchman.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Harper: </strong>I miss him.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I was texting him the other day, and it made me miss him a lot—him and his weird tinned fish obsession.</p><p>He gave me a lot of tools and provided me with things to read. He told me ways to approach these questions that I was trying to answer that I couldn’t have found on my own. Even just the process of getting on the phone with him and being like “I’m thinking X, Y, Z,” and he was like “Have you tried A, B, C,” those things helped me get my wheels turning in ways that I could not have done without him.&nbsp;</p><p>Criticism for me is often a collaborative process, even if I’m just getting up and going to my husband in the other room and saying, “I can’t figure out how to do this transition from one paragraph to the other. Can you help me understand what I’m trying to say here?” I know I could not be someone who gets on YouTube and talks for three hours about a movie. I need an editor. I need someone to help put guardrails on my arguments so I don’t fly off into random tangents.</p><p>There are people on YouTube who I think do a great job at criticism. I just watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZQv1_oosZg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seven-hour video about <em>Midsommar </em>and all the symbolism in it</a>, and the person who made the video, Novum, went so far as to reach out to actors on the film and production designers —so a really, really robust attempt to actually look at the work and think about meaning and how these symbols come together and create new meanings.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s possible [to do in the YouTube ecosystem]. But you can see and tell that this person comes from a tradition of talking and thinking about art in that way. And that kind of video is surrounded by other videos that are just like “<em>Midsommar</em> Ending Explained.”</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>You could even say those types of videos are the majority now. That’s the main form of discourse around these types of media, whether we’re talking games, TV, film, or whatever else, and then as an outlier you have people digging into something and trying to talk specifically about themes and the ideas a work is trying to explore – which I think is often the point when an artist creates something. But people are getting hung up on “Oh, there’s a plot hole here.”</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>Or literally even dumber, [a lot of videos] are just about what happened. “What was the sequence of events I just watched?” You can use your own brain to figure that out!</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It’s the plot section of a Wikipedia page.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>You can see the lack of facility here. And of course now a lot of those “Blah blah blah ending explained” videos are AI slop. AI voiceover and ChatGPT script put together with algorithmic editing of random clips from the film. That is worrying to me, because it’s not just about lack of media literacy—although I know that’s a popular conversation topic these days. It’s about a lack of curiosity. Not wanting to do the thinking yourself, but wanting something else to do the thinking for you—it is the thing that really concerns me about widespread use of ChatGPT.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/alien-earth-noah-hawley-fx-hulu-ridley-scott"><h3>Alien: Earth Has The Juice</h3></a><p>I was skeptical, but Noah Hawley has not let me down yet.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/cyberpunk-urban-design"><h3>What Cyberpunk 2077 Can Teach Real-World Cities</h3></a><p>Night City's urban design highlights the problems, and solutions, real cities deal with around walkability, housing, and mixed-use areas</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/iwalkfree-review-broken-foot"><h3>I Broke My Foot But The iWalkFree Gave Me Mobility Back</h3></a><p>Breaking your foot sucks, but the iWalkFree 3.0 gets you half way to walking again with some minor caveats.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-nty-wapo-vanity-fair-critics]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>By the time the credits rolled on the first episode of the new FX series <em>Alien: Earth</em>, I was shocked by how much I enjoyed it. Other than the first two films, <em>Alien</em> and <em>Aliens</em>, the legacy of the groundbreaking science fiction series has been divisive, to say the least. When I saw that Noah Hawley, who has also developed television adaptations of <em>Fargo</em> and created the X-Men series <em>Legion</em>, was credited for both directing and writing the series, I knew that we’re all in good hands.</p><p>I gave up on there being another good <em>Alien</em> movie a long time ago. As a general rule, I’m not a fan of extending something into a franchise when a story feels complete. <em>Alien</em> was its own complete story—one that gestured at a wider world, but a story with a beginning, middle and end. It’s extraordinarily lucky that <em>Aliens</em> is also an amazing movie, though an action movie rather than a compact science fiction thriller. But after these two successes, there’s been a series of duds and half starts, and some outright abominations (<em>Alien vs. Predator</em>).</p><p>As much as I personally enjoy a movie like <em>Alien: Covenant</em>, it is an objective truth that even the return of director Ridley Scott could not bring back the magic of that first <em>Alien</em> movie. As much as I like <em>Alien: Romulus</em>, it too relies on nostalgia for the past rather than creating new places for the story to go. This is not the case with <em>Alien: Earth</em>, which has two episodes streaming on Hulu right now. I think a large part of that is Noah Hawley.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Alien: Earth | Official Trailer | FX" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZbsiKjVAV28?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The first show written by Hawley that I watched was <em>Legion</em>, which is an adaptation of <em>X-Men</em>, sort of. It follows David Haller, a mutant in a mental hospital who later learns that the things he thought were mental illness were actually his mutant powers manifesting. Though the show becomes more uneven the longer it goes on, it’s always ambitious and visually adventurous. Instead of putting a hand to his temple and squinting, Haller’s psychic powers are portrayed as dance offs, Bollywood musical sequences, and at one point, a duet between him and his nemesis of the song “Behind Blue Eyes.”&nbsp;</p><p><em>Legion</em> manages to capture aspects of the X-Men and mutant culture that exist in comics that never makes it into the movies: mutants are discriminated against, and therefore a lot of them end up in the dregs of society. What would it feel like to have potentially world altering power, but also be in the throes of a drug addiction? Similarly, Hawley’s <em>Fargo</em> show is more than just a series of crime stories. It tries to grasp at the tone, and especially the humor, of the Coen Brothers’ film without retreading plot points too closely.</p><p>This is the great strength of <em>Alien: Earth</em>. It isn’t just another game of cat and mouse with the infamous xenomorph—though there is still plenty of suspense centered around where the xenomorph currently is, and where it’s going to go next. Like the original film, it’s also about how megacorporations like the fictional Weyland Yutani treat its workers as expendable in their quest to learn the secrets of immortality from the nigh indestructible xenomorph. In a way, the xenomorph itself becomes a literalization of the extractive nature of capitalism: it takes from people and hollows them out from the inside, all in the service of replicating itself. All of the entries in the <em>Alien</em> franchise that I enjoy makes that tension a part of their narratives.</p><figure><figcaption>Image Source: <a href="https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/alien-earth/galleries/first-look" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FX</a></figcaption></figure><p>Much of the first episode of <em>Alien: Earth</em> is about a new megacorp, Prodigy, which is experimenting in transferring consciousness from children with terminal illnesses into adult synthetic bodies.These synthetics have child minds, but they are in adult bodies, leading to some fun acting choices with these adult actors trying to portray that mentally these characters are all about eleven or twelve. Due to the secrecy surrounding this new technology, Prodigy does not allow these synthetics to return to their families ever again. The first child transferred into an adult synthetic body, Wendy, is allowed to see her brother, but only from a distance, watching him through viewscreens but never allowed to contact him.</p><p>In the first episode, a space craft crashes into a skyscraper, and Wendy watches her brother jump into action as a first responder. Wendy talks her handler into allowing her and her fellow synthetics to assist in rescuing people, and doing a bit of corporate espionage on the side. Of course–of course!—there is a xenomorph on that very ship. And boy howdy does it love tearing people apart.</p><p>More than just the fascinating mysteries that Hawley sets up in its first two episodes—the circumstances of how the xenomorph broke free from containment on a space ship, leading to it crashing into a populated city, are so far unrevealed—<em>Alien: Earth</em> is gorgeous to look at. The camera swings and careens down narrow hallways, picking up speed as if it's on a rollercoaster. There is detail packed into every frame, things moving behind people’s heads as they examine the crash, something scuttling in the background as they turn each corner. Most impressive to me are the show's use of soft fades to transition from shot to shot, overlaying images on top of each other into a collage. It all feels thoughtful and considered, a show you cannot watch while looking at your phone.</p><p>For a long time I never wanted an entry in the <em>Alien</em> series where the xenomorph comes to Earth. Hell, I thought most of the entries where the xenomorph is in space were cheap cash grabs relying on nostalgia—a xenomorph on Earth felt creatively bankrupt, as if the series were scraping at the bottom of the barrel to win back fans. After watching two episodes of <em>Alien: Earth</em> I stand corrected. There is something interesting in the idea of a corporation unleashing something this deadly on humanity, only to watch their plans all go up in flames.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-nty-wapo-vanity-fair-critics"><h3>Despite What NYT, WaPo, And Vanity Fair Seem To Think, We Still Need Critics</h3></a><p>"You’re ceding that process to people who do not have experience or training or standards"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/cyberpunk-urban-design"><h3>What Cyberpunk 2077 Can Teach Real-World Cities</h3></a><p>Night City's urban design highlights the problems, and solutions, real cities deal with around walkability, housing, and mixed-use areas</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/iwalkfree-review-broken-foot"><h3>I Broke My Foot But The iWalkFree Gave Me Mobility Back</h3></a><p>Breaking your foot sucks, but the iWalkFree 3.0 gets you half way to walking again with some minor caveats.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/alien-earth-noah-hawley-fx-hulu-ridley-scott]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>The overwhelming consensus among the first hands-on demos with <em>Borderlands 4</em> earlier this summer was that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/borderlands-4-hands-on-preview/">it’s more of the same</a>. If you already like <em>Borderlands</em>, the sequel is likely to provide everything fans usually show up for. If not, well, TBD on how many nonbelievers Gearbox Entertainment manages to win over with its most ambitious looter shooter yet. Much of that will come down to the details, and the studio has been sharing a lot of them recently. Here’s a bunch of stuff we learned <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-price-tag-70-drama-pitchford-80-real-fan-1851784583">about <em>Borderlands 4</em> this week</a>.</p> <h2>Split-screen co-op returns</h2> <p>Senior project producer Anthony Nicholson<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/12/how-borderlands-4-built-for-co-op-ground-up/"> wrote on Xbox Wire this week</a> that in addition to supporting local co-op, <em>Borderlands 4</em> will also let you play with another pair of people in split-screen mode. Two TVs, four-player sessions, tons of chaos. Teaming up has also apparently been streamlined with a better lobby system and improved dynamic level scaling, including the option for each player to set their own difficulty.</p> <h2>Switch 2 won’t have couch co-op</h2> <p>“Switch 2 players will have the same exciting <em>Borderlands 4</em> experience as other platforms minus the split-screen option, and yes, it will have full cross-play with Epic, Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox X|S,” reads <a href="https://support.borderlands.com/hc/en-us/articles/43481582561939-Borderlands-4-Nintendo-Switch-2-FAQ#h_01K1XYNFY9RTPMT184WZ70D421">the Nintendo version’s support page</a>. The port targets 30fps and arrives on October 3, roughly three weeks after the platforms.</p>

 <h2>There are over 30 billion guns</h2> <p>Yes, that’s a real stat Gearbox is pushing. One of the reasons for that big number is that <em>Borderlands 4</em> lets you mix-and-match elements from different in-universe weapons manufacturers. Then there are all of the RNG stat and perk drops you can get. According to Nicholson, the studio created a Matrix-like gun rack to help conceptualize all the possibilities and prevent the game from spitting out combinations that wouldn’t work.</p> <p>“It was this really large gun map where you could see all of the individual parts for all the individual guns, for all the individual manufacturers,” he <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/borderlands-randy-pitchford-interview-borderlands-4">told the Epic Games Store blog</a>. “It made it so you could see how each of those things were and how we could have those combinations roll together and how they would work—the slides, the animators, the actions, the art all fitting together. Because a certain gun, if it pumps one way, but there’s a long barrel that goes on the bottom, obviously those parts can’t go together.”</p> <h2><em>Borderlands 4</em> has “more passive perks than all the previous <em>Borderlands</em> combined”</h2> <p>Size matters, at least for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands4/comments/1lh1qm0/borderlands_4_long_info_dump_compiled_from_32/">Gearbox’s marketing guys</a>. The <em>Borderlands 4</em> map is bigger than the last two numbered entries combined. The guns have four times as many polygons as <em>Borderlands 3</em>. All those billions of guns. You get the idea. The skill tree follows a similar pattern. It sounds more advanced, and potentially overwhelming, than any game prior—more <em>Diablo 4</em> or<em> Path of Exile</em> than your traditional RPG shooter.</p>

 <p>“The Augment and the Capstone system that we have forces you to make a choice and all of them drastically change the ability that each player has,” character designer Nick Thurston <a href="https://www.polygon.com/borderlands-4-passive-perks-interview-gearbox/">told <em>Polygon</em></a>. “That <em>alone&nbsp;</em>would create more build diversity than we’ve ever had. But then we also have more passives than all the previous Borderlands combined. I think Amon alone has 87 passives, and most Vault Hunters have about 80.”</p> <h2>Techno Viking Amon is<em> Borderland</em>‘s “most complicated” Vault Hunter yet</h2> <p>Amon is the guy with the big fire and ice axes you see in all the <em>Borderlands 4</em> trailers. But looks can be deceiving. He’s not just a tanky melee character. He’s apparently the poster child for the new game’s build variety. Everyone in a squad could play as Amon, but the styles might all be different, Gearbox claims. Melee, ranged, support, he can do it all. Unlike most of the franchise’s Vault Hunters that pop abilities and then just shoot stuff, Amon’s skills can be deployed in more ways.</p>

 <p>“He just has more abilities than any other Vault Hunter numerically because of his trait, which allows him to have forge skills,” Thurston <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-amon-is-a-more-complicated-vault-hunter-to-play-than-past-options/1100-6533956/">told <em>GameSpot</em></a>. “I wouldn’t say he’s super complicated, but he has a lot more going on in the middle of combat, and he’s a lot more active than I think a lot of people historically expect from Vault Hunters.” He sounds like a more advanced archetype than some of the others, though Gearbox says he’s still approachable to new players.</p> <h2><em>Borderlands 4</em> is inspired by mergers, acquisitions, and fascism</h2> <p>The game takes place on a prison planet called Kairos. Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford suggests that’s a not-so-subtle illusion to the studio’s rocky period during which it was sold to the <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-gearbox-embracer-acquisition-1851297286">poorly conceived Embracer holding company</a>, before trying to escape again. The studio group is now owned by longtime publishing partner 2K Games, part of the broader Take-Two portfolio that includes <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> maker Rockstar Games and mobile maker Zynga.</p> <p>“There’s this cultural and emotional shift in me, personally, and at the studio. What does it mean to trade some autonomy for organization?” he told <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/borderlands-randy-pitchford-interview-borderlands-4">the Epic Games Store blog</a>: “What does it feel like to move up and down the scale between autonomy and being organized or even being controlled? On one end of a spectrum you have anarchy, and on the other end of the spectrum you have fascism, totalitarianism, zero freedom. It’s not just about societies—that’s all of us as individuals, to imagine where we want to be on that spectrum and how comfortable we are. And we were going through that as a company.”</p>

<section><p>Amid uncertainty for the future of alternative games, these developers share a resolve to keep going.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">When thousands of works were deindexed from Itch just a few weeks ago, livelihoods hung in the balance.</p><p dir="ltr">Itch hosted the works of developers, artists, writers, and zinesters. It was (and is) home to taboo pornography, garden-variety smut, video game memoirs, and game jam detritus. Over the last five years, it has perhaps become best known for hosting massive charity bundles, supporting causes like Black Lives Matter, Ukraine war relief, and Palestinian liberation. Those bundles were lined with small projects from hobbyist creators alongside big hits from professional developers. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-io-joins-steam-in-recent-push-to-ban-adult-games/1100-6533423/">When payment processors forced Itch to de-index thousands of games </a>following a pressure campaign from a right-wing anti-porn group, they threatened all of these avenues of artistic expression and financial income.</p><p dir="ltr">Nathalie Lawhead, a developer and artist who has hosted their work on Itch for years, is one of the creators who could be affected by the large-scale push for increased censorship. Their game, Everything is Going to Be Okay, is part of the permanent collection in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. But despite its acceptance into a major hub of mainstream arts culture, their work has struggled to find a home in the world of video games.</p><p dir="ltr">"The work I host on Itch is all the work that I had struggled in the past to get on mainstream storefronts... I can't count the number of times that my work has been rejected because of reasons like ’simulated error’ (glitch art), or because it features a visual style a storefront deems inappropriate, or because it is built a certain way that's not standard enough for these storefronts," Lawhead said over email.</p><p dir="ltr">Lawhead's work is not, strictly speaking, "gamey." They have described Everything is Going to Be Okay as a zine, and their upcoming game Blue Suburbia as an interactive poem. Lawhead's words and their work reflect a broader truth about Itch: that it has acted as a bastion for the weird and off-center from its inception.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4550338-exvhos.png" data-ref-id="1300-4550338" data-ratio="0.6669167291823" data-width="1333" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4550338-exvhos.png" data-ref-id="1300-4550338"></a><figcaption>An image from Lawhead's Everything is Going to Be Okay</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4550338-exvhos.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">For Lawhead and many other developers, the mass de-indexing represents a threat to that weirdness, whether their works are NSFW or not. In our conversation, Lawhead emphasized, "We are losing our ability to create work like this, slowly."</p><p dir="ltr">Other developers worry about the effect these bans will have on their thought process.</p><p dir="ltr">"I almost included a sex scene in my game Spring Gothic, but if I had put a sex scene in there, it would have been delisted," visual novel developer and critic Kastel said on a phone call. "I don't want to think like that. That's self-censorship."</p><p dir="ltr">For Howling Angel Games founder Olivia Nenmyx, their freedom to approach sensitive topics was hard-won.</p><p dir="ltr">"I had a lot of religious or psychological guilt around abnormal kink," they said over Zoom. "It took a lot of therapy and encouragement to start writing porn."</p><p dir="ltr">It's that experience that makes them determined to fight for the right of expression, but also frightened of what this precedent could mean.</p><p dir="ltr">"I know first-hand how strong the pressure to fall-in-line can be. I see a lot of people shying away from or not expressing themselves in ways that are controversial," Nenmyx said.</p><p dir="ltr">In kind, Kastel sees a danger in trying to police more taboo work.</p><p dir="ltr">"The executives, they don't really care if works are SFW or NSFW. Those are terms that creators and players decide," she said. "In the end, the payment processors are deciding everything and they have their own paradigms."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4550339-weemdu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550339" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4550339-weemdu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550339"></a><figcaption>An image from Kastel's Spring Gothic</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4550339-weemdu.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In addition to these concerns, the de-indexing has caused a lot of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-the-greatest-pc-games-of-2024-was-removed-from-itch-io-search-results/1100-6533495/">confusion and misinformation</a>. Press and players cited Consume Me and Mouthwashing as examples of affected games, but Itch had actually de-indexed both games before receiving pressure from payment processors, for unrelated reasons. The mess has caused some developers to criticize Itch fiercely, claiming the storefront should have done more, both to protect developers and warn them about what was happening.</p><p dir="ltr">Lawhead, however, believes that Itch deserves some benefit of the doubt.</p><p dir="ltr">"They don't have the resources that a place like Steam does," Lawhead said. "They are about as indie as I am. It's not hard to knock something like that off its feet and make it impossible for it to get back up... The only way to fight this is to understand that we are all in this together, and that includes<a href="http://itch.io/" rel="nofollow "> Itch.io</a> too."</p><p dir="ltr">But the question remains: How and where should independent artists share their work? As "someone that's already tried every possible alternative" and "that's been very vocal about alternatives out there," Lawhead admits they are skeptical there are real substitutes for Itch. Indeed, in the weeks since this policy changed the landscape of Itch, no obvious new options have emerged--although the dust is still settling and it is unclear what will remain in the aftermath or if Itch's policies will change. But the threat payment processors pose to marginal work is bigger than Itch or even Steam. True alternatives may be hard to find.</p><p dir="ltr">Some developers are already planning to divest. While Nenmyx wants to maintain a relationship with Itch, they are actively looking for alternatives and have added a storefront to their studio's website.</p><p dir="ltr">"I will continue to host free demos on Itch to try and get people onto my site, but I don't think I'm going to host paid content on Itch in the future," they said. "That's not set in stone though."</p><p dir="ltr">Kastel believes that trust will be slow to return, if it comes back at all.</p><p dir="ltr">"Even if Itch survives, people are going to be concerned that their games will be pulled off," Katel said. "The optimal way is probably, make a jam on Itch, but also upload a mirror copy somewhere else, like the Internet Archive."</p><p dir="ltr">But while individuals scramble for potential solutions, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-and-steams-new-policies-reflect-a-larger-battle-on-free-speech/1100-6533750/">the stakes of the broader fight remain high</a>. For Lawhead, the fate of Itch could set a precedent that would affect our online lives in every way.</p><p dir="ltr">"Given the bigger context of how corporations and monopolies have funneled everyone into these heavily-controlled walled gardens that now occupy our daily online lives, or even the way us developers can distribute software... I don't think there's any coming back from this."</p><p dir="ltr">It's hard not to see what they mean, as the<a href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/case-dismissed-wikipedia-loses-uk-online-safety-act-legal-challenge-but-it-may-still-be-safe-from-age-checks" rel="nofollow "> UK threatens the country's access to Wikipedia</a> or as Steam removes games like Vile: Exhumed. But Lawhead is not giving up.</p><p dir="ltr">"We need Itch.io to live," they said. "We need our own precedent."</p>

It's cooled by a very robust 360mm all-in-one liquid cooling system and run off an 850W power supply.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Radeon RX 9070 XT Received a 10/10 at IGN</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We rated the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT a "perfect" 10/10. Even though it costs $150 less than the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, the 9070 XT beats it out in several of the games we tested. In a few benchmarks, the results aren't even close. The 9070 XT is also comparable in performance to the older $1,000 RX 7900 XTX but with better ray tracing and upscaling performance than its predecessor. It does lose out on VRAM (16GB vs 24GB), but that isn't really an issue for gaming. By "4K ready" I mean that this gaming PC can run pretty much any game at 4K resolution and at framerates of 60fps or higher. Any video card that's weaker and you'll have to compromise in order to get playable framerates. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Battlefield 6 Beta Runs This Weekend</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 is out in October and there's one final open beta that runs August 14-17.
