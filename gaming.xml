Sometimes talking to a new <em>Dragon Age </em>fan can feel like walking on eggshells until you get a sense for where they fall on the community’s most hotly debated topics. Are they an <em>Origins </em>purist? A Templar apologist? Are they insistent that you must play every single one of <em>Origins</em>’ DLC packs for the full experience?

Each <em>Dragon Age </em>game has a different protagonist, and that trend is continuing into <em>The Veilguard </em>as Rook replaces the Inquisitor from <em>Inquisition</em>. However, the Inquisitor’s story is nowhere near finished by the time <em>Inquisition</em>’s over, and it’s only made more personal for them at the end of the <em>Trespasser </em>DLC. However, I know that suggesting that the Inquisitor should have been the protagonist fighting Solas in <em>The Veilguard </em>will inevitably get you responses pointing out how <em>Dragon Age </em>has always changed protagonists and to question if that’s effective or not is to question the natural order. So no matter how unsatisfying a former protagonist’s role in the continuation of their own story is, do not suggest that there is a better way, because someone will try to explain away your concerns.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4021affd6421c5289e357e50279bc3d8" data-recommend-id="image://4021affd6421c5289e357e50279bc3d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Varric holding Bianca." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Varric holding Bianca." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4021affd6421c5289e357e50279bc3d8" data-recommend-id="image://4021affd6421c5289e357e50279bc3d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Varric holding Bianca." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Look, everyone has their preferred characters in a party-driven RPG, and sometimes you might not align with the perceived consensus.

But you could also argue that it’s a fascinating microcosm of game design that even if it does bring the pacing of <em>Origins </em>to a screeching halt, it’s worth respecting—no, no, the meme must live on.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7ed1953e128128ef2b50ce5b96231981" data-recommend-id="image://7ed1953e128128ef2b50ce5b96231981" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Anders defends another mage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Anders defends another mage." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Dragon Age Wiki</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7ed1953e128128ef2b50ce5b96231981" data-recommend-id="image://7ed1953e128128ef2b50ce5b96231981" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Anders defends another mage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/GoggleboxQuotes/status/1153736715980484614&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/GoggleboxQuotes/status/1153736715980484614" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“We all like a bad boy though, don’t we?”</a></span></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/GoggleboxQuotes/status/1153736715980484614&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/GoggleboxQuotes/status/1153736715980484614" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Yeah, not a fucking terrorist.”</a></span></p><p>There is at least some nuance to the event in which Anders, <em>Dragon Age II</em>’s possessed revolutionary mage, blows up a church and sparks a war between the mages and templars.

<p>Over the last two years, a trend has emerged that doesn’t appear to be going anywhere, anytime soon. I’m talking, of course, about the handheld gaming PC. </p>



<p>From Valve’s Steam Deck that really brought the market to the mainstream to the ASUS ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go, and upcoming MSI Claw, there are plenty of options on the market for consumers. The worry becomes that it can start to get overwhelming when deciding which option is the best for your needs.</p>



<p>To help you figure out what best suites you, we’ve taken a look at the available devices (no, the Nintendo Switch doesn’t count for this) and put together reasons to either purchase or avoid each handheld gaming PC.</p>



<p>One thing to note, these are all devices that are currently available and have been used by those at Insider Gaming. The MSI Claw, OneXPlayer OneXFly, and more will be added after it’s been used and tested.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-valve-steam-deck">Valve Steam Deck</h2>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Specification</th><th>Details</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>CPU</td><td>4-core, 8-thread AMD Zen 2</td></tr><tr><td>GPU</td><td>8-core AMD RDNA 2</td></tr><tr><td>Display</td><td>LCD: 7-inch 1200 x 800 LCD 60Hz<br>OLED: 7.4-inch 1280 x 800 90Hz HDR OLED </td></tr><tr><td>RAM</td><td>16 GB LPDDR5</td></tr><tr><td>SSD</td><td>Starting 256GB NVMe SSD (LCD)<br>Starting at 512GB (OLED)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>1.47 lbs</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>11.73″ x 4.6″ x 1.92″</td></tr><tr><td>Price</td><td>Starting at $399.99 for LCD<br>Starting at $549.99 for OLED</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam Deck</a> was the first major player to the market, and it remains one of the best. A Linux-based device, the Steam Deck doesn’t have the same drawbacks that other handheld PCs available have to deal with. There’s no Windows bloat that takes up space, and it’s a lot more friendly to get set up right out of the box.</p>



<p>It’s not the most powerful device, and some games will struggle. But that’s to be expected for a price as low as $399. Some games won’t be able to run at full settings and there are extra steps for games to be labeled as “Steam Deck Verified”. I will say though, most games I’ve played like Cyberpunk 2077, Elden Ring, Lords of the Fallen, and more have had no problem running.</p>



<p>If simplicity and a quick setup is high on your list, then the Steam Deck is a no brainer. And with the OLED version available, one of the biggest problems I have is no longer the cast. The only other real problem I still have with it is its battery life. Depending on the game, I’m lucky to get 90 minutes out of a full charge. You’re also limited to playing just Steam games if you don’t want to learn how to get Battle.net, PlayStation Plus, etc. up and running on your machine. So that could turn some people off.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/p/handheld/legion-go/len106g0001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lenovo Legion Go</a> may be the most underrated of the available handheld PCs. To me, it’s the most comfortable of the devices available. The way it just sits in your hands and feels natural helps make longer game sessions feel like nothing. For me, it was hard to go back to the Steam Deck because of the comfort level I had with the Legion Go</p>



<p>What <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lenovo-legion-go-wants-to-be-the-handheld-pc-for-all-gamers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sets it more apart</a> from other handheld PCs are the detachable controllers. It gives off major Nintendo Switch vibes. It gives more flexibility in how you want to play, which helps those who can’t sit there holding the handheld.</p>



<p>It’s a Windows 11 machine meaning you have to do your standard login and utilize the Windows task bars, menus, etc. in order to get to your games. That said, because it’s Windows, getting Battle.Net, Ubisoft Connect, and other launchers installed and set up is a piece of cake. It’s a great option for those that have games on different launchers and want the flexibility of the detachable controllers.</p>



<p>One thing to be aware of is how bulky the Legion Go is. It’s not heavy, but it’s big, sitting at 11.76 inches long. That said, it’s not a turnoff unless you have really small hands or, maybe, want this for a child.  Also, it features a 1600p display which may require you to mess with in-game settings quite a bit to get your games to look the way you want.</p>

<h2 id="h-asus-rog-ally">ASUS ROG Ally</h2>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Specification</th><th>Details</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>CPU</td><td>AMD Ryzen Z1/Extreme</td></tr><tr><td>GPU</td><td>AMD Ryzen Z1/Extreme</td></tr><tr><td>Display</td><td>7-inch 1920 x 1080 120Hz</td></tr><tr><td>RAM</td><td>16GB LPDDR5</td></tr><tr><td>SSD</td><td>512GB-1TB NVMe SSD</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>1.34 lbs</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>11.02″ x 4.37″ x 0.83</td></tr><tr><td>Price</td><td>Starting at $499.99/ROG Ally X is $799.99</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>It’s been on the market for a year now and the ROG Ally X is here, showing that ASUS isn’t playing around with its effort on the market. Another Windows 11 system, the ROG Ally offers the same features from a software standpoint as the Legion Go. What will set it apart is your preference of the above specifications and the feel of the device.</p>



<p>As our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-good-asus-rog-ally-one-year-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grant Taylor-Hill said</a>: “It’s a sleek device that has a nice splash of RGB front and centre, which appeals to the gamer in all of us. The face buttons are a good size and are tactile, and the whole setup is made to mimic an Xbox or a PlayStation controller, right down to the sloped triggers and large, curved shoulder buttons.”</p>

The developer has since responded and implemented a change to make the player experience more enjoyable.</p><p dir="ltr">At launch, players were only allowed to create one character in Once Human. The game doesn't allow characters to be deleted, so players were upset to find themselves committed to only one character and asked for the option to be able to create multiple characters to use across different servers.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Zenless Zone Zero Review</p>
      </div>
<h2>Zenless Zone Zero - how to redeem codes</h2><p>Your codes for ZZZ freebies don't do anything if you don't know how to redeem them. First, let's go over that step. There are two ways to redeem ZZZ codes: one on the internet and one via the game itself.

Classic side-scrolling beat-'em-up Double Dragon is being reimagined in 3D by Arc System Works, the fighter-focused studio behind the likes of Dragon Ball FighterZ and Guilty Gear.
</p>
<p>
Double Dragon (for those needing a quick history refresher) first made a splash in arcades back in 1987, and has seen numerous sequels, spin-offs, and crossover releases - for both arcade and home systems - in the years since. Arc acquired the rights to the series in 2015, and would go on to release Double Dragon 4 in 2017, albeit to a fairly lukewarm reception.
</p>
<p>
While Double Dragon 4 and last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/double-dragon-gaiden-rise-of-the-dragons-out-this-summer">Secret Base-developed Double Dragon Gaiden: Rise Of The Dragons</a> both leaned heavily on the series' retro lineage, sporting a 2D pixel art aesthetic, Arc System Works has now announced a modern reimagining that'll shift the series into 3D.

<p>
As revealed in the latest issue of Japanese gaming magazine Weekly Famitsu and <a href="http://ryokutya2089.com/archives/77375">reported by ryokutya2089.com</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/arc-system-works-is-working-on-a-new-3d-double-dragon/">VGC</a>), Arc's new series instalment - appropriately titled Double Dragon Revive - is due to launch next year on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC.
</p>
<p>
Details are limited, but it'll apparently feature modernised controls and difficulty options, plus classic series characters - including the Lee brothers, Roper, and Abobo - all reimagined in 3D. You can get a glimpse its visual overhaul in the screens below.

Eurogamer contributor Simon Parkin wasn't entirely convinced by Double Dragon 4's slavishly archaic rhythms when he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/double-dragon-4-review">reviewed</a> Arc System Works' first original Double Dragon effort back in 2017, so perhaps a more modernised refresh is exactly what the series needs. Expect to hear more ahead of Double Dragon Revive's PlayStation, Xbox, and PC release next year.

It follows androids 2B and 9S on their mission to rid a post-apocalyptic Earth of evil machine lifeforms in order to make the planet hospitable for the remaining humans, who have been living on the moon for safety. As this is a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nier-automatas-director-i-might-be-broken-in-some-way-1824147208&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nier-automatas-director-i-might-be-broken-in-some-way-1824147208">Yoko Taro</a></span> joint, the story has tendrils that spiral out to touch on some pretty heavy themes about morality, philosophy, what it means to be human, and the absurdity of war. And <em>Ver1.1a</em> brings over a lot of what fans of the game love. It has the same voice actors, the same character designs, the same general plot, and Yoko Taro is involved. But what makes it special is how the show diverges from the path laid out by its source material.</p><p>The first few episodes of the series follow the dialogue and direction of the game’s cutscenes pretty closely, so it’s not until later that <em>Ver1.1a</em> starts to reveal its complexities. This is mainly done through the character of Lily, who is part of the android resistance against the machines on Earth and a new face for those who played the game, but not to those who know the extended lore of the <em>NieR/Drakengard </em>universe. She’s actually from a play that serves as a prequel to the game, which has heavy ties to its third protagonist, A2. Tying her story directly into the show creates ripples and permutations of what we as returning fans know. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-nier-replicant-remaster-does-many-good-things-and-o-1846743596&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-nier-replicant-remaster-does-many-good-things-and-o-1846743596"><em>Nier Replicant</em></a></span> proved Taro is always iterating on stories, yet <em>Ver1.a</em>’s changes are done so seamlessly that newcomers aren’t lost. For those who haven’t played the game, <em>Ver1.1a</em> has served as a wonderful streamlining that encapsulates what makes the source material so great without losing too much in translation. </p><p>I think that’s owed to Yoko Taro’s skill at crafting stories in plenty of different mediums. He’s done theater, TV, and games and knows the strengths of each medium. For <em>Nier: Automata,</em> one of the biggest pillars of the game is how player choice and interactivity feel exceptionally important to how the themes are communicated to the player. That’s probably best exemplified by the game’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/every-time-nier-automata-ends-it-gets-better-1793524744&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/every-time-nier-automata-ends-it-gets-better-1793524744">multiple endings</a></span>, which range from short jokes to deeply emotional finales. To give anime viewers a piece of that, the show ends each episode with a short puppet play with its own (sometimes completely new) endings to the show’s story. </p><figure id="" data-id="9b140b5128943deef31107021017c7a3" data-recommend-id="image://9b140b5128943deef31107021017c7a3" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoiler warning graphic" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="9b140b5128943deef31107021017c7a3" data-recommend-id="image://9b140b5128943deef31107021017c7a3" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoiler warning graphic" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The first part of season 1 ended in dramatic fashion, revealing perhaps the game’s biggest twist. Humanity is entirely dead and the androids are only continuing their mission, so they do not go into an existential crisis. 9S discovers this and then quickly loses his memory of the major discovery. Part 2 picks up from there, showing vignettes of 2B and 9S traveling together. Each vignette ends with 9S dying or being reset in some way until the second grand reveal comes that 2B is his executioner and has killed versions of him many times in the past due to his realization about the truth of humanity. </p><p>The anime takes this betrayal one step forward by showing it actually happen, something the game only tells us about. It’s brutal and heartbreaking and shows how useful <em>Ver1.1a </em>is as a companion to its source material. <em>Nier </em>games demand a lot of the player, asking them to play multiple times to reach the true ending. A lot of players probably never get past ending A, but <em>Ver1.1a </em>succinctly tells the stories leading to endings A and B.<br></p><p>It’s impressive how much <em>Ver1.1</em> achieves as an adaptation. It serves diehard fans by tying in deeper lore directly into the plot, it gives gamers who only saw a part of the story a chance to experience it in full, and it serves as a complete package for newcomers. It’s quite an accomplishment, and it continues the excellence and ingenuity of the <em>Nier </em>series’ storytelling. If you haven’t been watching it, it’s time to start.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ian-%E2%80%98crimsix%E2%80%99-porter-inducted-into-esta-hall-of-fame.924024/</guid>

<p>EsportsNext 2024 just wrapped up in Chicago, with the Esports Trade Association bringing the curtain down on another successful event. From July 7 – 9, the ESTA hosted an esports-centric networking event and showcase, along with an awards ceremony and an induction event that saw Ian ‘Crimsix’ Porter brought into the ESTA Hall of Fame.</p>



<p>This stellar showcase went hand-in-hand with the news that the city’s mayor, Brandon Johnson, had declared July 7 ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/chicago-mayor-declare-esports-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Esports Day in Chicago</a>‘.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fame-indeed">Fame Indeed</h2>



<p>The ESTA works to spread awareness and raise support for the industry across North America. It aids those seeking career paths in the esports industry just as much as it hosts networking events to allow businesses to forge valuable relationships that could act as bedrocks in the developing foundation of the global esports ecosystem. </p>



<p>Last year, the ESTA inducted its first member into the Hall of Fame – Charles Conroy. With more than 18 years of experience working in the esports industry, Conroy was dubbed as playing ‘a pivotal role in the expansion and business development of several prominent gaming organisations.’</p>



<p>He’s now joined by Ian ‘Crimsix’ Porter, a superstar esports competitor who retired from the Call of Duty scene in 2022 and found a new passion in simracing. He has since moved on to track racing and drives for Rafa Racing Club – and he’s a shining talent on the road as much as he was on the sticks.</p>



<p>Crimsix is the winningest Call of Duty player of all time, boasting three world championship titles, thirty-nine ‘chips’, and tenure at some of the most prestigious esports organisations in the COD scene. He played at the top of his game for more than a decade, acting as a stalwart fountain of experience for newer players to lean on. If anyone deserves a spot <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7216854921990537217-0RZT/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in the ESTA Hall of Fame</a>, it’s Ian Porter.</p>

                <p>Prime Day 2024 is right around the corner, but Amazon is already slashing prices on some of the most popular gadgets of the year. This includes the latest iPad Pro and iPad Air lineups, with over 10 different models seeing generous discounts. One of our favorite deals is for the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Pro-13-Inch-Landscape/dp/B0D3J7ZX58?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple iPad Pro 13-Inch (M4, Wi-Fi + Cellular, 256GB)</a>, as it's down to just $1,389 from its usual $1,500.

It's an all-around great tablet--and if you're thinking about using it for drawing or photo editing, consider pairing it with the discounted <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Pencil-Pro-Pixel-Perfect-Industry-Leading/dp/B0D3J71RM7?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Apple Pencil Pro</a>.</p><p>Of course, plenty of other iPads are on sale right now, including a wide range of other iPad Pro models.

Once you've found one you like, consider pairing it with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/iphone/" data-ref-id="5005-112">AirPods Max</a>, as they've also hit their <strong>lowest price ever</strong> ahead of Prime Day.

That's something I learned firsthand while customizing my Rook within BioWare's Edmonton, Canada, office earlier this year during my cover story visit. We were customizing a feminine Rook, and while adjusting body options - read </span></span><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/06/13/a-deep-dive-into-dragon-age-the-veilguards-expansive-character-creator"><span><span>Game Informer’s </span></span></a><span><span><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/06/13/a-deep-dive-into-dragon-age-the-veilguards-expansive-character-creator">in-depth feature about Veilguard’s character creator here</a> for more details – our Rook's shirt disappeared to let us customize things like chest size. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>And that's when Veilguard game director Corrine Busche smiled, likely knowing full well that nudity in the character creator means nudity elsewhere in the game, like in Veilguard's romances, something I know BioWare fans will be delighted to hear.&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>"This is a mature RPG," she tells me.</span></span></p>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="d9b523b2-4d7b-4eeb-9d32-a3ede2420061" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p><span><span>I only see topless nudity in the character creator, and when I later ask BioWare if there is bottom nudity as well, I'm told that's something it wants to let fans discover for themselves in the game. Interesting answer, considering we're talking about genitalia here, but I don't push further.&nbsp; Though the game's leads wouldn't share too much about romance options in the game, I have a feeling nudity will play a part in some cutscenes and that's what BioWare is alluding to.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Nudity has been present in previous BioWare games, but it's almost always been implied. Characters are sometimes naked in romance scenes and elsewhere, but arms, legs, shadows, and pieces of scenery obscure characters' more… oogly bits. With some of those bits on full display in the character creator, I have a feeling Veilguard's romantic scenes will be the spiciest in the series' history. And the game's pretty visual design, running in EA's Frostbite engine, only adds to that.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Okay, I think I've hit the limit that I can write the word nudity on my work computer before it gets flagged by HR or something. You'll have to wait for the game's full release this fall to learn more about nudity, romance, and more.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-happens-if-the-internet-goes-out-nato-is-working-on-a-plan/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>The internet has become ingrained in our daily lives that many of us don’t know what we’d do if it just disappeared. But that’s a realistic problem that many countries are working on should it ever happen. Specifically, what if the subsea cables that carry data ever came under attack and were taken offline? </p>



<p>Researchers from the United States, Sweden, Switzerland, and Iceland are working alongside NATO to develop a plan that would reroute traffic to satellites in space. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-08/nato-backs-effort-to-reroute-internet-to-space-in-event-of-subsea-attacks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, NATO’s Science for Peach and Security Program has approved a grant  up to $433,600 to help with the $2.5 million project.</p>



<p>The report also states that the data carried by the undersea cables “account for roughly $10 trillion worth of financial transactions every day, and nearly all of the NATO’s internet traffic travels through them.”</p>



<p>With multiple risks — from anchors to attacks from adversaries — the belief is that finding a solution to avoid catastrophe sooner rather than later is paramount to keeping things stable.</p>



<p>“With enough time and banging our heads against the wall we are confident we can do it,” Gregory Falco, a space systems engineer at Cornell University, told Bloomberg.</p>



<p>Law professor Bjarni Már Magnússon added that it would take “three or four bombs to just cut off Iceland and its communications”.</p>



<p>In addition to rerouting communications, this project is also researching how to detect threats to the cables before anything happens to them. The goal is to detect potential problems to the cables “down to the nearest meter”.</p>

Though he had never heard of the man until the day he recorded his voice role in Elden Ring, the game director made one heck of an impression:</p><p>“I walked in the [recording studio], and there were at least 12 or 15 people in the room,” Lintern recalls. “Mr. [Hidetaka] Miyazaki was there. So we shook hands, but he largely didn't communicate with me in English. Other people did…a man called Adam Chapman, who was the voice director on the piece for me, works with a company called Fire Poets – I want to sing his praises just for a moment or two, because it's quite intimidating when you walk into that room and there is clearly a god of the gaming world there.</p><p>“Now, I'm not entirely stupid, but I had not heard of Mr. Miyazaki before. I didn't know the game, and I didn't know the status of the game, and I didn't know his status. But when I walked into the room, his status was very clear, very clear immediately. Everyone was very friendly, but at the same time, I could see that this was a bigger deal than I'd imagined it was going to be. And Adam, to his immense credit, took me under his wing and said, ‘Look, this is what they're going to look for. This is what you need to do. Be open to moving in different ways with the character. No one's quite sure what they're going to end up with, but it's a journey that we go on together.’”</p><p>Lintern was there to record the role of Igon, a new character added in Elden Ring DLC Shadow of the Erdtree who’s become a beloved community icon thanks to Lintern’s performance. Specifically, everyone loves a monologue he delivers when summoned to aid the player in the fight against Bayle the Dragon, an absolutely massive beast who Igon utterly <em>loathes.</em></p><p>“CURSE YOU, BAYLE!” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkILyL_Urn8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the monologue begins</u></a>. “I hereby vow! You will rue this day! Behold, a true drake warrior! And I, Igon! Your fears made flesh! Solid of scale you might be, foul dragon, but I will riddle with holes your rotten hide! With a hail of harpoons! With every last drop of my being!”</p><p>While the Elden Ring community has made dozens of memes of Igon, Bayle, and the above monologue, until I spoke to him last week, Lintern was largely unaware of how much the fans adored his performance. In fact, he hadn’t even seen the final cut of his monologue, didn’t know what his character Igon looked like, and had absolutely no clue why he was so pissed off at this Bayle fellow. All he knew was that his experience performing in Shadow of the Erdtree was one of the most intense and unusual roles in his acting career.</p><h2>From 0 to 5,000</h2><p>Richard Charles Lintern is an English actor with a robust resume across film, TV, and theatre. He’s perhaps best-known for his work at the English National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company, and on TV as Thomas Chamberlain in BBC series Silent Witness. He’s also no stranger to voice acting, having taken on numerous roles over the past decade. But Elden Ring was his very first time performing in a video game.</p><p>“I had never engaged, or been used, or tried to be used, or even thought of myself as a possibility for use in voice work in the gaming world,” Lintern says. “And once you open that door, it's been a real revelation for me, actually. I've been astonished about how worldwide it is, how enormous it is. I had kind of imagined that the world of TV and film and theater was the largest grossing, or most important, or whatever. And my eyes have been opened, not even by the work on Elden Ring, but by the response to it, and the scope of the reach, and the contact that these stories, these worlds have with people all over the world has been a real revelation for me, and really, really interesting.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/10/img-4592-1720632164339.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Richard Charles Lintern</figcaption></figure></output><p>Lintern isn’t clueless about video games, to be clear. He has three sons, and he’s played games with them, including various Star Wars entries, Super Mario, GoldenEye 007, and others. But he tells me he had never really engaged with games where you “disappear into a fantasy universe” until his role in Elden Ring. Lintern says he’s still a bit confused as to why they picked him, saying that he feels his sample clips are a far cry from the work he ended up doing as Igon.</p><p>“Even though I'm an actor and you're expected to be able to adapt to the character that you are playing, usually that adaptation is from zero to ten, or zero to seven,” he says. “In the case of the character that I played in Elden Ring, it was from naught to 5,000. He was a long way away. He was either dead, or dying, or recovering.”</p><p>When Lintern first received his lines for Igon, he says they were “largely incomprehensible” to him. He understood that his character was in pain, and kept threatening someone named Bayle, but that was it. </p><p>“Largely with voice work, the characterization, or the work is done on the day in the studio,” he says. “If I'm doing a documentary voice, I will have a conversation with the producer. Someone will say, ‘Well, we need a voice with gravitas,’ or, ‘We need a voice with a little bit of sympathy,’ or a smile, or whatever it happens to be. But that work is largely done on the day. There's not much you can do prior to the actual meeting, other than turn up on the day sober and in good health, basically. And then you get on with it.”</p><p>In that regard Lintern’s work as Igon started off completely normal. But his day in the recording studio was anything but.</p><h2>Exploding Into Elden Ring</h2><p>Given the very, very small number of lines Igon has in Elden Ring, Lintern expected his recording session, taking place at a studio in Central London, to be short, maybe 40 minutes. It was not. He recalls being in the booth for maybe five or six hours, and that he had to return a week later to a follow-up session. “It was epic in there.”</p><p>“I would perform one of the lines,” he recalls. “And then there would be a quite extensive conversation between Mr. Miyazaki and various other people around him in the room. Largely, I think the way things worked was, one of the other people would then speak to Adam, and explain what direction Mr. Miyazaki wanted to move in. But he, the mysterious figure in the center of the room, was very much in control of the entire operation.</p><p>“I remember thinking when I left, A, I'm exhausted. That's never happened to me before. I'm absolutely, my voice is wrecked and I'm physically exhausted, and I'm emotionally exhausted as well. B, that was quite an experience. There were a lot of people in there…We were doing lines hundreds of times, literally hundreds, because if I was there for five hours, the actual total amount of lines that I spoke, I could've done in seven minutes.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>For Lintern, Elden Ring was an “eye-opening” experience, one that’s led him to appreciate the emotional possibilities offered by video game stories. But even though he went through a wide gamut of different types of expression, he notes that never once was he asked to bring his emotional levels back down, or temper or mute them in any way. He says every single note he received in that five hours was along the lines of “Do you have more? Can you explode?”</p><p>“I'm standing there with my arms outstretched,” he recalls. “And I think at the time, I don't think I even knew that Bayle was a dragon. I think I might've thought Bayle was a person. Anyway, I can't remember, but I'm giving it as much as I possibly can, vocally, emotionally, neck stretching, vocal cords ripping, everything. And then we would come back, and then there'd be silence again, during which I'd have a glass of water. And then we'd come and do it again with a tinge of sorrow, or with a tinge more rage, or slower, or faster, or whatever it happened to be.</p><p>“The attention to detail that was given to the character and the performance was pretty much greater than anything I've experienced before,” he adds. “Comparable with characters in Shakespeare that I've played and stuff. People were taking it extremely seriously.”</p><h2>Too Angry to Die</h2><p>At this point in our interview, Lintern asked me to explain his character to him – who he was, and how the player interacted with him. I explained that Igon is an NPC the player meets by a roadside who is clearly in great agony when he’s encountered. Unfortunately, there’s not much the player can do about Igon’s pain. </p><p>“You can't heal me? You can't give me water?” Lintern asks. </p><p>Sorry, Mr. Lintern, no.</p><p>In subsequent encounters it becomes clear that Igon is absolutely furious with a character named Bayle. The player will eventually learn from other sources that Bayle is a massive dragon – and not just any dragon, he’s widely regarded as <em>the absolute worst dragon, </em>one that even other dragons loathe. Igon, a guy who kills dragons and eats their hearts for a living, really wants to eat Bayle’s heart. But when we meet him, he’s already tried and failed, with Bayle leaving him injured, agonized, and near-dead. When Igon sees the player is capable of killing dragons, he throws in his lot with them in hopes of getting revenge. It’s basically Captain Ahab and Moby Dick, with Igon’s monologue giving off big “From hell’s heart I stab at thee” energy. Igon even uses a harpoon in battle! Lintern appreciates the comparison.</p><p>“A quest of the soul, a quest of morality, and strength, and pain, and terror, and doom,” he observes. “And an enemy that is so huge that you can't even comprehend it, but for some reason, the bravery of the individual comes through and manages to triumph over it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>An enemy that is so huge that you can't even comprehend it, but the bravery of the individual comes through and manages to triumph.</p></div><p>“Or, this is the other thing. I remember feeling rather foolish at one point, about an hour or two in, there was one line where I said something like, ‘You are defeated. I triumph over you.’ And then the next line on the piece of paper was, ‘So you have defeated me.’ And I remember saying something like, ‘I think there's a mistake on the script thing here, because one minute he wins and the next minute he loses.’ And there was this awkward pause on the other side of the screen. And eventually, someone came back to me saying, ‘It's a video game, Richard. Sometimes you defeat the beast, and sometimes the beast defeats you. We need both options.’ I hadn't thought about that.”</p><p>I eventually show him images of Igon (“I look like a kind of broken down, scarecrow kind of guy.”) and the enormous Bayle. Bayle elicits quite the reaction from Lintern: “How on earth? Do you fight alongside me? How does that work?” I explain Elden Ring’s boss fights and its summon system that allows us to fight alongside Igon, but Lintern remains impressed anyone can beat such a massive dragon even with Igon and all his harpoons at their side.</p><p>I can’t help myself - I show Lintern a couple memes of Igon, including <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1doin0s/whatever_they_paid_his_voice_actor_it_wasnt_enough/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of my absolute favorites</a>: </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/10/2024-07-10-1720627876817.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>"Man literally too angry to die,” he reads. “Is that me? That's genius.”</p><p>I’m not the only one who’s been showing Lintern Igon memes. He tells me his son keeps <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xU6_pabXADQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>sending references</u></a> and asking him what “Curse you, Bayle,” means, but up until now Lintern hasn’t had a helpful answer. Lintern tells me he knows better than to name search himself online, but between his agent and his son, he’s seen enough positive feedback to know his role was well-received. And he’s certainly up for more video game roles in the future, he says, even if the intensity level is similarly dialed up to 5,000.</p><p>“I remember thinking for quite a few days afterwards, ‘That was quite an intense experience,’” Lintern concludes. “It was very mysterious. Mr. Miyazaki was a very mysterious character, but it was enjoyable. It felt creative, and it felt engaged. And I didn't quite know what I was doing, but I knew that I'd had fun doing it. Put it that way.”</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip? Send it to rvalentine@ign.com.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is not the only tactical espionage action on the horizon. Black State is a third-person action stealth game clearly taking some cues from Metal Gear, both with its surreal, sci-fi tone and its MGS5-esque gameplay. Alas, none of the marketing has shown any giant robots (yet).</p><p>Black State is the first game from developer Motion Blur, an independent AAA studio based in Istanbul. Apparently the game will have few loading screens, using doors as portals to transition to and from a diverse set of areas. This acts both as a plot device and visual hook. The story itself concerns a soldier summoned by a group of scientists called The Architects for a mysterious hostage mission who encounters strange doors that teleport him across impossible distances. Other plot details are vague, though the trailer does show some of the characters you may meet including a Colonel Campbell-esque commanding officer heard in voiceover and an old man surrounded by clocks.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQOB0PLJeAY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="8">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JQOB0PLJeAY?start=8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Most of the trailer is a real-time vertical slice of the game. It shows the as-yet-unnamed protagonist decked out in a high-tech suit, as he opens a door to a subway, runs down the train corridor, and opens another door into a military installation. He proceeds to take out the base using a machine gun, shotgun, and stealth takedowns, and it also shows a robot companion that maps the installation, tosses explosives, and activates smoke bombs. The end of the trailer teases a boss fight against a black-horned figure called simply Horn. While the trailer displays a more action-orientated approach, it's clear that stealth will also be viable.</p><p>Black State is available to wishlist on Steam and Epic Game Store. The game currently has no release window.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/i-fucking-hate-ser-criston-cole-house-of-the-dragon<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>House of the Dragon</em>, a show in the same universe as <em>Game of Thrones</em> but taking place centuries earlier, is great fun mostly because all the characters are so hateable. Much like <em>Thrones</em>, the show offers a succession crisis and introduces several factions that are vying for power. Also like <em>Thrones</em>, so many of the characters are either so vile or so stupid that I feel myself rooting for chaos more than anything else. I do have one character that I hope loses, though: Hand of the King and commander of the Kingsguard, Ser Criston Cole, played by Fabien Frankel.</p><p>If you’re not watching <em>House of the Dragon</em>, I’m sorry for spoiling some of the events of last season in this article. Cole is a stupid asshole who failed upward and isn’t even good at his job. He’s presumptuous and petty, has a nasty violent streak, is a horrible little misogynist and has a stupid haircut. I’m getting ahead of myself—apologies. I just hate this man so much.</p><p>I thought Cole might be fine when we were first introduced to him in the previous season. He was a new knight from a non-noble background, and he quickly hit it off with Rhaenyra, the heir to the throne. After Rhaenyra learned that she was supposed to marry another noble, Cole confessed his love to her and asked her to run away with him so she could fucking farm goats or something instead of being the queen. I don’t know what he thought was going to happen there; she refused him. Not soon afterward, to let off some steam, Cole beats a man to death over dinner. It’s genuinely horrifying to watch, and somehow it isn’t Cole’s worst moment.</p><p>From there on out, Cole goes from being so down bad for Rhaenyra that he was actively asking her to run away with him to hating her passionately. When Alicent, Rhaenyra’s best friend who married her dad (there’s a lot of incest in this show), eventually makes her <em>own</em> claim for the throne, Cole is her most ardent defender, going so far as to place the crown on her shitty son Aegon’s head. He also starts fucking Alicent, which I’m sure is unrelated to all the other stuff that’s happened before and has no bearing on his general opinions on women with power.</p><p>During every episode of <em>House of the Dragon</em>, I pray for Ser Criston Cole’s death at least once. Often, I wish for his death multiple times per episode. It’s not enough that he sucks as a human being. Aemond, who has now killed not one but two of his own family members, is a loathsome little asshole, but he has panache. He’s also extremely good at his job of being a scary fucker who intimidates his enemies. By contrast, Cole is an abject failure in basically every way. As commander of the Kingsguard, he often loses track of his King. In fact, while King Aegon’s son was murdered, Cole was nowhere to be found because he was fucking King Aegon’s mom. When he’s later elevated to Hand of the King, supposedly the King’s most trusted advisor, he approaches every delicate political situation as if he’s a hammer and they’re all nails.&nbsp;</p><p>Caught an assassin who killed the toddler-age prince? Time for torture. Torture didn’t produce the name of the second assassin? Okay, hang everybody who matches the only criteria they were able to glean, horrifying the King’s subjects. Because it turned out so well last time, just keep fucking the Queen Dowager, whose stupid son is your charge. Almost all of his choices are spurred by his fragile sense of pride, and then he makes his shame and guilt everyone else’s problem. To avenge the death of King Aegon’s son, he tells a knight to go impersonate his twin in Rhaenyra’s court and kill her. Not only does that obviously not work, it leads to the surviving twin killing himself out of grief. Great job, Ser Criston Cole! Better luck next time!</p><p>The most frustrating thing about Cole is the way he tries to become a political player, but without any of the knowledge or savvy of the people who have been at court longer than he has. Cole is smart enough to know that King Aegon is basically a big himbo, but not smart enough to know how to steer him away from extremely dangerous situations where he will most likely die. In fact, all he does is stoke Aegon’s bloodlust out of his own desire to secure his seat of power and win glory on the battlefield. While Cole’s battle tactics may be sound, he’s just unable to do his duty, which is make sure the King doesn’t die. He makes the mistake of thinking a vain twenty-something with absolute power will listen to him, despite the fact that Aegon <em>dismissed his previous Hand because he didn’t want to listen to him</em>.</p><p>At the very least <em>House of the Dragon</em> lets us all watch this blow up in Cole’s face constantly. While he and Aemond were able to engineer a narrow victory through their superior tactics, Cole yet again was unable to protect his King, who surprised them at the battlefield. This resulted in Cole getting severe burns and multiple broken bones. Frankel plays this moment perfectly in the episode—when Cole finally finds King Aegon’s body, he looks like a guilty dog that got into the toilet paper. The only way it could have been sweeter is if a dragon bit him in half.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But rather than aggressively double down on Game Pass as the future of Xbox by continuing to increase value and keep prices cheap, Microsoft seems to be slamming the breaks on its risky subscription experiment, announcing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-game-pass-price-increase-ps5-microsoft-1850561048&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-game-pass-price-increase-ps5-microsoft-1850561048">not just the second price hike in a year</a></span> but a substantial retreat from the everything, everywhere, at one simple price ethos that launched it in the first place.</p><p>On Wednesday, Microsoft <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866">revealed an overhaul of the subscription gaming program more confusing</a></span> than the pre-order bonus chart for your favorite Electronic Arts game. Game Pass will still have four tiers, three for console and one for PC, but the benefits, names, and prices are changing. Most notably, the basic Xbox Game Pass subscription tier, simply called “Game Pass for Console,” is turning into Game Pass Standard, going from $11 a month to $15, gaining Xbox Live, and losing access to day-one Game Pass releases and certain other games in the full Game Pass library.</p><p>The Game Pass library already got splintered once with Game Pass Core, which contains a very limited slice of first and third-party Xbox games, and now it’s happening again, though we won’t know the full extent of the fragmentation until more details are announced in the coming months. Current Game Pass for Console subscribers will stay grandfathered in as long as their membership stays on auto-renew. But for everyone else, the only way to keep access to day-one releases will be to sign up for Game Pass Ultimate, which now costs a whopping $240 a year, or roughly the cost of the frequently discounted Xbox Series S. </p><figure id="" data-id="9a081bc8ff7219cfa4c6a70eb4c51797" data-recommend-id="image://9a081bc8ff7219cfa4c6a70eb4c51797" data-format="jpg" data-width="2119" data-height="1415" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An Xbox sits on a table.

It’s one of the games Microsoft spent $69 billion to buy Activision Blizzard for, an acquisition whose main legacy so far appears to be mass layoffs and fewer exclusives. Playing <em>Diablo IV</em>’s comeback season on Game Pass has been nice, but it wasn’t worth Tango Gameworks closing, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-08/xbox-studio-closures-microsoft-plans-more-cost-cutting-measures-after-layoffs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-08/xbox-studio-closures-microsoft-plans-more-cost-cutting-measures-after-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a decision seemingly precipitated in part</a></span> by newfound scrutiny on Xbox’s bottomline following the close of the historic merger.<br></p><p>When Game Pass launched in 2017, the fate of the Xbox One was sealed. A bungled launch and a lack of first-party hits to cut through the noise left Microsoft out in the wilderness. So it purchased a bunch of studios to bolster its portfolio and built up a subscription service Sony couldn’t compete with, one that had the potential to grow beyond consoles. Xbox players have spent the first half of a new console generation waiting for that to all change, but it effectively hasn’t. A stellar not-E3 showcase this summer was still aimed at the future, or in the case of a new Gears prequel, the ancient past.</p><p>But through all of it there was Game Pass, the service that you could recommend to friends and family without qualifiers or caveats. It had day-one access to <em>Halo</em> and <em>Forza Horizon</em>, timeless classics like <em>Fallout</em> and <em>Elder Scrolls</em>, and some of the biggest indie hits of the year, as well as a bunch you never would have discovered otherwise. Adding Blizzard games and <em>Call of Duty</em> should have made it even better. Instead, they’re turning the service into something that feels more like a toll booth than a bargain. Rather than basking in the freedom of a gaming buffet, there’s the guilt of trying to make sure you get your money’s worth.</p><p>Nothing puts the value trade-off as starkly as what Microsoft <em>isn’t</em> changing about Game Pass for PC. While the subscription is going from $10 to $12, it will still get access to day-one games and remains free of the monthly cost of playing games online on consoles. Instead of $240 a year for Game Pass Ultimate, PC players can play <em>Black Ops 6 </em>with their friends for just $144. There’s a version of Game Pass that’s still the best deal in gaming, it turns out. It’s just not on Xbox anymore. And maybe that’s the entire point: having potentially cannibalized its own console storefront by training some of its players not to buy things, Microsoft is trying to poison the well just enough to make buying<em> Indiana Jones </em>or <em>Avowed</em> outright <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Doctor_Cupcakes/status/1810822847977181497&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Doctor_Cupcakes/status/1810822847977181497" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">look that much more appealing by comparison</a></span>.</p><p>None of this is a business case for why Microsoft should do things differently. It may well be that soaking its most loyal customers is the best way for it to draw blood from a stone at this point. But the retreat from Game Pass makes it feel like Xbox is once again in need of a new story to tell about its future, and why it’s a platform worth investing in. Without it, the Xbox Series X/S console generation goes back to feeling like a jack-of-all-trades and master of none. I’m not the first person to point out that without strong games, strong hardware, or strong services, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-and-the-battle-for-xboxs-soul&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-and-the-battle-for-xboxs-soul" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you’re just another Microsoft brand</a></span>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<h3 id="h-november">November</h3>

<h3 id="h-december">December</h3>



<p>And finally, we come to December, the last month in 2024’s esports events calendar. Presently, no major tournaments are confirmed to be starting in December, and it’s unlikely any will be announced. Are you looking forward to 2025?</p>

			<p>Riot Games has been dipping its toes into the world of fighting games after becoming well-known for its MOBA League of Legends and auto-battler Teamfight Tactics. Their latest game is on the horizon, with 2XKO, formerly Project L, currently in Alpha testing. However, they also had a second fighting game, code-named Pool Party, which was binned in May.</p>
<p>This fighting game was said to be in the style of Super Smash Bros, with melee fighting and platforming set in the League of Legends universe. Current and former Riot employees have spoken out about this game, saying that a team of 70-80 people was assigned to work on this project.</p>
<p>While the project has since been scrapped, at least half of the team has received an offer to be reassigned within the studio to other jobs. Ten people did not receive an offer and were subsequently laid off or left the company voluntarily.</p>
<p>A statement has been made by Joe Hixson, the senior communications director at Riot Games. He told <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/riot-games-pool-party-canceled-smash-melee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mikhail Klimentov</a> of readergrev.com, "We always have a number of projects in various phases of R&amp;D, and spinning projects up and down happens multiple times a year."</p>
<p>While they haven't specifically said why the project was scrapped, it's possible that they felt that the scene was now becoming too saturated. While Super Smash Bros. remains on top as the ultimate melee platform fighter, Multiversus has now broken into the scene.</p>
<p>Earlier in the year, Riot Games had a <a href="https://wccftech.com/riot-games-lays-off-11-of-workforce-shuts-down-riot-forge-to-refocus-on-core-projects/">mass layoff of over 500 employees</a>, which was said to be due to budget cuts so that they could continue to have as many ongoing projects as they currently do.</p>
<p>Riot Games' newest project, 2XKO, a fighting game, is due for a 2025 release date. Registration forms for their Alpha labs are currently open for people who are interested in trialing the game for them.</p>
