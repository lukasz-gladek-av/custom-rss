<p>In a rather surprising turn of events, in celebration of Warcraft’s 30th anniversary, Blizzard unveiled and surprise launched remasters of Warcraft 1 and Warcraft 2, which are available on Battle.net at this very moment. If you want to purchase the entire collection, you can score Warcraft Remastered, Warcraft 2 Remastered, and Warcraft 3 Reforged for $39.99 in a unique Battle Chest. Oh, and if you buy now, you’ll also receive Warcraft Orcs &amp; Humans, Warcraft 3 Reforged multiplayer hero skins, and the World of Warcraft Meat Wagon mount, akin to a siege weapon with massive, bloody spikes on its front, rear, and wheels.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The surprise shadow drop of both Warcraft remasters occurs alongside the announcement that, after two decades, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/after-20-years-world-of-warcraft-is-getting-player-housing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World of Warcraft is finally getting player housing</a> in its upcoming expansion, Midnight. However, it’s still a year or two away from launch. But for now, if you pick up the Warcraft Battle Chest, you’ll find yourself with plenty of real-time strategy goodness to sift through before then.</p>



<p>For now, let’s focus on Warcraft Remastered and Warcraft 2 Remastered. For starters, Brad Chan, senior manager of Warcraft RTS, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>These remasters have brand new hand drawn visuals that capture the original art style from each game, and you’ll be able to swap between the original graphics and the remastered versions in real time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The remasters feature UI and UX improvements, making both real-time strategy games more accessible to modern audiences. Alongside the remasters, Warcraft 3: Reforged Patch 2.0 is on its way, featuring an environment and lighting overhaul, and improvements to the user interface. Oh, and there are uprezzed HD assets.</p>



<p>Is Warcraft a little too old for your tastes? Let us know if you’re hopping into the remastered RTS trilogy this week with the Battle Chest by visiting us on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>It wasn’t long ago that Blizzard took the stage at BlizzCon 2023 to announce <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-worldsoul-saga-warcraft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">20 more years of World of Warcraft with the Worldsoul Saga</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295683/gog-preservation-program-pc-game-drm<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PC game platform GOG has launched a new preservation program dedicated to keeping beloved older games playable, “now and in the future.”</p><p>“If a game is part of the Preservation Program, it means that we commit our own resources to maintaining its compatibility with modern and future systems,” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fblog%2Fthe-gog-preservation-program%2F">the announcement blog reads.</a></p><p>The program is launching with 100 games including <em>Diablo</em>, <em>System Shock 2</em>, and <em>Resident Evil 1-3</em>, with GOG planning to add emore titles in the coming months. Games featured in the program will come with a number of perks. GOG says that when you buy a game from the program, you can:</p><div><ul><li>“expect it to work on current and&nbsp;future&nbsp;popular PC configurations”</li><li>“be sure that this version is the best and most complete available anywhere, including compatibility, manuals, and other bonus content, but also DLCs and even features that are missing in other editions”</li><li>“access GOG’s Tech Support if you encounter technical issues with running the game”</li><li>“as with all titles in our catalog, always keep access to their offline installers, granting you the power to safeguard them how you want”</li></ul></div><p>GOG says that its goal is to acquire “all games no longer updated or maintained by their original publisher,” no matter their age. A recent study from the Video Game History Foundation found that 87 percent of games released before 2010 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/14/23792586/classic-game-preservation-video-game-history-foundation-esa">are no longer able to played</a>. These figures are exacerbated by the trend of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/7/24290671/sega-classic-games-delisted">delisting classic games from storefronts</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/26/23657431/wii-u-nintendo-3ds-eshops-shut-down">shutting</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/29/24208627/the-xbox-360-store-shuts-down-today">down</a> entire storefronts altogether. Even new games are subject to inaccessibility with Sony’s <em>Concord</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">going permanently offline</a> mere weeks after its launch earlier this year.</p><p>With the launch of this preservation program, GOG is one of the only major game platforms to directly acknowledge the grim reality of video game preservation while taking significant action to keep older games accessible. </p><p>“Games shaped us,” reads the announcement. “Being able to play them is an essential part of reconnecting with ourselves. They must stay accessible, playable, and alive.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

By the time I was pushing payloads and getting Play of the Game with a well-placed Tactical Visor, a lot of the old hero kits and team compositions that were infamous when the hero shooter launched in 2016 were more like cautionary tales for relative newbies. But since I never experienced things like Mercy being able to revive her entire team with a press of the triangle button, I was excited to see what I missed thanks to the current <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-classic-blizzard-6v6-tanks-event-dates-1851694954&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-classic-blizzard-6v6-tanks-event-dates-1851694954"><em>Overwatch Classic </em>mode</a></span>, which lets you play as the original versions of the 21-hero roster from 2016. However, even though there are still a few weeks left before the event ends on December 3, I played it for one night and…I think I’m done.

Some of the problems I have with the game would have been less damning if I’d jumped in when it was an exciting, brand-new thing that was fresh and hadn’t yet been sanded down by patches and ruleset changes. There’s something endearing about how unpolished <em>Overwatch Classic </em>feels. I imagine that back in 2016, it felt like there was so much potential for this universe and these heroes. If I’d been playing the game since launch, I think that feeling of potential is what I’d feel more nostalgic for, rather than the actual nuts and bolts of how <em>Overwatch </em>used to play.</p><p>The first match I played was against a team of three Roadhogs. I didn’t realize the “No Limits” setting that lets you and your team all pick the same character was in effect, meaning you could have teams made up of bulky tanks that would basically be immovable bullet sponges. These days, <em>Overwatch 2 </em>has limits that require you to play as different heroes, and in some modes your composition has to include an allotted number of characters per role. But it was the wild west in 2016 and people could create teams of all one hero if they wanted. And reader, that’s what my friends and I were up against. I thought I was gonna bust a blood vessel when I, as Soldier: 76, ran up the hill of the Hollywood map only to be greeted by a team of six Meis.</p><p>Mei, for those unfamiliar with her original kit, was able to freeze an enemy in their tracks with her primary fire. Her icy beam starts with a slowing effect that keeps you in place until the frozen status takes hold, giving the hero an easy opening to pop a headshot. That’s manageable when you’re facing one of her, but when it’s six? I effectively wasn’t playing for swaths of the match thanks to their icy assault, and even as we slowly but surely made progress on the objective, the opposing team didn’t change things up. It was just a constant barrage of ice keeping all of us in place.</p><p>I’m sure this was a funny bit for the opposing team, but I can’t imagine putting in the 1000+ hours I have in the game now if that’s what the game was like. What drew me to <em>Overwatch </em>in the first place was how heroes synergize, and facing opponents who have free reign to make a team of unkillable, self-healing tanks or the <em>Overwatch </em>equivalent of an Elsa snowstorm is the kind of thing that would have killed my enthusiasm for the game early on.</p><p>I’ve seen comments from the <em>Overwatch </em>community joking that the <em>Overwatch Classic </em>event is just reverse psychology to make people realize how good we’ve got it with <em>Overwatch 2</em>, and after playing the throwback mode for a night, I think I could be convinced of that. So much of <em>Overwatch </em>discourse is “make it like it used to be,” whether that be bringing back loot boxes instead of the battle pass it uses now, reverting to the 6v6 format instead of the current-day 5v5 structure, or going back to a previous rework for a character who doesn’t play like they once did. The original <em>Overwatch </em>was slower-paced, and playing it again after years of <em>Overwatch 2 </em>making the game feel more frantic is like suddenly getting caught in a fly trap. It’s a fun gimmick that’s brought back lapsed fans jonesing for the old days. But by and large, it’s been a reminder that sometimes parts of a game do get mechanically better over time and that maybe we’re not nostalgic for the game as it was, but the feeling we had when playing it.</p><p>I played a night of <em>Overwatch Classic </em>and I think I’ve had my fill. I missed all the characters I main that have been added since 2016 and all the balance and ruleset tweaks that have made matches feel less like chaotic shitposts. I don’t have much opinion on whether or not 6v6 should come back, but I do know that I’m more intrigued by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-6v6-test-season-14-open-role-queue-date-1851680742&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-6v6-test-season-14-open-role-queue-date-1851680742">the plans Blizzard has laid out</a></span> for reintegrating that original ruleset than the free-for-all we once had. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, the presentation ended with one big tease that’s farther out – a major feature coming to World of Warcraft’s next expansion that players have been asking about for years: player housing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The presentation didn’t offer any real details about exactly how player housing would work or what it would entail. All we learned is that the feature is in the works, and that we’ll finally see it in World of Warcraft: Midnight, the game’s next expansion planned for a full reveal in late summer of 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea of player housing has been toyed around with in expansions going as far back as the Warlords of Draenor. At the time, the “Garrison” feature was floated as WoW’s answer to player housing, but ultimately fell short of the customizability and more permanent nature of player housing in other MMORPGs, such as Final Fantasy 14.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Garrisons were ultimately abandoned at the end of Warlords of Draenor, serving no real lasting purpose for most players, and Blizzard hasn’t revisited the idea of player housing since. Notably, Guild Wars 2 just implemented player housing earlier this year as well, suggesting the feature is a popular one for MMO players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, we don’t know much else about what World of Warcraft’s next expansion, Midnight, will entail. We did see a content roadmap during the presentation that suggests the expansion will be officially unveiled in late summer of 2025. Midnight will be the second part of what Blizzard is calling “<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-announces-next-three-expansions-in-world-of-warcraft-the-worldsoul-saga-blizzcon-2023">The Worldsoul Saga</a>”, which also encompasses The War Within and the expansion following Midnight, entitled The Last Titan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warcraft-30th-anniversary-direct-everything-announced">everything announced from today’s Warcraft Direct right here</a>, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warcraft-1-and-2-remasters-shadow-dropped-with-improved-graphics-quality-of-life-improvements-and-other-new-features">remasters of Warcraft I and II</a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcrafts-next-major-patch-will-finally-visit-the-legendary-goblin-capital-undermine">next patch for The War Within</a>, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/world-of-warcraft-classic-heads-to-mists-of-pandaria-next-year">next update for World of Warcraft: Classic</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

They’ll receive a new customizable ground mount specifically built for use in Undermine (it’s a fancy car) that goes really, <em>really </em>fast.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As usual for a new major patch, Undermine(d) will bring with it numerous new activities. There’s a new arena map, and a new dungeon, Operation Floodgate, which will join the remaining four The War Within launch dungeons in the Mythic pool. There will also be two new delves, some new variations on existing delves, and new story and updates for delve companion Brann Bronzebeard. Finally, there’s a new eight-boss raid, The Liberation of Undermine, which will take teams through the city itself and into the decadent heart of the goblin empire, where players will finally fight goblin faction leader Gallywix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Undermine is a significant location in the Warcraft universe, though this is the first time players will visit it. In Warcraft’s history, Undermine was the underground site beneath the isle of Kezan that goblins claimed for their capital after rebelling against the Zandalari trolls. However, during the Cataclysm, the volcano the city was situated beneath erupted. The goblins evacuated the surface of Kezan, and Undermine was thought to have been destroyed. However, there have been hints ever since then that Undermine is still operational, and the new patch will allow us to see the city for the first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">World of Warcraft patch 11.1 “Undermine(d)” is planned for release early next year, with a patch 11.2 coming in the summer.

Though Halloween was last month, the presentation kept the scares going with a full reveal of Ghostface from Scream, along with an interesting twist: The character is actually <em>three</em> Ghostfaces in one, and two of them are from the Mortal Kombat universe.</p><p dir="ltr">The Kombat Kast started with the gameplay trailer for the new fighter, which showed off multiple moves and combos, a fourth-wall-breaking Fatality, and a tease at his Animality where he morphs into a buzzard. After the trailer, it was explained that the original Ghostface--the one transported to the Mortal Kombat timeline--is the main fighter, but he can call other Ghostfaces into battle for him.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Mortal Kombat 1 - Official Ghostface DLC Character Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Those other Ghostfaces--per NetherRealm lead QA analyst Stephanie Brownback--are "not anonymous," but instead are known characters from the Mortal Kombat canon. The only clues given during the stream were that both were recruited from Kano's Black Dragon clan, and that the male Ghostface is called "Black Dragon Enforcer" and the female is "Black Dragon Assassin." Each of the Black Dragon Ghostfaces have "clues" and "Easter eggs" that present while they're on-screen, and it will be up to the players to figure out who is who.</p><p dir="ltr">The Kombat Kast also revealed new features and adjustments to the roster, including new moves and abilities for Ashrah, Smoke, and Sub-Zero, among others. A replay takeover was also highlighted, where players can rewatch a recent online match and "take over" for a brief period of time, in order to analyze the situation and strategize for future matches.</p><p dir="ltr">Mortal Kombat 1 is available now on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC. Ghostface will officially join the roster on November 26, while those with early access through the Premium or Kollector's Edition will be able to play as the Scream killer one week sooner on November 19.</p>

(We’re doing a sale about it, which you can <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-first-birthday-sale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learn more about here</a>.) Like most one-year-olds, the site still has some growing to do; while it does not whine, wear diapers, or throw up on itself, it is prone to irritating login issues and business-related woes that – like an infant’s shrieks – <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-business-lessons-learned-tips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keep Riley up at night</a>. Despite these known issues and the many character flaws of the people who own it, Aftermath is nonetheless loved by a great many people, some of them important – and all of them important in our hearts.&nbsp;</p><p>As part of our one-year anniversary celebration, here’s what they had to say:</p><blockquote><p>Chris Person’s blogs about some hobby he’s gone incredibly deep down the rabbit hole into are my favorite part of the site, full-stop. He got me into the <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-to-make-movie-theater-popcorn-flavacol-secret-ingredient" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flavacol + whirly pop meta</a>, and I am very thankful. I love how this site never feels constrained by the conventional boundaries of the games/media industry. It's the spontaneous blogs like ‘<a href="https://aftermath.site/learning-new-stuff-as-an-adult-rules" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I learned a new skill/hobby</a>’ or ‘isn’t that thing neat’ that keep me coming back.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– Drew, Aftermath community member</p><blockquote><p>I really appreciate Aftermath's mixture of piercing moral clarity and insanely specific deep dives into, like, how to build your own <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-need-an-open-source-mouse-so-i-never-have-to-look-at-razer-synapse-again" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gamer mouse</a> out of bits of metal you buy on hobbyist websites. Chris Person's list of <a href="https://aftermath.site/best-active-forums-internet-today" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still-thriving online forums</a> was one of the best blog posts I read this year. Very happy to support one of the last corners of the internet where a human heart still beats. Aftermath forever!</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– Adam Conover, creator of <em>The G Word</em>, <em>Adam Ruins Everything</em>, and <em>Factually</em>&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>Very happy to support one of the last corners of the internet where a human heart still beats.</p></blockquote></figure><blockquote><p>This Discord is the best Discord channel I follow. Supportive in many ways while also confronting in ways to make everyone their better selves.</p><p>As for the actual news coverage: This is an outlet I wish existed during my troubled times working in the game industry. I'd likely would have opened up sooner to Aftermath as I would have felt seen and appreciated for being a part of the labor workforce of video games. Obviously many things were different over a decade ago, but my initial choice to be a subscriber is the hope you can be the voice I didn't have for others who need it now.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– John “Seg” Seggerson, developer and <a href="https://aftermath.site/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftermath Discord</a> regular</p><blockquote><p>For me Aftermath is more about what they don’t cover than what they do; so many sites push whatever is trending, Web3, crypto, AI, [and] even when they aren’t pushing it, they are covering it and legitimizing it.&nbsp; Whereas on Aftermath I always see conversations around games that you would have with your friends, your smart friends, the one smarter than you, so when they say something, you just nod your head and agree but [are] secretly writing it down in your head to post it later as your own thoughts.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– Chet Faliszek, CEO at Stray Bombay and former lead and writer at Valve</p><blockquote><p>I love Riley's (often self-described) role as the curmudgeon. Also appreciate keeping up on the actual journalism industry. Reporting layoffs and critiques and stuff about other game sites. Basically none of the corporate owned ones are going to do that, so having people who are actually caring about the hardships and stuff that this industry (this this industry, not that this industry... though you guys do also highlight that) is going through is great.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– Cind, Aftermath community member</p><blockquote><p>I read Aftermath because, frankly, I’m glad something like this exists. Gaming news is easy enough to get from other places, but what’s been harder to find is gaming perspective. I appreciate that the writing here comes from a point of view, because regardless of [whether] I agree 100% of the time, it’s interesting to see the ‘why’ behind a piece, and not just read the ‘what.’</p><p>Also, as someone who wrapped a lovely interview about our studio’s first game with Game Informer three days before <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-has-been-shut-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Informer</a> was effectively <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-archives-closed-illegal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deleted from the internet</a>, it really drove home how important having independent voices in the space can be.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– Mike Laidlaw, CCO at Yellow Brick Games and former creative director on <em>Dragon Age</em> and lead writer on <em>Jade Empire</em></p><blockquote><p>I learned about this site and the writers behind it via <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/episode-16-nathan-grayson-riley-macleod-just-launched/id1570901546?i=1000634033743" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Games Press podcast</a> and was initially won over by that interview to support Aftermath.

Congratulations on your first anniversary, Aftermath!</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– Ben Hanson, founder of <a href="https://www.patreon.com/minnmax" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MinnMax</a></p><blockquote><p>When I was laid off from my job as the head of a video game section in September 2022, I thought I would bounce back quickly. A lot of my games journalism peers reached out offering freelance work or told me full-time roles were about to open up, so I was hopeful I could get something. But that was just the setup for an awful punchline. Over the next few months, most of those people would also be laid off. I didn't do the math, but I'm confident that as of now, over two years later, the remainder have lost their jobs. I even know people who were laid off during this period, pivoted to game dev, and then lost those jobs. It was, and still is, extremely dire.</p><p>I remember the one question people kept asking in the aftermath (oh hey) of all those initial 2022/2023 games journalism layoffs: Where's the <a href="https://defector.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Defector</a> of video games? Defector sprung up in the wake of an explosive journalism moment, so why couldn't it happen here? I kept posting through it, many of us did, dreaming of starting an independent media outlet or supporting all of our struggling friends. This was something I wanted to work on, but I didn't have the money nor the social clout to do so. Most of us didn't.</p><p>That's why it was so, so nice to see people who did have those things go for it. Aftermath is arguably the ‘Defector of video games’ since it literally runs on the same platform and is, you know, mostly about video games, but there's also <a href="https://www.rascal.news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rascal</a> for tabletop games, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SecondWindGroup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Second Wind</a> for a post-Escapist world, <a href="https://remapradio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Remap Radio</a> to fill the gap Waypoint left behind, and others I'm definitely forgetting. I wouldn't go so far as to say the ‘independent games journalism’ revolution is here, but as more and more sites lay us off or will only hire us for literal pennies, it's the one piece of hope we have.</p><p>Same goes for the rest of journalism. I subscribe to <a href="https://www.404media.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">404 Media</a> for explosive and deep technology coverage and <a href="https://flaminghydra.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flaming Hydra</a> for insightful essays. I look at <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/the-onion-sold-global-tetrahedron-1235982383/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Onion's comeback</a> as an independent outlet actually run by a person actually in media (can you imagine?) with pride and endless cackling. The more independent outlets set up successful Kickstarters or publish one-of-a-kind work, the better I feel.</p><p>However, the vibes in games journalism right now are, frankly, bad. They're ‘take off for the rest of the afternoon because you're too depressed to function’ kind of bad or ‘black out on edibles’ bad. Just rancid. Everybody's competing for the one job that pops up every six months and for a tiny slice of any meager freelance budget that still exists. We all have Discords, we talk about this probably once a week. When I can make it out to conventions, every conversation is just... so sad. Not even hours of drunk karaoke or some great games on display can lift the mood.</p><p>I've had a few temporary and freelance opportunities since my layoff, but I'm still unemployed. After two years, I've finally had to accept that I'm done. I'm applying to jobs in other industries, but it's all tinged with a bit of sadness. And with Trump coming back into power and bringing every power-hungry billionaire with him, I don't think I can get a job in any industry, let alone one I might be a bit qualified for. Do you think media can survive yet another Trump presidency? Another day of Musk, Zuck, Bezos, Altman, or whoever's in charge at Google today hollowing out this institution?</p><p>Aftermath and independent media isn't going to be the thing that solves games and culture journalism's systemic problems. Or maybe it will! I don't know, I'm not a scientist. But the people need video games journalism beyond the same SEO crap, the guides, and the regurgitation of press releases. I know people want it too. They might not do anything about it, but they want something different. They just don't know where to go to get it.</p><p>But it's doing something. It's giving people work, producing excellent articles that I read every day, and is creating a space to move forward. And hey, that's something that can give us hope, the inspiration to do our own thing, or just not spiral further into despair. We're all going to spiral, so we should at least have some cool stuff to read as we go.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– Carli Velocci, very good games journalist (hire her, jfc)</p><figure><blockquote><p>Aftermath and independent media isn't going to be the thing that solves games and culture journalism's systemic problems. Or maybe it will! I don't know, I'm not a scientist.</p></blockquote></figure><blockquote><p>There are lots of things worth celebrating about Aftermath on its one-year anniversary. There's reading a video game site in 2024 that doesn't have a giant car insurance ad in the middle of the page hijacking your web browser. There's the daily mix of scoops, no-bullshit criticism, and honest to god blogs. And there's a bunch of people terrible with numbers who decided to run a business with math in the name. Most of all there's the fact that it's succeeding, not despite all of these things, but because of them. But my personal favorite thing about Aftermath is how it's always logging me out of the site every time I close the tab. It's not the roguelike I wanted but it's the one games journalism needed.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– Ethan Gach, senior reporter at Kotaku</p><blockquote><p>I love Aftermath. I wrote about video games for years. I think it's great to have a platform disconnected from the tropes of games journalism with a willingness to speak as a gamer.&nbsp;</p><p>On one night where I felt lonely and sad, where a karaoke party had fallen apart, Nathan Grayson refused to quit. He would simply not let me sit and be sad and lonely, and found a coterie of karaoke gargoyles. For hours we sat blasting the dumbest shit imaginable. It was a wonderful night, and I'm glad I left the house. Nathan would simply not accept the concept that my night was done, that I had nothing else to do, or that I was not worth the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>On one night, where I felt self conscious, worried that nobody would want to talk to me, Chris Person walked over and told me about how he was in the process of working out how to use a certain kind of compound to create sugar free ice cream - the formula of which was yet to be finalized - and how it might work.&nbsp; He then listened to the minutiae of my day with the kind of intense focus usually reserved for counselors or mentors. Chris cares. Chris simply gives a fuck more than 99.9% of people.&nbsp;</p><p>In both of these cases, Grayson and Person showed a level of empathy that most do not, invigorated by their own passion. That's what you get from Aftermath. You empower and embolden personalities willing to be vulnerable, to dig into random shit, to take joy in the impossible or irrelevant, to disconnect from what might be expected or demanded, and talk about what matters, which might be beyond esoteric or niche, but matter so deeply to them that it disarms you and makes you consider a world beyond algorithms, beyond the norm, and beyond what you may think you want, and you will be surprised, and ultimately you will be better from having heard it. You will be richer for it.&nbsp;</p><p>I cannot tell you how media empires are made. Most of my success has come from brute forcing creative ideas empowered by a perpetual sense of having to work out the rest of my life. What I can tell you is that both Nathan and Chris have been loving, caring people in my life, despite me, in my opinion, never providing much more than being a guy who says ‘hey.’ They deliberately and cavernously love the things they love, and have such unplumbed depths of creativity that they are yet to explore.&nbsp;</p><p>Aftermath allows them to. Back them. I have done so since the moment they allowed me to give them my credit card.&nbsp;</p><p>In a world increasingly focused on selfishness over love and product over passion, Aftermath operates as a beacon of what's beyond the norm, and beyond the unrelenting slop of genericism and emptiness.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– Ed Zitron, CEO at <a href="https://www.ezpr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EZPR</a>, writer of <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Where’s Your Ed At</a>, and host of <a href="https://linktr.ee/betteroffline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Better Offline</a></p><figure><blockquote><p>He would simply not let me sit and be sad and lonely, and found a coterie of karaoke gargoyles.</p></blockquote></figure><blockquote><p>Happy first birthday Aftermath! They say the first anniversary is the paper one, so I hope you stack big in 2025. I want to shout out Chris Person’s blog about how <a href="https://aftermath.site/challengers-soundtrack-reznor-ross-playstation-wipeout-2097-ape-escape" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the <em>Challengers</em> score sounds like a PS1 game</a>. I've listened to and thought about that album a lot this year and basically nobody else put it into this context, and I totally agree with it and think it and he and you guys rock. Please do more chess blogs next year, or else.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– Patrick Redford, staff writer at Defector</p><blockquote><p>Amazing blogs, but have you guys considered sticking to Games?</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– Ari Notis, guides editor at Polygon</p><blockquote><p>I'm Gita.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>– Emanuel Maiberg, co-founder at <a href="https://www.404media.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">404 Media</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I’ve lost myself to the MMORPG genre since 2004, and no, it wasn’t at the launch of World of Warcraft. I started with EverQuest 2. But I quickly jumped ship after a few years, joining the fun in Blizzard’s monolithic MMO sometime around the launch of Cataclysm. However, the experience always missed one immersive feature that most other games in the genre offered. Well, it’s happening. World of Warcraft will receive player housing after two decades!</p>



<p>In a teaser on <a href="https://x.com/Warcraft/status/1856769095112200343" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Blizzard unveiled player housing for World of Warcraft, which is coming in the next major expansion, Midnight. From the short teaser trailer, it appears we can decorate the walls and floors with various trinkets and furniture, and there’s a quick scene of a warrior consuming a mug of some type of drink before sitting down at the fire, with the whole trailer culminating in a look at two floor mats with Horde and Alliance logos, respectively.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/world-of-warcraft/player-housing-is-coming-to-world-of-warcraft-after-20-years-though-youll-have-to-wait-until-the-next-expansion-its-a-tremendously-large-undertaking/?utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, Blizzard’s Ion Hazzikostas said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We want to give players a little sneak preview of some of what the team is cooking. This also gives us a chance, I think, to have more open conversations about it that aren’t possible when it’s a top secret feature.</p>



<p>[Player housing] an idea that’s been kicked around for a long time—but we knew that to do it, we needed to be able to do it right. It’s a tremendously large undertaking.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Furthermore, Hazzikostas said the team wants to hear from the community regarding what they want to see and what they expect from player housing. If you have suggestions, don’t be afraid to make them known. Blizzard is generally quite active on social media, and they have forums where you can submit suggestions for the player homes feature coming in the upcoming expansion!</p>

<p>Depending on how long you’ve had an account on Steam, you probably have hundreds of titles waiting in your backlog. You scored them cheap, right? I couldn’t help myself, either. I have so many games in my library, many of which I’ve never played, but whenever a new zombie survival game is on sale, I can’t help myself. I grab it. And now, you can score Dread Dawn, by developer Kioop, on sale until November 26!</p>



<h2 id="h-dread-dawn-is-on-sale-through-november-26">Dread Dawn is On Sale Through November 26</h2>



<p>Dread Dawn is available for 20% off for this extended sale, bringing the total price down from $19.99 to $15.99. While $20 for an open-ended zombie survival game is already an excellent deal, the reduced price through the end of November should help anyone on the fence.</p>



<p>On launch, Dread Dawn received a mixed reception from fans. The studio launched the game as a full release, but it was evident that it required more time to cook. An Early Access launch may have mitigated many negative reviews, but it’s still an exciting zombie survival sandbox!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-dread-dawn">What is Dread Dawn?</h2>



<p>Dread Dawn is a top-down, open-world zombie survival game with sandbox and RPG elements. You play a student trapped on the campus alongside your classmates and other survivors as the evacuation goes wrong and you’re left behind. With zombies approaching on all sides, you must find ways to survive, growing food, wielding firearms and melee weapons, and constructing barricades and turrets to help you defend against the encroaching hordes. It’s part tower defense and part Project Zomboid, but with a little more jank and no controller support currently.</p>



<h2 id="h-other-zombie-survival-games-worth-your-time">Other Zombie Survival Games Worth Your Time</h2>



<p>Of course, the zombie survival genre is positively massive, thanks to years of content flowing through the game development pipeline. If Dread Dawn doesn’t catch your fancy, then check out:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Project Zomboid</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dying Light 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>7 Days to Die</strong></li>



<li><strong>Left 4 Dead 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Zompiercer</strong></li>



<li><strong>No More Room in Hell 2</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>What’s your favorite zombie survival game of all time? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forums</a>, and maybe you’ll find a few like-minded players to join your next survival run!</p>

<p><em>It's </em>Half-Life 2<em> week at Ars Technica! This Saturday, November 16, is the 20th anniversary of the release of </em>Half-Life 2<em>—a game of historical importance for the artistic medium and technology of computer games. Each day up through the 16th, we'll be running a new article looking back at the game and its impact.</em></p>
<p>There has been some debate about which product was the first modern “triple-A” video game, but ask most people and one answer is sure to at least be a contender: Valve’s <em>Half-Life 2</em>.</p>
<p>For Western PC games, <em>Half-Life 2</em> set a standard that held strong in developers’ ambitions and in players’ expectations for well over a decade. Despite that, there’s only so much new ground it truly broke in terms of how games are made and designed—it’s just that most games didn’t have the same commitment to scope, scale, and polish all at the same time.</p>
<p>To kick off a week of articles looking back at the influential classic, we’re going to go over the way it was made, and just as importantly, the thought that went into its design—both of which were highly influential.</p>
<h2>A story of cabals and Electronics Boutique</h2>
<p>Development, design, and production practices in the games industry have always varied widely by studio. But because of the success of <em>Half-Life 2</em>, some of the approaches that Valve took were copied elsewhere in the industry after they were shared in blog posts and conference talks at events like the Game Developer’s Conference (GDC).</p>
<h3>The cabals of Valve</h3>
<p>Valve is famous for influencing many things in gaming, but it was most influential in its relatively flat and democratic team structure, and that played out even during <em>Half-Life 2</em>’s development back in the early 2000s. While many studios are broken up into clear departments big and small for different disciplines (such as art, level design, combat design, narrative design, AI programming, and so on), many parts of Valve’s <em>Half-Life 2</em> team consisted of a half-dozen multi-disciplinary small groups the company <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/classic-postmortem-the-making-of-i-half-life-2-i-">internally called “cabals.”</a></p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Each major chapter in <em>Half-Life 2</em> had its own unique four-to-five-person cabal made up of level designers and programmers. These groups built their levels largely independently, while frequently showing their work to other cabals for feedback and cross-pollination of good ideas. They all worked within constraints set in a pre-production phase that laid out elements like the main story beats, some of the weapons, and so on.</p>

      Each major chapter, like this battle-in-the-streets one toward the end of the game, was designed by a largely independent cabal.

                  </span>
          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>Additionally, similarly sized design cabals worked on aspects of the game’s design that crossed multiple levels—often made with representatives from the chapter cabals—for things like weapons.</p>
<p>There was even a “Cabal Cabal” made up of representatives from each of the six chapter teams to critique the work coming from all the teams.</p>
<h3>Ruthless playtesting</h3>
<p>Many game designers—especially back in the '80s or '90s—worked largely in isolation, determining privately what they thought would be fun and then shipping a finished product to an audience to find out if it really was.</p>
<p>By contrast, Valve put a great deal of emphasis <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1plhILdjuZE">on playtesting</a>. To be clear: Valve did not invent playtesting. But it did make that a key part of the design process in a way that is even quite common today.</p>
<p>The <em>Half-Life 2</em> team would send representatives to public places where potential fans might hang out, like Electronics Boutique stores, and would approach them and say something along the lines of, “Would you like to play <em>Half-Life 2</em>?” (Most said yes!)</p>

<p>The volunteer playtesters were brought to a room set up like a real player’s living room and told to sit at the computer desk and simply play the game. Behind them, the level’s cabal would sit and watch a feed of the gameplay on a TV. The designers weren’t allowed to talk to the testers; they simply took notes.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Through this process, they learned which designs and ideas worked and which ones simply confused the players. They then made iterative changes, playtested the level again, and repeated that process until they were happy with the outcome.</p>
<p>Today’s developers sometimes take a more sophisticated approach to sourcing players for their playtests, making sure they’re putting their games in front of a wider range of people to make the games more accessible beyond a dedicated enthusiast core. But nonetheless, playtesting across the industry today is at the level it is because of Valve’s refinement of the process.</p>

<h3>The alpha wave</h3>
<p>For a game as ambitious as <em>Half-Life 2</em> was, it’s surprising just how polished it was when it hit the market. That iterative mindset was a big part of it, but it extended beyond those consumer playtests.</p>
<p>Valve made sure to allocate a significant amount of time for iteration and refinement on an alpha build, which in this case meant a version of the game that could be played from beginning to end. When speaking to other developers about the process, representatives of Valve said that if you’re working on a game for just a year, you should try to get to the alpha point by the end of eight months so you have four for refinement.</p>
<p>Apparently, this made a big impact on <em>Half-Life 2</em>’s overall quality. It also helped address natural downsides of the cabal structure, like the fact that chapters developed by largely independent teams offered an inconsistent experience in terms of difficulty curve.</p>
<p>With processes like this, Valve modeled several things that would be standard in triple-A game development for years to come—though not all of them were done by Valve first.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>For example, the approach to in-game cutscenes reverberates today. Different cabals focused on designing the levels versus planning out cutscenes in which characters would walk around the room and interact with one another, all while the player could freely explore the environment.</p>

      </figure>

<p>The team who focused on story performances worked with level designers to block out the walking paths for characters, and the level designers had to use that as a constraint, building the levels around them. That meant that changes to level layouts couldn’t create situations where new character animations would have to be made. That approach is still used by many studios today.</p>
<p>As is what is now called <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/uefn/greyboxing-in-unreal-editor-for-fortnite">greyboxing</a>, the practice of designing levels without high-effort artwork so that artists can come in and pretty the levels up after the layout is settled, rather than having to constantly go back and forth with designers as those designers “find the fun.” Valve diddn’t invent this, but it was a big part of the process, and its in-development levels were filled with the color orange, not just gray.</p>
<h2>Finding the DNA of <em>Half-Life 2</em> in 20 years of games</h2>
<p>When <em>Half-Life 2</em> hit the market via the newly launched Steam digital distribution platform (more on that later this week), it was widely praised. Critics and players at the time loved it, calling it a must-have title and one that defined the PC gaming experience. Several of the things that came out of its development process that players remember most from <em>Half-Life 2 </em>became staples over the past 20 years.</p>
<p>For instance, the game set a new standard for character animations in fully interactive cutscenes, especially with facial animations. Today, far more advanced motion capture is a common practice in triple-A games—to the point that games that don’t do it (like Bethesda Game Studios titles) are widely criticized by players simply for not taking that route, even if motion capture doesn’t necessarily make practical sense for those games’ scope and design.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>And <em>Half-Life 2</em>’s gravity gun, which dramatically built on past games’ physics mechanics, is in many ways a &nbsp;concept that developers are still playing with and expanding on today. Ultrahand, the flagship player ability in 2023’s <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, could be seen as a substantial evolution from the gravity gun. In addition to offering players the ability to pick and place objects in the world, it gives them the power to attach them to one another to build creative contraptions.</p>
<p>There’s also <em>Half-Life 2</em>’s approach to using environmental lines and art cues to guide the player’s attention through realistic-looking environments. The game was lauded for that at the time, and it was an approach used by many popular games in the years to come. Today, many studios have moved on to much more explicit player cues like the yellow climbing holds in so many recent AAA titles. As you’ll see in an upcoming article this week written by someone who played <em>Half-Life 2</em> for the very first time in 2024, <em>Half-Life 2</em>’s approach may have set the stage, but modern players might expect something a little different.</p>
<figure>
    
          <figcaption>
        <div>
    
    <p>
      Environments like this were carefully designed to guide the player's eye in subtle ways. Today, many AAA games take a less subtle approach because playtesting with broader audiences shows it's sometimes necessary.

  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>One thing about the environment design that <em>Half-Life 2</em> was praised for hasn’t been replaced these days, though: a commitment to subtle environmental storytelling. World-building and vibes are perhaps <em>Half-Life 2</em>’s greatest achievements. From <em>BioShock</em> to <em><a href="https://www.vg247.com/half-life-2-influence-half-life-alyx">Dishonored</a></em> to <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, this might be the realm where <em>Half-Life 2</em>’s influence is still felt the most today.</p>
<h2>A legacy remembered</h2>
<p>Looking back 20 years later, Half-Life 2 isn’t necessarily remembered for radical new gameplay concepts. Instead, it’s known for outstanding execution—and developers everywhere are still applying lessons learned by that development team to try to chase its high standard of quality.</p>
<p>Even at the time, critics noted that it wasn’t exactly that there was anything in <em>Half-Life 2</em> that players had never seen before. Rather, it was the combined force of quality, scope, presentation, and refinement that made an impact.</p>
<p>Of course, Valve and Half-Life 2 are also known for multiple memorable cultural moments, some of the industry’s most infamous controversies, and playing a big part in introducing digital distribution. We’ll explore some of those things as we count down to the "Red Letter Day" that is this Saturday.</p>

                <p>Last year, quality-assurance workers at Bethesda and ZeniMax studios formed ZeniMax Workers United, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/qa-workers-at-zenimax-studios-have-become-the-gaming-industrys-largest-union/1100-6510268/" data-ref-id="1100-6510268">the largest certified video game union</a> in the United States. Now that union is putting its collective power to the test in a brief strike against Bethesda and ZeniMax's parent company, Microsoft.</p><p>ZeniMax Workers United has been attempting to negotiate a deal with Microsoft over remote-work requirements while also limiting the number of outsourced QA workers who can be brought in on Bethesda's projects. The union didn't say who Microsoft is outsourcing QA work to, but it accused the company of ignoring requests to negotiate.</p><p>"They have continually given us their first proposal again and again, and it's become obvious that our different mobilization tactics have not worked," QA test lead Rhyanna Eichnersaid told <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/bethesda-strike-zenimax-xbox-microsoft" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inverse</a>.</p><p>This one-day strike was called in an attempt to make Microsoft more receptive to addressing the union's concerns.</p><p>"Striking isn't fun or ideal, but there's a satisfaction in having a concrete physical action we can do to fight for better work conditions," noted senior QA tester Juniper Dowell. "Hopefully, we can convince them to stop dragging their feet and meet us at the table."</p><p>According to Dowell, many of the QA testers were hired during the COVID pandemic when remote work was more prevalent. Microsoft's current requirements call for QA workers to be in the office two days a week, while the union is asking for a more flexible remote policy.</p><p>After the strike began, Microsoft issued a statement affirming the company's willingness to "listen and address their concerns at the bargaining table."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/stephentotilo/status/1856757427913236783" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Quote from MS rep to me re: today's ZeniMax strike (over remote work, outsourcing): "We respect our employees’ rights to express their point of view as they have done today.

                <p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's in-game store gets stocked with all manner of microtransactions tomorrow, November 14, to kick off the game's Season 1. And included among them is the BlackCell bundle, which features Goliath as its headlining hero. Goliath is one of the most unique Call of Duty operators to date.</p><p>Goliath has a "molten, crystalized skull" whose armor emits flames. As you can see in the trailer below, Goliath is a menacing force to be reckoned with.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgDL9clbEdk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AgDL9clbEdk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>BlackCell bundles are Call of Duty's most expensive in-game offerings, coming in at around $30. For that price, purchasers get a new Operator, along with 20 Battle Pass tier skips, an allotment of 1,110 COD Points to spend on other stuff, and exclusive guns. For the Season 1 BlackCell DLC, this includes the "Boiling Point" assault rifle that is actually dripping with fire. It also comes with the "Who's Laughing Now" finishing move in which Goliath's hyena companion comes in and tears your enemy apart. The bundle also includes a special BlackCell clan tag to show off in lobbies and winner's cricles.</p><p>Beyond all of this, BlackCell owners get BlackCell-exclusive skins for Sev, Bayan, Bailey, Carver, Alvarez, and Stone, along with six BlackCell-exclusive weapon blueprints. People who buy the BlackCell DLC can also unlock any single page of the Battle Pass and bypass the normal requirements. What's more, there are more than 130 rewards that BlackCell owners can unlock throughout Season 1.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4399179-screenshot2024-11-13at2.26.29pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4399179" data-ratio="0.55712603062426" data-width="1698" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4399179-screenshot2024-11-13at2.26.29pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4399179"></a><figcaption>The new BlackCell bundle goes live on November 14</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4399179-screenshot2024-11-13at2.26.29pm.png"></figure><p>If you don't want to spend $30 on the BlackCell bundle, Black Ops 6's in-game store will receive many other bundles for the Season 1 launch, including one that turns you into a shark.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-janthir-wilds-finally-launched-bringing-in-housing-mechanism-new-raids-much-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds</a> will receive the Godspawn update, adding a new 50-player boss battle, a new 10-player raid, and a legendary spear.</p>
<h2>Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds is getting the first major update "Godspawn" on November 19th, expanding the story with new story chapters</h2>
<p>The MMORPG Guild Wars 2 by ArenaNet is receiving its first major update for the Janthir Wilds expansion soon. It's the first of three major updates, and it'll land on November 19. The update will add new content to the game for the players.</p>
<p>The <em>Janthir Wilds&nbsp;</em>expansion DLC was released in August this year, bringing unexplored wilds and&nbsp;<em>Homestead&nbsp;</em>for players to decorate and cultivate. With the <em>Godspawn&nbsp;</em>update, the game will bring three new story chapters to continue the adventure against the Titans. This time, ArenaNet has introduced a new 50-player battle against a Titan, who will be the reinterpretation of <em>Decima. </em>It will be similar to the boss battles as introduced in the <em>Secrets of the Obscure </em>Convergence.</p>
<p>Players can enter the battle every three hours, but private squads can start the challenge at any time. Apart from the boss battle, Guild Wars 2 will also receive a new 10-player raid, allowing players to climb Mount Balrior to battle the titans of Janthir to obtain rewards such as marquee items and cosmetics.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Image Credit: guildwars2.com</figcaption></figure>
<p>The 10-player raid will feature three bosses and several smaller battles that will allow players to enhance their coordination and adaptability. The two bosses,&nbsp;<strong>Greer&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Decima</strong>, will regroup once again at Mount Balrior, stronger than before as this time they won't be alone and will also have newer abilities.</p>
<p><iframe title="Guild Wars 2: Janthir Wilds – &quot;Godspawn&quot;" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jrol0Nr8q_Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Several new updates are also on the way in Godspawn update, including the new Sea Wave Glass weapon, more rewards in the Wizard's Vault like skins for armor and boots, and new decorations for Homestead to customize living space. A new legendary spear, <em>Klobjarne,&nbsp;</em>will be available to players as well. The Godspawn update will be free for those who have purchased the <em>Janther Wilds&nbsp;</em>expansion. Two more updates will be released in the coming months to complete the expansion.</p>
