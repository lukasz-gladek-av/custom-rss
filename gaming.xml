<p>The head of Xbox Games Studio, Craig Duncan, has commented on the current state of development for State of Decay 3.</p>



<p>State of Decay 3 was first announced back in July 2020. The last time any public movement indicating development was in 2024, when a trailer dropped with brief gameplay clips. Now, Craig Duncan is confirming that he’s played the game and that Xbox Games Studio remains optimistic about the franchise.</p>







<h2 id="h-state-of-decay-3-is-coming-on-well">State of Decay 3 is ‘Coming on Well’</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/xbox-game-studios-lead-cant-say-when-state-of-decay-3-will-rear-its-head-again-but-he-will-certainly-see-a-lot-more-of-it-in-the-coming-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">During a recent interview with GamesRadar+ </a>following the Xbox Developer Direct, Duncan was asked whether fans of the open-world zombie series could expect new information or gameplay footage this year. He did not give a straightforward answer, but he noted that he’s visited the studio several times in the past year and remains excited about the potential of the next State of Decay.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Here’s what I’ll say: I have done a number of visits to that studio in the last six to eight months. I have sat and played the game with the team a bunch of times. It’s coming on really well.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Following the Xbox Developer Direct, Craig Duncan was much more focused on the Fable reboot and the immediate future of Xbox in 2026. </p>







<p>He stated that he knows they have been inconsistent about which of their games head to other platforms as they continue to move forward with their new marketing strategy that encourages players to play Xbox games on all platforms.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The head of Sonic Team has commented on potentially adding “deep-cut” Sonic characters to the game’s roster in future Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds DLC.</p>



<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds was released in 2025 to critical acclaim. As part of the game’s hook, several crossover characters from other universes were added to the roster and the possibilities. These characters include SpongeBob, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Minecraft characters, and more.</p>



<p>However, there is a catalog of Sonic characters lost to time that could also have their moment in the new racing game.</p>







<h2 id="h-sonic-racing-crossworlds-should-represent-all-eras-of-sonic">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds Should Represent All Eras of Sonic</h2>



<p>Takashi Iizuka was recently interviewed by <a href="https://mcvuk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MCV Magazine </a>(<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sonic-boss-says-hes-open-to-adding-deep-cut-sonic-characters-as-crossworlds-dlc/">h/t: Video Games Chronicle</a>). In the interview, he was asked about seeing deeper cuts from Sonic lore coming to the game as possible downloadable content, specifically characters from the ’90s animated TV series or the IDW comics.</p>



<p>Takashi Iizuka noted that he sees the passion around the extended universe and wants all eras of Sonic represented, so anything’s possible with the opportunity feels right.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“There’s a lot of passion around the extended Sonic universe, and we’re open to including the ‘deep cut’ characters if the opportunity feels right,” Iizuka replied. “We want Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds to represent all eras of Sonic.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While this doesn’t confirm the return of fan-favorite characters like Sally Acorn, it does leave the door open for that level of surprising additions in the future.</p>







<p>Speaking of Sonic’s deep history, the franchise is currently celebrating its 35th anniversary. As part of that celebration, a new audio drama is coming to podcast platforms based around the Chaotix.

<p>Can an MMO developer deliver a kick-ass open world action/adventure game with RPG elements? That's the unspoken question behind <strong>Crimson Desert</strong>. South Korean developer <strong>Pearl Abyss</strong> achieved incredible success with their debut game, 2014's MMORPG <strong>Black Desert Online</strong> (known simply as Black Desert on consoles). In February 2024, almost ten years after the game's original PC launch, the studio could boast a player base of <strong>over 55 million users</strong> across all platforms (including mobile) and a lifetime revenue of <strong>more than $2 billion</strong>.</p>



<p>With all this money, Pearl Abyss <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-to-acquire-eve-onlines-ccp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired CCP Online</a></strong>, the maker of <strong>EVE Online</strong>, and conceived several new projects, three of which <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-showcases-stunning-debut-trailers-for-crimson-desert-plan-8-and-dokev-mmo-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were announced at G-Star 2019</a>: the shooter <strong>Plan 8</strong>, which hasn't been mentioned in a long time; the creature-collecting game <strong>DokeV</strong>, still in development; and Crimson Desert, which had its own lengthy development phase but is now very close to being available.</p>

<h2 id="release-date-platforms-pricing"><a href="#release-date-platforms-pricing">Release Date, Platforms, and Pricing</a></h2>



<p id="h-release-date-platforms-and-pricing">The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally meant to launch in <strong>Winter 2021</strong></a>, but Pearl Abyss <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-open-world-multiplayer-game-delayed-indefinitely-by-pearl-abyss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opted for an indefinite delay</a> as it reworked several aspects of the game. The developers went silent for a couple of years and <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-gets-new-gameplay-trailer-at-gamescom-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">resurfaced at Gamescom 2023</a> with an awesome new trailer. From that point, Crimson Desert communication became more regular, eventually leading to an official <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-in-fall-2025-pc-requirements-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Fall 2025</strong> launch window</a>. The team needed a little more time, though, and delayed it to Q1 2026, which was later <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-has-release-date-recommended-requirements-reduced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">formalized as the final release date of <strong>March 19, 2026</strong></a>. We can now add that <strong>further delays are unlikely</strong>, as Pearl Abyss confirmed a few days ago that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-release-date-gone-gold-pearl-abyss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game has reached gold status</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Crimson Desert will be available on <strong>PC</strong>, <strong>PlayStation 5</strong>, and <strong>Xbox Series S and X</strong>. There are three editions available for pre-order: </p>



<ul>
<li>Standard Edition: <strong>$70</strong> (base game only)</li>

<h2 id="genre-setting-story-premise"><a href="#genre-setting-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</a></h2>



<p>Crimson Desert can be best described as a <strong>single player open world action/adventure game with RPG elements</strong>. It is set in a medieval fantasy world, specifically the large continent of <strong>Pywel</strong>, where multiple factions fight for control of the land. </p>



<p>The protagonist, <strong>Kliff Macduff</strong>, is a seasoned mercenary of the <strong>Greymanes</strong>, a kinship-bound fighting order. <strong>The Greymanes are, however, struck down at the very beginning of the narrative</strong>, when the <strong>Black Bears faction</strong> ambushes and decimates them, scattering survivors across Pywel. From there onward, <strong>Kliff's mission is to reunite his scattered order</strong>, including Oongka, Yann, and Naira, and exact revenge on the enemy leader <strong>Myurdin</strong>, but there's more at play in the political landscape amid a broader collapse of centralized authority. <strong>The King of Demeniss has fallen into a mysterious coma</strong>, creating a power vacuum that various factions, including the aforementioned Black Bears, other warlords, and even ancient forces, are seeking to exploit to gain control.</p>



<p>Kliff, an unlikely political player, <strong>is tasked with protecting an artefact of unclear significance</strong> while rebuilding his mercenary company. Based on what Pearl Abyss has shared so far, the narrative will emphasize themes of <strong>leadership under duress</strong>, <strong>the cost of survival</strong>, and <strong>redemption</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="gameplay"><a href="#gameplay">Gameplay Features and Mechanics</a></h2>



<p>As briefly touched upon earlier in this roundup, Crimson Desert had to be massively reworked before it could be released. That's because <strong>it was initially unveiled as an MMO-like game</strong> in the vein of Black Desert. The story of Macduff and his crew was already there, but so were many MMO features, which were eventually removed until <strong>it became a single-player-only game</strong>.</p>



<p>The developers have instead doubled down on creating a massive and immersive open world game. The studio recently confirmed that size estimates put the continent of Pywel at <strong>twice the size of Skyrim</strong> in The Elder Scrolls V, and it's also <strong>larger than the already big playable map of Rockstar's Red Dead Redemption 2</strong>. The game world is completely seamless (there will be little to no loading screens), and traversal options include horseback riding, <strong>dragonback flight</strong>, mechanical mech with jet propulsion, and climbing/parkour mechanics. </p>



<p>There will be plenty of side content, including <strong>non-combat activities like fishing, cooking, hunting, arm wrestling, sheep wrangling, and horse taming</strong>. However, <strong>the fighting is central to Crimson Desert</strong> and features incredible complexity. Pearl Abyss took inspiration from retro arcade fighting games, such as Samurai Showdown, Final Fight, and King of Fighters, rather than contemporary Soulslikes. The combat system includes multi-button combinations, linked attacks, and more. It'll require more time to master than the average action/adventure game, that's for sure, but it could also be the game's defining feature when it's all said and done.</p>



<p>Kliff's combat toolkit lets players choose between <strong>swords, spears, bows, spells, grapples, wrestling throws, Taekwondo kicks (which were motion-captured from martial artists), and punches</strong>. Defensive mechanics feature stamina-draining blocks, precise parries that enable counterattacks, and dodge rolls with perfect dodge windows restoring the stamina resource. Furthermore, interaction with the environment can also be exploited by throwing enemies into hazards, igniting fire traps, toppling structures, detonating magical spells mid-air, and exploiting weakpoints.</p>



<p><strong>There is, of course, equipment customization</strong>. Various armor sets (helm, chest, gloves, boots, cloaks, rings, amulets) offer different stat modifiers, like defense (physical/magical mitigation), health/stamina pools, resistance to specific damage types (fire, ice, elemental), skill cooldown reductions, and damage boosts for weapon types. </p>



<h2 id="tech-specs"><a href="#tech-specs">Tech and Specs</a></h2>



<p>Crimson Desert runs on the proprietary <strong>Black Space Engine</strong>, which the South Korean studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-blackspace-engine-showcase-demonstrates-big-tech-advancements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">detailed in depth during a GDC 2025 presentation attended by Wccftech</a>. Black Space was <strong>designed to render vast, fully seamless open worlds without sacrificing details</strong>. It is <strong>powered by several simulation systems</strong>, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Dynamic weather</li>



<li>Cloth, hair, trees, and grass behave believably and are affected by wind movement</li>



<li>Environments that support real-time destructibility</li>



<li>Highly realistic waves, currents, and ripples thanks to the engine's FFT Ocean simulation and Shallow Water simulation</li>



<li>Volumetric fog and detailed atmospheric scattering effects, and dynamic weather</li>



<li>Ray tracing</li>
</ul>



<p id="h-tech-and-specs">On PC, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-little-nightmares-iii-and-crimson-desert-all-launching-with-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been confirmed to support <strong>NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation</strong></a> for GeForce RTX users. AMD users can also look forward to <strong>three FSR RedStone</strong> features: <strong>Upscaling</strong>, <strong>Frame Generation</strong>, and <strong>Ray Regeneration</strong>.</p>

            <guid>1415647</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Kota Furushima, the game director of Beast of Reincarnation, has commented on Game Freak’s history of criticism for how its 3D open-world games look and run.</p>



<p>Game Freak is best known for its work on the Pokémon franchise. Pokémon, while a beloved IP, does not feature 3D games that fully maximize hardware potential in 2026. Sometimes, recent Pokémon games have struggled to function properly. However, Beast of Reincarnation, the new game from Game Freak, looks to be a game on par with most.</p>







<h2 id="h-game-freak-prioritizes-creating-experiences">Game Freak Prioritizes Creating Experiences</h2>



<p>During a recent interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/beast-of-reincarnation-game-director-answers-all-our-burning-questions-about-the-pokemon-developers-upcoming-action-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Kota Furushima addressed these criticisms. He noted that, overall, they’re always striving to create a unique experience rather than hyper-fixating on reaching a certain quality Benchmark.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our focus is on that gameplay experience. Part of that, of course, is making sure that it performs really well, but our attention is more on getting the experience over to you and making sure that our vision can get to your hands and your hearts.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, he spoke about the game being centered on natural environments and very rooted in Japanese inspiration. He also noted that the video game’s score was rooted in themes of loneliness and isolation, while also emphasizing the importance of learning to rely on others.</p>







<p>Beast of Reincarnation is slated to release this summer.

<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero will be receiving some new DLC in the near future.</p>



<p>The Dragon Ball team has announced that the latest console game in the Dragon Ball franchise, Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, will receive a major DLC release this summer. The DLC was released as part of the franchise’s 40th anniversary celebration. As part of the celebration, a trailer revealed that Super Android 17 would be coming to the game. </p>



<p>As well as the ‘Great Demon King’ Piccolo, the villainous version of Piccolo from the original Dragon Ball series. Super Saiyan Bardock is also on his way to the franchise. More names are also planned to join the lineup.</p>



<p>Additionally, there will be new cosmetics and other skill customizations. The trailer also teases a new single-player game mode. More is expected to be announced in the coming months.</p>

<h2 id="h-there-s-also-a-new-dragon-ball-game-coming-in-2027">There’s Also A New Dragon Ball Game Coming in 2027</h2>



<p>Additionally, the celebration revealed that a new game project is in the works. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-age-1000-fans-dragon-ball-online/">Known as “Age 1000,</a>” it was accompanied by a brief trailer. Work on Age 1000 began more than 5 years ago, and Akira Toriyama, the franchise’s creator, worked on the game’s world-building and even on some brand-new characters. Great news for longtime fans of the series who thought that Toriyama’s passing in 2024 might have meant that the last of his work had already been seen.</p>







<p>More information about the forthcoming game will be revealed during Dragon Ball Games Battle Hour 2026 in April.</p>



<p>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero is currently available for purchase on all Xbox consoles, PlayStation 5, Steam, and the Nintendo Switch family of consoles.</p>

            <p>A familiar face is on its way to Resident Evil Survival Unit, one that will no doubt delight Albert Wesker (if you know, you know): Rebecca Chambers.</p>
<p>Described as "a chemistry expert who flew through university at a young age", the Legendary character Rebecca brings her sharp intellect and specialism to the team, including a raft of exploration and field skills to help you out.</p>

<p>Here's what Rebecca has to offer, with the '?' denoting a value that scales based on the character's level:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Exploration:</strong></p>

<li>Lv.?: First Aid Spray: uses a healing medical spray on a single ally, recovering HP equal to ?% of Rebecca's Attack.</li>
<li>Lv.?: Molotov Cocktail: Every 20 seconds, lobs a Molotov cocktail. When the Molotov cocktail lands, it sets the area on fire for 10 seconds, dealing damage equal to ?% of Attach per second to any enemies within the area. Enemies affected by the flames are burned, taking damage equal to ?% of Attack per second for five seconds.</li>
<li>Lv.?: Herbal Mix: Every 12 seconds, Rebecca mixes herbs, recovering HP equal to ?% of Rebecca's Attack for all allies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Field:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Lv.?: Combat Medical Expertise: Increases the attack of the deployed squad by ?% and Defense by ?%.</li>
<li>Lv.?: Stimulant: When deployed Allied squad attacks, there is a 25% chance to deal ?% increased damage.</li>
<li>Lv.?: Anesthetic: When deployed Allied squad attacks, there is a 40% chance to take ?% reduced damage.</li>

<p>The team did not confirm specifically when Chambers would be reporting for duty, but she's apparently "headed your way soon".</p>
<p>Capcom reckons Resident Evil: Survival Unit offers "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-survival-unit-stars-a-bunch-of-your-favourites-including-leon-jill-claire-and-the-real-mvp-barry-burton">a fresh, mobile-first gameplay experience</a> that diverges from the traditional survival horror format of the main series". It has already been downloaded over a million times.</p>

<p>Rumour has it Ubisoft is also working on a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rayman-legends">Rayman Legends</a> remake, although it's now unclear if those plans have been scuppered by Ubisoft's "reset" in which it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">closed two studios and cancelled six projects</a>, including its much-delayed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> remake.

In a video posted on the official Rayman X account, which had been dormant for years prior to the announcement, Gounon stated: "A very talented team at Ubisoft Montpellier and Ubisoft Milan are currently working on the future of Rayman. Don't expect news from us too soon, but rest assured, Rayman is in good hands."</p>
<p>To mark the 30th anniversary of Rayman, Gounon also announced Ubisoft will be sharing behind-the-scenes anecdotes, interviews, concept art, and more.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft has wiped over a third off its share price after announcing a "reset" would close down two studios and cancel six games.</p>
<p>As noted by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/22/ubisoft-shares-plummet-after-assassins-creed-maker-cancels-six-games.html">CNBC</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/ubisoft-shares-plummet-to-lowest-price-in-over-14-years-amid-its-recently-announced-restructuring-centered-on-cancellations-layoffs-and-generative-ai/">PC Gamer</a>), the stock price had progressively declined since the pandemic, but on Thursday - the day after its announcement - it plummeted another 34 percent. It's the lowest share price the company has had since 2011, when it reported losses in the multi-millions, and closed at just €4.06. Just seven days prior, the share price was €6.89.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">Ubisoft closed two studios and cancelled six projects</a> - including its much-delayed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> remake - last week as part of a major restructuring effort that will also see delays for seven games. Described as a "major organisational, operational and portfolio reset", the publisher/developer said the cuts come as it struggles to compete in a "persistently more selective AAA market and an increasingly competitive shooter landscape".</p>
<p>As well as the six cancellations, Ubisoft has also confirmed it is delaying seven unspecified games "to ensure enhanced quality benchmarks are fully met" and to "maximise long-term value creation". Though not confirmed, it's widely believed that this includes the unannounced but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">much-rumoured Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake</a>.</p>
<p>All this has led Ubisoft to revise its guidance for the full financial year, saying it now expects net bookings of around €1.5bn - a reduction of €330m.</p>
<p>As Matt reported for us at the time, the restructuring will now see the publisher split its efforts across five "creative houses", respectively focused on "scaling and extending" its biggest properties (including Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six); on competitive and cooperative shooter experiences (The Division, Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell); on live experiences (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/for-honor">For Honor</a>, The Crew, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/riders-republic">Riders Republic</a>, Brawlhalla, Skull &amp; Bones); on immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes (Anno, Might &amp; Magic, Rayman, Prince of Persia, Beyond Good &amp; Evil), and on casual and family games.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-assassins-creed-boss-marc-alexis-cote-sues-ubisoft">Former Assassin's Creed leader Marc-Alexis Côté is reportedly suing Ubisoft following a surprise and suspicious departure from the company last year</a>.</p>

<p>Now, for those unaware, and to get things off in a high-brow sort of way through the illusion of learning, Robert Burns was a Scottish poet, now the country's national poet no less, who lived from 1759 until 1796. Just 37 years. However! In this tragically short lifespan, he managed to imprint himself permanently on the Scottish psyche through his powerful works which contributed greatly to the Romantic movement, don't you know.</p><div><figure data-videoid="CiNQNWrXoic" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CiNQNWrXoic?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytCiNQNWrXoic" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CiNQNWrXoic?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CiNQNWrXoic?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed82b568ripnht&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>The fact that Burns wrote in a Scots dialect (although he did use a watered-down version, making his verses and lyrics much easier to parse for non-native speakers) made him incredibly popular and personal to the Scots, and in death he's become a figure of inspiration for socialist and liberal movements, in particular.</p>
<p>Of course, we probably all know <strong>Auld Lang Syne</strong>, his poem which became lyrics sung on New Year's Eve to "ring in the bells" as folk say up here in Scotland (they kidnapped me in 2007 and made me live here, please help). But other works — and we're getting to the end of the learning bit now, class, so stay strong — include very well-known stuff like <strong>A Red, Red Rose</strong> and <strong>Tam o' Shanter</strong>.</p>
<figure data-uuid="b9ab63965a8a5"><a title="Robert Burns Night AC" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b9ab63965a8a5/robert-burns-night-ac.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yes, Tam o' Shanter. That's right. If this rings a bell, gamers, it's because back in 2010 Nintendo helped celebrate Burns Night with a special Animal Crossing item. Burns Night — which happens every 25th January (Burns' birthday) and which I'm currently enjoying immensely, thank you — sees some folk in Scotland read and/or perform from a selection of the poets' works, eat lots of haggis, neeps and tatties (that's turnip and potatoes to you), and, well, some people may even like to have small thimble of whiskey, too. Then straight to bed!</p>
<p>If you happened to have been playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/animal_crossing_city_folk">Animal Crossing: City Folk</a>, or <strong>Animal Crossing: Let's Go To The City</strong> as it was known o'er here — sorry, went all Burns there — back in 2010, you'll have got to celebrate your very own Burn's Night by nabbing a very exciting (mild sarcasm detected) "Tam o' Shanter" hat. Aye, a wee Scottish tartan bonnet for putting oan the in-game heid eh a bonnie wee lad/and or lassie. (Apologies to all my Scottish friends for that sentence.)</p>
<p>The coolest thing about this particular hat, as you'll no doubt already know, was that it gave your character a shaggy new Scottish hairdo as an extra to boot, and this celebration of Scotland's national bard has also gone on to feature in both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/animal_crossing_new_leaf">Animal Crossing: New Leaf</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> (hey, that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">just got an update!</a>).</p>
<p>So, seeing as it's Burns Night and all that, and seeing how I'm currently in Glasgow, the unofficial capital of Scotland, why not join me, in...well...it's not exactly the same as raising a glass to the great man, but why not hop into your copy of Animal Crossing: New Horizons (or New Leaf), stick yer hat oan, and join me in some deep breathing exercises as we consider Robert Burns, and his many, many excellent poems. But most especially Tam o' Shanter, as it's the one holding this vaguely game-related article together.</p>
<p>With me? Right! Can't find your Tam o' Shanter? To nab the headgear in New Horizons, you need to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/animal-crossing-new-horizons-gulliver-souvenir-list-how-to-wake-up-where-to-find-communicator-parts">get it from Gulliver as a reward for helping him find his communicator parts</a>. No worries, you can just jump into the game's custom designs portal to look for (or design!) some Scottish and tartan-themed gear. If you're wondering, you got the hat from Pelly or Phyllis at the Post Office in New Leaf.</p>

<p>Once you've got your hat on, and have your plate of haggis (that's sheep liver, lungs, heart, etcetera, all mixed up with delicious oatmeal, or there's a veggie option available!), grab yourself a thimble of something delicious and we'll offer up a toast to Rabbie Burns, and to Animal Crossing, I guess, on this latest Burns Night.</p>
<p>And to close out, here's a little excerpt from Tam o' Shanter, in which we contemplate the transient nature of joy, man's inability to control time, and the nature of mortality. Annnnnnnd relax:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>But pleasures are like poppies spread,<br>
You seize the flow'r, its bloom is shed;<br>
Or like the snow-falls in the river,<br>
A moment white–then melts forever . . .<br>
. . .<br>
Or like the rainbow's lovely form<br>
Evanishing amid the storm.–<br>
Nae man can tether time or tide;<br>
The hour approaches Tam maun ride;<br>
That hour o' night's black arch the key-stane,<br>
That dreary hour Tam mounts his beast in;<br>
And sic a night he taks the road in,<br>
As ne'er poor sinner was abroad in.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, I'm off over to Wikipedia to get this Animal Crossing malarkey added to the site's official list of cultural references for Robert Burns.</p>
<p>Gabh cùram!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>As a retro gaming fan, I was thrilled when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/5/24122341/apple-app-store-game-emulators-super-apps">Apple opened its App Store to emulators in 2024</a>, but I’ve yet to find a controller that makes me want to fully embrace retro gaming on my phone.</p></div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/661382/the-new-backbone-pro-could-be-the-one-controller-for-all-your-gaming">Clamp-on controllers like the Backbone Pro</a> are a bit too bulky, and I don’t want to prop my phone up somewhere to use a standalone gamepad. The Abxylute M4 seemed exactly what I was looking for when it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/809274/abxylute-m4-snap-on-mobile-wireless-smartphone-controller-magnetic-magsafe">debuted a few months ago</a>. It’s a compact wireless gamepad that uses a magnetic mount to attach to my iPhone. It’s a clever design, but one that’s let down by stiff thumbsticks and a magnetic mount that doesn’t always feel like it’s securely supporting my phone.</p><p>There are two components to the Abxylute M4: a retro-looking rectangular gamepad that connects to your smartphone over Bluetooth, and a Q-shaped mount that attaches the controller to your phone so it feels like you’re playing a handheld console. The mount is compatible with MagSafe iPhone models and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762426/google-qi2-wireless-charger-pixelsnap-pixel-10-series">Google Pixel 10 Series</a>. I primarily tested it with an iPhone 16 Pro, but Abxylute includes an adhesive metal ring you can stick to the back of any phone to make it compatible.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The M4’s magnetic mount can double as a smartphone stand using a ring-shaped kickstand.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The ring of magnets on the M4’s mount stuck to the back of my iPhone as securely as any MagSafe accessory or Qi2 charger I’ve ever used. It’s not going to come off until you want it to. It also features a smooth finish, allowing you to rotate the mount and attach the gamepad so that it completely hides behind your phone instead of hanging off the side. But the whole thing ends up being too bulky and thick to slip into a pocket, so I’ve been removing it entirely when not playing.</p><div id=":R1j2r6eqb96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>The M4 controller doesn’t protrude far enough from the bottom of a phone to play games in a portrait orientation.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The M4 can be attached so it completely hides behind your phone. But you’ll need giant pockets to carry it around like this.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>One limitation of the M4’s design is that when attached, it can only be used to play games in a landscape orientation. In a vertical mode, the controller doesn’t protrude far enough for all its controls to be accessible. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, but as a decades-old Game Boy fan, I tend to prefer playing games vertically. Recently announced mobile controllers like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/860093/pocket-taco-pocket-taco-pocket-taco">GameSir Pocket Taco</a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/860160/8bitdo-flippad-hands-on">8BitDo FlipPad</a> support that.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The mount attaches to the M4 controller using one of two magnetic connectors.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>A far bigger issue with the M4’s design, and a potential deal-breaker, is the connection between the mount and the controller. It also relies on a strong magnet that makes the controller snap into place when attached to the mount. But the connection doesn’t feel strong enough to always keep the mount securely connected to the controller while your phone’s attached.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The mount’s connection to the M4 controller feels strong, but it doesn’t take a lot of force for it to accidentally disconnect.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The connection between the mount and controller feels secure enough when I’m holding the M4 and my phone up in front of me while playing a game. But at some angles, or when I accidentally bump my phone, the mount can separate from the gamepad. The two will also consistently disconnect if you absentmindedly turn the whole thing upside down, sending the phone and the attached mount falling. Thankfully, all my testing was done on a soft sofa.</p><p>I’m not the only one to experience this behavior. <a href="https://retrododo.com/abxylute-m4-controller-review/"><em>Retro Dodo</em>’s Brandon Saltalamacchia</a> did, too. The connection might fare better with a lighter phone, like the iPhone Air, but given smartphones are now a significant investment (my iPhone 16 Pro cost just shy of CA$1,500 here in Canada, or around $1,100 US), I’m not comfortable using the M4 as it’s designed.</p><p>The M4 isn’t entirely dependent on its magnetic mount. It can be used as a standalone controller with phones, consoles, or any device that supports Bluetooth gamepads. I was surprised at how comfortable it was to use with my gigantic hands. Its square-shaped design lets me reach the M4’s shoulder buttons without contorting my index fingers, and the build quality feels solid.</p><div id=":R1n2r6eqb96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>The M4 controller’s action buttons are small, but the D-pad feels comfortably sized, even for my large thumbs.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>There’s two pairs of shoulder buttons atop the M4 controller, which I found easy to reach without having to overstretch my fingers.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>The controller’s four action buttons are small but have a satisfying amount of resistance. They’re paired with a large D-pad that’s a bit mushy and prone to registering inputs from multiple directions, but adequate for pick-up-and-play gaming sessions. Choose a different controller if you’re chasing high scores.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The M4’s analog joysticks feature a sliding disc design similar to what the Nintendo 3DS offered. But on the M4 they’re stiff and uncomfortable to use.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Abxylute includes two analog joysticks, a feature rarely found on controllers this size. They use a sliding disc design similar to what Nintendo used on the 3DS — but less effective. The sliding joysticks on the M4 are stiff and uncomfortable, making subtle movements nearly impossible. My thumb ached after just a handful of races in <em>Mario Kart World</em>, and I can’t see myself using either of the joysticks again.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>For $49 the Abxylute M4 is one of the more affordable ways to turn your smartphone into a handheld console, but the risks don’t feel worth it.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>As compact controllers go, the $49 Abxylute M4 is good, but far from great. But that’s not why people are going to buy it. Its promise of turning a smartphone into a handheld console helped the company raise over $300,000 from nearly 6,000 backers on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1932181238/m4-snap-on-magnetic-phone-controller-for-anytime-pocket-play">Kickstarter</a> — a lot of whom I think will be frustrated or disappointed if they’re not extra cautious while using it. Trusting your $1,000 mobile device to the M4 requires a leap of faith that’s a bit too far for me.</p><p><em>Photos by Andrew Liszewski / The Verge</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/864821/abxylute-m4-snap-on-mobile-controller-magsafe-magnetic-bluetooth]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Dataminers believe they've found evidence that Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has changed the ending to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yakuza-3">Yakuza 3</a> in the upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yakuza-kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> 3.</p>
<p>Though the game isn't even out yet, some dataminers claim to have discovered the full script hidden in the playable demo, suggesting the ending has been revised.</p>

<p>At the end of the original Yakuza 3, the game's main antagonist, Yoshitaka Mine, plummets to his death, taking fellow bad guy Andre Richardson with him, and setting up the events of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yakuza-4">Yakuza 4</a>. Now, however, if the claims are true, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1qk5rws/yakuza_3_kiwami_script_leak/">Mine miraculously survives the fall</a> and joins the Daidoji, with a considerable knock-on effect on the rest of the franchise. Dark Ties, a spin-off game bundled in with Yakuza Kiwami 3, is a prequel starring Mine (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/yakuza-kiwami-3-ending-leaked/">TheGamer</a>).</p><p>"The ending for Dark Ties has been leaked and has massively retconed the end of the game to the point where it rectons something in Yakuza 4," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1qm2kzp/comment/o1ivapa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said</a> one player. Another said they had "definite proof" regarding the amended conclusion, writing: "I was sceptic first, but after having datamined the demo myself with a datamining tool and exploring the auth file (for anyone trying themselves -&gt; par decomp. -&gt; data and db.bis.en-&gt; Auth file), I found the proof for the new end."</p>
<p>Back in September, though, the studio said there "won't be any major changes to the story", but did suggest we'd get to learn more about the motivations behind why certain characters behave the way that they do.</p>
<p>The silver lining, I guess, is that we don't have long to wait to find out if this is just a troll kicking up trouble or that the game's conclusion really has changed: Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties is set to release for PC, PS5, Xbox Series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, and last-gen consoles on 12th February, 2026.</p>
<p>This latest furore comes on top of pressure from fans to remove Teruyuki Kagawa, who portrays Goh Hamazaki, from the cast after he <a href="https://kbizoom.com/roppongi-class-teruyuki-kagawa-admits-sexual-harassment-of-a-female-club-employee/">admitted</a> to sexual misconduct and forcibly touched a woman without consent in 2019.</p>
<p>Last weekend, we learned<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yakuza-3-remastered-will-not-be-available-to-buy-as-a-standalone-game-after-yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-releases-next-month"> Yakuza 3 Remastered will no longer be available as a standalone purchase after Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties releases next month</a>. While people who already own the game will "still be able to continue playing it", "those new to the series who wish to experience the original version" will only be able to play it if they buy the whole Yakua Complete Series bundle.</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>The game currently has a mixed reaction on Metacritic with a 70 Metascore. The user rating is a little more unforgiving, currently at 4.8. Some reviews knock the game for being buggy and urge others not to buy. Well, PlayStation Plus users won’t have to buy the game in February if they want to try it out. </p>



<p>Currently, Epic Mickey: Rebrushed and Need for Speed Unbound are available to download for free on PlayStation Plus.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has unveiled a new trailer showcasing the upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> Movie, giving us our first look at Yoshi and, I'm delighted to report, Birdo.</p>
<p>The two-minute preview, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-super-mario-galaxy-movie-nintendo-direct-coming-this-sunday">which debuted overnight,</a> was introduced by Nintendo's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>, and sees Mario and Luigi - seemingly cosplaying as Dune characters - pull up in the Tostarena Kingdom to address a "troubled pipe". Complete with the score we all know so well, the brothers enter what appears to be an ancient temple and meet a very familiar face.</p>
<p>You can check it out below:</p>

<p>We also get to see Baby Mario and Luigi, Peach, Toad, Birdo, and catch Luigi ribbeting in a Frog Suit.</p>
<p>"After the first trailer was released, people were asking, is Yoshi not going to be in the movie?" Miyamoto explained. "Of course he's in it! For over 30 years, Yoshi has been a significant part of Mario's adventure.</p>
<p>"When we began developing Super Mario World, Yoshi was created from the idea of wanting to run around while on a small dinosaur. Mr. Kondo added percussion to the background music, and Yoshi - who's fun to use for running, jumping, stomping, eating things, and laying eggs - was born.</p>
<p>"Even after evolving into 3D, Yoshi has continued to play an active role across different games."</p>
<p>Illumination's Chris Meledandri also confirmed that animation has now been "fully completed", and the movie has moved into post-production, with teams now focused on music and sound design, which includes a 70-piece orchestra.</p>
<p>Along with Mario and Luigi, the upcoming animated sequel will also see Bowser Junior and Rosalina joining the chaos, the latter of which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-gets-its-first-trailer-revealing-rosalina-and-bowser-jrs-voice-actors">is being voiced by long-time Nintendo fan</a>, Brie Larson.</p>

              <p>For some reason, Nintendo decided to hold <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2YywtBYAaw">a “Direct”</a> presentation on a Sunday about the upcoming <em>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>. In it, we get a new trailer showcasing a few new <em>Mario&nbsp;</em>characters joining the cast in the sequel, though we didn’t get any confirmation on whether big celebrity actors are voicing them like they are rest of the crew. Yoshi and Birdo will both make their cinematic debut in the movie when it premieres on April 1.</p> <p>The trailer opens with Mario and Luigi investigating a pipe that apparently has some kind of monster trapped inside. The two activate their Fire Flowers and get ready for a fight, only to find that there’s no monster in there, just a scared little dino guy. Aww. Thus begins the beautiful onscreen friendship between the Brooklyn plumbers and a prehistoric sidekick that eats baddies and poops them out into eggs.&nbsp; Though this is the first official reveal of the character, we saw what he would look like back in November <a href="https://kotaku.com/your-first-look-at-yoshi-in-the-mario-galaxy-movie-comes-from-a-box-of-cookie-dough-2000642406">after a cookie dough box revealed his movie look early</a>.</p>

  <p>We also see Birdo and Peach fighting in a brief action montage, but it’s a blink-and-you’ll-miss it shot, so there’s not much to glean from it just yet. Nevertheless, the cast of characters for the second <em>Mario</em> movie is growing pretty substantially, with Bowser Jr. and Rosalina also joining, <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-rosalina-bowser-jr-direct-2000643447">as revealed back in the first trailer last year</a>. We even see a glimpse of Baby Mario and Baby Luigi in this latest tease, but it’s unclear if those will be distinct characters or just some kind of transformation state that the brothers go through during their next adventure.</p> <p>At the end of the direct, Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri said that all animation on the film is complete, and it has officially entered post production, focusing on sound design and finishing up the score. Does that mean it’s too late for them to fix whatever the hell is going on with those <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-bowser-jr-eyes-bloodshot-2000643518">gross, bulging eyes on Bowser Jr.</a>? Probably. <em>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> isn’t out for another couple of months though, so who knows what other surprises Nintendo still has waiting in the wings.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-dji-gopro-hero13-black-hits-its-lowest-price-as-amazon-offloads-waterproof-action-cameras-2000661985</link>
            <guid>1415488</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The GoPro HERO13 Black features 5.3K60 video, 27-megapixel photographs, and is waterproof, dustproof, and shockproof, with a ruggedized design for capturing professional-quality videos and casual social media posts. The camera has been engineered to withstand muddied, snowy, and wet environments, including up to 10 meters underwater, while continuing to record high-quality video that can be slowed down or repositioned. Additionally, the camera will allow you to continue shooting in harsher environmental conditions thanks to its Enduro battery, which provides longer recording times in extreme temperatures.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6865/">Go to Amazon to buy the GoPro HERO13 Black for $319, down from $430, for a $111 discount and a 26% price reduction.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6865/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The perfect camera to capture all the action in your life</h2>
<p>With the GoPro Hero 13, you can record at 5.3K resolution at up to 60 frames per second, providing your video with greater clarity and detail than standard 4K or 1080P recordings. Additionally, if you’d like to capture both a video and a high-resolution photo, you can do so by pulling still images up to 24.7 megapixels directly from your video in the Quik application. When you’re trying to showcase some of the most exciting parts of your video, such as splashy moments, tricks, and quick movements, slow-motion recording allows you to slow down the action to approximately 13 times slower than real-time.</p>
<p>HyperSmooth 6.0 Stabilization smooths out bumps and small vibrations that may occur when the camera is shaken on trails, in the water, or in the snow. So, even the fastest runs appear smoother rather than choppy. In addition, a water-repellent lens cover helps quickly remove water droplets from the lens, thereby reducing glare in wet conditions. The ruggedized case is designed to protect against knocks, scrapes, and other forms of wear and tear from traveling between shoots.</p>



<p>The updated mounting system, combined with the camera’s small footprint, makes attaching it to new locations a simple process. Included with the purchase of the GoPro Hero 13 is a curved adhesive mount, a mounting buckle, and a thumbscrew, allowing for a basic setup to be attached immediately. Additionally, the Enduro lithium-ion battery is optimized for long runtime regardless of the environment’s temperature. Highlight Video Tools, along with Cloud Backup support, help streamline the process of converting your recorded sessions into completed and ready-to-post videos.</p>
<p>While additional mounting options and lens mods can be purchased separately, all the necessary accessories to get started with the camera are included in the box. These include a USB-C cable for charging and transferring data, a microSD card slot to select the storage capacity based on your intended usage. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6865/">Right now, you can buy the GoPro Hero 13 for $319, down from the typical retail price of $430</a>, and get rugged 5.3K video, enhanced battery life, and expanded creative options with various lens mods in a single, compact package.</p>

<p>The latest trailer for the Super Mario Galaxy movie reveals a couple of fan-favorite characters. Also, it shows that the upcoming film has taken more inspiration from recent Mario games than was once believed.</p>



<p>In a special Nintendo Direct specifically for the Super Mario Galaxy movie, Shigeru Miyamoto revealed the latest trailer for the upcoming film. The trailer begins with Mario and Luigi traveling through the Sand Kingdom from Super Mario Odyssey. They run into several Tostarenans who are excited to see the plumbers. </p>



<p>They point them toward the disturbances they’ve been experiencing. This leads to a dark cavern, requiring Mario and Luigi to use a fire flower, and when they reach the center warp pipe, Yoshi is revealed. At first, they are just as afraid of Yoshi as he is of them, but they quickly realize that they have found a new companion in everyone’s favorite green dinosaur.</p>



<p>Yoshi was previously teased in the end credits scene following the Super Mario Bros. Movie in 2023.</p>

<p>In addition to Yoshi, there was a brief fight scene featuring Princess Peach and Birdo, paying homage to the fact that Birdo was a boss battle in the second Super Mario Bros game. In the trailer, Birdo was shooting eggs at Princess Peach with great ferocity. There was also a brief moment of Luigi wearing a frog suit. Lakitu was also briefly shown.</p>



<p>Keegan-Michael Key’s Toad also returns, and he is initially annoyed at the fact that Yoshi immediately joins the group. The whole gang is later seen running away from the realistic dinosaur featured in Super Mario Odyssey. During the scene, it was revealed that Mario and Luigi were in their baby forms and were being carried by Toad.</p>







<p>Chris Meledandri from Illumination also appeared at the end of the presentation to say that the movie was currently in post-production and had finished animation. The movie will be released in theaters on April 1.</p>
