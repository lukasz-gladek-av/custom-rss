The genre, that first flourished in the early ‘90s with <em>SimCity 2000</em> has consistently delivered intricate excellence, with series like <em>Tropico</em>, <em>Frostpunk</em> and <em>Anno</em>, building to the triumph of 2015's <em>Cities: Skylines</em>. But it’s also offered more esoteric takes, with the brilliant <em>Surviving Mars</em>, <em>Before We Leave</em>, and <em>Dorfromantik</em>. But you know what they all lack? A magic light being with a story to tell. So welcome <em>Dawnfolk</em>, a glorious distilling of the genre that  streamlines and simplifies, while weaving its own spellbinding narrative. - John Walker <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dawnfolk-review-city-building-game-steam-indie-1851770670&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dawnfolk-review-city-building-game-steam-indie-1851770670">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e9c8f3def50df9afb600b2747b6e8e0b" data-recommend-id="image://e9c8f3def50df9afb600b2747b6e8e0b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1919" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mika Mobile</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e9c8f3def50df9afb600b2747b6e8e0b" data-recommend-id="image://e9c8f3def50df9afb600b2747b6e8e0b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1919" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Released earlier this month, <em>Zombieville USA 3D </em>is a new, super-stylish top-down indie roguelike zombie shooter that is both simple and incredibly well made, with fantastically responsive controls and impressive animation and art.

<p>There's still a little ways for Shadows to go until it tops the series' last big launch, Valhalla, which arrived in late 2020 when many of us were at home, but as Tom summarised for us earlier this month, it arrives at a time when Ubisoft is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-considering-fresh-business-to-own-assassins-creed-and-other-big-franchises-co-owned-by-others-like-tencent">reportedly considering a sale or some other kind of reorganisation to turn around its ailing fortunes</a>.</p>
<p>"Majestic in scope, impressive in detail, Ubisoft's epic adventure honours the beauty of feudal Japan, even if its strongest moments are saved for the personal stories of its two protagonists," Tom wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">Eurogamer's Assassin's Creed Shadows review</a>, awarding it four out of five stars.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>We already <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knew</a> that the game would support NVIDIA DLSS 4, including Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation. Now, Funcom has confirmed that Dune Awakening will also integrate 'the latest open upscaling and advanced frame generation tech from AMD', which would appear to hint at AMD FSR 3 support (FSR 4 is exclusive to the new AMD GPUs) as well as Intel XeSS 2 with XeLL to lower latency.</p>
<p>Additionally, thanks to a partnership with Razer, Dune Awakening integrates Razer Chroma RGB and Razer Sensa HD Haptics, enhancing immersion. The Razer Kraken V4 Pro headset provides synced lighting and intelligent haptic feedback, just like the Freyja Gaming Cushion, which will let you feel the hum of your ornithopter as if you were sitting on it.</p>
<p>The following tweakable settings were confirmed, too:</p>
<p><b>Settings</b></p>

<p><iframe title="Dune: Awakening — Business Model &amp; Post-Launch Plans Explained" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q1B7G2SXBDc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, Game Director Joel Bylos spoke in a brief video about the business model ahead of the pre-order opening. Dune Awakening will be buy-to-play only, so there won't be any optional subscriptions. Bylos stressed that this won't be an early access launch. That said, Funcom has a long history of supporting games like its MMOs (Anarchy Online is still active 25 years later) and, more recently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/conan-exiles-age-of-heroes-begins-today-adding-voiced-companions-and-living-player-settlements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conan Exiles</a>, and the same will happen with this one through a combination of free updates and optional premium DLCs.</p>
<p>There will also be optional Season Passes, which include several DLCs, but the DLCs will also be purchasable separately. Finally, as with most games, there will be five days of advanced access for those who purchase the most expensive editions. Bylos noted that this, however, helps the studio balance server load, ensuring a better experience for everyone. Furthermore, when the game launches for everyone, there will be new servers for those who don't wish to join a server where others have already started progressing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/634125/assassins-creed-shadows-photo-mode-infinity-nikki<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Infinity Nikki </em>and <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>have become my twin obsessions for their meticulously detailed environments, textures, and weather. With <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/14/24320757/infinity-nikki-review-gacha-dress-up-game">open-world dress-up game <em>Infinity Nikki</em></a>, I continue to be agog at how clothing textures are rendered with such detail and fidelity that by mere sight, I know exactly what a piece of fabric will feel like. For <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/631744/assassins-creed-shadows-review-ubisoft">an action-packed romp through feudal Japan</a>, I’m constantly in a state of awe at the natural beauty of the Japanese countryside, <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-graphics-seasons-screenshots-1851770252">a feature that has been widely celebrated</a> since its release. Both games are so visually arresting they made me fall in love with a video game staple that I’ve never really cared about before: photo mode.</p><p>Photo mode, which typically pauses the game to give players the ability to take professional grade images of their video games, is a modern gaming feature that’s been around long enough to become a standard inclusion, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/5/13/17344018/god-of-war-ps4-photo-mode">especially in AAA games</a>. But I’ve never seen their appeal. It’s a video game, not some fleeting life moment. I’m not gonna fondly flip through my PS5 media gallery in five years going, “Aww look at the time Yasuke chopped the arms and head off that guy,” like I’m looking at my grandkids’ baby photos. I definitely appreciate the skill with which others have made the most out of photo modes — like what my friend <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/applecider.bsky.social/post/3lkotizwcc224">does</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/applecider.bsky.social/post/3lkoung5vy22e">with</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/applecider.bsky.social/post/3ljduojaqhs2v"><em>Overwatch</em></a> — but it was always something I ignored. </p><p>I’ve played no shortage of games so interesting their moments <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23718926/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review-nintendo-switch">demand to be captured and shared</a> but that compulsion is on another level with <em>Infinity Nikki</em> and <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>. So, starting with the dress up game, I opened photo mode, started fiddling around with apertures and vignettes and was genuinely surprised with the results. The photos looked good! The photos weren’t <em>Vogue</em> quality, but they started to resemble the pictures that get upvoted to the moon on the <em>Infinity Nikki </em>subreddit. Even though I don’t really care to post my own photos there, it’s thrilling enough to know I’m developing a talent for something I didn’t know was in me to begin with. </p><p>I took that success with <em>Infinity Nikki </em>and translated it to <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>. I’m actually glad the game doesn’t have the feature from the last <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>where your horse automatically follows the road. Without it, I am forced to take in the game’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-seasons-change-nature-review">impressive weather and foliage</a> as I drive ole’ Kikai around rather than looking at my phone after setting him on auto-pilot. That’s how I found my first picture. I was roaming around as Yasuke and I rode by a long road flanked by Japanese maples in full, deep-red autumn foliage. (At least I think they’re Japanese maples. The codex could stand a few more flora and fauna entries, Ubisoft.) The colors were so vibrant and the sound of the wind through the leaves was so invigorating, I felt I had to preserve the moment despite none of it being real. The urge was strong enough that it completely changed my feelings about photo mode altogether.</p><p>I saw that entirely fake scenery made of pixels and code and immediately opened up photo mode as though I was capturing real natural phenomena. I placed the camera behind him and zoomed out to see as much foliage as I could fit into the shot, while still keeping Yasuke as the focus of the picture. I then tinkered with the lighting to brighten the leaves and the saturation so their colors would pop. I wanted it to look like a shot Akira Kurosawa could have composed for one of his samurai epics — a kind of thought I’ve never had while taking pictures in real life or in games. This moment completely changed my perspective on video game photography. What once seemed like a cool party trick now felt like a real avenue of creative expression.</p><p>Putting the photo modes in <em>Nikki </em>and <em>Shadows</em> through their paces, I’ve discovered game photography is now something I can really, earnestly do, and want to do more of. I hope to get better at it so I can one day take those skills from capturing video games to capturing real life. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ubisoft has revealed that Assassin’s Creed Shadows has surpassed Odyssey and Origins’ launch numbers, hitting a 2 million player milestone.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-has-surpassed-2-million-players">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Has Surpassed 2 Million Players</h2>



<p>The official Assassin’s Creed account on <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1903431554459644198" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) has just confirmed that Shadows has crossed the launch numbers of AC Origins and Odyssey, with 2 million players joining their latest adventure in Feudal Japan. The game managed to cross the 1 million players mark <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-crosses-1-million-players-on-day-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">within the first day</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ubisoft’s decision to launch Shadows Day One on Steam seems to be going well, too, as the game has already beaten AC Origin’s all-time peak numbers and is now closing in on AC Odyssey. Shadows has hit an all-time peak of 59,941 <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3159330/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">today</a> (at the time of writing), and the number can go higher as it’s the weekend. This number beats Valhalla and Origns all-time peaks of 15,679 and 41,551 and is just a bit shy of beating Odyssey’s 62,069. However, it’s worth noting that none of the other AC games were Day One releases on Steam.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows was subject to several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delays</a> before it was released on March 20. However, the added time has helped the developers provide the players with a more immersive and polished experience. It’ll be exciting to see how many more players the game attracts over time and whether it becomes the most-played Assassin’s Creed game yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Assassin’s Creed Shadows may have set a record <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-endgame-credits-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for its endgame credits</a>. Also, the Japanese government is worried about ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/japan-government-worried-attacks-assassins-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">imitation attacks</a>’ based on the game.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/playing-as-yasuke-in-assassins-creed-shadows-doesnt-feel-like-assassins-creed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playing-as-yasuke-in-shadows-doesn%E2%80%99t-feel-like-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-he%E2%80%99s-something-new.1142097/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/playing-as-yasuke-in-assassins-creed-shadows-doesnt-feel-like-assassins-creed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Thanks to a renewed focus on the ideas the series was originally built on, Shadows is the most satisfying Assassin’s Creed has felt in years. You can fluidly move from ground to castle rooftop thanks to the best parkour system since Unity, and a grappling hook only makes the journey to a great vantage point even speedier. Perched on a tightrope high above the enemy, you’re only a drop away from scoring the perfect kill… provided you’re playing as Naoe, that is. Take control of Yasuke, Shadows’ second protagonist, and it’s a whole different game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yasuke is slow. He is clumsy. He can’t kill silently. And he climbs like a grandpa. He is the antithesis of an Assassin’s Creed protagonist. He is one of Ubisoft’s most baffling design choices… and one of its most fascinating. Because when I play as Yasuke, I don’t feel like I’m playing Assassin’s Creed anymore. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/15/ac-1715776356743.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Yasuke changes the rules of Assassin's Creed, promoting grounded combat over parkour stealth. | Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I initially found this gulf between Yasuke’s ability set and the fundamental philosophy of the series to be incredibly frustrating. What is the point of an Assassin’s Creed protagonist who can barely climb and can’t perform a silent takedown? But the more I’ve played as him, the more I’ve seen merit in Yasuke’s design. He’s unquestionably flawed, but I think he addresses a couple of very important issues that Assassin’s Creed has struggled with over the past few years.      </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A brief starring role in Shadows’ prologue aside, you don’t get to play as Yasuke until several hours into the campaign. It means that your entire settling-in period is spent controlling Naoe, a swift shinobi who fulfills the “assassin” part of Assassin’s Creed better than any series protagonist has for a decade. Switching to Yasuke after playing as Naoe for so long is jarring. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This towering samurai is too big and too noisy to effectively sneak through enemy camps, and is barely capable of climbing anything higher than his own head. He cannot find a handhold in the jutting roofs that line Japan’s streets, and when you do find something he’s able to climb, he does so painfully slowly. On rooftops, he precariously balances on the apex, standing upright for all to see as he cautiously inches forward. These impairments to Yasuke’s climbing abilities introduce friction. Scaling environments can feel like a chore, with structures like scaffolding and ladders required to make any significant progress. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this doesn’t exactly <em>force </em>Yasuke to stay at ground level, but it certainly encourages it. This in turn denies him vision; without easy access to high vantage points it’s difficult to map out an area’s threats and plan accordingly. And where a grounded Naoe at least has the enemy-highlighting Eagle Vision to fall back on, Yasuke has nothing. Take up his blade and you’re agreeing to sacrifice almost everything other than raw strength.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Assassin's Creed is built on stealthy kills and vertical exploration, ideas that Yasuke is in direct opposition to.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If this sounds not a lot like Assassin’s Creed, it’s because it isn’t. The series has thus far been built around parkour-led exploration. Even when it has delved into areas of history where buildings were rarely more than one or two storeys high, verticality is still a core part of the flow. Being robbed of the series’ traditional climbing freedom and forced to follow more prescribed routes makes time spent as Yasuke feel much closer to playing Ghost of Tsushima than Assassin’s Creed – a feeling only emphasised by Yasuke’s lack of stealth training and reliance on his samurai sword skills. Embodying Yasuke is to play a game that’s first and foremost about fierce combat, something Tsushima is fondly remembered for and Assassin’s Creed often criticised over. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">To play as Yasuke is to be asked to rethink how to play Assassin’s Creed. Historically, the series has allowed us to climb anywhere. Previous assassins have been knife-happy Spider-Men, armed with sticky hands that allow them to scale everything from towers to glaciers as if they were ladders. It is effortless and, as a result, it offers no challenge whatsoever. Yasuke changes this. While it’s true that there’s a lot beyond his grasp, careful observation of the environment reveals hidden pathways that have been built especially to allow Yasuke to reach his objectives. For instance, a leaning tree trunk protruding from an overcrop can lead you to a sync point that would otherwise be inaccessible without a grappling hook. A castle may have an open window on the second floor, easily entered if you follow the staircase-like arrangement of the courtyard’s exterior wall. Such paths are arguably more interesting to decipher than the practically thoughtless scrambles of past games.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These pathways only take Yasuke where he <em>needs </em>to be, though. He has much less freedom when it comes to general exploration, and it’s difficult to gain the high ground to observe enemy patrol patterns. But Yasuke really doesn’t abide by the traditional Assassin’s Creed approach of assessing guard movements and planning ahead. His only real stealth ability is the “Brutal Assassination” skill, and… well, it involves impaling an enemy on his sword, lifting them three feet off the ground, and yelling. Not exactly inconspicuous, is it? Rather than a takedown, it’s an opening move for combat, kicking things off with an instant kill. And when things do kick off, things get good. They get <em>really </em>good. Shadows boasts the best swordplay Assassin’s Creed has had in over a decade. There’s purpose to each strike and a rich variety of techniques to pull on – from brutal rush attacks to satisfying ripostes. Finishing moves cleave heads from shoulders, an image that creates a clear contrast between Yasuke’s abilities and Naoe’s stealthy approach. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/20/ac-shadows-yasuke-combat-1742486870466.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Yasuke enjoys the best combat mechanics Assassin's Creed has ever had. | Image credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But there’s more than just contrast here; the separation of combat and stealth into two characters means there’s less bleeding between the two styles. In Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla, far too many quests used direct conflict as the default interaction. As such, action became their primary language. In Shadows, the twin protagonist system safeguards against that; Naoe’s relative fragility means she can’t go full slaughter mode, so when combat does break out you’re eventually forced to flee, reposition, and reset the stealth loop. When you want a break from that tension, Yasuke’s strength ensures you’ll be able to survive the worst Shadows can throw at you. It’s the power that he brings to the party that makes him such a tantalising prospect in combat, especially once his flashy skill tree full of abilities unlocks over time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s strong intention within Yasuke’s design, then. But it’s nonetheless difficult to see where he fits into Assassin’s Creed – this is a series built on stealthy kills and vertical exploration, ideas that Yasuke is in direct opposition to. While it’s true that the likes of Bayek and Eivor stepped much too far into action territory, they were still able to perform the fundamental actions of an Assassin’s Creed lead character. They climbed to the apex of temples and wielded hidden blades. While it is thematically appropriate for Yasuke, who is a samurai and not an assassin, to be bad at stealth and climbing, his design simply means you can’t play Assassin’s Creed like Assassin’s Creed while in control of him. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The real problem Yasuke faces, though, is his ally. Naoe is just the better option. She is, mechanically speaking, the best Assassin’s Creed protagonist in many years. Her stealth toolkit is complemented by Sengoku Period Japan, which allows for the towering verticality of architecture the series has been missing since Syndicate. Combined, these elements allow for an experience that truly fulfills the promise of Assassin’s Creed: becoming a highly mobile silent killer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naoe also benefits from the design changes that shape Yasuke – while she can climb up to practically anywhere in the world, the “stick to every surface” mantra of the series has been scrapped in favour of something slightly more realistic. This means you still have to assess climbing routes and find anchor points for your grappling hook, but you can leap further and climb faster – these are the fundamental things that turn an open world into an Assassin’s Creed sandbox. And when you are on the ground and in the thick of it, Naoe’s combat flow feels just as ruthlessly violent and impactful as Yasuke’s. She benefits from all of the swordplay enhancements he enjoys, just with the caveat that she can’t endure battle for as long as her samurai friend can. All of this raises the question: why would you play as Yasuke when you can play as Naoe?   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Due to its admirable intent to offer two distinct playstyles with Yasuke and Naoe, Ubisoft has created a double-edged sword. The African samurai plays by very different rules to a classic Assassin’s Creed protagonist, which creates a contrasting and reasonably compelling experience that’s a genuine first for the series. But he is undeniably in direct opposition to the ideas upon which these games were built – ideas that remain largely unique in the open-world genre. So while I’ll always find time to return to Yasuke’s shoes to enjoy the vicious thrill of his blade, it’ll be through the eyes of Naoe that I truly explore Shadows’ world. Because when I play as Naoe, I feel like I’m playing Assassin’s Creed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Keita Takahashi, the creator of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/katamari-damacy">Katamari Damacy</a>, has revealed he left Bandai Namco so he wouldn't "be limited to only working with [...] Japanese people".</p>
<p>Takahashi - who left Bandai Namco in 2010 after 11 years and recently announced his next project, To a T, which is set to be published by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-showcase-everything-announced">Annapurna</a> - stressed the importance of sharing skills and experiences with developers from all over the world to "get ideas from different perspectives".</p>

<p>"I left [Bandai Namco] because I didn't want to be limited to only working with the people there. I wondered why I was only making games with Japanese people," Takahashi told <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/03/20/150569.html">GameSpark</a> (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/katamari-damacy-creator-keita-takahashi-talks-about-his-decision-to-leave-bandai-namco-and-the-inspiration-behind-his-new-game/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>"I thought if I could develop games with more people from other countries, I would be able to get ideas from different perspectives.</p>
<p>"I'm currently developing games with a range of people from all over the world."</p>
<p>Takahashi added that knowing the different customs and cultural expectations of different countries is also valuable when making games.</p>
<p>"American schools don't have the custom of changing shoes like Japanese schools do," Takahashi explained. "I was once asked by a team member about what the school space full of shoe cupboards was like. I tried to convey to them that there are loads of shoes, and there's a kind of smell... but it really is something that's unique to Japan.</p>
<p>"I don't know what school culture is like in the US, so I had no choice but to use Japanese elements."</p>
<p>Takahashi finished on saying he was committed to "mak[ing] games that I feel satisfied with, so I'd like people to play them if they want to".</p>
<p>"I guess I probably should make games while thinking about the target audience, but I'll work on that in my next life," he added.</p>
<p>To a T will release on 28th May on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC, including Xbox Game Pass.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/katamari-damacy-rolling-live-announced-first-all-new-entry-in-eight-years">A new Katamari Damacy game was also recently revealed</a>, which will release exclusively on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/apple-arcade">Apple Arcade</a>.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/katamari-damacy-rolling-live">Katamari Damacy Rolling Live</a> will be the first original game in the series in almost eight years and will arrive on Apple Arcade on 3rd April.

<p>Delta Force developers have revealed they are developing a new ‘solo mode’ for the game’s campaign, allowing players who prefer to play alone to do so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/delta-force-devs-adding-solo-mode-easier-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VideoGamer</a>, Delta Force’s game design director Ricky Liao mentioned a ‘solo mode’ they will introduce soon for Black Hawk Down. The solo mode will be “a more approachable experience for players who prefer playing alone”. At the same time, the developers will maintain “the core tactical elements of the game” to provide a similar experience in the new game mode.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-delta-force-black-hawk-down-solo-mode">Delta Force Black Hawk Down Solo Mode</h2>



<p>The developers will provide different difficulty options for Delta Force Black Hawk Down’s upcoming solo mode, so players don’t need to face off against enemies created for co-op difficulty. However, the campaign will remain challenging no matter what, as the game “isn’t meant to be a fast-paced shooter”. The developers want “players to think critically, strategize, and collaborate effectively with teammates, creating a level of tension and realism that mirrors real military operations.“</p>



<p>Apart from the ‘solo mode,’ the developers also discussed adding balancing changes to make the game seem “more fair.” However, they confirmed that the game will not become easier as “the challenge is intentional.” The developers want players to approach this game tactically “and as a team.” For those wondering, Delta Force’s Black Hawk Down launched to ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-mostly-negative/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mostly negative</a>’ reviews on Steam, as many felt it was too difficult.</p>



<p>In other news, Delta Force has issued <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-issues-thousands-of-10-year-bans-to-clamp-down-on-cheaters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1,000s of 10-year bans</a> to clamp down on cheaters. Also, here’s all you need to know about the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-console-release-window-everything-we-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console release window</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/7-cool-indie-games-from-gdc-2025.1142058/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/633885/gdc-2025-best-indie-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Game Developers Conference, an annual gathering that brings thousands of game developers to San Francisco, has just wrapped up. While most of the event is about networking and interesting talks about game design and technology, there were also a bunch of unreleased indie games that we got to check out. Yes, much of video games in 2025 will probably be defined by the Nintendo Switch 2 and <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>. But based on the games we played, there might be some really fun smaller titles that could be huge hits this year, too.</p><p>Here are a few of our favorites that we’re looking forward to.</p><div><p id="dreams-of-another"><h2><em>Dreams of Another</em></h2></p></div><p><em>Dreams of Another</em> is a shooter, but you use your gun to <em>create</em> the world around you instead of destroying it. The game’s graphics have a dreamy, deconstructed quality to them, and when you shoot things, the colorful, unfocused scenes you see will solidify into things like buildings and people. Unexpectedly, my brief demo ended with a more traditional shootout against a sentient manhole cover. (I even lobbed a couple grenades to try and destroy it.) But I’m intrigued by the overall concept, and I look forward to seeing what developer Q-Games does with it in the final version of the game.—JP</p><div><p id="faraway"><h2><em>Faraway </em></h2></p></div><p>In <em>Faraway</em>, you play as a shooting star and try to make constellations. The game requires just pressing and holding one button to spin around other stars, create a trail, and essentially play a celestial game of connect the dots. It’s a simple concept, but I was impressed by it immediately. In just a 10-minute demo, I was really starting to get the hang of using my shooting star’s momentum to perfectly swing around a star to make elaborate and high-scoring constellations. That’s all the time it took to make <em>Faraway</em> far and away my favorite game of the show.—JP</p><div><p id="haste-broken-worlds"><h2><em>Haste: Broken Worlds</em></h2></p></div><p><em>Haste: Broken Worlds</em> is kind of like a 3D version of the classic mobile game <em>Tiny Wings</em>. You play as Zoe, a girl who runs forward at blinding speed through procedurally generated levels. Like with <em>Tiny Wings</em>, there are rolling hills you can launch from for added height, and if you time your fall right into the curve of another hill, you’ll get a satisfying “perfect” message and a boost to a meter that lets you pull out a hoverboard. The game has a roguelike structure, so you’ll get to pick and choose different types of levels to tackle as you make your way through a run. On the show floor, I was awful, dying within the first few levels before I had to hand the controller to the next person in line. But as soon as I got back to my hotel room, I downloaded the game’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2940200%2FHaste_Broken_Worlds_Demo%2F" rel="sponsored">free demo on Steam</a>.—JP</p><div><p id="herdling"><h2><em>Herdling</em></h2></p></div><p><em>Herdling</em> tasks you with herding mysterious, fluffy beasts. In my demo, the character starts in a dark city before quickly coming upon three adorable beasts that reminded me of a big goat mixed with <em>Sesame Street</em>’s Mr. Snuffleupagus. Your goal is to get them out of the city and out to wilder pastures. You coax the animals forward from behind with a magic stick, and while they generally follow your directions, they are sometimes difficult to direct. More than once, my herd of three walked right into a wall. By the end of the demo, however, I really started to care for my fluffy friends, especially since you can name them — though I can only imagine the cruel ways the developers will pull on my heartstrings over the course of the full adventure.—JP</p><div><p id="hotel-barcelona"><h2><em>Hotel Barcelona</em></h2></p></div><p>This is sort of the video game equivalent of a supergroup. Goichi “Suda51” Suda (best known for off-kilter games like <em>Killer 7</em> and <em>No More Heroes</em>) has teamed up with Hidetaka “Swery65” Suehiro (the writer and director behind <em>Deadly Premonition</em> and, more recently, <em>The Good Life</em>) on an extremely challenging and roguelike game set in a world inspired by slasher movies. In the short time I had with the game, I died multiple times, but the twitchy action felt very satisfying, especially once I got the hang of the controls. There’s a neat feature where you can fight alongside a ghost image of your previous run, which seems like it will come in handy. What I didn’t get to experience was the inevitable surreal twist the two creators have put on the horror setting, but the core is solid.—AW</p><div><p id="my-arms-are-longer-now"><h2><em>My Arms Are Longer Now</em></h2></p></div><p>Slapstick comedy games are really coming into their own of late. And if you loved <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/20/20868532/untitled-goose-game-review-nintendo-switch-pc-house-panic"><em>Untitled Goose Game</em></a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/31/24232540/summer-2024-best-indie-games"><em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em></a>, this is definitely one to keep an eye on. The name really says it all: you control an unseemly long and stretchy arm and attempt to... do things, most of which are illegal. The level I played took place on a moving train, and you were tasked with stealing items from passengers while remaining undetected (probably because of how terrifying the arm is). There’s a puzzle element to it; at one point, I needed to take a briefcase from a sleeping businessman, only to find it was chained to his wrist. It’s absurd, of course, but that’s exactly the appeal.—AW</p><div><p id="to-a-t"><h2><em>To a T</em></h2></p></div><p><em>To a T</em> is a delightful game about a teenager permanently stuck in a T pose. The game is from <em>Katamari</em> series creator Keita Takahashi, so, of course, it’s wacky and silly. My demo featured an elaborate tooth-brushing sequence, musical numbers, and a talking giraffe. But the demo also hinted at the character’s fear of school and bullying over their T-pose condition. I was surprised how much that made me care for the character, and if the story sticks the landing, it could make a game that might have been pure silliness something more thoughtful. It’s out on May 28th.—JP</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Former Sony executive Shuhei Yoshida recently discussed redesigning Crash Bandicoot for Japanese marketing because the character looked ‘scary’.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-was-crash-bandicoot-redesigned-for-japan">How Was Crash Bandicoot Redesigned for Japan?</h2>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oved6qVecH8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kyle Bosman</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/platformer/former-sony-exec-shuhei-yoshida-says-the-playstation-marketing-team-had-to-completely-redesign-crash-bandicoot-in-ps1-commercials-because-he-was-too-ugly-for-the-japanese-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games Radar</a>), Yoshida discussed Crash Bandicoot’s marketing plans for Japan and the hurdles they had to overcome, such as the redesign. Yoshida explained that Crash Bandicoot initially had green eyes and very thick eyebrows, which was “a bit scary”, so the devs were asked to make his eyes brown “like Japanese people” and thin the eyebrows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yoshida elaborated that Crash Bandicoot’s body had to be redesigned, too, as the character was “hairy on the surface,” which was “a bit scary” as it “looked like an animal.” Hence, they asked the Naughty Fog to create a plastic skin for Crash’s Japanese marketing materials, where the character would be “shiny”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The marketing plans for Crash Bandicoot in Japan included a 15-second advertisement where the game’s characters dance to a tune. Yoshida revealed that “Naughty Dog liked” their idea, adding that Crash starts dancing during the opening of Crash Bandicoot 3, and the idea for that came from Japanese marketers.&nbsp;</p>

While <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-march-21-2025">Amazon US listings are looking amazing</a> with their <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-finally-solves-pokemon-tcg-shortage">Pokémon TCG restocks</a>, Amazon.co.uk has a surprisingly <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uk-deals-im-getting-the-best-pokmon-tcg-sword-and-shield-boosters-at-retail-pricing-on-amazon">healthy stock of booster packs</a>, tins, and collector boxes. Better yet? Amazon UK ships internationally, so even if you're stateside, you can still snag the cards you’re hunting for. Just check the individual product pages to confirm availability and estimated shipping fees.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">UK Deals: Amazon UK Has More Pokémon TCG Stock Than Amazon US </h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Delivery costs vary depending on your location and the product’s weight, but Amazon does the math for you at checkout. You can also get a rough idea by adding the "per delivery" cost and the "per item" or "per kg" charge. Some items may have fixed delivery fees, and customs charges might apply outside the EU. If you're signed in, your Buy Now delivery address determines what’s shippable. Even if you're just browsing, your IP address helps estimate options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's everything that's being sold directly by Amazon UK that includes a booster pack, so no filler "Trainer Academy" boxes or "My First Decks" here. Just pure ripping opportunities for UK residents sorted into catagories because I'm super awesome:</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Elite Trainer Boxes</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I always keep an eye out for Elite Trainer Boxes, and let me tell you, Amazon UK is stacked right now. These things are basically the all-in-one toolkit for any self-respecting collector: packs, sleeves, dice, and a box that won’t immediately fall apart like the drawer I crammed my bulk cards into last year.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Booster Pack Blisters</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think of blisters as the Pokémon TCG equivalent of a Freddo bar. You don’t need it, but it hits the spot (I imagine they cost the same now anyway). They come with a booster, a promo, and a coin that I absolutely don’t need but still get excited about. The selection on Amazon UK is refreshingly normal—no wild markups, no mysteriously “collectible” price tags, just blisters like they’re meant to be.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Booster Bundles and Boxes</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re chasing hits or just want to rip open a stack of packs without stopping to think about life choices, bundles and boxes are the move. I’m talking 6 boosters in the bundles or 36 packs in the booster boxes in one shot. That’s a full night of chaos waiting to happen. Amazon UK actually has these in stock without forcing you to play the “Is this legit?” eBay game too.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Mini Tins</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I have a soft spot for mini tins. They’re tiny, cute, and somehow still feel luxurious. Each one has a couple of packs and an art card, which I absolutely pretend is more valuable than it probably is. Amazon UK has a bunch of them bundled together too, which is great because I never know which one to pick anyway.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Tins </h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The regular-sized tins are where I start getting serious. A minimum of four packs and a promo in a metal box that makes a satisfying clunk when you close it? That’s what I’m here for. I like that I can still find fan-favorite tins on Amazon UK that US listings have either forgotten or priced into oblivion. Charizard fans, you know exactly what I mean.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">V, ex, Super, Collection and Chest Boxes</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I live for big flashy collector boxes. Give me the oversized card, stickers, foil promos I’m scared to look up the value of online. These boxes are like the deluxe edition of Pokémon merch, and I love them for it. Amazon UK has some I haven’t even seen on Amazon US lately, which makes me feel like a proper legend(ary).</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Bundles</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I want it all in one box, and I don’t want to think too hard about it. That’s why the bundle listings on Amazon UK speak to me. It’s like someone read my mind, threw a bunch of tins and blisters together, and said “Here, go wild.” I will Pokémon Company, I will.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><em>God of War is celebrating its 20-year anniversary today, March 22, 2025. Below, we examine how Kratos' character arc has shifted over time to become a timely reflection on masculinity and change.</em></p><p dir="ltr">As much as people remember the brutality and the grandiosity of God of War, as a singular game and as a series, it's easy to forget that the first God of War in 2005 doesn't actually begin with Kratos fighting a hydra and ripping soldiers apart with his bare hands.</p><p dir="ltr">It begins with a suicide attempt. Starting a new game, the very first thing we hear from Kratos is him gravely intoning that "the gods have abandoned me" before walking straight off a cliff into the Aegean Sea. This is a warlord who accidentally murdered his own wife and child, and is then cursed by an oracle to have his family's ashes permanently grafted to his skin, ensuring there is nowhere in Greece he can go where his crimes are unrecognized. The only help he receives is being conscripted by the gods to murder Ares, who set him up to begin with, which isn't really helpful at all. The reward is the gods' forgiveness, which does nothing to alleviate his consistent nightmares about the deed. When blood doesn't grant him peace, the gods give him power, letting him take Ares' place as the Greek God of War, beginning a reign so destructive that almighty Zeus himself has to intervene to take him down. That's before finding out Zeus himself is Kratos' father, and Kratos having his revenge means laying waste to his entire domain. Which Kratos does.</p><p dir="ltr">For a series that built so much of its early reputation on violent catharsis, it always felt ike Sony having their cake and eating it too that Kratos' quests never really get him any real solutions to his pain. Even when he sacrifices himself for a more noble cause in God of War III, spilling blood doesn't fix problems in this series--though it sure feels great in the moment. It all still leads to the desolation of Kratos' homeland, the complete massacre of its pantheon, and he himself doomed to wander the Earth with nothing but his thoughts. If I had a nickel for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-last-of-us-part-2-spoilerfree-review/1900-6417483/">every prestige PlayStation franchise that ended up there</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lbj5C-Sw2_A" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Lbj5C-Sw2_A" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">All of this is a product of the time in which Kratos was born, really. Not as a character, but as a game from 2005, and one that felt like a grim-and-gritty nu-metal take on Greek myth--and two years before Zack Snyder would get there on film, to boot. Kratos' angst is the style of the time, a man who has made horrible, cruel, vicious mistakes, and his rage about that becomes everyone's problem. Everything about Kratos' design is of its place and time, and if there is any enduring lesson from that place and time, it's that hatred and violence can be useful and have their place, but they, in and of themselves, are not solutions. There is no happy ending with just nihilism as a driving force. By definition, it ends with nothing. God of War III just shows us the endpoint. Or, at least, what we thought was the end, before 2018, and Kratos' arc became one of the most beautiful things ever committed to pixels.</p><p dir="ltr">What tends to go forgotten after all these years is that the shift for this character didn't begin in 2018. It began in 2010, when we find out exactly why Zeus felt Kratos needed to die, the first acknowledgement that he himself had started a cycle of violence, creating the precise circumstances where his child, Kratos, would do to him what Zeus did to Kronos. But, again, Zeus still dies in God of War III. One of the unkillable plagues of AAA gaming is the inability for its stories to speak a language that isn't a language of blood, and there was no way to reconcile Kratos with the forces that resulted in his existence except by ensuring Zeus could not inflict more pain on others--not that there was anyone left on Olympus when Kratos was done. The cycle could only have a chance to be broken by taking Greece's #1 abuser out of the equation.</p><p dir="ltr">The thing we never see much of--in real life or in video games--is what awaits on the other side. Revenge is easy to obtain, retribution is easy to imagine, but the thing we don't consider enough in our art is what rehabilitation looks like. What does it mean for someone having done the things Kratos has done to continue to exist, if we are to allow him to exist?</p><p dir="ltr">There's no roadmap for processing the things Kratos has done, the only certainty being that he must carry the unrelenting weight of it. And he does carry it. The Kratos of 2018 is, too, a product of his time. He is heavy, taciturn, all too aware of what his power and anger can bring, trapped alive in a tomb of scars and regrets. It's where the manhood he was created to embody leads. But the singular issue with men knowing their acts have consequences, the innate wrongness of it all, is there is so little that tells them where to go next. That's especially true for Kratos since the one woman who could have guided him a little further down a righteous path has passed away when the new games begin.</p><p dir="ltr">The only light that shines out in that darkness is the fact that Kratos has a son. And in his son, even as he lacks the literal and metaphorical vocabulary to do it, he has but one true north, a realignment of priorities for this kind of narrative: "Don't be sorry. Be better."</p><p dir="ltr">How does Kratos atone? Are the centuries Kratos spends in silent exile enough? Is it enough that he once again loses a wife? The hard answer is that there may never be enough. But the asterisk is that it is good and worthwhile to try.</p><p dir="ltr">Thus begins a story unlike any in all of gaming and at bare minimum rare in all of fiction; the slayer of gods, monsters and men putting something back into the world instead of burning it all down, a father seeing his future reflected in the prism of his child's life, while ever pursued by the distorted Norse funhouse mirror of his past. And even though Kratos takes up the blades again, it is endlessly fascinating that Kratos does not regress. There is brutality still, a wellspring to draw upon when faced with a threat. But the timbre of the violence is different. It is violence attempting to operate without malice. And that's a hard tightrope to walk, one that God of War 2018 and Ragnarok don't always traverse without slipping. But the intent is clear, on the part of the developers, and this character, this man. We must try to be better, even when better is inconvenient.</p><p dir="ltr">Kratos watching himself and his son struggle with power and privilege is wonderful on its own, their journey towards empathy and sympathy for each other, for all they have endured is equally so. But the moment that fully raised Kratos into the rarified air of characters in gaming came later, when the Valhalla DLC for God of War Ragnarok dropped, and Kratos faced his true enemy. Himself.</p><p dir="ltr">Kratos faces his younger self, the bastard who slaughtered by the thousands, bathed in blood and fury, the one who would rather have killed himself than confront his grief and crimes, and the one who came to power he did not deserve or understand. That Kratos. It could have been a final boss. Instead, it is a monologue. Kratos has the vocabulary to face himself.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL9c_A9I2VY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qL9c_A9I2VY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">High-profile games don't reckon with the ramifications of their existence much. It's not fun, or entertaining, or empowering in the traditional sense. And a power trip like 2005's God of War is those three things above all else. But no matter what the medium is, there's a crucial honesty in the idea that the stories we tell each other grow with us, that a tale can mean one thing when you're 20, and something else entirely when you're 40. Where God of War differs is in being one of the few video game characters that has legitimately grown and changed in 20 years. Not after a reboot or redesign, but because the character has had experiences that recontextualize everything he's done. And so, Kratos faces himself.</p><p dir="ltr">"What can I say to you? I remember how it felt to take the throne. All that it meant, and all that it did not. A god of war. A god of pain. Of suffering. Of destruction. The Norns said I chase a redemption that I know I can never deserve. What does that make me? God of fools. A god of...hope. ‘When all else is lost.' You lost everything. And everyone. And you became. There is no forgiving you. You chose. I chose! What now? Should I, this same man…should I sit? Take? Proclaim? Lead? Place myself in service? In service. Should I lose everything and everyone? Will there still be enough left inside so that I do not become you? I do not know. But I have hope. You are cruel, and arrogant, and selfish. But you are more than that. You have always been more than what others saw. You are more than that."</p><p dir="ltr">That monologue represents one of the greatest feats of storytelling in this medium, putting itself in direct dialogue with the game that many of us followed into adulthood, with many of them really. It is a thorough understanding of the power of escapism, the appeal of it, but also its limits, its failures, and ultimately, that it is not enough for any soul that wishes to evolve. For men in particular, the ones for whom Kratos represented a place of violent force unquestioned, for those words to come from a better man is miraculous. And it uses one of gaming's most violent monsters to tell it, without redeeming him, simply showing the path forward, the way to wield power and privilege. There is no arc like this in the wider landscape of gaming. And that, more than any blessing from the gods, will make Kratos truly immortal.</p>

<p>What have you been playing this week?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TSBonyman’s</strong> wait for Atomfall was broken by grabbing The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, the Smash TV clone Deathrun TV, and the platforming puzzler The Last Shot. That should keep him busy this weekend, until Atomfall arrives next week.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s the round up for this week. Hope you have a great weekend ahead!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-blood-and-zeal-review-all-zealots<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Kill Team</em> 2024 continues with the release of its second expansion set, Blood and Zeal. Following the same format as previous expansions, we're treated to 2 brand new kill teams, both sharing religious zealotry but to very different gods. In this article, we'll take a look at both kill teams and what else Blood and Zeal adds to your games.</p>

<p><em>Kill Team</em> is a skirmish wargame set in Games Workshop's larger <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> setting. As a skirmish game, <em>Kill Team</em> features a small number of elite troops, fighting special operations battles, rather than huge battles fought with entire armies. We've covered <em>Kill Team</em> in depth since the first edition, and you can read our review of the current <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">Starter Set</a> here.</p>




<h2>All The Fanatics All The Time</h2>

<p><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Blood and Zeal, as with previous expansions, adds 2 brand new kill teams and some scenery that builds on that from the Hivestorm box, but rather than new missions, it has the Blood and Zeal mission pack to expand your games. The full box contents are:</p>

<ul><li><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Blood and Zeal&nbsp;Dossier</li>
	<li>8x Goremongers</li>
	<li>11x Sanctifiers</li>
	<li>Datacards for both kill teams</li>
	<li>Tokens for both kill teams</li>
	<li>Blood and Zeal Mission Pack Card Set</li>
	<li>A large Shrine Statue scenery piece</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-blood-and-zeal-4.jpg?itok=PD0g1vxH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-blood-and-zeal-4.jpg?itok=r57ShW_W 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kill Team</em> Blood and Zeal includes a new style of mission pack with the Blood and Zeal card pack.</figcaption></figure><h2>Different Flavours Of Zeal</h2>

<p>Instead of the usual mission pack with linked scenarios,&nbsp;<em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Blood and Zeal adds a mission pack card deck to existing scenarios, putting the Shrine Statue in the centre of the board. The mission pack card deck has cards of 2 different types, and players can choose which deck to draw from. Cards are drawn at the start of each strategy phase, when your opponent scores a VP, or if you interact (praying or defiling) with the Shrine Statue.</p>

<p>Cards can then be played during the turn, with blood cards offering an offensive bonus like the Double Fight/Shoot card, which lets you immediately repeat a fight or shoot acction, and zeal cards offer a defensive bonus, like the Obscured card, which makes an operative targeted by a ranged attack more than 6 inches away obscured, reducing the hits by 1 and protecting them from critical hits.</p>

<p>At the end of the game, both players total up their used blood and zeal cards, and the player with the most of either, scores 1VP. The Blood and Zeal mission pack can put real pressure on during the game, as your opponent gains a card every time you score VP, giving them an edge as you never know what ability they've drawn, along with securing them a possible extra 2VP at the end if you've given them a lot of cards to use. It also draws combat to the Shrine Statue as both players try to control it to stop the other from drawing more cards.</p>

<p>The Sanctifiers are ad-hoc units of zealots of the Imperial Creed, brought together by their faith, they join crusades with other forces of the Imperium or begin their own. The Sanctifiers have the Sermon special rule, that if played as a Strategic Gambit, one of their fighters gains the Orator keyword, which allows nearby units to benefit from the Sermon. Anyone benefiting from the Sermon takes 1 less damage from damage of 3 or more.</p>

<p>Each band is led by a Confessor, who, if is the Orator, can use the Lead the Procession special rule, which gives all nearby friendly units a free charge, fallback, or reposition action if the Confessor takes one of those actions, which can result in a particular devastating charge if you have a load of powerful units bunched up together.</p>

<p>The Confessors are backed up by Perscutors who wield oversized chainweapons, and Conflagrators, who dual-wield hand flamers. They can also deploy Miraculists, who have a single-use but very powerful Holy Light attack and can lay down psychic fire on nearby foes. To back them all up, you can take 2 Missionaries, who carry the heavy weapons like standard flamers, plasma and melta guns, but also have access to the Brazier of Holy Fire, which can be used as a short ranged, or melee weapon, and benefits from the Blaze special rule that sets targets on fire, dealing D3 damage whenever they activate until they put it out.</p>

<p>You can feel the fanatical zeal when using them. They're very close combat orientated, with short ranged weapons and melee armaments all round. They also mostly like to hang around in packs to benefit from the Sermon, except the Missionaries who's thematic 'Spread the word of the God-Emperor' ability gives their weapons severe if they're 6 inches away from other friendly operatives, and the Micaculists, who's Holy Light doesn't care who it burns.</p>

<p>The Goremongers are a different breed of fanatic. Like all followers of the Blood God, Khorne, they want to spill blood in his name. But these mortal followers are a further step into madness, having fought beside or seen the demonic followers of their god, and an obsession born of that experience pushes them further. Their cult starts with replacing their legs with bionic replacements and then installing tanks on their backs that carry a mix of blood and stimms that drive them and their augmetics.</p>

<p>These tanks give the Goremongers access to the Sanguavitae special rule, which lets them deplete their gore tank for special abilities. They have access to healing, increased action points, double fight actions, D3 extra damage on a charge, increased movement, and extra attacks. Tanks can carry a maximum of 2 uses and need to be topped up by taking out enemy fighters. This means that the Goremongers will do well against kill teams with lots of low wound fighters, but not so well against elites or durable fighters, and even worse against elite, durable kill teams like the Plague Marines.</p>

<p>As might be expected from a kill team that refills the blood tanks on their backs with their slain enemies, they like to get in close, which means most operatives are limited to wilding an autopistol (the Inciter wields 2!), but this is just to give you options, if you're shooting you're doing it wrong. The kill team is led by the Blood Herald, who can refill their gore tank for free if it's empty, thanks to their Khorne's Favour ability. They can also ignore the entirety of an attack once per battle.</p>

<p>The rest of the kill team is made up of an expected mix of bloodthirsty, melee-focused fighters. The Bloodtaker can fill their gore tank just by damaging enemies and can also transfer that blood to nearby friendly fighters' gore tanks. The Impaler is armed with a Fleshskewer that can drag enemies and choose not to inflict damage so that you can finish them off in combat, and the Inciter, who wields 2 autopistols, can also use them in close combat to make sure they're still taking the blood tithe.</p>

<p><em>Kill Team</em> Blood and Zeal is another great thematic box for <em>Kill Team</em>. The focus on getting up close and taking names works really well. The Blood and Zeal mission pack adds a new dynamic to the game, and while not balanced enough for competitive play, it gives a great narrative experience. The combination of Blood cards and the Goremongers Sanguavitae abilities can lead to some absolutely insane attacks. The Shrine Statue is an awesome scenery piece, and while it's nice to get functional scenery, having great-looking centerpieces is awesome too.</p>

<p>In a recent seminar at GDC, Cameron Williams, formerly of Rockstar Games, offered a walkthrough of the issues plaguing open-world games. Williams has since relocated, taking his talents to Absurd Ventures, the studio founded by Dan Houser, but he has previously worked on Grand Theft Auto 6 and Red Dead Online.</p>



<p>He stressed that large open worlds with too much content are leading to analysis paralysis and preventing players from wanting to actively explore. The worlds we’re experiencing these days are so expansive and the incentives for travelling vast distances and covering all the bases just aren’t enough anymore. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-an-impossible-task">‘An Impossible Task’</h2>



<p>In a panel discussion covered by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/players-dont-explore-former-grand-theft-auto-6-and-red-dead-online-designer-lays-out-the-perils-of-open-world-fatigue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> at GDC, Absurd Ventures’ Cameron Williams took a deep dive into one of the most talked-about issues with open-world games. In his words, they’re becoming too big and diverse, presenting players with so many options that they simply cannot choose what to do next.</p>



<p>This is something that the team at Absurd Ventures is actively trying to avoid.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Players just don’t explore, right?</p>



<p>Whether they just simply aren’t compelled or your game has a huge time investment and it’s hard for players to pick up and put down, which is an increasing challenge, especially with the sort of evolving ecosystem of free-to-play and live service games that are kind of eating everyone’s time and attention.</p>



<p>They’re wondering, ‘Okay, how far away is the next thing? I really gotta run all the way across the map? And what’s my gain?</p>



<p>We want to avoid creating a possibility space so large that <strong>players simply just don’t know what to choose</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s something I covered in my recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review/">review of Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, which is a great game but suffers from the open-world fatigue that Williams is referring to. The objectives are far too spaced apart and the world is enormous, which makes it a chore to navigate, leaving players to rely on fast-travel mechanics far too often.</p>



<p>These games can be hellish for what Williams dubbed ‘beeliners’ – players who want to go from A to B with as little interference as possible. They’re the gamers who don’t have time to waste on side content and tertiary missions and want to explore a story and hang up their hat.</p>



<p>Do you think open-world games are becoming far too bloated for the average gamer to enjoy? Let me know what you think in the comments.</p>

<p>Battlefield leaks are still flowing thick and fast from the latest round of testing sessions, and in the freshest drops, an all-new map has been revealed. It’s called Battery, and per the reports, it’s a dense urban map themed on Gibraltar, which was a location given away in early concept art for the game.</p>



<p>A series of gameplay clips from Battery have leaked on Reddit. They showcase the new map and some Conquest action – check out the links below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-new-norm">The New Norm</h2>



<p>Many have theorised that Electronic Arts <em><span>all</span>ows </em>these leaks to flow from the Battlefield Labs tests, as it’s effectively free publicity. The consensus so far has been that the next Battlefield game looks <strong>good</strong>, even at this alpha stage. It looks like a throwback to the peaks of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-leaks-reveal-battlefield-4-vibe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4</a>, which is great news for those more veteran of the series.</p>



<p>In the latest Battlefield leaks, we’re given a look at Battery, a packed urban map with tight streets and tall buildings. It’s the kind of map that fosters intense destruction, close-quarters combat, and kill boxes for vehicles, but it looks great at first blush.</p>



<p>The best look at Battery comes courtesy of user TooFlu2, who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1jguiic/gameplay_from_the_new_battlefield_labs_map_and/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">uploaded a two-minute clip</a> to the Battlefield subreddit.</p>



<p>In another post, user eggdrums115 uploaded <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1jgofni/first_overview_of_new_map_battery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a picture of Battery’s tac-map</a>, which shows you just how tight-knit the environment will be.</p>



<p>The more talked-about features pop up again in this gameplay snippet, such as players having the ability to pull downed teammates out of the line of fire. It’s also a showcase for the convention military mechanics that are set to feature in the next Battlefield game – gone are the futuristic gadgets, robot dogs, and wingsuits.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the next Battlefield game? Have the leaks filled you with hope that it will finally deliver when it’s ultimately released? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> OG mode is taking another step toward the present very soon--<strong>Season 3 starts on March 25</strong>, taking us back to the season that kicked off way back in February of 2018. While Fortnite OG has waned in popularity a bit recently, one of the big reasons for that is that Fortnite changed very little during those original two seasons, so this nostalgic mode didn't get to do much differently either. Season 3, however, is where things began ramping up. The game's overall storyline made its very first appearance when a large meteor appeared over the island midway through the season.</p><p dir="ltr">With just days remaining before the next round of Fortnite's throwback party begins, let's take a look at everything we know about Fortnite OG Season 3.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_OG_Season_3_teaser">Fortnite OG Season 3 teaser</h2><p>Epic has dropped a single teaser for OG Season 3, which shows an astronaut helmet with the Fortnite island visible in the reflection--along with the meteor above it. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DHdzbgTMbcX/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The TikTok and Instagram versions of the teaser</a> are the most illuminating versions, as they reveal that the astronaut is wearing a studded leather jacket. There aren't any skins that wore anything like that from Season 3, battle pass or otherwise, but our Metallica-themed remix of Rust from Chapter 5 Season 3 did. Regardless, I doubt that thing is spaceworthy, but Fortnite isn't concerned with such things.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_OG_Pass_Season_3">Fortnite OG Pass Season 3</h2><p>The first two OG passes have included three new skins that are remixes of existing skins that first appeared during the original seasons. Each pass had two remixes of old pass skins and one remix of a shop skin, though it should be noted that they had to do it that way for those seasons because they didn't have many skins--the Season 1 shop only had two, and the Season 2 battle pass only had three knights and Sparkle Specialist.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463354-fortniteseason3bp.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463354" data-ratio="0.55826771653543" data-width="1270" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463354-fortniteseason3bp.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463354"></a><figcaption>The original Season 3 pass, pictured here, will heavily inspire the OG Pass.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463354-fortniteseason3bp.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Season 3 battle pass, by contrast, had six skins--Rust Lord, Elite Agent, The Reaper (Fortnite-brand John Wick), and three astronauts. They could make three distinct skins from that group, but on the shop side of things, Season 3 did introduce Raven--and Epic loves doing new versions of Raven almost as much as it likes doing new versions of Midas.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_OG_Season_3_map">Fortnite OG Season 3 map</h2><p dir="ltr">Not much changed between Season 2 and 3, as you can see--the Season 3 map is almost identical to the Season 2 island that's on the way out. But that teaser including the meteor could be hinting that we'll start in the middle. As the end of the season approached, and the meteor came along with it, small pieces of the meteor kept falling off and damaging the island every match, and that's exactly the sort of shakeup feature that the OG mode could use. Since Epic has typically not done many in-season map changes in the OG mode, would anybody be upset if they jumped straight to that part?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463352-fortniteogseason3map.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463352" data-ratio="1" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463352-fortniteogseason3map.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463352"></a><figcaption>Fortnite OG's presumed Season 3 map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463352-fortniteogseason3map.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Fortnite_OG_Season_3_loot_pool">Fortnite OG Season 3 loot pool</h2><p dir="ltr">Most of the current OG loot pool will stick around for Season 3, but this season introduced a variety of interesting new weapons and gadgets that you will very likely see in the new OG season.</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Hand cannon</li><li dir="ltr">Crossbow</li><li dir="ltr">Guided missile</li><li dir="ltr">Egg launcher</li><li dir="ltr">Port-a-fort</li><li dir="ltr">Remote explosives</li><li dir="ltr">Clingers</li></ul>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/inzoi/" data-ref-id="5000-610765">InZoi</a>, the first real attempt ever to compete with The Sims in the life sim space, is here, releasing via Steam Early Access, and it's only natural that players will spend their first several hours in the game creating their characters and messing around in build mode to see what kinds of dollhouses they can assemble. There's no point in jumping into the simulation until you've got everything else in order.</p><p>For those Sims players who are eager to see what InZoi's got that The Sims doesn't, be warned that InZoi's build mode has a few big quirks that you'll need to learn about before you get started, or else you might accidentally rip the walls out of your house while you're trying to make it bigger. Fortunately, we've got you covered with our InZoi build mode guide.</p><h2>How InZoi's home-building gameplay differs from the Sims</h2><p>If you're coming to InZoi from The Sims 4, you'll probably be used to a build mode in which everything is one context-sensitive click away. Clicking on an object picks it up; clicking on a wall lets you move it to expand or contract the room it's containing. You just click on what you want to manipulate, and then you manipulate it. InZoi's build mode is slightly more complicated than that, thanks largely to the fact that it has more customization options--but there are some fundamental differences from The Sims that will probably trip you up at first.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463269-inxoibuildmode2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463269" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463269-inxoibuildmode2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463269"></a><figcaption>InZoi's build mode will be familiar to Sims fans, but it has several unique aspects to it.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463269-inxoibuildmode2.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr"><span>The first of these big differences is that you need to choose the right selection mode. By default, your cursor is using the standard "</span><strong>Selection Tool</strong><span>," which lets you click on and manipulate individual objects, like your couch. When you're in the mode, moving a wall will move </span><em>only</em><span> the wall--the room the wall belonged to won't change aside from no longer having a wall. If you want to change the size of a room, or make your house bigger, you'll instead need to choose the </span><strong>Room Selection Tool</strong><span>, which you can find on the build mode options bar near the top of the UI, immediately to the right of the standard Selection Tool.</span></h3><p dir="ltr">It's in that part of Build Mode--the part where you're dealing with furniture, appliances, and anything else you might put in your house--where you'll find another quirk you'll need to remember. In InZoi, you can customize your furniture just as deeply as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-make-custom-clothes-and-furniture-in-inzoi/1100-6530233/" data-ref-id="1100-6530233">you can customize your clothing</a>, but you can only do so <em>after</em> you have placed the item in question. So you would, say, pick a couch you like from the build menu, place it in your home, and click on it to bring up the option to customize it--then you'll be presented with a pile of options for texture and color, and you can upload your own texture images yourself if you want, or use InZoi's built-in AI image generator to make one. If you want all your furniture to be covered in pictures of your dog, you can do that.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463268-inzoiroomselectionmode.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463268" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463268-inzoiroomselectionmode.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463268"></a><figcaption>You'd better get used to swapping between the Selection Tool and the Room Selection Tool, because you're going to do it a lot.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463268-inzoiroomselectionmode.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This after-the-fact customization causes no issues for things like your refrigerator, but since everything you can place in build mode works the same way, there are certain things where this becomes a problem. For example, if you want to add a staircase that turns 180 degrees halfway up, you'll have to place a full straight flight of stairs first and then bend it afterward. Since the purpose of such a staircase is to save on the horizontal space that the staircase takes up, having it work this way defeats that purpose because you have to make room for the full normal staircase anyway. You'll have to exercise a bit of cleverness to deal with this issue when it arises.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you understand these two basic aspects, most builders will be ready to go in InZoi; build mode is otherwise largely similar to that of The Sims but with a redesigned UI. But we'd be remiss if we forgot to point out one other strange thing about InZoi's build mode that has no equivalent in The Sims.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463270-2025-03-21-14-55-02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463270" data-ratio="0.56288478452067" data-width="2274" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463270-2025-03-21-14-55-02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4463270"></a><figcaption>The ersatz apartment building where my Zois live</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4463270-2025-03-21-14-55-02.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When I set up my first Zoi family, I put them in what looks like the first floor of a small apartment building in Dowon, which you can see above--it has a communal space with a gym on the ground floor, with three floors of living space above it. My family lived on the first of those floors, but I soon realized that I had no neighbors, and there was no access point for the upper two floors.</p><p dir="ltr">The whole building belonged to my family, and I just had to build new staircases to get up there--I had three times more space to work with than I'd thought, and my small apartment turned into a large house in minutes. It was a pretty surprising development since this is not how a building like this works in real life, and the game had made no attempt to tell me that I could do that. This is something to keep in mind when you start feeling like your family needs more space--you might already have it.</p><p dir="ltr">InZoi launches in Early Access on Steam on March 27 for $40. Until the game officially launches, players can download the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-an-inzoi-creative-studio-key-for-the-demo/1100-6530268/" data-ref-id="1100-6530268">InZoi Creative Studio</a> for free. Through the 22nd, you'll unlock access by watching InZoi streams on Twitch or the game's Steam store page. Starting on the 23rd, the Creative Studio will be available to download on Steam without requiring any tasks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/bleach-rebirth-of-souls-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">So far it feels like this anime arena fighter's combat and story mode were made in different rooms.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Editor's Note: This initial review in progress is based only on the PlayStation 5 version so far, with the PC version </em><a href="https://x.com/BLEACH_game_en/status/1903117822466855006" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>experiencing launch issues</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Bleach is the flashiest member of the shonen anime “big three,” standing shoulder to shoulder with mega popular series like One Piece and Naruto, it has long suffered from middle child syndrome when it comes to arena fighter adaptations. Bleach Rebirth of Souls aims to break the cycle of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/anime-deserves-more-than-run-of-the-mill-arena-fighters"><u>run-of-the-mill anime fighters</u></a> this series has previously been part of, delivering a unique action game that attempts to raise the genre to greater heights. Even though I still have a lot left to play before my final review, having only spent 10 hours with it since I received review code just before the Ultimate Edition went live yesterday, it's evident that developer Tamsoft has a deep respect for the anime. Every detail of its crisp character models is meticulously crafted, and the combat feels like it's been lifted straight out of the show, with a depth that begs to be explored. However, the story mode, where I’ve spent most of my time so far, plays like a laughable attempt at a visual novel that was hobbled together as a last-second afterthought.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bleach Rebirth of Souls opens with a tutorial that puts its best foot forward – its combat. It’s easy to get overloaded with a bunch of confusing anime jargon as it explains how its health bar, counters, and super moves work, but here’s the quick way to understand things: This is a 3D arena fighter with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/12/06/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review">Super Smash Bros.</a>’s life stock system, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/21/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-review">Sekiro</a>’s stance-breaking swordplay, and Bleach’s unique visual flair. Unlike other arena fighters, which often have combat so shallow you only need to find a single combo or spam super moves to win matches, Bleach's combat feels like a challenging game of tug-of-war – one where victories are clinched rather than mindlessly stomped out of opponents.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Bleach Rebirth of Souls Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Each sword swing feels snappy and weighty as you teleport around the screen, ambushing your enemies from behind and breaking their guard. It never gets old to see large blocks of text wrap around freeze-framed characters with every successfully landed counter and super move. Even when you play Rebirth of Souls on its Standard Mode button layout, which streamlines things by letting you dish out flashy auto combos, it still harbors complex and unique mechanics specific to each character that warrant further exploration. That could be Uryu's long-ranged bow attacks  or Yoruichi's in-your-face brawler style. Variety like that is important as I both decide on a main and try to understand how to defeat different characters. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a massive fan of the anime and manga's stunning artistry, stirring character development, and shocking plot twists, I had high hopes that Rebirth of Souls could deliver a worthwhile story mode. Sadly, I’ve been disappointed big time. By and large, cutscenes in an anime fighter should act as a sparkly reward at the end of battle, meant to bring the momentum of a fight to a thrilling climax. Cutscenes in the story modes of Naruto and Dragon Ball Z’s games are sometimes so well animated that they could serve as a substitute for watching the actual shows. That is not the case with Bleach. If anything, they nearly bring things to a screeching and embarrassing halt. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The look of its combat may have a lot of tender love and care put into it, but the story moments between that action instead play out like a cheap visual novel. Outside of a few pre-rendered cutscenes, the SparkNotes version of the anime this story mode attempts to tell is a rushed, hobbled mess. Instead of being greeted by bombastic scenes where my favorite characters clash, I was met with Machinima-looking animations where in-game models would fart out energy waves at each other and stiffly fall to the ground. Even the emotionally heady scenes lose all sense of tension as its characters move around like clumsy action figures with limited points of articulation in bright, low-poly arenas. What's more, exciting moments like sword clashes and beam struggles lose all of their gravitas as these scenes incessantly cut to black with bright slashes on the screen that look less like a creative choice for dramatic effect and more like a placeholder for an animation that wasn’t added in time. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Combat's vibrant sword slashes feel at odds with the unevenly crafted cutscenes.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If this was a genuine attempt to resemble a visual novel, it definitely missed the mark, as it feels more like an unfinished first draft – and with review codes arriving so close to launch, it’s hard not to see this as an intentional hope that fans will buy-in based solely on the goodwill of the franchise. Which is a shame, because both its English and Japanese voice cast are putting in work with their vocal performances and the character models are faithful recreations that do look great in action. As if Bandai Namco took pointers from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhndpv7sEqE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Invincible season 2’s joke</u></a> about how animators cut corners to make more scenes, Rebirth of Souls put all of its focus on the fights, and every moment outside of them looks like a fan-made animators first crack at recreating the anime as a result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But although the story mode has yet to wow me in the 10 hours I’ve spent with it so far, there’s still more to play with — namely, the online and offline versus mode — before I can settle on a final verdict. As it stands right now, Bleach Rebirth of Souls’ combat goes above and beyond a run-of-the-mill anime arena fighter, with a dense battle system and tons of love put into making each of its characters feel unique. That makes it all the more disappointing that its crisp character models, vibrant sword slashes, and stylish typography accompanying each super move feel wholly at odds with the animation in its unevenly crafted cutscenes. Instead of making me want to play through the anime’s sprawling story myself, it's only encouraged me to revisit the source material so that the emotional climaxes actually land. But despite not delivering on that lofty promise, I’m keen to see if the versus modes will pick up the slack as I work toward my final review.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But Apple’s upcoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296445/mythic-quest-season-4-premiere-date-side-quest">spinoff series <em>Side Quest</em></a> will give us a much better look at what the game looks like from within.</p><p>While some of <em>Side Quest</em>’s four episodes focus on people’s lives outside of and away from <em>Mythic Quest</em>, the final episode, titled “The Last Raid,” takes place within the fictional MMORPG and follows high schoolers Devon (Van Crosby), Kelly (Melanie Brook), Rory (Alice Wen), Seth (David Andrew Calvillo), and Freddie (Justin Jarzombek) setting out to fight powerful bosses. In this exclusive clip from the episode, the kids have been playing <em>Mythic Quest </em>for years and made an annual tradition of taking on big raids to commemorate becoming friends in the game.</p><p>“The Last Raid” makes <em>Mythic Quest </em>(the game) look a bit like a dated <em>World of Warcraft </em>clone compared to cutscenes from <em>Mythic Quest</em>’s (the series) more recent seasons. But the episode, and the rest of <em>Side Quest</em>, may offer a better sense of what keeps players returning to <em>Mythic Quest</em>.</p><p>The entire season hits Apple TV Plus on March 26th.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
