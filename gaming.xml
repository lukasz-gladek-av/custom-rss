That's pretty great, all things considered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Riot and UVS Games' <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/riftbound-league-of-legends-where-to-buy">Riftbound League of Legends TCG</a> fresh on the Western market after just launching a few of weeks ago, taking advantage of this promotion is a great way to pick up singles and build your decks with all upside incentives. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sealed Riftbound product has been fairly hard to come by for consumers, but for those of you lucky enough to get your hands on cards and follow the metagame, we've picked out 10 cards you should have on your radar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And with Riftbound's second set, Spiritforged, scheduled for English release in February of 2026, there's ample time to pick up the cards you need for your deck and get the most out of them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Read on for detailed breakdowns of our picks, listed from least expensive to most expensive. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I wanted to focus on metagame staples some players might not have on their radar, as well as some cheaper alternatives mixed with high-end late-game bombs. </p><p id="stacked-deck"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Stacked Deck">Stacked Deck</h2></p><div catalogid="a8bd2389-2562-406f-8119-f230fbc458d6" id="230459"><div id="230459" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Stacked Deck</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the few draw spells in the game so far, this is an easy three-of in any Chaos (purple) deck. It's single Energy cost without having to recycle Runes is an extremely valuable rate both on turn one and in the late game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's going for around $5-$6, so as an uncommon it's a bit pricey. </p></div><p id="tasty-faefolk"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Tasty Faefolk">Tasty Faefolk</h2></p><div catalogid="a8bd2389-2562-406f-8119-f230fbc458d6" id="230460"><div id="230460" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Tasty Faefolk</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Tasty Faefolk sees play in most Calm (green) decks. It's a great late-game finisher on a budget, currently sitting at around $7. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I might not play three of these due to its high cost, but it depends on the deck it's slotted in. </p></div><p id="darius-trifarian"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Darius Trifarian">Darius Trifarian</h2></p><div catalogid="a8bd2389-2562-406f-8119-f230fbc458d6" id="230461"><div id="230461" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Darius Trifarian</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Darius is a considerably good mid-game drop in Fury (red) decks. Midrange strategies like Sett the Boss will often play a copy or two, and you'll likely see him taking up space in the top-tier <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmOgRq?object_uuid=25314409-5722-4403-88c9-ff0d1ee5977d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kai'sa, Daughter of the Void</a> decks as well. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At $10, it's reasonably priced for a powerful effect. </p></div><p id="falling-star"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Falling Star">Falling Star</h2></p><div catalogid="a8bd2389-2562-406f-8119-f230fbc458d6" id="230462"><div id="230462" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Falling Star</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Kai'sa, Falling Star is another card this deck typically considers including three copies of. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The two Power, two Energy cost disrupts your tempo a bit, but it can be an extremely efficient boardwipe in a pinch. I'd also consider playing this in any other red deck like <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN8Ard?object_uuid=25314409-5722-4403-88c9-ff0d1ee5977d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Jinx, Loose Cannon</a>, especially at the reasonably-priced $13. </p></div><p id="baited-hook"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Baited Hook">Baited Hook</h2></p><div catalogid="a8bd2389-2562-406f-8119-f230fbc458d6" id="230463"><div id="230463" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Baited Hook</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Veteran Magic: The Gathering players will recognize this as Riftbound's answer to <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDrx2X?object_uuid=25314409-5722-4403-88c9-ff0d1ee5977d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Birthing Pod</a>. It's a great combo card that pairs nicely with cards like <a href="https://zdcs.link/9215M1?object_uuid=25314409-5722-4403-88c9-ff0d1ee5977d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Machine Evangel</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In go-wide strategies like <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBD37v?object_uuid=25314409-5722-4403-88c9-ff0d1ee5977d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Viktor, Herald of the Arcane</a>, Baited Hook can be a great finisher if you're able to stomach the $37 price tag. </p></div><p id="master-yi"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Master Yi">Master Yi</h2></p><div catalogid="a8bd2389-2562-406f-8119-f230fbc458d6" id="230464"><div id="230464" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Master Yi</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the strongest Legends in the game so far, Master Yi, Wuju Bladesman's $38 cost is due to both his popularity and scarcity. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can only get him in the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gjgwy?object_uuid=25314409-5722-4403-88c9-ff0d1ee5977d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Proving Grounds</a> box (as well as three other exclusive Legends), and getting your hands on that is currently a bit of a chore. But if you're looking to quickly build the second-best meta deck, singles are readily available. </p></div><p id="thousand-tailed-watcher"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Thousand-Tailed Watcher">Thousand-Tailed Watcher</h2></p><div catalogid="a8bd2389-2562-406f-8119-f230fbc458d6" id="230465"><div id="230465" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Thousand-Tailed Watcher</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the best cards in the game as a whole, every Mind (blue) deck will consider auto-including three of these, even with its high cost. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thousand-Tailed Watcher is incredible late game finisher to score your last points, and strategizing your Battlefields and units in conjunction with it will mean the difference between victory and defeat. Because of this, it's currently sitting at around $40. </p></div><p id="dazzling-aurora"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Dazzling Aurora">Dazzling Aurora</h2></p><div catalogid="a8bd2389-2562-406f-8119-f230fbc458d6" id="230466"><div id="230466" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Dazzling Aurora</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the only cards in Riftbound Origins I would consider borderline unfair and actually broken, Dazzling Gleam is an incredibly powerful finisher in decks like Master Yi ramp. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its nine Energy cost is worth considering, but spitting out massive Units like <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWEDgn?object_uuid=25314409-5722-4403-88c9-ff0d1ee5977d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Deadbloom Predator</a> for free will quickly win the game, especially since not many decks run much Gear removal. </p></div><p id="kaisa-survivor"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Kai'sa Survivor">Kai'sa Survivor</h2></p><div catalogid="a8bd2389-2562-406f-8119-f230fbc458d6" id="230467"><div id="230467" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Kai'sa Survivor</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The end-all, tier-1 meta deck in Riftbound Origins. Her aggressive cost mixed with her extremely powerful effect ensures she sees play in most red decks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're running Kai'Sa, Daughter of the Void as your Legend, playing three Kai'Sa Survivor is a no-brainer. That is, of course, if you're able to get your hands on three copies. She's currently sitting around $73, so I wouldn't blame you if you found some budget replacements. </p></div><p id="time-warp"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Time Warp">Time Warp</h2></p><div catalogid="a8bd2389-2562-406f-8119-f230fbc458d6" id="230468"><div id="230468" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Time Warp</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally, I'm not the biggest fan of extra turn effects in TCG's, since they often give an unfair edge when used. Regardless, Riftbound's Time Warp is an extremely powerful, high-cost effect that is the metagame's current most expensive staple, sitting at around $86-$90. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most blue decks run at least one of these, so it may be worth it to pick up a single copy to build up store credit. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">More Riftbound Cards to Keep an Eye On</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, these aren't the only format staples or expensive cards Riftbound has to offer in its over 300-card Origins set. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are dozens of much more expensive alternate versions of many Legends and Champions, and more metagame staples that will break the bank a bit. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But if you're more interested in the collector value of these cards over their competitive use, we have a list of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-origins-most-expensive-cards">15 most expensive Riftbound cards</a> you can buy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also have a handy <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/riftbound-league-of-legends-where-to-buy">buying guide</a> if you're new to Riftbound. While sealed product can be hard to find right now and price hikes are rampant, but knowing what's available is always a good move when a new TCG launches. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">TCGplayer Subscription</h2></div><div catalogid="0cc34152-a4aa-4aaf-8c84-5d8a17b23349" id="231794"><div id="231794" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>(Up to 15% Cashback for Cyber Weekend) Free Shipping and up to 3% Cashback on orders over $35</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>TCGPlayer Subscription</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Free Shipping and up to 3% Cashback on orders over $35</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're planning on snapping up quite a few Pokémon cards in the sale, this is a great time to become a <a href="https://zdcs.link/9l2Emr?object_uuid=25314409-5722-4403-88c9-ff0d1ee5977d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TCGplayer subscriber</a>.

But Team Cherry did tease it will feature the Steel Assassin, a character shown in a prior trailer but who has yet to show up in Silksong itself. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the relevant exchange with Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier:</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Do you want to do a mix of smaller updates like Lifeblood, or are you thinking bigger stuff like Godmaster and Grimm Troupe? Is there a cadence you have in mind?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gibson:</strong> In simple terms yes, we’d be thinking about different things arriving at different scales. That might mean larger things like Godmaster. Certainly, we’ve noticed that people would like an expansion in that way, being able to enter pantheon spaces and refight bosses. And there is already a huge number of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pellen:</strong> We were talking about the next project in general. We’re not thinking about the size. We just started making new stuff and working on bits and pieces. We’re still in this world, thinking about stuff to present to people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gibson:</strong> It is interesting working out how you expand an already huge game, to make sure you don’t completely overwhelm new players, because obviously new players will be experiencing the new stuff, very naturally integrated. It’ll just seem like the base experience. Some of that might mean finding ways to hide away the access, because otherwise potentially by the end of the our expansions and developments it would just be gargantuan.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hollow Knight: Silksong Release Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Silksong remains one of the most-played games on Steam following its huge September 4 release.

<p>Hypixel Studios confirmed the news earlier today via the official&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em><a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-early-access-january-13-2026" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, on which it was revealed that the game will be launching into Early Access on PC on January 13th. Pre-orders will begin on December 13th.</p>

<p>Despite that, Hypixel says you shouldn't pre-order the game "if you don't feel comfortable" doing so. The studio is clear on the fact that&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>will very much be an Early Access release, which means it'll be "unfinished" and "buggy for a while". Caveat emptor, and all that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hytale-early-access-release-date-bugs.jpg?itok=etey4Iqv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hytale-early-access-release-date-bugs.jpg?itok=LvScV7nC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll do more than your fair share of running away from bugs, as it were, in&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>in January.</figcaption></figure><p>In the post, Hypixel reiterates what it said last week as part of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hytale-rescued-early-access-soon" rel="nofollow">its announcement</a> that&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>had been revived, namely that the game will follow "the original vision from the 2018 trailer" and that the developer will be "returning to a four-year-old legacy build that had been abandoned".</p>

<p>As such, "some parts of the game will feel behind" when it launches in January, but despite that, Hypixel says "momentum is strong", so you can expect plenty of updates and communication from the developer throughout the Early Access period.</p>

<p>If you're the kind of person who wants to mod&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>to make it your own, then you'll be pleased to know modding and creative tools will be available on day one of Early Access, even though they're "not where [Hypixel wants] them long term".</p>

<p>Hypixel closes by warning players that the Early Access build of&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>will be "rough", but promises that "the path ahead matters more". It seems like it really is important to set your expectations accordingly here.</p>




<p><em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>began life as a custom&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>server before being spun off into its own entity in 2018, with&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>'s Riot Games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/riot-games-hytale-acqusition-adds-blocky-adventure-to-roster" rel="nofollow">stepping in to purchase Hypixel</a> in 2020.</p>

<p>However, the partnership between Hypixel and Riot ended earlier this year when the latter <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hytale-canceled-dev-shuts-down" rel="nofollow">shut down the former</a> and seemingly canceled&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em>, although the game has since risen from the ashes under the stewardship of some of the original server's co-founders.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>when it launches on PC via Early Access on January 13th next year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

              <p>Black Friday is a great time to stock up on essentials, plus treat yourself to purchases that are a little hard to justify during the rest of the year. We’re spotting hundreds of discounts across almost every single category you could think of, including games. Titles have dropped in prices, and so have the consoles.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to surprise your little ones with something that gets them moving in your living room, we might have just found the best gaming deal of the season. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6060/">Nex Playground — a cube-like console — is currently sitting at $199 on Amazon, after a 20% discount on its close to $250 price tag</a>. You’ll also get $25 back in Amazon credit with your purchase, which brings the total down even further. Note that both discounts are only valid till supplies last, and that might not be long. To avoid any last-minute disappointments, it’s best to get your orders in fast.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6060/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Interactive Motion Games</h2>
<p>Nex Playground looks quite like a mini projector, but in a fun way. It connects to your TV and lets you play interactive motion games using just your body. There are no controllers needed, as the built-in wide-angle camera uses AI to scan your movements to register them in games on its own.</p>
<p>Multiplayer setup is supported. Up to four people can hop in at the same time to get some workout in. Five games are packed for free, including Fruit Ninja, Starri, Whac-a-Mole, Go Keeper, and Party Fowl; showcase your chopping skills with the fast movement of arms, or put that adrenaline to good use by nailing down as many moles as you can. For a bit more variety, you can purchase a 3-Month or 12-Month Play Pass, both of which cost $49 and $89, respectively. These get you instant access to a full catalog of games, plus enjoy new games each month. Games include Barbie, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, How to Train Your Dragon, Peppa Pig, Care Bears, Elmo, Miraculous Ladybug, Gabby’s Dollhouse, Kung Fu Panda, and more, so there’s going to be something for everyone. It encourages kids to move around, and is perfect for playdates or family game nights. Honestly, we won’t judge if you want to get a solo session in after putting the little ones to sleep. It’s also appropriate for kids of all ages, since it doesn’t support ads or in-app purchases. They can play their favorite games without needing you around!</p>



<p>Getting started couldn’t be simpler. Nex Playground connects to your TV using a single HDMI cable. Plug the power supply cord into the console and then plug the adapter into an outlet. Switch the thing on, and manage it using your TV remote; simple as that.</p>
<p>All things considered, this console offers a fun way to get your family moving together. Your living room is going to turn into a mini playground (or a battlefield) without a console or tons of other accessories. Just connect it to your TV, and get the party started. You’re getting five games included for free, but will need to purchase the Play Pass to unlock more.&nbsp;<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6060/">The current Black Friday deal drops the price down to $199, letting you save a nice $50 on it. Additionally, you can get $25 back in Amazon credit, which brings the price down even further.</a> Just note that the promotional credit is added automatically to your account 30 days after shipment, so you might not be able to access it right away.</p>

Whether it's his <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/random-takaya-imamura-wants-to-see-star-fox-assault-on-switch-2">wishes for a Star Fox revitalisation</a> or his dreams of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/random-takaya-imamura-ponders-the-possibility-of-star-fox-zero-on-switch-2">future movie adaptations</a>, the former Nintendo dev is always on hand to give us something to think about. But today, all that's on our minds is how inadequate our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> design capabilities are.</p>
<p>You see, in the past 24 hours, Imamura-san has shared a couple of pictures from his New Horizons pad, flexing the iconic movie posters that he has recreated in staggering detail via the in-game Custom Designs app. To start, there were just three. Now, there are seven. And, simply put, they put our best efforts to shame.</p><div><figure data-videoid="HpG4hedNmz8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytHpG4hedNmz8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpG4hedNmz8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f0b5ghxvnu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>At the time of writing, we've seen recreations of <strong>E.T.</strong>, <strong>Back to the Future</strong>, <strong>Star Wars</strong>, <strong>The Terminator</strong>, and more, and every one of them is more accurate than we could ever hope to muster with our humble skills. What's more, Imamura-san claims that he "rushed" the second batch — now come on, that's just showing off.</p>

<p>Of course, this is the man behind some of Nintendo's most iconic artwork, having designed for the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/star_fox">Star Fox</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_majoras_mask">Majora's Mask</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/f-zero">F-Zero</a>. We really shouldn't be all that surprised that he's a dab hand at Animal Crossing custom designs too, but here we are. So, when's he dropping the patterns, eh?</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/kindle-paperwhite-drops-to-record-low-e-reader-now-cheaper-than-buying-a-few-physical-books-2000648434</link>
            <guid>1367629</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Kindle e-readers have evolved into reading experiences that rival physical books through <strong>e-ink displays mimicking printed paper and provides instant access to over 15 million titles that would fill entire libraries</strong>. The convenience proves transformative through lightweight portability replacing heavy books in bags, immediate downloads eliminating bookstore trips, and adjustable lighting enabling reading anywhere regardless of ambient conditions.</p>
<p>The newest <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6054/">Kindle Paperwhite with 16GB storage (and ads) costs $124 during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $159</a>, and hits a record-low price where Amazon removes profit margins completely on their own hardware. The ad-supported version saves money through occasional lock-screen advertisements, though <strong>spending an extra $20 for the ad-free model proves worthwhile</strong> if promotional content bothers you.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6054/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The fastest page turns that are like real books</h2>
<p>The next-generation processor makes <strong>page turns 25% faster than older Paperwhite models</strong>: This gets rid of the short lag that made earlier e-readers feel slow compared to flipping through real pages. The speed boost is especially noticeable in scenes with a lot of dialogue or action, where quick page turning keeps the story moving instead of making fake pauses that break the immersion.</p>



<p>The <strong>7-inch glare-free screen gives you a lot of reading space</strong> in a small package: It can fit more text on the screen while still being portable which is something that bigger tablets give up. The anti-glare coating makes it possible to read in direct sunlight where phone and tablet screens wash out completely which means that you can read at the beach, in an outdoor cafe, or at a sunny window seat without having to squint or move around like you would with reflective screens.</p>
<p>The <strong>adjustable color temperature changes from bright white light for reading during the day to warm amber tones for reading at night</strong>: This lowers blue light exposure, which can affect sleep quality. The warm light lets you read before bed without the blue light that phone and tablet screens give off, which keeps your natural sleep patterns going instead of messing them up.</p>



<p>The<strong> IPX8 waterproof rating</strong> means that the device can be submerged in water for up to two meters for 60 minutes. This means you can read by the pool, relax in the bathtub, or spend time at the beach without worrying about your electronics getting wet. The device won’t break if it falls into a pool, gets splashed by waves, or gets rained on, so you don’t have to be as careful with it when it’s wet, like you do with most expensive electronics.</p>
<p>The <strong>battery lasts for 12 weeks on a single charge</strong> so you don’t have to charge your phone or tablet every night, which can make them feel like they need constant care. Read every day for months without needing to charge, take vacations without bringing chargers, or keep reading without worrying about the battery running out like you do with devices that need daily power. The USB-C charging makes it easier to charge when needed because it doesn’t need special cables like older Kindles did.</p>
<p>The<strong> 16GB of storage can hold thousands of books</strong> which is much more than what most readers read before they upgrade their devices. The storage is especially useful when traveling internationally, when buying books can be difficult.</p>
<p>If you’ve thought about getting an e-reader but were put off by the usual prices, this is the perfect time to make the switch from physical books.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/get-a-headstart-on-your-2025-holiday-tech-shopping-with-the-ai-powered-lenovo-idea-tab-2000636961</link>
            <guid>1367626</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The digital device in pretty much every student’s backpack doesn’t absolutely have to be an expensive laptop computer. The apps and tech that make digital note-taking, research, and AI-assisted writing and coursework has filtered down not just to high-end tablets, but also some of the more affordable models as well. That’s where the Lenovo Idea Tab sits — an 11-inch Android tablet armed with everything a student needs, including Lenovo AI Notes, but without the hefty price tag that comes with a laptop. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6048/">It’s on Black Friday sale right now at Amazon for just $180 (-25%).</a></p>
<p>Odds are the Lenovo Idea Tab is going to outperform most if not all other $180 tablets for academic and productivity purposes. It comes with the Lenovo Tab Pen and a folio case, both of which are almost always added expenses with tablets. Google’s Circle to Search feature is built in as well, along with Lenovo’s AI Notes.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6048/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Clear Picture</h2>
<p>The Lenovo Idea Tab comes with four apps that are tailor-made for academic performance: Squid, the powerful paper-replacing Android app for handwritten notes, PDF markups, and other tasks; MyScript Notes (formerly Nebo), a great freehand-sketching app; MyScript Calculator, which can solve your handwritten numerical equations; and Lenovo AI Note, which transforms your handwritten notes into AI-generated quizzes, and can also use AI to expand on your notes with greater insight.</p>
<p>Whether you’re working or playing, the 11-inch 2.5K screen on the Lenovo Idea Pad isn’t going to let you down. The MediaTek Dimensity 6300 octa-core processor ensures that the images on that screen come through smoothly, and the seemingly inexhaustible battery is good for up to 12 hours of video playback.</p>



<h2>All the Tablet, Without the Price</h2>
<p>Everything else you would ask of the tablets in the higher price brackets — fast internet, smooth streaming, quality built-in camera and Dolby Atmos quad speakers for video calls, and total portability (just 6.5 x 10 x 0.28 inches in size and 1.05 pounds in weight) — are here with the Lenovo Idea Pad, and don’t forget the included-in-price Lenovo Tab Pen and folio case.</p>
<p>The Lenovo Idea Pad might be considered to be an “entry-level” tablet by some, and to be fair, we wouldn’t throw it in the ring against the latest iPad Pro or Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra. But you’re certainly not getting anywhere near either of those heavyweights for $210, and the differences between them and the Lenovo Idea Pad probably don’t quantify the $1,000-plus price difference. Long story short, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6048/">you’re getting far more tablet than you would expect for $180 from the Lenovo Idea Pad, so this Amazon Black Friday deal is a solid thumbs-up.</a></p>

<p>Build a rocket, boy</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/little_rocket_lab">Little Rocket Lab</a> is a sweet pixel art automation game from No More Robots and Teenage Astronauts. It arrived on Steam and Xbox last month, and we have been wondering when a Switch release would follow ever since. Well, it's coming real soon. What's more, there's a Switch 2 Edition in tow.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/little-rocket-lab-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Little Rocket Lab - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, and its Switch 1 counterpart, will be available on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Little-Rocket-Lab-2955324.html">eShop</a> from 10th December for <strong>£15.99 / $19.99</strong> (or as a free upgrade for those who make the jump between systems down the road), and it boasts some pretty slick performance on the new hardware. Alongside the promise of boosted resolution, Teenage Astronauts have also got things running at a sweet 120fps — so you know those conveyor belts are going to be looking smooth as anything.</p>
<p>It's not necessarily the kind of game that we can imagine being drastically impacted by a triple-figure frame rate, but S2 Editions hitting those upper reaches are always a welcome sight.</p>
<p>For those curious, this is a chilled little factory-building game, where you set out to transform your rundown family home into a prime site for rocket construction. To do so, you'll have to lay down transport, delegate machinery, and make the most of your surrounding resources, all while keeping the locals happy.</p>
<p>You'll find a brief rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Clever Contraptions:</strong> Use drills, furnaces, automated bots, cranes, complex assemblers and far more to help the town’s struggling locals!<br>
<strong>The Heart of Community:</strong> Build lifelong friendships with townsfolk, learn the depths of their lives, and become the heart of the community<br>
<strong>Invent, Invent, Invent!:</strong> Devise and formulate new machinery, energy sources and mechanical pals to help you on your journey to the stars<br>
<strong>Cozy Organisation:</strong> Lose yourself in the comforting hum of well-oiled machines, made by your hands, and working just as intended<br>
<strong>Build a Rocket Ship:</strong> Support a struggling town while building a rocket ship!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first half of December is looking particularly rammed at the moment, but if you're after something to kick back with between the stresses of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, this might just end up fitting the bill.</p>

            <guid>1367614</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Fatshark's 10 Years of Tide celebration includes not only Warhammer: Vermintide 2 (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-vermintide-2-currently-free-to-keep-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was recently given away for free</a> and also got a new map), but also Warhammer 40K: Darktide. The studio's most recent game is about to receive a new paid DLC, the Hive Scum class, following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/darktide-arbites-dlc-was-a-success-boasts-fatshark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">successful launch of the Arbites class</a>. In a press presentation attended by Wccftech, Fatshark introduced the Hive Scum as a gang of native criminals from Tertium's Hive City who are begrudgingly joining forces with the inquisitorial warband to fight the forces of chaos. This new class brings a very different style and attitude to gameplay, emphasizing a more aggressive and playstyle compared to other classes available in Darktide.</p>



<p>The developers have prepared extensive customization options for the Hive Scum, including new faces, hairstyles, full-body tattoos, and a unique system called face paints. Players can represent different cartels within the Hive, adding an extra layer of identity and personality to their Hive Scum characters.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Hive-Scum-Screenshot-4-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>This class focuses on rapid dual-wielding pistols for ranged combat and dual-wielding shivs (daggers) for melee combat. The dual-wielding pistols can be fired in an alternate, frenzied mode with the left trigger but can also be fired more accurately with 'brace mode', which is enabled with the right trigger. Similarly, when using the dual blades, Hive Scum players can switch between blunt and pointed grip, which changes the attack chains and effects. In either case, it's a fast-paced playstyle designed to highlight the street-gang vibe of the Hive Scum, which is reflected in their animations as well. </p>



<p>The class features several abilities and ultimate moves that align with its reckless gangster theme, such as unlimited ammo and invincibility during a Desperado ultimate. Another ultimate, Rampage, buffs melee attacks, enhancing attack power, and can be refreshed by hitting targets. Lastly, Stimm Supply places a crate on the ground that buffs the whole group. The type of buff is derived from the Stimm Lab, arguably the class's most significant innovation. It is a new, class‑specific progression system that lets Hive Scum players craft a custom 'Cartel Special' stimm. For every character level, you gain one point to spend in the Lab, selecting different bonuses that are baked into this personal Stimm, which then replaces regular Stimms found in missions if you opt in. The Cartel Special automatically recharges on a cooldown, and that cooldown grows longer the more points you invest and the more powerful the combined effects become. Using the Stimm Lab is optional, by the way: if you don't take any upgrades there, your Hive Scum simply uses the same normal stimms as other classes.</p>



<p>The Hive Scum class also introduces a new damage type to Darktide called toxins, which deal damage over time and weaken enemies. When it comes to Blitz abilities, Blinder/Blackout is a fast‑throw concussive grenade for knocking enemies down and creating openings; Boom Bringer is a disposable missile launcher for deleting elites and monsters; and Chem Grenade creates lingering toxic zones and chain reactions. The talent trees are designed around three core playstyles: a gunslinger Desperado, a melee-focused Ruffian, and a Chemist specializing in the aforementioned toxin damage.</p>

<p>While the Hive Scum class is a premium DLC (available starting December 2 on all platforms for $11.99 in the Standard Edition and $18.99 for the Premium Edition), all Warhammer 40K: Darktide players are getting a new three-mission story arc as part of a free update. It includes trench warfare-style combat through a 'No Man's Land' area as players escort a tank to reclaim a stronghold held by a cult faction. The mission features outdoor combat areas with classic Warhammer 40K-inspired ruined cityscape and bunkers. It branched out from previously released content but includes new voice-overs, story elements, and narrative developments. It requires players to unlock part of the main campaign before access, but can also be joined in co-op with players who have unlocked it.</p>



<p>In the presentation's Q&amp;A segment, we learned from Fatshark that developing a new class like the Hive Scum usually takes them between six and twelve months, with teams ranging from 10 to 25 members involved. The studio promised further ongoing support for Darktide, including additional missions, factions, and gameplay features.</p>



<p>I asked whether the studio was evaluating the addition of PvP modes <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-vermintide-2-gets-versus-mode-with-4v4-battles-and-several-characters-to-choose-from/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like in Warhammer: Vermintide 2</a>, and the reply was that this is not currently planned, but may be considered later. Don't hold your breath, though, as it sounded like this possibility has barely been evaluated thus far. It took many years before Vermintide 2 got its own PvP, and the same may apply to Darktide.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Though Black Friday deals usually start ahead of the actual date, there are always still deals that only appear on the day itself, which is why it's still worth keeping your eye out for deals and waiting for the actual day. Well, anyone who was patient enough to wait for it to actually be Black Friday in order to take advantage of deals on video games has been rewarded, because there's a slew of games, all of which were released in 2025, that you can grab for $40 or less on Amazon.</p>



<p>Of course, you can find older games for cheap as well, and some other 2025 releases on sale for more than $40, but no one is able to grab everything they want in a given year right at launch, so there's likely a few games in this list of 20 titles released in 2025 that you can pick up for cheap now.</p>



<p>Starting from the top-end of the pricing, with games that you can pick up for $40 that were released in 2025:</p>



<ul>

<p>Moving down the pricing list, here are the games you can get for $30 and up:</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/top-all-your-essentials-in-one-go-with-the-3-port-65w-anker-usb-c-charger-for-just-24-2000648212</link>
            <guid>1367599</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday has arrived in all its glory, slashing rates across a wide range of categories right, left, and center. We’re spotting tons of items hitting their lowest ever prices, and even some of the latest releases getting surprise discounts. It’s basically a great time to pick everything you’ve had your eyes on for less, whether it’s a MacBook, a pair of premium Bose headphones, or even an air fryer to finally start eating healthy.</p>
<p>If you rely on multiple devices to get through the day and are done dealing with cord clutter, a multiport charger is the way out. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6044/">Right now, you can snag the 3-port 65W Anker USB-C charger for $24, after a whopping 40% off its usual price of $40 at Amazon.</a> And as if that wasn’t enough, the retailer is also throwing in 2 free months of Audible with your purchase to sweeten the deal even more. Both Prime and non-Prime members can grab it, but subscribers will enjoy free shipping, so they’re saving a few bucks on that front, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6044/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>High-Speed Charging for All Your Devices</h2>
<p>This compact charger is roughly the size of an AirPods Pro case, and the plugs fold in for easy portability. The smooth, scratchproof surface handles everyday wear and tear well, making it easy to take it with you on the go without worry.</p>
<p>There are three ports (two USB-C and one USB-A) to charge up to three devices at the same time, whether it’s your smartphone, tablet, or even a laptop. 65W ultra-fast charging is enough to juice a 14-inch MacBook Pro to 50% in just 35 minutes, or a Google Pixelbook to about half in a little over 40. You’ll get maximum power when using a single port, but when multiple devices are plugged in, the charger automatically spreads the output intelligently. For instance, when topping three devices up at the same time, the top USB-C port can output 40W, while the second USB-C port and USB-A port can deliver 12W each. You can connect your power-hungry devices to a USB-C port, while other essentials to the rest.</p>



<p>Despite this power, the charger stays calm and cool while it works. GaN II technology makes for higher energy efficiency and upgraded heat dissipation in a compact frame that is around 53% smaller than your regular, everyday blocks. The box comes with the Anker 735 Charger, a welcome guide, and an 18-month warranty for some extra peace of mind.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6044/">To wrap it up, you’re saving a massive 40% or $16 on this compact, but powerful charger that’s easy to use and makes any workspace more efficient.</a> It plays nicely with a range of devices, so you can use it to top up your earbuds, smartwatches, smartphones, tablet, laptop, and even consoles.&nbsp;You’re also getting a free 60-day Audible trial on top of that, which typically costs $15 a month. Audible gets you access to a huge library of podcasts, audiobooks, and Audible Originals that include documentaries, comedy shows, and more. You can purchase titles, enjoy on-demand streaming, and even enjoy offline access to your favorites!</p>
<p>Both the offers, however, are expected to expire soon, so it’s best to get your orders in quickly. Once these are gone, there’s no guarantee they’ll be back. This is also a great time to grab other tech gadgets for less. We’re covering the top deals here at Kotaku, so don’t forget to check back for the latest drops and some exclusive offers.</p>

Like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/819903/analogue-3d-nintendo-64-console-ship-date-november-18">recently released</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/822849/analogue-3d-review-n64">Analogue 3D</a>, it will play N64 games in 4K through the use of an FPGA. ModRetro — the company founded by the controversial figure Palmer Luckey who’s also behind a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/798821/anduril-eagleeye-palmer-luckey-mark-zuckerberg-meta-military-mr">defense contractor that makes military tech</a> — has been <a href="https://x.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1901796093396222233?">teasing details about the console</a> on social media over the past few months, but today it finally revealed the console’s design, and an accompanying remake of the N64’s unique three-pronged controller.</p><p>Similar to the recently-launched Analogue 3D, the M64’s design is inspired by Nintendo’s original hardware with a gently curved top panel, cartridge slot on top, and four ports on the front compatible with the N64’s original wired gamepads. On the front corner of the top panel you’ll find a power button, while the other corner features a dial labeled “Menu.” Aside from presumably navigating on-screen menus we don’t yet know if the dial will have additional functionality. On the back of the M64 is an HDMI port, three USB-C ports, and a microSD card slot.</p><p>The new images of the M64 show the console with a translucent housing in green, purple, and white color options, as well as three color-matched controllers. The Analogue 3D is also compatible with the Nintendo 64’s original gamepads, but the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/825309/8bitdo-64-wireless-bluetooth-controller-analogue-3d-retro-gray-color">worked with 8BitDo to create a modernized version</a> with a similar button layout and thumbstick design. ModRetro has instead gone for authenticity. The M64’s controllers look nearly identical to the original with a three pronged design featuring the thumbstick on top of the middle grip and a trigger button beneath it.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1993115525153436057">post on X earlier this week</a>, Luckey also announced that while the M64 was priced at $199 (the same launch price as the N64 in 1996) for those who signed up for the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmodretro.com%2Fpages%2Fm64" rel="sponsored">waitlist on ModRetro’s website</a> after the M64 was announced, the introductory pricing is being extended to everyone — at least for now.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/831498/modretro-m64-console-4k-fpga-nintendo-64-clone]]></content:encoded>

Of steel is my spirit, of thunder my bones. I am the hawk's justice, the quadrapedal crucible of oil and atrocity in which the future is forged. BEHOLD, ye <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> simulation enthusiasts. Behold my unabashed phallic symbolism menacing the gates of heaven, while my hissing hydraulics uncipher the coordinates of my prey.</p>
<p>Many are my supplicants, strangers from near and far who seek to beguile me and aim my blessed ordnance, but mine is the judgement, and mine the tactile gratifications of levers and gears and dials. You were getting bored of turrets in war games? Fools! You have never experienced one from the inside. Come, surrender yourself to the dieselpunk folds and surprisingly jaunty background music of my ironclad majesty. (Here's a trailer.)

"A brutal dieselpunk heavy-artillery experience where you dominate the battlefield through a colossal war machine," roars <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2950790/IRON_NEST_Heavy_Turret_Simulator/">the Steam page for Iron Nest: Heavy Turret Simulator</a>, like a minotaur with a marketing degree. "Every lever, every dial and every shot is under your control. High Command may send cryptic orders, but you alone pull the trigger. Obey or defy, in this nest you are the god of steel and fire. Beware, each blast tears the silence!" ARGH. I just saluted inadvertently and jammed a pencil in my ear.
</p><p>
There's a slightly less bellowy characterisation of the game at the bottom of that Steam page. This is "a unique blend of tactical problem-solving, war machine management, and strategic customization" in which you "translate cryptic reports into coordinates, determine where to strike, and set the turret accordingly". It features "a card-based requisition system that keeps every mission fresh", and is apparently the work of just two developers with about 20 years of experience between them. 
</p>
<p>
Iron Nest takes heavy inspiration from (deep breath)  <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pvkk-planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant">PVKK: Planetenverteidigungskanonenkommandant</a>, which is kind of bizarre because PVKK isn't even out yet. In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2950790/view/707754276831626328?l=english">a post</a> about the experience of going moderately viral on Tiktok, the devs stress that Iron Nest and PVKK are quite different once you disregard the theme of honking massive manually operated cannons. It's about "ground-based artillery, which brings a completely different setup, mechanics, and challenges compared to an orbital gun!" 
</p>
<p>
Potato, potarto, I'm tempted to say, but I'm already imagining the whistle of vengeful shells. You can expect a demo in a few months, and the full release in mid-2026.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-expensive-oled-tvs-4k-fire-tv-on-black-friday-sale-does-the-job-for-97-of-people-2000648430</link>
            <guid>1367569</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon sells Insignia-branded TVs despite the brand being owned by competitor Best Buy and creates the unusual situation where Amazon’s platform promotes a rival’s house brand.&nbsp;Several popular sizes including <strong>55-inch and 75-inch variants have already sold out</strong> completely, but remaining models like this 50-inch version offer exceptional value that doesn’t justify spending significantly more on competing brands.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5462/">55-inch TV costs $169 during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $299, and hits a record-low 43% discount</a> that makes 4K smart TVs cost less than many soundbars or streaming devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5462/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fire TV integration</h2>
<p>The <strong>4K Ultra HD resolution at 2160p has four times as many pixels as 1080p Full HD</strong>. This makes images sharper with text that is still readable, faces that show detail, and faraway objects that stay clear instead of becoming blurry copies. HDR10 support improves dynamic range by using metadata to adjust brightness and color on a scene-by-scene basis, and this lets you see more detail in shadows in dark scenes while keeping bright highlight information.</p>



<p>The wide color gamut shows more colors than standard dynamic range and makes images that are more colorful and realistic like what we see in real life, instead of the flat colors that SDR content has. The upscaling engine looks at content with lower resolution and smartly adds detail to make it look like 4K quality.</p>
<p>The <strong>60Hz refresh rate works well with regular TV and movie content</strong> because it has native frame rate support that stops the judder from happening on displays with different refresh rates. The refresh rate is good enough for almost all types of content, including streaming services, cable TV, and DVDs and Blu-rays, which never go above 60 frames per second.</p>
<p>You don’t need any extra streaming sticks or boxes to <strong>use the built-in Fire TV operating system to get to streaming services</strong> like Prime Video, Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max, and thousands of other apps right away. The all-in-one design gets rid of the HDMI port, the need to switch between remotes, and the mess of cables that come with separate streaming devices.</p>



<p>With the <strong>smart home hub</strong>, you can watch camera feeds from compatible video doorbells and security cameras directly on the TV in picture-in-picture or full-screen mode. You can use voice commands to control Alexa-compatible lights, thermostats, and smart plugs through the TV remote. This makes it easier to manage your smart home without needing separate Echo devices or phone apps.</p>
<p>Insignia’s 50-inch 4K Fire TV is now the cheapest on Black Friday at $169: It <strong>costs less than many 32-inch TVs but has a much bigger screen and all the smart features you could want</strong>. This deal makes 4K smart TVs available at prices that have never been seen before so you can get big-screen entertainment without losing any of the important features.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/crucial-x10-1tb-ssd-now-costs-less-than-a-dime-per-gb-actually-only-0-08-while-black-friday-supplies-last-2000647763</link>
            <guid>1367566</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cruising Amazon for the best Black Friday deals is a hunting expedition for those red digits next to the price — the negative numbers with the percentage sign that guide you to the biggest price drops. It was -13% that led us to the deal on the Crucial X10 1TB Portable SSD, but it was the Crucial name and the features of this awesome drive that led us to click “buy now.”</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6043/">The new $85 Black Friday price on the Crucial X10 is well worth jumping on.</a> The 1TB capacity of this model of the X10 is enough to serve as a secure backup for tens of thousands of irreplaceable files. It’s compatible with Windows, Mac, Android, and many gaming consoles. The Crucial X10 transfers data at a fast 2,100MB/s, and it has advanced dust, water, and drop resistance built in. Crucial might not have as recognizable a name as SanDisk or Samsung or some of the other big tech companies, but the reputation and the performance are impeccable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6043/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tiny Yet Enormous</h2>
<p>When you click over to Amazon to check out the Crucial X10 the first thing you’ll notice is how much smaller it is than most other portable SSDs. Just 2.55 by 1.96 inches square and a truly remarkable 0.39 inches thick, it’s probably the most pocket-sized 4TB drive on the market. Even so, you don’t have to treat it with kid gloves — the Crucial X10 has IP65 dust and water resistance ratings, and drop resistance of nearly 10 feet.</p>
<p>With that kind of rugged construction combined with the 1TB capacity and outstanding speed of data transfer make the Crucial X10 a prime candidate for anything you would use a portable SSD for. Add 1TB of storage to your gaming console — it works with PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox — and bring the extra games with you on the road. It’s a perfect Time Machine drive for automatic Mac backups, and as storage or transport for huge files like hi-res photo and video files, it’s a massive amount of space in a tiny package, and it can move the files back and forth to your editing station with great speed.</p>
<h2>Ditch the Thumb Drive</h2>
<p>Students, remote workers, and frequent business travelers have mostly relied on USB thumb drives for ferrying their files. They’re pocket-sized, plug-and-play, and inexpensive, so that tracks. But the Crucial X10? Pocket-sized, plug-and-play, and for a exceptionally fast, nearly universally compatible, massive-capacity drive, inexpensive. And unlike those thumb drives, the Crucial X10 can take a little bit of abuse, and isn’t going to glitch out on you like those cheap thumb drives. It’s a worthy investment in keeping your irreplaceable files safe and secure, especially during this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6043/">Amazon Black Friday sale with the fat 13% price drop that makes the Crucial X10 one of the best portable SSD buys of the day at just $230.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Team Cherry is Thinking of Making a New Game Instead of Hollow Knight 3]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-3-team-cherry/</link>
            <guid>1367560</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new interview, Team Cherry co-founder Ari Gibson sat down with Jason Schreier to discuss the studio’s success and what could be next for Team Cherry, and it might not be Hollow Knight 3.</p>



<p>During the interview (via <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-28/the-makers-of-hollow-knight-silksong-aren-t-done-just-yet?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NDM0NzQzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzY0OTUyMjM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNkczNjFLR0NUSDAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.nHDv04b3quPAcWKT5nBOeCqr1KCS01wBn_nMscKzzng" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>), Schreier asked Gibson what’s next for Team Cherry after they complete Silksong: Hollow Knight’s DLC content, to which Gibson said that “we do have other games that we plan to make”, citing that their only concern is the time that it now takes to make games.</p>







<p>“The only time concern really is — and we’ve talked about this before — death. It’s not that far off if you spend seven years per project, and potentially add another two. So it’d be nice to do a few more games,” he said.</p>



<p>Schreier immediately jumped on the comment, asking if Team Cherry intends to create more games within the same universe or go somewhere else entirely. </p>



<p>Gibson replied, “We have said we’ll go elsewhere as well. Although we’ve also said those experiences will still be about exploring big worlds full of weird characters and giant bosses and whatnot. So there would be a through line there that people will be familiar with. That’s not to say we won’t return to these&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>&nbsp;worlds. We do have ideas around what forms those would take. But we also don’t want to be exclusively people that make&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>.”</p>



<p>Gibson then said that it doesn’t mean he would necessarily be annoyed at making another Silksong, and that he just thinks it will be ”&nbsp;interesting for us to explore the same things we’re interested in but maybe in a slightly different genre, slightly different theme, and how that affects the stories we come up with.”</p>







<p>As for now, though, it seems like Team Cherry doesn’t really have something concretely set up for their next project, and if anything, it’ll probably be another 4-5 years until we find out what they are working on.</p>



<p>What do you think Team Cherry should do next? Would you welcome a Hollow Knight 3? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <p>Team Cherry has confirmed it's still working on new content for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, but won't say when it's coming out.</p>
<p>The long-awaited adventure was finally released in September to huge fanfare. And it would seem the developers aren't done with it yet.</p>
<p>"We didn't plan seven years for Silksong," Team Cherry co-founder Ari Gibson told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-28/the-makers-of-hollow-knight-silksong-aren-t-done-just-yet?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NDM0NzQzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzY0OTUyMjM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNkczNjFLR0NUSDAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.nHDv04b3quPAcWKT5nBOeCqr1KCS01wBn_nMscKzzng&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a>. "Not that we expect to take an excessive amount of time, but we still are pursuing the same development philosophy, which sometimes can expand our timeframe."</p>

<p>Silksong, infamously, began life as DLC for the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> game before ballooning into a full standalone game.</p>
<p>It's unclear exactly what the studio is working on, and if that too has the potential to balloon in size.</p>
<p>Bloomberg has speculated a DLC focused on Steel Assassin Sharpe may be in the works. This character was teased in a <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/happy-hollowmas">studio blog post years ago</a>, but wasn't included in the final game.</p>
<p>"Just waiting in the wings," said Gibson of the character. "Waiting to arrive is probably the best way to say it. One of those enemies, a little suite of Sharpe and their companions, they got tucked away for a while because the game had so much in it. And all of these pieces need polish, and polish takes time. We're excited to reintroduce Sharpe. We just have to get to them."</p><p>Gibson added: "We will make sure to deliver on all of our obligations. One, because they're going to be very fun to do. But even alongside those tasks we had our own ideas for extra things that could be added to the world. We're trying to juggle when that could potentially be."</p>
<p>Bloomberg also asked Team Cherry if they wish to shorten the time for their next game.</p>
<p>"At the start of Silksong, and at the start of Hollow Knight, we had no conception it would take as long as it did for either game," said co-founder William Pellen. "We started to work on the basic idea of it, and allowed it to grow as much as we wanted it to. We could've stopped that from growing if we'd wanted to. I imagine we'll go on to the next game, again with that core idea and begin exploring it and start to suss out what the boundaries will end up being."</p>
<p>Gibson added: "We're clearly not concerned if it ends up taking a long period of time."</p>
<p>For now, the pair are "certainly happy with where [Silksong] is sitting right now, and we're not planning anything dramatic at this point," said Gibson, following multiple balance tweaks and updates.</p>
<p>He continued: "We're also quite happy where technically it's sitting, noting that we will continue to do small fixes of course. And we are looking at what else can we do, what else can be brought to the experience and how that world can expand. I don't know how much we can really speak about it. We're playing a little coy again. But that's also because this stuff is in flux."</p>
<p>The pair are considering different sizes of updates too, similar to the smaller Lifeblood or larger Godmaster and Grimm Troupe from Hollow Knight.</p>
<p>Said Pellen: "We were talking about the next project in general. We're not thinking about the size. We just started making new stuff and working on bits and pieces. We're still in this world, thinking about stuff to present to people."</p>
<p>Information will come "soon", but the pair wouldn't be drawn to a timeframe and said they'll have a more frequent cadence of communication as there's more to discuss.</p>
<p>Gibson surmised: "Yes, we're continuing to work on the game, we're pursuing the things that excite us."</p>
<p>This will certainly be exciting news for Silksong fans, too. "Pretty and charmingly mean-spirited, this is a game filled with revelations and genuine personality," reads our five star <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-review">Hollow Knight: Silksong review</a>.</p>
<p>In the same interview, the pair also discussed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/modding-hollow-knight-silksong-is-totally-fine-say-team-cherry-but-studio-is-largely-happy-with-difficulty-balance">Silksong's imposing challenge and the use of mods to alter the difficulty</a>.</p>

<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@LinusTechTips">LinusTechTips</a> has built a gaming PC featuring specs similar to Valve's upcoming system, providing a good preview of the performance the system is expected to offer (which is speculated to <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-rely-amd-fsr-4k-60/">heavily rely on AMD FSR to deliver 4K resolution at 60 FPS gameplay</a>). Building this system with off-the-shelf parts (some of which offered nice-to-have features that didn't significantly impact performance), purchased at their lowest historical price, resulted in a total cost of $602.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><td><strong>Component Type</strong></td><td><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(232, 230, 227, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(232, 230, 227, 0.2)">Componen</strong><strong>t</strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(232, 230, 227, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(232, 230, 227, 0.2)"> Name</strong></td><td><strong>Historical Lower Price</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>CPU</strong></td><td>AMD Ryzen 5 8400F</td><td>$84</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Motherboard</strong></td><td>Asrock B650M-H M.2+</td><td>$100</td></tr><tr><td><strong>RAM</strong></td><td>Crucial (2x8) 16 GB 5600MT/s CL46</td><td>$44</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Case</strong></td><td>Player's Choice</td><td>$50</td></tr><tr><td><strong>PSU</strong></td><td>Seasnoic GX-550 550W</td><td>$55</td></tr><tr><td><strong>GPU</strong></td><td>Asrock Challenger Radeon RX 6600</td><td>$175</td></tr><tr><td><strong>SSD</strong></td><td>Kingston NV3 500 GB</td><td>$38</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Controller</strong></td><td>Gamesir Cyclone 2</td><td>$56</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>On the other hand, if this system were to be built today under current market conditions, which are severely impacted by<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/memory-markets-have-entered-a-panic-buying-phase/"> memory shortages</a> that are already forcing companies such as <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpowerpc-announces-price-changes-for-its-gaming-pcs-due-to-higher-ram-and-ssd-prices/">CyberPowerPC to increase the prices of their gaming PC</a>s, the cost would rise to $900. Going for cheaper parts that would keep the system's performance as is, the cost would be $813.</p>



<p>However, since Valve benefits from a direct-to-consumer model that lets them retain both brand and retailer margins, the total cost of the system (unlikely to be below $600–$650) will ultimately be decided by the markup Valve targets</p>



<p>If market conditions don't change further, Linus estimates that the system may cost $699.99, as this price is above the company's current cost. As the Steam Machine will be on sale for years, there will be plenty of opportunities for the company to improve its margins.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Although Linus' estimate sounds reasonable, based on the analysis, it's challenging to predict the Steam Machine's price accurately at this point. Valve has yet to confirm it, but has already stated that <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-pricing-will-be-really-competitive-with-building-a-similar-pc/">it will be really competitive, and in line with the cost of building a PC with similar specs</a>, and that <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-isnt-going-to-be-subsidized-valve-confirms-prepare-for-high-price/">the system won't be subsidized</a>, meaning that the company is not going to sell it at a loss at launch - something other console makers like Sony and Microsoft have done in the past thanks to the 30% cut on games sales from their own digital stores, a cut Valve also takes from every game sold on Steam.</p>
