<p>In 2023, Evil Geniuses won VALORANT Champions, claiming just the third ever world championship in Riot’s tactical FPS. Less than two years later, only one face remains: coach Christine “potter” Chi.</p>



<p>Potter, a former Counter-Strike pro who first joined EG as a player in 2021, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/potter-signs-three-year-extension-with-eg-valorant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">signed an extension this offseason</a> to continue coaching through 2027. The team also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/evil-geniuses-sign-yay-and-icy-to-complete-2025-valorant-roster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">signed Jacob “icy” Lange and once-upon-a-time best player in the world Jaccob “yay” Whiteaker</a>.</p>



<p>This year, the goal for potter is the same as it always is: do more with less.</p>



<hr>



<p>Insider Gaming had the opportunity to sit down with potter at the VCT Americas Media Day. The following interview has been edited slightly for clarity and length.</p>



<p><strong>IG: At the SEN City Classic you talked about wanting to work with that roster specifically, but what led to the team ending up with icy as opposed to&nbsp;Tyler “sym” Porter?</strong></p>



<p>“My mindset towards rosters has always been tunneled towards making it work, no matter what. I’ve never looked at it from the angle of ‘when can I replace this player?’ So when I said that at the time, I fully believed that would be our roster in 2025.</p>



<p>After that tournament though, it was clear there were some issues with sym. I do really wish we could have made it work; sym is incredibly talented, he’s really hungry, an incredible teammate and a really good human. But the time issue was always on my mind, with trying to bring yay into a comfortable environment and highlighting him to be successful. We need to make sure everyone was playing their roles properly, especially with all of yay’s role changes and not being as comfortable on the sentinel role.</p>



<p>This roster that we’re going into Kickoff with, this combination of players turned out to be better for us.”</p>



<figure><figcaption>Potter lifts the trophy at Champions 2023. Image credit: Colin Young-Wolff/Riot Games.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>IG: The last time you kept the same roster core between years was from 2022 to 2023, and we all know how well 2023 turned out. How important is it to keep the same core together through the offseason?</strong></p>



<p>“It’s so important. Even at that time, I was getting so much shit from the community, my peers, from some in management about replacing certain players on that 2023 roster. But I knew keeping a core was going to be important. All the work, all the small annoyances that teams have to do that take so much time, that was already out of the way [in 2023].</p>



<p>And it’s the same with this roster in 2025. We took last year to hash out a lot of those details, to learn about each other, get those fundamentals down. All those things are done. And yeah we lost Alexander “jawgemo” Mor, and that fucking hurt really badly, and it hurt us as a team. But, we put in a lot of work last year, and we feel very confident about that work we put in.”</p>



<p><strong>IG: What do you hope to see out of both yay and Icy? What can they bring to the table that VCT Americas viewers haven’t seen yet?</strong></p>



<p>“Over the last three years, EG has been a place where every player ends up not by choice, but more so by how things turned out. Each player has their own hunger, and drive, and story they want to rewrite for themselves. And that’s always been my strength: having these misfit players with their own desperate drive they need to prove. I see exactly [those kind of players] in yay and icy. </p>



<figure><figcaption>In his OpTic days, yay was regarded as the best VALORANT player in the world. Image credit: Colin Young-Wolff/Riot Games.</figcaption></figure>



<p>With yay, he’s gonna have to prove that he’s not just a Chamber main. That’s his ultimate goal. He’s swapped over to the sentinel role, and every day it’s a constant battle. We have El Diablo on our team, but we still need him to do his job, which sometimes isn’t as sexy as going out there and getting three crispy headshots. Sometimes he’s gonna have to play off of his trip, and it’s small things like this we’re working out as a team. He’s such a capable player, but sometimes being that capable can bait you into into certain engagements that don’t make sense.</p>



<p>For icy, he’s an incredible role player. His IQ is up there, he’s humble, and he’s a very sacrificial duelist. As a duelist, you have to be greedy, but you also have to be willing to go in there and die for your team. So my focus for him is to highlight his mechanical skill. That consistency wasn’t there last year, and I’m hoping he finds that here on this roster.”</p>



<p><strong>IG: You had the prestige and name power to go coach another team. What made you want to stay with EG?</strong></p>



<p>“I did get a lot of offers, and they were all exactly the same: building up a roster of misfits or players that need to prove themselves from tier two or tier three. I did want to look at a team that was willing to spend the big bucks on big names, but that didn’t work out. A lot of the rumors are true. I did look into NRG, and those talks did go pretty far, but they went a different route. At that point it was either go somewhere brand new and do what I’m already doing here, or continue what I’ve done at EG with the core I’ve already built here.</p>



<p>I fully believe in Phat “supamen” Le, in the same way I was fully convinced jawgemo was going to be the best duelist at the end of the year. Turns out he wasn’t even our main duelist!”</p>



<p><strong>IG: He wasn’t even the best duelist on EG!</strong></p>



<p>“[Laughs] Right! And NaturE is a top IGL. He and I have worked so long together, and we’re in that sweet spot. And Derrek is casually good, and I like that. In practice and matches, he’s not straining for highlights. His energy is fantastic.</p>



<p>I really stayed because I believe in this core. I think we made the right roster moves. Yay is a big question mark, but he absolutely is elevating us and catapulting us up like how Ethan and Demon1 did in 2023. So I’m excited about this roster.”</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> Festival, the concert-themed rhythm-action portion of Epic Games' free-to-play jack-of-all-trades juggernaut, is getting local co-op support next month - conjuring nostalgic memories of countless evenings spent twanging away in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rock-band">Rock Band</a> with pals.
</p>
<p>
Not coincidentally, of course, Fortnite Festival is the work of Rock Band developer Harmonix (which Epic Games acquired back in 2021) and is extremely reminiscent of the studio's beloved earlier titles, right down to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rock-band-developer-harmonixs-new-fortnite-music-mode-will-support-instrument-controllers">support for guitar-shaped plastic peripherals</a>.
</p>
<p>
And Epic has now revealed that, from Tuesday 14th January, Fortnite Festival will get a little closer to capturing the social spirit of those heady Rock Band days, by letting multiple players jam away in the comfort of the same room - but only on Xbox and PlayStation. The company hasn't shared much in the way of specifics just yet, but judging by the <a href="https://x.com/FNFestival/status/1877762481533165921">excessively elaborate, Snoop Dogg-starring trailer</a> it's released to announce the new feature, it'll support local co-op for up to four players, as well as the simultaneous use of two plastic guitars.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>GET THE BAND BACK TOGETHER ‼️</p><p>Local multiplayer is coming to Fortnite Festival on Xbox and PlayStation January 14!  Stay *tuned* for more details 🎸 <a href="https://t.co/m5hzBmbCtw">pic.twitter.com/m5hzBmbCtw</a></p></div>— Fortnite Festival (@FNFestival) <a href="https://twitter.com/FNFestival/status/1877762481533165921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>
This marks the first major new feature for Fortnite Festival this year, and follows Epic's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-commits-to-rock-band-like-festival-musical-mode-support-through-2025-and-beyond">confirmation last December</a> that it would continue to support its rhythm game through "2025 and beyond". It made those assurances after revealing it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-waves-chequered-flag-on-rocket-racing-mode-themed-updates">no longer be releasing themed updates for Fortnite's Rocket Racing</a>, which has struggled to maintain player numbers since being introduced alongside Fornite Festival and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a> in 2023.
</p><p>
The arrival of Fortnite Festival's local co-op support on 14th January coincides with the end of the mode's current Snoop Dogg-themed season and the start of the next, which will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-hatsune-miku-crossover-coming-leaks-suggest">likely see Vocaloid popstar Hatsune Miku step in as the latest featured artist</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/what-we-played-marvel-rivals-destiny-2-kingdom-come-deliverance-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The first full week of the year definitely picked up the pace again, and there’s been plenty of headlines, new trailers and general stuff happening in video games. And there’s also new games coming out sooner than you might think!</p>
<p>I’ve had an old platformer on the go that you’ll hear about next week, and&nbsp;I also played a few hours of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 to cobble together a preview video for the game earlier today.</p>
<p>But it’s <strong>Gamoc</strong> who on point for our Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 review, and it’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/10/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-final-preview-use-mace-on-bandits-its-quite-effective/">his first impressions</a> that we were able to share in our final preview. He’s really been enjoying it so far, so keep your eyes peeled for our review next month! That’s not all he’s been playing, though. There’s also been some bits of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Black Ops 6, and Terraria with his sister (who’s having to put up with just having a PS4 for the time being).</p>

<p><strong>Jim’s</strong> also been playing Kingdom Come… but only the first one – “My enjoyment took a momentary dip during the notoriously dull monastery main quest in which you become a novice monk, performing mundane daily duties while also investigating which of your fellow brothers is a criminal. It was great in terms of historical immersion but was surprisingly punishing. I much preferred my next quest, giving the villagers of Pribyslavitz a good telling off for pooing in the nearby river.”</p>

<p><strong>Aran’s</strong> continuing adventures through The Witcher 3 have taken him through Novigrad, where he’s just picking up quests and some Witcher contracts. He’s also been on the sidelines of Football Manager 24, getting Valencia to the Champions League semi finals, but getting knocked out, meaning he’s just got the slimmest of hopes left for a league win if Real Madrid and Barcelona ever slip up.</p>

<p>There’s been a fair bit of Marvel Rivals for <strong>Jason</strong>, where he’s been having to do an awful lot of carrying as the team healer. Alongside that it’s been Atlyss – &nbsp;“a very enjoyable MMO-style game with some, uh, very specific character models.”</p>
<p><strong>Nic</strong> and his wife have reached the final credits of Animal Crossing: New Horizons, so now there’s just all the catching of fishes, bugs and everything else still to do!</p>
<p>While <strong>Dom</strong> was feeling like he was going to be crushed under the sheer weight of a Lenovo Legion Go – he is, after all, a very small person, and it is a large handheld – <strong>Miguel</strong> has been mainlining gacha games including Girls Frontline 2, some Zenless Zone Zero, a pinch of Nikke and a whisper of Honkai Star Rail. Also some Phantasy Star Portable 2 Infinity on PSP!</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> wrapped up and enjoyed Star Wars Jedi: Survivor (except for that stupid map), and so has gone back to Another Crab’s Treasure. He also played the first few hours of Alone in the Dark on PS5 and trawled through FromSoftware’s back catalogue to play Ninja Blade on 360 – his PC version is stuck in German, somehow?</p>

<p>And aside from being disappointed by the final act of Destiny 2’s story after The Final Shape, <strong>Tuff’s</strong> been playing “writing a CV” for the first time in 28 years, which is both a new and old experience.</p>
<p><em>Now then, what have you been playing?</em></p>

The PS5 is over four years old now. If you’ve been playing since launch, there’s a good chance you’ve earned a bunch of achievements across all of the games you’ve played, and mementos from those milestones are clogging up your SSD. I knew my PS5 was doing this but I didn’t realize just how much space it was taking up. </p><p>Fortunately, I came across <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1hxngn2/psa_by_default_the_console_saves_a_14_second_clip/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1hxngn2/psa_by_default_the_console_saves_a_14_second_clip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this really helpful PSA by user wolfgang784</a></span> over on the PlayStation 5 subreddit today. “Just found over 2200 videos while trying to free up space and wondering why my media folder was so big,” the thread reads. Wolfgang784 points out that the PS5 records and stores a 15-second clip of your gameplay every time a trophy pops. If you aren’t vigilant, all of those clips can add up quick. Here’s how to fix that:</p><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li>Turn on your PS5</li><li>Go to the gear icon on the far right of the home screen to access settings</li><li>Choose the storage option and open up the media folder</li><li>toggle over to the trophy category and then select all and hit delete</li></ol><figure id="" data-id="65bc17c90d7e72dadc711832aac9210f" data-recommend-id="image://65bc17c90d7e72dadc711832aac9210f" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The media folder on the PS5 displays trophy clips.

At least that’s what I tell myself to explain why I never noticed this until now. Usually I’m sorting through albums for various games trying to figure out what precious clips I want to delete to try and win back one precious gigabyte here and another there from my precious SSD space. In addition to everything else, the dedicated trophy section of the media folder makes it easy to quickly nuke a ton of footage without worrying.</p><p>After that, you can go and change the settings for what’s recorded when you earn a trophy. It can be just a screenshot, or you can limit captures to only gold or platinum trophies. If you’re serious about documenting all of that stuff, then by all means feel free to hang onto it or move it to an external drive before purging. I am not, and instantly got back 7GB of storage. </p><p>That’s not much when it comes to behemoth game file sizes like <em>Destiny 2 </em>and <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, but as someone who recently went through their digital collection and downloaded a ton of stuff I’ve never played, 7GB is enough to install half a dozen smaller indie games or older PlayStation classics. One of these days I’ll install a bigger SSD. Until then, thank you, wolfgang784, for the super useful tip. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Metroid fans have been waiting for the better part of two decades for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/" data-ref-id="1100-6492292">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>. The sequel was officially announced in June 2017, and Amazon put up preorders sometime after that. Through the game's extended development, those orders still stood. Now, even after last summer's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-re-revealed-with-impressive-trailer-and-2025-release-date/1100-6524332/" data-ref-id="1100-6524332">re-reveal of Metroid Prime 4</a>, Amazon is canceling those longstanding preorders.</p><p>Presumably this is a mistake on Amazon's end, rather than anything dire like another delay for Metroid Prime 4 or even a cancelation of the game itself. GameSpot has reached out to Nintendo for comment. At least one person on GameSpot's staff noted that his six-year-old Metroid Prime 4 preorder--which was discounted to $48--was among the canceled orders today.</p><p>Following the initial announcement in 2017, Nintendo updated the status of Metroid Prime 4 in 2019 when it was revealed that the previous development was being abandoned in favor of a fresh start with Retro Studios, the same studio that developed the Metroid Prime trilogy. During the years between announcements, a standalone title called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metroid-dread-review-space-truckin/1900-6417757/" data-ref-id="1900-6417757">Metroid Dread</a> and a remastered edition of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metroid-prime-review/1900-2897768/" data-ref-id="1900-2897768">Metroid Prime</a> were released on Switch. Metroid Prime 2: Echoes and Metroid Prime 3: Corruption <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yes-metroid-prime-2-and-3-are-reportedly-still-coming-to-switch/1100-6511589/" data-ref-id="1100-6511589">are both reportedly getting remasters for Switch</a> as well.</p><p>Aside from those games, Metroid's leading woman, Samus Aran, remains a regular in the Super Smash Bros. franchise. But to stay current with Samus' in-continuity adventures, you should probably brush up on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-the-series-story-so-far/1100-6524350/" data-ref-id="1100-6524350">everything that's happened in the Metroid Prime games so far</a>. Nintendo recently reiterated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-re-emerges-reiterates-2025-release/1100-6527895/" data-ref-id="1100-6527895">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will be released in 2025</a>, but it doesn't currently have an exact date.</p>

That means we are now entering the 12th year of Sony’s home console. Usually, at this point in a console’s lifetime there are few if any new games being released for it. However, that’s not the case with the PS4, as there are over 20 games scheduled to arrive on the aging machine in 2025. </p><p>Here are 22 new games coming to PS4 (and other platforms) this year. Keep in mind this likely isn’t a complete list and it’s possible that more games will be announced for PS4 later in the year.</p><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li><strong><em>Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana</em></strong> (PS5/PS4, Switch) - January 7</li><li><strong><em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em></strong> (PC, PS4, PS5, Switch) - January 10</li><li><strong><em>Tales of Graces f Remastered</em></strong> (PS5, PS4, Switch, PC, Xbox One, XSX/S) - January 17</li><li><strong><em>Star Wars Episode I: Jedi Power Battles</em></strong> (PC, PS4/5, Switch, Xbox One, XSX/S) - January 23</li><li><strong><em>Sniper Elite: Resistance</em></strong><em> </em>(PC, PS4, PS5, XSX/S, Xbox One) - January 30</li><li><strong><em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak 2</em></strong> (PS5, PS4, PC, Switch) - February 14</li><li><strong><em>Tomb Raider IV-V-VI </em>Remastered</strong> (PC, PS4/5, Switch, Xbox One, XSX/S) - February 14</li><li><strong><em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em></strong> (PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, XSX/S ) - February 21</li><li><strong><em>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars</em></strong><em> </em>(PS4, PS5, PC, Switch, Xbox One, XSX/S) - March 6</li><li><strong><em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories and the Envisioned Land</em></strong> (PS4, PS5, Switch, PC, Xbox One, XSX/S) - March 21</li><li><strong><em>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls</em></strong> (PC, PS4, PS5, XSX/S) - March 21</li><li><strong><em>Atomfall</em></strong><em> </em>(PC, PS4/5, Xbox One, XSX/S) - March 27</li><li><strong><em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em></strong> (PC, PS4, PS5, XSX/S) - April 24</li><li><strong><em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</em></strong> (PS4, PS5, PC, Mobile) - June</li><li><strong><em>Double Dragon Revive</em></strong> (PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, XSX/S) - October 23</li><li><strong><em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> </strong>(PS4/5, PC, Xbox One, XSX/S) - 2025</li><li><strong><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></strong> (PC, PS4/5, XSX/S, Xbox One) - 2025</li><li><strong><em>Little Nightmares 3</em></strong> (PC, PS4/5, Switch, Xbox) - 2025</li><li><strong><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em></strong> (PC, Switch, PS4/5, XSX/S, Xbox One) - 2025</li><li><strong><em>Splitgate 2</em></strong><em> </em>(PC, PS5, PS4, XSX/S, Xbox One) - 2025</li><li><strong><em>The House of the Dead 2: Remake</em></strong> (PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, XSX/S) - 2025</li><li><strong><em>WWE 2K25</em></strong><em> </em>(PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, XSX/S) - 2025</li></ol><p>Now, as mentioned before with the PS2, it’s not unheard of for very popular video game consoles to keep receiving new game releases a decade after the device first hit the market. A big install base is a big install base. But usually, this far into a console’s lifespan, you might get, say, one or two new games. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-game-release-dates-of-2018-red-dead-2-smash-br/1100-6455204/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-game-release-dates-of-2018-red-dead-2-smash-br/1100-6455204/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">For example, in 2018</a></span>—12 years after the PlayStation 3 launched—we got two new PS3 games, and one was <em>FIFA 19. </em></p><p>What we’re seeing with the PS4 in its 12th year is unlike anything in modern gaming history. Nearly two dozen games, at least, are set to arrive on PS4 this year, and not all of them are sports games or old ports. Some are brand new remasters, others are smaller 2D titles, and some are big AAA games like <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> and <em>Elden Ring Nightreign.</em> </p><h2 id="h197330"><a id=""></a>Console generations aren’t the same as before</h2><p>And before someone jumps on me for suggesting PS4 games launching in 2025 is a bad thing, let me be clear: I’m not saying that. Most AAA video game studios have moved on to more powerful hardware, so I don’t think the industry is being held back by the PS4 (or the Xbox One, for that matter, which is also getting new games.)</p><p>The reality is that in 2025, the video game industry and market are very different than they once were. Back in the era of the PS2 and even PS3, tech was advancing rapidly from 2D to 3D to HD to 4K. New consoles felt more necessary every few years. That’s not the case in 2025. </p><p>The PS4 is still a fairly capable machine, especially for indie devs or people making smaller games or RPGs using pre-established tools and tech. And thanks to digital marketplaces, you don’t need to stock your game at Walmart to sell copies. It also helps that modern engines like Unreal and Unity are very scalable and flexible, so a single game can run on Switch, PS4, PS5, and even mobile devices. </p><p>Oh, and let’s not forget that some of the most popular games around right now—<em>Fortnite, Call of Duty Warzone, Genshin Impact, Overwatch 2, GTA Online, Minecraft, </em>and <em>Roblox</em>—are all on PS4, and still receive updates each month. There’s a giant group of players who don’t feel the need to move on because the big games they play every week are still active and alive on PS4, so it’s not shocking that devs are still making plenty of games for the 12-year-old console in 2025. </p><p>The real question now is whether the PS4 can last longer than the PS2. I think it can. Even if, come next year, we only see half as many PS4 games launch as we get in 2025, that’ll still be over 10. We might even be getting PS4 games up until and beyond the launch of a theoretical PS6. Wild stuff. </p><p>&nbsp; .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Earlier this week, Los Angeles and surrounding cities in California were struck by multiple wildfires and intense Santa Ana winds that caused catastrophic damage to Pacific Palisades, Malibu, and other areas. Major Hollywood events and pro sports games were canceled in the wake of the fires. However, Niantic has announced that it still plans to go forward with next month's Pokemon Go Tour: Unova - Los Angeles event in Pasadena's Rose Bowl stadium.</p><p>"Our team has been carefully observing the situation in Los Angeles with the well-being of Pasadena, greater Los Angeles, and of course our Niantic community," said Niantic's director of communications, Mark Van Lommel, in a statement to <a href="https://dotesports.com/pokemon/news/niantic-is-carefully-observing-the-situation-in-los-angeles-ahead-of-pokemon-go-unova-tour" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dos Esports</a>. "While we are currently continuing our preparations, any updates regarding the event will be shared as they become available."</p><p>The Los Angeles fires are still ongoing and have been hugely devastating to the community and the people who live there. Information about <a href="https://ktla.com/news/california/wildfires/heres-how-to-help-those-impacted-by-the-wildfires-across-southern-california/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">how to help the affected victims can be found here</a>.</p><p>Although the wildfires have also struck Pasadena, the Rose Bowl is currently undamaged and available for the Pokemon Go Tour: Unova - Los Angeles on February 21-23. Prior to the fires, Niantic announced that the event will mark the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-january-2025-events-raids-spotlight-hours-community-day-and-more/1100-6528604/" data-ref-id="1100-6528604">Pokemon Go</a> debut of Black Kyurem and White Kyurem ahead of their global rollout on March 1.</p><p>Late last year, Niantic revealed that it has used the activities of Pokemon Go players <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/niantic-used-pokemon-go-players-to-create-real-world-ai-navigation-model/1100-6527871/" data-ref-id="1100-6527871">to create a real-world AI navigation model</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-secret-lair-chaos-vault-previews-psychedelic-land-cards<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has released a preview of an upcoming <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> Secret Lair Chaos Vault drop. This more experimental spin-off of a Secret Lair, which quietly launched <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-announces-their-first-chaos-vault-drop-for-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">back in December</a>, is continuing its eclectic streak with some new psychedelic land cards.</p>

<h2>The Secret Lair Chaos Vault 2025 Drop</h2>

<p>IN an official blog post, Wizards of the Coast briefly restates the intention of the Secret Lair Chaos Vault drops. They are designed to be unexpected. Sales launching at unexpected times to selling unexpected items. The post also confirms an email list for updates on future Chaos Vault drops.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-lair-chaos-vault-basic-land-cards.jpg?itok=d_h9_YkZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-lair-chaos-vault-basic-land-cards.jpg?itok=JUXqkmW2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The post continues with a preview of the drop. Starting "sometime next week" the next drop will feature new basic land cards. These land cards showcase a vibrant art style with abstract, rainbow-like colors by artist Scott Balmer. They look more like background vignettes to a prog-rock album than a fantasy landscape.</p>

<p>If you are worried about cost, this latest Chaos Vault drop will try something different. Buying this Chaos Vault drop will get you ten copies of each basic land card by popular demand. That is fifty cards in total as part of this drop. In keeping with the chaotic nature of these drops, there is no current listed price.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-lair-chaos-vault-koi-pond-artwork.jpg?itok=Vf-wST80 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-lair-chaos-vault-koi-pond-artwork.jpg?itok=Bd4yyP-C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Lastly, the post ends with a tease of what other Chaos Vault drops will entail. It features several pieces of artwork by Rhonda Libbey, Heikala, Ashley Mackenzie, and kelogsloops. The artwork moves back and forth between watercolor vignettes, cozy anime imagery, and impressionistic koi ponds.</p>

<p>This promise of experimentality is in keeping with the first Secret Lair Chaos Vault drop. That drop, titled the Fairest Drop of All, had several cards in the style of art deco title plates. One card was illustrated in full profile. If this is maintained, Chaos Vault could serve as an outlet for alternative artists and to entice players with more eclectic taste.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-rumored-to-also-get-gears-of-war-hellblade-ii-and-age-of-mythology-from-microsoft/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>PS5 users might be treated to a full wave of Xbox games in 2025 as Microsoft continues its third-party push. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle by MachineGames is coming in Spring 2025, and DOOM: The Dark Ages will be available on PS5 at launch, but there's a lot more coming from Microsoft-owned studios.</p>
<p>Earlier today, insider Nate the Hate <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection-playstation-5-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> the latest rumors he heard from his industry sources. According to him, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 and Halo The Master Chief Collection will be released sometime this year for Sony's PlayStation 5 and even for the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, Windows Central's Jez Corden <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/a-new-rumor-suggests-final-fantasy-7-remake-is-finally-coming-to-xbox-in-2025-with-rebirth-heading-across-in-2026-as-more-xbox-games-head-to-ps5-and-nintendo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> having heard the same rumors about these games making the jump to other consoles. He also added a few more titles that are reportedly being prepared for a PS5 debut: Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, Age of Mythology, and even Gears of War 1 Ultimate Edition.</p>
<p>The latter in particular would mark the arrival of one of the most iconic Xbox franchises on its main console rival. Sure, it's a very old game at this point (the Ultimate Edition remaster launched in 2015), but it could be a sign that more games in the franchise originally created by Epic and now handled by The Coalition could be ported. After all, there have been rumors of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-collection-rumored-to-be-coming-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gears of War Collection</a> for years.</p>
<p>The announcement of the other two would definitely be easier to handle for Xbox fans. Senua's Saga: Hellblade II is <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a great game in its own right</a> (albeit far too similar to the first installment), but it's also a niche title that could certainly use all the sales it can get. The same goes for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/age-of-mythology-retold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Age of Mythology Retold</a> (which, however, still isn't available on Xbox consoles, either).</p>
<p>By the way, Corden even said these games could be released on the Nintendo Switch 2 as well as the PS5. Personally, I do have some doubts regarding Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, as that is a rather heavy game that might be really challenging to port onto a platform that is rumored to be quite a bit weaker than the Xbox Series S.</p>

In the podcast episode, Stiller implies they were working on <em>Severance </em>before the streamer’s existence was publicly announced, as he described the early experience as “developing this show for a platform that didn’t exist yet.” What we didn’t know at the time the series order made news is that Apple wasn’t convinced Scott should be Mark, and a year went by with no new developments on the show because they were trying to figure out how to get Apple on board with Scott starring.</p><p> “There was a long process of talking about other ideas. But, really, I was not going to do the show if [Scott] wasn’t going to do it. I kept saying that to them, and they were like, ‘Okay, maybe you’ll think of this actor. Maybe you’ll think of that actor,’” Stiller recalls. </p><p>Stiller was confused as to why the bigwigs at Apple were dragging their feet on accepting Scott, but changed their minds once they saw Scott read for the part. Taking it all in stride, Scott humbly admits his star power might not have been enough for the Apple head honchos. “I understood why they were feeling this way because, the first time I read this script, my first instinct was: ‘There’s no way I’m going to end up doing this. This is too good,’” Scott explains. “If I was Apple, I would likely be wanting a giant star to play this role.”</p><p>Since Apple came to their senses, Scott has gone on to garner an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series and a Golden Globe nomination for Beat Actor in a Television Series — Drama for his impeccable portrayal of Mark on <em>Severance. </em>Apple were saved from themselves, and we all have Stiller and his year-long persistence to thank for it. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-fans-are-doing-a-gta-6-and-losing-their-minds-over-hidden-half-life-3-clues-they-desperately-want-to-be-real<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Half-Life fans have waited years for Valve to do… something <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/half-life-3">Half-Life 3</a> related. That’s nothing new. But recent weeks have seen a step up in the hunt for clues, with some believing Valve has already started an elaborate alternate reality game (ARG) that will lead to the dramatic confirmation that Half-Life 3 is finally on the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This next level obsession, which GTA 6 fans will find instantly familiar, was kickstarted by Mike Shapiro, the voice actor behind Half-Life's mysterious G-Man. Late last year, in full G-Man mode, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-3-rumors-ramp-up-after-g-man-voice-actor-issues-cryptic-tweet-his-first-in-years">Shapiro published a cryptic tweet teasing some sort of news for 2025 alongside the tags #Valve, #Halflife, #GMan, and #2025</a>. It was Shapiro’s first non-reply tweet since he congratulated Valve on the success of VR exclusive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/half-life-alyx"><u>Half-Life: Alyx</u></a> back in December 2020.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That was enough to send the rumor-mill into overdrive, but since then all sorts of wild theories have emerged within the Half-Life community. Some who have analyzed Shapiro’s tweet to within an inch of its life believe he has started an ARG for Half-Life 3, connecting the dots in such a way to lead them to the ultimate prize in video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Half-Life fans obsess about numbers. Valve, famously, can’t count to three. But can it count to 197? It turns out that Shapiro’s X/Twitter post contained images of the cover art of his new song, <a href="https://youtu.be/_tYRar01hCM?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Best Long Dog</a>. Buried within this image is the number 197. Bizarre!</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/10/longdog-1736528102368.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">197! What does it mean? Image credit: Mike Shapiro - Topic / YouTube.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Best Long Dog is three minutes and 17 seconds long, aka 197 seconds long, because of course it is. Oh, and it came out 197 days after his previous song, Magnetic North. Weird!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s where the Half-Life community really steps up to the plate. Some fans theorize 197 is a reference to gold, or, more specifically, its stable isotope 197Au. This is Half-Life, after all! What’s gold got to do with anything? GoldSrc, pronounced "Gold Source,” is the original Half-Life engine. Eventually it was replaced by the Source engine, but the link is clear. Oh yeah, gold only has a single stable isotope, which means 197Au is the only gold isotope with no half-life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The plot thickens. 197 appears three times in relation to Shapiro: in the cover art of his song, in the length of the song, and in the days after the release of his previous song. Three times! Could 197 hint at a date? Some think so. Perhaps it’s July 19?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now we move on to fellow Valve game Counter-Strike 2, and what some believe to be hints at Half-Life 3 in the game. Remember we told you Shapiro’s song is called Best Long Dog? Valve renamed the Popdog hallway in map de_train to "Longdog."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a lot more to this apparent ARG, including even more numbers and people drawing lines in the snow. But the long and short of it is that Shapiro’s tweet, combied with changes to Counter-Strike 2, mysterious references to a dog and the number 197 are fuelling one of the most popcorn-worthy community obsessions since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-community-devastated-by-gta-6-trailer-announcement-no-show-after-moon-theory-proved-incorrect">GTA 6 fans started analyzing phases of the moon</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HalfLife/comments/1hy21ov/weve_lost_our_collective_minds/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redditor emsollas summed up the sentiment</a>. "I think we’re so starved with real information on our beloved HL3 (or even the notion of Episode 3) that we’re literally seeing signs where there are none," they said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yes Shapiro’s post is definitely leading, and there maybe something coming. But breaking down every bit of info and finding the 197 and trying to connect it is just... lunacy."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Officially, Half-Life 3 does not exist, despite the story ending on a cliffhanger with 2007’s Half-Life 2 Episode 2. In November, to mark Half-Life 2's 20th anniversary, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/never-before-seen-half-life-2-episode-3-gameplay-footage-and-ice-gun-revealed-in-new-documentary"><u>Valve opened up about its development</u></a> in a documentary that revealed never-before-seen work-in-progress footage, a brand-new Ice Gun, and a raft of new concept art. You can see the gameplay segment from the documentary in the video below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the details shown in the video, Episode 3 would have been set in the Arctic, and it would have focused on Alyx as a companion character. Aside from the Ice Gun, the footage shows a blob-like enemy that could split into multiple parts. According to the documentary, the team had completed a "collection of playable levels in no particular order" and expected to be able to release the game within a year or two.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve has plenty on its plate already, of course, including ongoing support of Counter-Strike 2, Dota 2, Steam itself, the Steam Deck, and new game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/deadlock"><u>Deadlock</u></a>. Could it also be working on Half-Life 3 alongside all those other projects?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

There’s multiple collaboration events, free recruitment opportunities, a new version of a popular character, new story content, and in-person experiences.</p>If you haven’t checked out Goddess of Victory: Nikke yet, it’s a free-to-play sci-fi RPG shooter from developer Shift Up that’s available for download on iOS, Android, and PC. You’re in charge of a group of android soldiers called Nikke and lead them in a fierce battle to reclaim the overworld from a vicious race of aliens called Raptures.<p data-cy="paragraph">The game has been a resounding success, recently celebrating its second anniversary as well as reaching 45 million downloads worldwide. Throughout its two years, it has collaborated with several renowned IPs, including Neon Genesis Evangelion, Chainsaw Man, Nier: Automata, Re:Zero Starting Life in Another World, and Dave the Diver. That tradition continues in 2025, with Shift Up recently announcing a collaboration with Stellar Blade as well as a second collaboration with Evangelion.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/03/45m-celebratory-1920x1080-en-1735928143021.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Stellar Blade collab will unite two popular games developed by Shift Up. Stellar Blade is an action-adventure game available on PS5 that shares a similar setting with Goddess of Victory: Nikke. You play as Eve, and your mission is to reclaim Earth from monsters called Naytibas after humans lost their battle against them and were forced to flee the planet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Evangelion collab arrives in February and will feature loads of new content. It will add two brand-new recruitable SSR characters, named Asuka: WILLE and Rei Ayanami (Tentative Name), and Sakura will be a free-to-obtain collaboration character. Plus, there will be new collaboration character costumes (including free-to-obtain costumes), a new 3D event map, new collaboration event storyline, and a new bullet hell minigame.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These two collabs are the biggest events on the horizon, but they’re not the only updates to come to Goddess of Victory: Nikke. Things got started on the first day of the year, with the addition of a new recruitable version of Rapi, the game’s heroine. Called Rapi: Red Hood, she’s an awakened form of Rapi who has taken on the power of another strong Nikke called Red Hood. The new version of Rapi is an SSR Nikke, the highest rarity in the game. Rapi’s upgraded variant was also accompanied by new events that delve deeper into her story for the first time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The start of the new year has also brought events that reward players with free chances to recruit characters. With the new events and story content, you can earn more than 100 recruitment opportunities in all. That gives newcomers or players who haven’t played in a while a chance to jump in and hit the ground running. Plus, the recruitment banner featuring popular character Scarlet: Black Shadow from last year’s New Year event will make a return.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/03/rewards-1735928173140.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The new year celebrations have also been happening in the real world, and that will continue with a pair of live concerts in Japan and South Korea.

It’ll then move on to Kyung Hee University Grand Peace Palace in Seoul, South Korea on February 15.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/03/concert-kv-en-1735928267895.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">For tickets and more information, you can visit the official websites for the <a href="https://nikke-concert.jp/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Japanese concert</u></a> and the <a href="https://nikke-concert.kr/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Korean concert</u></a>.

                <p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is looking for feedback from players as it proposes a new rule revolving around in-game currencies and transactions that would allow the current Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA), and the protections it grants to consumers, to apply to certain video game companies.</p><p dir="ltr">Historically, the EFTA has been used to protect consumers from unauthorized transactions and requires financial institutions to fix errors and investigate and correct illicit transactions. The CFPB wants some of those same rules to apply to game companies whose products resemble "consumer asset accounts" that allow for converting in-game currency or goods into real money.</p><p dir="ltr">Under that interpretation, new regulations would apply to games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox-game-client/" data-ref-id="5000-451936">Roblox</a> (which allows users to convert Robux into US dollars) and not games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>, where in-game currency and goods can be purchased but can't be converted into real cash or exchanged between players. It would also likely apply to platforms like Steam, where users can sell in-game goods like weapon skins and other cosmetics for cash.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the distinction, the CFPB is asking players more broadly to share their experiences when it comes to purchasing digital goods and services in-game. It's asking for players to share their stories about issues they've encountered when using in-game currency, the kind of help (or lack thereof) they've received when something has gone wrong, and what protections they would like to see when it comes to protecting their in-game transactions and accounts.</p><p dir="ltr">"Every year, Americans spend billions of dollars on video games and virtual worlds," the <a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/blog/lfg-looking-for-gamers-cfpb-wants-to-hear-about-your-video-game-loot/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CFPB writes</a> in its call for feedback and input from gamers. "A large portion of those expenses are purchases of gaming currency that is stored on a player's account and used for in-game transactions, like buying goods and services and person-to-person ("P2P") transfers. As detailed in our report on the financial risks of video games and virtual worlds, the ways in which these gaming currencies and accounts work is evolving rapidly, including to function more and more like banking and payment systems."</p><p dir="ltr">The CFPB goes on to state that gaming companies currently operate on the idea of "buyer beware," where users who run into issues converting currency, have their accounts hacked, or have their virtual goods stolen receive little to no help from game companies themselves. Those who encounter issues often have their refunds denied, may be banned from the game associated with their account, or are lost in customer service "doom loops" as they try to find answers, according to the CFPB.</p><p dir="ltr">"The proposed interpretive rule clarifies that gaming companies that are subject to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act could violate federal consumer financial law if they fail to address problems gamers have with their accounts," the CFPB writes. "The CFPB invites the public, including gamers, to provide comments and stories to our proposal."</p><p dir="ltr">The public will have until March 31 to submit a comment by emailing the CFPB.</p><p dir="ltr">"Your contributions will help us shed light on features in the gaming industry that increasingly resemble traditional banking and payment options," the CFPB writes.</p>

		<p>Now I am not going to suggest the people behind these leaks are making stuff up, but at this point, almost any Xbox exclusive title seems likely to come to PS5. Microsoft has broken the barrier and with PS5 sales massively outstripping Xbox sales throwing a bunch of older games to hungry PS5 players is a no-brainer.</p>
<p>Two reliable sources – NateTheHate and Windows Central’s Jez Corden – have been posting about the games in question.</p>
<p>“So, games that I have heard will be released multiplatform in 2025 beyond the obvious include Flight Simulator, which will come to PlayStation 5 and Switch 2, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/11/07/halo-the-master-chief-collection-review/">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> will be coming to PS5 and Switch 2 as well,” states Nate on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIhoTirZxlk">podcast.</a></p>


<p>If you are reeling from the idea of Halo on PlayStation, he also suggests that the rumoured Gears of War collection will also come to PS5.</p>
<p>Jez has confirmed he had also heard about Flight Simulator and Halo, and<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/a-new-rumor-suggests-final-fantasy-7-remake-is-finally-coming-to-xbox-in-2025-with-rebirth-heading-across-in-2026-as-more-xbox-games-head-to-ps5-and-nintendo"> adds</a> “I’ve heard that also Hellblade 2, Age of Mythology, and potentially Gears of War 1 Ultimate Edition are all also slated for PlayStation 5 this year, although I’m unsure if that includes the Nintendo Switch 2.”</p>

<p>Doom: The Dark Ages and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle are already set to land on PS5 this year.</p>
<p>It’s not all one way though, Nate also suggests that Final Fantasy VII Remake will land on&nbsp; Xbox this year with Rebirth following in 2026.</p>

However, back in 2010, we did get just such a game. </p><p><em>Transformers: War for Cybertron </em>is a third-person action shooter that lets you play through both sides of the civil war on the robotic planet of Cybertron. One campaign is focused on the Autobots and the other tells the story of the Decepticons. And don’t expect Earth or humans in this game, as it’s all about the bloody civil war that, eventually, leads to the fall of Cybertron (good name for a sequel) and the exodus of the Transformers. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers:_War_for_Cybertron&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers:_War_for_Cybertron" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>War for Cybertron</em></a></span> and its sequel, <em>Fall of Cybertron</em>, play like most other third-person action shooters of the day, complete with the <em>Gears of War</em>-inspired “Hold this button to look at something cool happening” feature. But that’s fine, because instead of boring soldiers shooting people, you get to play as giant transforming robots with silly names who use big guns to destroy other robots, and ayou can become a car or hover tank, too. </p><p><em>War </em>and <em>Fall </em>both know that people want action and sci-fi nonsense in a <em>Transformers </em>game, make the right call in giving you plenty of that. Also, I hope you like different-colored metal corridors filled with nameless robot drones who you blast away over and over again, because that’s mostly what you do in these games. That may not sound great, but because it’s covered in <em>Transformers </em>lore, characters, and weirdness, it still ends up being a lot of fun. And unlike most other third-person corridor shooters of the era, you can transform into a car or a hover tank whenever you want. While in either form you can move faster and gain access to more powerful weapons. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/bOM1T7sWvW4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/bOM1T7sWvW4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">They truly are more than meets than eye. </a></span></p><p>What’s wild to me is that I’m not a <em>Transformers </em>fan and I still enjoyed going back and replaying <em>War for Cybertron</em> earlier this week. If you <em>are</em> a <em>Transformers</em> fan, I expect you’ll get even more out of all the characters and lore shoved into these action-packed shooters. </p><h2 id="h13748"><a id=""></a><em>War for Cybertron</em> deserves a second life</h2><p>So how do you play <em>War for Cybertron</em> and its sequel in 2025? It ain’t easy. The games were pulled from digital storefronts years ago once Activision’s licensing deals expired, so you can’t just buy them on Steam. You can find used Xbox 360 copies floating around on eBay and other sites for under $30, but you’ll need an Xbox 360 console to play them, as none of the games are backward compatible. </p><p>There are other ways to find these games and play them on PC; perhaps you might check out some large archive of content on the internet. Once you get your PC version (I’m not asking how), <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wsgf.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=63&amp;t=24097&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wsgf.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=63&amp;t=24097" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can use this tiny tool</a></span> to unlock the framerate and play <em>War for Cybertron</em> at 120 FPS. </p><p>It’s a shame that Microsoft and Activision haven’t cut a deal with Hasbro to remaster or at the very least port these <em>Transformers </em>games to modern hardware so more people can play them. We know Hasbro wants these games made available again, so it seems like it comes down to Activision. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/transformers-war-cybertron-hasbro-activision-remaster-1850692571&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/transformers-war-cybertron-hasbro-activision-remaster-1850692571">The publisher claimed in 2023</a></span> that despite comments from Hasbro, it still had access to original code for the games. Over a year later, nothing has manifested and it’s still hard as heck to play these popular <em>Transformers </em>games. Which is a shame. </p><p>While we’ve continued to receive smaller <em>Transformers </em>games over the years, it’s been far too long since the last big-budget game based on the franchise hit store shelves. Hasbro and the other companies involved should work out a deal and get the <em>Cybertron </em>titles back on digital stores in 2025, giving <em>Transformers </em>fans who missed out a chance to play these fantastic games. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
