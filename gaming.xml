            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-shown-in-new-43-minute-long-gameplay-video/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is the game featured in December's IGN First, so fans of the upcoming first-person open world action roleplaying game can look forward to new content and reveals throughout the whole month. To start with, IGN posted the first 43 minutes of gameplay, which were taken from the PC version of the game. You can watch them in the embed below.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is still based on Crytek's CryENGINE technology rather than switching to the far more popular Unreal Engine by Epic Games. During <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-qa-half-of-the-voiced-lines-arent-related-to-the-story-at-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Gamescom 2024 chat with Martin Klima</a>, we asked him why. Here's what he had to say on the subject:</p>
<p><em>When we finished KCD, we took a look at the technology we were using and were considering our options, but we decided that keeping CryENGINE made the most sense for us because we spent a lot of time customizing it for our needs and I think we are very happy. I'm quite proud of the performance we have now.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>We have access to the latest version of the engine. Of course, we also wanted to keep our customization. In the end, although the engine that we have is not quite the same engine that Crytek uses for Hunt: Showdown, it is very close.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 Gameplay - The First 43 Minutes | IGN First" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F6GXG1HD6bg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Warhorse Studios still hasn't shared the game's system requirements. However, they did share that the game can run smoothly even on relatively low-end machines, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-runs-buttery-smooth-on-rtx-3050-wont-have-denuvo-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> by PR Manager Tobias Stolz-Zwilling in the first official Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 live stream:</p>
<p><em>We learned from what we did in KCD. We took way more time than in the first game for bug fixing, optimization, performance testing, and so on. We are working on this right now and not only on PC but also on consoles for the console players, so there's good news for everyone. Give us a tiny little bit more time, but I think by the end of the year, we should be able to tell you exactly what you should get. I personally at home play on a 3050 GPU I think, and it runs buttery smooth. As I said, give us some time on performance testing, and we will tell you soon.</em></p>
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is slated to release on February 11 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-tournaments-december-celebration/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>PlayStation is in the midst of celebrating the 30th anniversary of the brand. From bold sales to nostalgia-fuelled montages celebrating the label’s expansive history, players have been wrapped up in the last three decades of PlayStation-based gaming for several days.</p>



<p>Later this month, several esports tournaments will surface on PS5, utilising the onboard PlayStation Tournament platform that was added to the system towards the end of 2022.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-games-are-in-the-playstation-tournaments">What Games Are In The PlayStation Tournaments?</h2>



<p>It was revealed that a string of PlayStation Tournaments will unravel between December 6 – 8, allowing users to win exclusive celebratory prizes. These prizes will include in-game items and avatars created in celebration of PlayStation’s milestone.</p>



<p>Here are the games confirmed to be contributing to this special event:</p>



<ul>
<li>College Football 25</li>



<li>EA Sports FC 25</li>



<li>Guilty Gear Strive</li>



<li>Mortal Kombat 1</li>



<li>Madden NFL 25</li>



<li>MLB The Show 24</li>



<li>NBA 2K25</li>



<li>Tekken 8</li>



<li>UFC 5</li>
</ul>



<p>For some, the list is a little lacking – there are no FPS or racing options, which might seem a little short-sighted given the state of the esports industry and its preference for such games, but that’s a conversation for another day.</p>



<p>If you consider yourself a talented player in one of these games, you can sign up through the PlayStation Tournament function on your PS5, competing across one – or several – of these games in an attempt to win some exclusive prizes.</p>



<p><a href="https://compete.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation’s ‘Competition Center’</a> is the place to go to find out everything you need to know about this promotional event.</p>



<p>Will you be taking part in December’s PlayStation Tournaments? Let us know what game you’ll play on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Gray Zone Warfare Rip-off Appears On PlayStation Store]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-copy-playstation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gray-zone-warfare-rip-off-appears-on-playstation-store.1050399/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-copy-playstation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It was recently noticed that a knock-off copy of Gray Zone Warfare, ‘Gray Zone Attack’, has appeared on the PlayStation store, set to be released in 2025. It’s from a developer named ‘Esail’, and at first blush, it’s a carbon copy of the popular tactical-slash-extraction shooter that was released in April 2024.</p>



<p>The cover art featured on the PlayStation store was made using AI, and everything from the iconography on down is a thinly-veiled replication of Gray Zone Warfare.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-shameless">Shameless</h2>



<p>It’s the nature of the business – when a game becomes successful enough, replications of said game will surface.</p>



<p>Last year, I covered a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-switch-clone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">hilarious Last of Us clone</a> on Nintendo Switch called ‘The Last Hope’. It featured characters reminiscent of Joel and Ellie, slaying the undead and looking for a ‘brighter future’. It was pulled from the store not long after appearing, though.</p>



<p>Gray Zone Attack has appeared under similar circumstances. It’s listed on the PlayStation store as a single-player shooter, whereas Gray Zone Warfare is a PvEvP FPS. The game’s blurb and spiel reads could be describing MADFINGER’s GZW, though.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Prepare to enter a hostile and unpredictable world where danger lurks at every turn. In Gray Zone Attack, you’re part of an elite tactical unit sent to uncover the secrets of a devastated quarantine zone. Every decision matters, every bullet counts, and survival is never guaranteed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>“Every decision matters.”</em></p>



<p>MADFINGER’s slogan for Gray Zone Warfare is ‘every move matters’ – the audacity of this replication is mind-blowing.</p>



<p>On social media, MADFINGER’s Rick Lagnese wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>While #GrayZoneWarfare brings players tactical depth and strategic thrills, “Gray Zone Attack” might be a little too busy attacking the idea of originality. We prefer crafting something one-of-a-kind.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The full description of Gray Zone Attack talks of an immersive open world, customisable gear, tactical combat with realistic weapon handling, and a dynamic injury system. These are all features that sit front and centre in Gray Zone Warfare, which has been painstakingly crafted by MADFINGER over many years.</p>



<p>I’d bet hard cash this title will never see the light of day, and if it does, it’ll be some bizarre, stripped-down microtransaction farm.</p>



<p>What’s the most ridiculous copy of a game you’ve seen? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

The Victus is HP's lineup of budget-oriented gaming laptops. This model features a 15" 1080p display, a low-voltage AMD Ryzen 8 8845HS CPU, GeForce RTX 4070 GPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD. The RTX 4070 has a maximum TGP rating of 120W, which is actually quite impressive for such an affordable gaming laptop.

The best deal is definitely on the consoles themselves: the PS5 Slim Disc Edition has dropped to $424.99 (originally $500) and the PS5 Slim Digital Edition has dropped to $374.99 (originally $450). I would choose the Disc Edition because it's only $50 more and then I have the option to buy (and later sell or trade) physical disc media. But if you want to save some money and go the Digital Edition route, I would suggest getting the NBA 2K25 bundle, which also includes a game. Although the Fortnite Cobalt Star bundle has a fancy looking box, no actual game is included.</p></div><p id="playstation-5"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="PlayStation 5">More Playstation Cyber Monday Deals</h3></p><div catalogid="56b24fb1-b74e-4b45-8835-20eee9ba9746" id="211427"><div id="211427" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Metaphor: ReFantazio</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://howl.link/fmaa2am0vzacr" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> was released on October 11, so it's nice to see a nice 29% off discount so soon after launch.

Retailers usually release their hottest selling items in batches so that every sale event has at least some inventory reserved. That said, I also expect plenty of new, never before seen deals. Traditionally, Black Friday was known as the "retail holiday," where the best deals were found in-store, and Cyber Monday was known as the "online holiday," where the best deals were online only. Although today the lines have blurred, it is still true that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-vs-cyber-monday">many online only retailers still consider Cyber Monday the sale event of the year instead of Black Friday</a>. Expect some amazing sales to come out of online-only sites like Amazon, Newegg, Dell, HP, Lenovo and several online-only deals from traditional retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart. In fact, Amazon has taken the preemptive and already switched over to Cyber Monday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>The <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-crew-will-include-the-battle-pass-lego-pass-music-pass-and-more-starting-in-december" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recently announced changes to Fortnite Crew</a> have been accompanied by some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1h4udhl/why_is_no_one_talking_about_the_massive_xp_nerf/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">unpopular</a> <a href="https://x.com/ItsADAMO_/status/1863601685421281422" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">changes</a> to XP gains in Chapter 6 Season 1, with progress slowing compared with past seasons--a jarring shift after the just-ended Remix season was overly generous with XP.</p><p>As with every new Fortnite season, players spent Chapter 6's launch day binge-playing the new battle royale map and trying out all the new weapons and items. But a lot of folks noticed something odd after playing all day--they weren't as far along in the new battle pass as they'd normally expect to be. Whereas dedicated players could usually earn 20 or 30 levels just from playing a lot on day 1, this time around, a lot of folks (including myself) found their gains grinding to a halt before they hit double digits.</p><p>This is reportedly the result of some newly implemented major changes to how XP is primarily gained in Fortnite. Season-long milestones for battle royale have been removed entirely, there is now just one set of three daily quests for all modes combined instead of quests for each mode, and XP in other modes (Lego, Reload, OG, Festival, Save the World, and Creative) is now primarily time-based and hard-capped weekly--it only takes a few hours to reach the cap, and after that gains are reduced to a trickle.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/ItsADAMO_/status/1863601685421281422" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">According to dataminers</a>, Lego, Reload and OG modes all share one pool of weekly playtime XP, capping at 21 levels in total. Creative modes cap out at about 11 levels gained per week, Save the World caps out at nine levels, and Festival actually has a daily cap of just over one, single level. These caps only apply to passive, playtime-based XP, so any quests would provide an additional boost.</p><p>Battle royale and Zero Build, meanwhile, have had their passive XP removed entirely, which is why gains slow down so much once you finish the weekly and kickstart quests.</p><p>This is likely a consequence of the new changes to how Fortnite Crew works. With the new chapter, a Fortnite Crew subscription now includes the Lego Pass, the Music Pass, and the upcoming monthly OG Passes, but the rub is that you can only earn rewards on those passes while subscribed--you no longer get the battle pass for the duration for buying Crew at the start of the season. Since the price of a month of Crew didn't change, some trade-offs were to be expected, and so Epic Games rationing XP on a weekly basis so players progress at a more steady rate makes sense in that context.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, there's been a bit of a backlash to theses changes on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1h573kg/we_have_their_attention/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1h4x5on/does_epic_just_nerfed_the_daily_xp_of_each_mode/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reddit</a>, but Epic likely will wait and see how everybody feels in a couple weeks before making any changes. The company made a similar attempt to ration XP over the course of a season when Chapter 4 launched two years ago, with weekly quests that expired instead of staying until the season ended. It took nearly two months for Epic to revert that change, despite a similar response from fans. That said, this is the sort of thing that Epic can hotfix without a big update, so this status quo could change at any time.</p>

                <p>A low-quality video of what appears to be a Nintendo Switch 2 has emerged, prompting fan speculation over the as-yet-unseen console and the validity of this footage.</p><p>The video was posted on Chinese video site <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV19GzdYSEhe/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bibli</a> and was first spotted by <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/rumor-leaked-images-of-switch-2-joy-cons-surface-online/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Soup</a> (via <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-leak-joycon-looks-like-release-date-1851711427?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=SocialMarketing&amp;utm_campaign=dlvrit&amp;utm_content=kotaku" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>). The footage appears to show someone removing a joycon from the side of the Switch 2 screen by simply pulling it off. The controllers themselves seem to sport infrared sensors (on both the left and right joycons) and bigger shoulder buttons. This matches <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-images-have-allegedly-leaked-suggesting-powerful-leap-forward-for-nintendo/1100-6526551/" data-ref-id="1100-6526551">previous leaks</a>, which suggested that the Switch 2 would have magnetic joycons and a more complex controller layout, though it would also maintain the same basic design as the original Switch. However, the blurry footage could be fake, and feature a version of the console constructed using information from prior leaks.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote><div dir="ltr"><p>Edited video by me (since the original video is 5+ minutes long)</p><p>We can also see the man de-attaching the Joy-Cons at the beginning of the video <a href="https://t.co/RtIVDQJOlX" rel="nofollow   ">pic.twitter.com/RtIVDQJOlX</a></p></div>  — Adrien190303 #ThankYouToriyama (@Adrien190303) <a href="https://twitter.com/Adrien190303/status/1863624665647792557?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2024</a></blockquote>


  






  </div><p>Details about the upcoming console are still scant.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled">Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled</a> - the spruce-up of the racer once referred to as "objectively loads better" than Mario Kart by Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell, causing eyebrows to catapult clean off people's faces - is making its way to Game Pass this Wednesday, 4th December.
</p>
<p>
Crash Team Racing Nitro-Fueled is, of course, developer Beenox's effervescent remaster of 1999 PlayStation cult classic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crash-team-racing">Crash Team Racing</a>, which - alongside a significant audio-visual makeover - introduced elements from 2003's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crash-nitro-kart">Crash Nitro Kart</a> and 2005's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crash-tag-team-racing">Crash Tag Team Racing</a>. "[It's] is a gold-standard remaster," Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crash-team-racing-nitro-fueled-review-generous-remaster-of-a-cult-classic">his review</a> back in 2019, "capturing the loveably janky, off-brand spirit of classic CTR - and then some." 
</p>
<p>
"It's just plain, dumb fun, a game completely unashamed of itself even now," he continued. "I think that's probably why, even beyond the enormously generous treatment it's had from Beenox... CTR is still one of the best kart racers ever made." He then slapped it with a Eurogamer Essential, whereupon heads across the world began to explode, Scanners-style.

Crash Team Racing: Nitro-Fueled is the first game to be confirmed for Microsoft's December Game Pass line-up (you'll find <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-november-line-up-announced">November's over here</a>). It's also the latest in a slow trickle of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> titles to have hit the subscription service - following on from the likes of Spyro Reignited Trilogy, Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy, Diablo 4, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 - since Microsoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">$69bn acquisition of the publisher</a> last year.
</p>
<p>
And if you're not already a Game Pass subscriber, you might be interested to hear Microsoft recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-is-reinstating-its-11-game-pass-trial-but-only-for-pc">reinstated its previous £1/$1 14-day trial offer</a> - but only for PC.

GOG started it with a list of 100 games, including <em>Diablo </em>and <em>Resident Evil 1-3.</em></p><p><em>Warcraft I </em>and <em>Warcraft II </em>are being delisted from GOG “at the publisher’s request,” the company says. Their publisher, Blizzard, released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295730/warcraft-remastered-battle-chest-1-2-3-reforged-upgrades-windows-mac-blizzard-battle-net">remastered versions</a> of <em>Warcraft I</em> and <em>Warcraft II</em> the same day the preservation program was announced. You can still buy the games before they’re removed, and GOG is offering discount code  MakeWarcraftLiveForever, which shaves a little off the price for those buying a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gog.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fwarcraft_bundle">bundle containing both games</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's the best deal we've seen on this beloved <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy game</a> all year, including its discounted price during Prime Day in October.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Get Splendor Now for $19.99</h2><div catalogid="0641b3cd-4fd7-4dd4-904b-3f20f273a1e5" id="212898"><div id="212898" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Splendor Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Splendor was released in 2014 and has remained a popular title among board game enthusiasts since. The beauty of Splendor lies in its simplicity: It's a great game to bust out a family gathering for players of all ages and experience levels due to its intuitive ruleset and average 30-minute playtime. Once you get a handle on the basic premise of the game, there's room for plenty of strategy to come into play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an economic engine game designed around the concept that players are working to build an increasingly powerful economy to buy cards that earn them points (dubbed "prestige" in the world of Splendor). In good ol' Renaissance fashion, your currency is none other than gemstones, which are represented by multi-colored tokens. The end goal is to reach 15 prestige points, which you accumulate by purchasing cards worth variable amounts of points with the gems you collect.

                <p>There's a new era for NASCAR games coming in 2025, but fans may want to grab the previous titles while they still can. Motorsport Games, the company that until recently held the rights to make NASCAR racing games, has announced that all of its NASCAR titles and associated DLC will be pulled from digital storefronts on December 31.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/MSportgames/status/1862534587206836467" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>To the NASCAR game community!</p><p>From December 31, 2024, all NASCAR game titles and their DLC content will no longer be available for purchase on all digital storefronts but will remain available to play after this time. This includes the <a href="https://twitter.com/NASCARHeat?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NASCARHeat</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/NASCARRivals?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NASCARRivals</a>, and… <a href="https://t.co/7RyCQXuZUo" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/7RyCQXuZUo</a></p></div>  — Motorsport Games (@MSportgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/MSportgames/status/1862534587206836467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The silver lining from that announcement is that titles like NASCAR Heat, NASCAR Rivals, and NASCAR: Ignition will be going on sale before the games are delisted. All of the affected games and their physical disc counterparts will remain playable after January 1, 2025, they just won't be directly available for online purchases. </p><p>NASCAR branded games date back to 1991 with Bill Elliott's NASCAR Challenge, and the license has been utilized by several different gaming publishers over the decades. The current NASCAR rights holder is iRacing, which reportedly plans to release NASCAR '25 across all consoles and PC in Fall 2025. </p><p>Real-life NASCAR racers have previously shown their support for games based on their events. Perhaps most notably, Ross Chastain credited NASCAR 2005 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nascar-driver-uses-video-game-inspired-trick-on-final-lap-and-it-actually-worked/1100-6508780/" data-ref-id="1100-6508780">for his thrilling wallride finish in 2022</a>. NASCAR <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nascar-will-now-penalize-wall-riding-technique-popularized-in-video-games/1100-6511055/" data-ref-id="1100-6511055">subsequently banned the move</a> as a potential safety hazard. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-teases-squid-game-crossover-for-early-next-year<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
There's another Call of Duty collaboration on the way. Following crossovers from the likes of Tomb Raider, Crash Bandicoot, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>, and The Boys, Activision has revealed it's teaming up with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> to shove the streaming service's hugely popular Squid Game TV series into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> and Warzone early next year.
</p>
<p>
Squid Game, which follows a group of players attempting to survive a series of deadly children's games in order to win a BIG CASH PRIZE, took the world by storm when it first aired on Netflix back in 2021. It's been a long time coming, but the show is finally set to return for a second series on 26th December, and Netflix's promotional efforts are now in full swing.
</p>
<p>
And so enter Call of Duty. Activision unveiled its impending Squid Game crossover via a thirty second teaser trailer, in which a dashingly behatted Operator discovers a mysterious envelope emblazoned with symbols one 'X' away from a PlayStation copyright claim. It all ends with the Call of Duty logo emerging in a sequence reminiscent of Squid Game's opening titles, after which we're informed the collaboration is set to begin in January 2025.

<p>
Beyond that, specifics are limited to the point of non-existent. We do know the crossover is coming to both Black Ops 6 and Warzone early next year, but whether it'll offer anything more substantial than romper-suit-style premium cosmetics remains to be seen.
</p><p>
Call of Duty's Squid Game collaboration won't be the first digital take on the hit Korean television show to barrel out in conjunction with Netflix's season two promotions, however. The streaming service's own internally developed Squid Game Unleashed - a multiplayer "party royale" for iOS and Android devices - launches for subscribers on 17th December. It's just one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-has-over-80-games-currently-in-development-and-plans-to-launch-one-each-month">more than 80 titles currently in development</a> as part of Netflix's continuing push into the world of gaming, although one of its most intriguing projects - a new AAA game led by Halo creative head Joseph Staten - has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-closes-aaa-internal-studio-led-by-halo-creative-head-joseph-staten">now been cancelled</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for Call of Duty, it seems to be having a strong 2024. Microsoft recently announced Black Ops 6 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-records-for-game-pass-subscriber-adds-on-launch-day-says-microsoft">managed to set a record</a> for most "Game Pass subscribers adds on launch day" - a record previously held by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> following its launch last year.
