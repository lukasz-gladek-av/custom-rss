            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-sales-one-million<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher GSC Game World has announced that&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>sales have already crossed a big milestone, and the game has only been on release for two days.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/4455843903878201787" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam announcement</a>, a million copies of&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>have been sold since the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-delayed-once-again-november" rel="nofollow">launched on Wednesday</a>, a feat for which GSC Game World thanks the players who've already bought&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>.</p>

<p>The game's sales achievement is even more impressive when considering that it was a day-one Xbox Game Pass release as well, which means that a million players have bought&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>in addition to those who've checked it out as part of Microsoft's subscription service.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-sales-radar.jpg?itok=sMtIWCLl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-sales-radar.jpg?itok=Q1J2zd4F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is off to a very strong start sales-wise.</figcaption></figure><p>Although&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s sales performance has been strong, the game hasn't been without its issues. Its Steam reviews are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">broadly positive at time of writing</a>, but even many of those who recommend the game acknowledge that it's got more than its fair share of bugs (or "anomalies", if you will).</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1859265478276894856" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday</a>, GSC Game World acknowledged that&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>has some "rough edges", but that hotfixes to correct some of the game's most egregious bugs are on the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following those fixes, the development team has pledged to release larger updates that will include extra content for&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>, with a roadmap for the game on its way in December.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>, it's the second mainline entry in GSC Game World's&nbsp;<em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>series, which combines open-world RPG-inflected gameplay with a non-linear, hands-off approach to exploration and combat.</p>

<p>The game has had a long and troubled development history; it was first revealed in 2010 before numerous delays and studio troubles saw the game shelved for a number of years.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>was then <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-heart-of-chernobyl-release-date-announced" rel="nofollow">reintroduced at E3 2021</a>&nbsp;with an intended April 2022 release date, although that was naturally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/post-apocalyptic-shooter-stalker-2-delayed-until-december" rel="nofollow">pushed back</a> several times. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia in early 2022 also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-developer-reportedly-leaving-ukraine" rel="nofollow">significantly impacted development</a> for GSC Game World, which is based in the besieged country.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/stalker-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's also available as part of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/all-confirmed-xbox-game-pass-november-2024-games" rel="nofollow">November's Xbox Game Pass lineup</a>.

            <p>The mutant enemies in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> are very hungry. Hungry not only for your flesh, but also all the bullets in your AK-47. It can take entire clips of ammo to take down some of these tough beasts, and you get nothing back for killing this wildlife except the hollow satisfaction of pest control. Alongside the bugs and performance issues, it's a common enough complaint to players of the first-person <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> shooter that it's already been addressed by a modder, who has created a tweak to lower the health of various dogs, boars, and bloodsuckers. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The simply named <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/41">Lower Mutant Health</a> mod by NexusMods user "Fredrik" will cut each enemies health by either 25% or 50%, depending on your preference. "I found that the mutants and creatures of the zone were borderline annoying," said the modder, who felt strongly enough about it that they reduced the health, even though there are some creatures they haven't encountered yet. "I haven't seen them yet and can as such not judge whether or not their health is unreasonable."</p>
<p>It's not the only mod that has cropped up. It's only been a few days since the game's release but already we have a mod that will <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/77">reduce the painfully high repair costs</a> of your guns and armour, another that lets you <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/48">sprint for longer</a> without getting tired, and even one that introduces <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/10">slow motion "bullet time"</a> to the game. </p>

<p>It's worth noting that the radioactive sequel, for all its foibles, is meant to be a harsh and tough misadventure that forces you to make firm decisions. It's one of the many things James liked about it in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-review">his review</a>. For example, you need to decide what items you can afford to carry and what you must leave by the roadside to avoid becoming encumbered. But if you're happy to ignore the design intentions of the game, you can always install this mod that allows for <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/78">infinite carrying capacity and non-decaying weapons</a>. Fair warning, this will pretty much nullify a core pleasure of the game. Here's how James described the game's approach to difficulty:</p>
<blockquote>I’ve been battered and sometimes frustrated by S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2, but ultimately there is something admirable about its commitment to challenging you – especially when it simultaneously provides just enough tools to avoid becoming unfair. Between that, its punchy shooting, and some properly superb atmosphere-building, it’s done enough to earn the mantle of Good Game.</blockquote>
<p>One thing I do like, though, is this mod that <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/52">reduces the stamina cost of jumping and knife attacks</a>. Because, god, the platforming puzzles are already shonky enough without having to take a breath between every leap. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/igneditorial/lists/nintendo-switch-online">all the games available on Nintendo Switch Online here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong Land offers a condensed version of the side-scrolling gameplay in Rare’s much loved 1994 SNES classic Donkey Kong Country, with different level design and boss fights. As you’d expect, it stars Donkey Kong and his nephew Diddy Kong, who team up to defeat King K. Rool and collect many, many bananas.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1859764097480355961?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 22, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The game did well enough to get three sequels: Donkey Kong Land 2 (1996), based on Diddy's Kong Quest; Donkey Kong Land 3 (1997), based on Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!; and a Game Boy Color version of Donkey Kong Country (2000).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Cranky Kong doesn't think Donkey Kong has proven himself to be a hero yet. So, he decides to work out a deal with the closest villain that he knows. K.

And the only response is for Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong to go off on another adventure!</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">The Game Boy launched in 1989 with the likes of Super Mario Land, Tetris, Baseball, and Alleyway, all of which are now on Nintendo Switch Online. Other Game Boy games on the service include Metroid 2 – Return of Samus, Kirby’s Dream Land, Super Mario Land 2 – 6 Golden Coins, The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening DX, and Wario in Wario Land 3.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Donkey Kong, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a>, a remake of the Nintendo Wii original that was also ported to Nintendo 3DS, launches on Switch in January.

    <p><span>Farewell to Penacony with Sunday and Fugue.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 2.7 update for <em><a title="Games > Honkai: Star Rail [32 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a></em>, dubbed “A New Venture on the Eighth Dawn,” will launch on December 4, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [178 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-929490"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>This update brings the final chapter before the Express sets its course for the mysterious realm of Amphoreus, the Eternal Land. With the journey in Penacony coming to a close, a new story is set to unfold, featuring the debut of two new playable characters, Sunday and Fugue. In addition to these characters and storylines, Version 2.7 also offers Trailblazers a range of immersive experiences to enjoy.</p><p>In the previous story arc, Black Swan suggested that the Crew venture to Amphoreus, a realm so enigmatic that even the Aeon of Trailblaze, Akivili, could not reach. Curious yet cautious, Navigator Miss Himeko decides to gather intel on this destination. Meanwhile, the Crew makes a final stop in Penacony, reuniting with old friends and creating lasting memories before embarking on their next journey.</p><p>The memories of that ‘performance’ at the Penacony Grand Theater are as vivid as if they happened yesterday. It’s not just the Astral Express or Penacony that’s awakened from its dream—Sunday has, too. Having stepped down as head of the Oak Family, he has chosen to “descend to the mortal realm and see what this world is truly like.” Casting aside blessings from both Harmony and Order, Sunday sets out to pursue his vision of a utopia as a mere mortal. With the help of a secret Pepeshi named Wonweek, he returns to Penacony with one wish—to give a final, unforgettable performance before beginning his new journey. His robe and hood provide a fresh appearance and conceal his identity for his last dance in the “Planet of Festivities.”</p><p>While in combat, as a 5-star Imaginary character, Sunday has unique support skills. His Skill allows teammates to immediately take action while increasing their DMG dealt. If the teammate has a summon, both can immediately take action, and the DMG Boost effect is even more evident. Using Sunday’s Ultimate can regenerate Energy for one teammate, as well as causing the character and their summon to be blessed with “The Beatified.” A halo will appear on “The Beatified” teammate, boosting their CRIT DMG.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Another character soon to arrive is Fugue, who Trailblazers know as their old friend—Tingyun. Once a tactful foxian girl, she now finds her name, appearance, and even identity stolen. Fate, however, has left her a slender thread of hope, though the mark of Destruction still stirs restlessly within her. Tingyun barely escaped death after her clash with Phantylia during version 1.2’s main storyline and was saved only by the intervention of Madam Ruan Mei from the Genius Society, who granted her a second chance at life. Recently, Himeko and Welt visited Madam Ruan Mei and took it upon themselves to bring Miss Tingyun home, renewing her journey back to the familiar.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_929491"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Fugue is a 5-star Fire character with an affinity with support one teammate in reducing enemies’ Toughness regardless of Weakness Type. When Fugue is in combat, enemy targets will be inflicted with the “Cloudflame Luster” effect. When “Cloudflame Luster” is reduced to 0, the target will take Weakness Break DMG again. Furthermore, when teammates attack Weakness Broken enemy targets, they will also deal Super Break DMG. Not only that, through her Skill, Fugue can increase ally characters’ Break Effects. When she uses her Ultimate, she deals Fire DMG to all enemies regardless of Weakness Type and directly reduces all enemies’ Toughness.</p><p>Additionally, the limited 5-star characters, General Jing Yuan and Firefly will have their return in the first and second halves of the Version 2.7 warp event, respectively. Their formidable assistance make them invaluable allies for your future journeys.</p><p>Beyond new characters and storylines, Version 2.7 introduces an immersive experience aboard the Astral Express’s new Party Car, blending elegance with a sense of nostalgia. Here, a spacious reception area with a sleek marble bar and a classic bartending robot awaits. With the Cosmos as their backdrop, players can enjoy a drink with the Express Crew or quietly reflect by the window, letting the view inspire their thoughts.</p><p>Ascending the stairs, players will find the Trailblazer’s personal quarters. In the “Cosmic Home Décor Guide” event, they’ll transform an empty storage room into a cozy haven, adding areas like a bedroom and bathroom. Using Express Funds earned from tasks, Trailblazers gather furniture piece by piece, crafting a space that reflects their journey through the stars.</p><p>Looking ahead, as the game prepares for Version 3.0, it will introduce the Path of Remembrance, featuring characters with unique summons known as memosprites.

			<p>The Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director recently apologized for the difficult Platinum Trophy of the game, vowing to never make another so difficult in the future.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-34152657">Daily Star</a>, director Naoki Hamaguchi discussed the difficult Platinum Trophy, which requires multiple playthroughs of the game and completing mini-games at hard difficulty. He apologized for how difficult it is to unlock and assured that he would never make one so difficult to obtain again, so trophy hunters should have far fewer problems mastering the third and final part of the Final Fantasy VII Remake project.</p>
<p>To Daily Star, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi also <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-wont-34152228" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reiterated</a> how the game won't be getting any DLC to have the sequel out as soon as possible and how the third entry in the series is likely to shake up the formula of the second game in the Remake trilogy, as he wants to add a <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-director-wants-to-add-a-different-twist-for-a-new-and-exciting-experience/">different twist for a new and exciting experience</a>. This new experience will likely involve the Highwind airship, as the team is fully committed to delivering a <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/">freely explorable map using the airship.</a></p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PlayStation 5, and it is played best on <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-patch/">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> until the game finally hits PC on a yet-to-be-confirmed date. You can learn more about the game in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

            <p>BioWare has released a rather hefty patch for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, which among a myriad of bug fixes, also adds some quality of life changes. </p>
<p>This includes more filters to its photo mode and new weapon icons. Players will now also be able to bind arrow keys to input mappings, thanks to this recent patch, while screenshot file names from photo mode are now "simplified".</p>
<p>As for those rings, new ones can now be compared against both equipped ring slots. Previously when you picked up a new ring to put on your finger, it would only compare the stats against one of the rings you had equipped. </p>

<p>On the bug side of this Dragon Age: The Veilguard patch, BioWare has implemented over 40 fixes. These cover crashes (BioWare has "eliminated" the causes for some of them - hurrah!), and some odd facial expressions from Rook's first meeting with Emmrich.</p>
<p>Also, companions should no longer get stuck on balance beams now, which I am sure they will be pleased about.</p>

<p>On its release, we awarded Dragon Age: The Veilguard a shiny five out of five stars.</p>
<p>"It is the strongest and loudest answer BioWare could have mustered for the people still doubting whether it could do it. The answer is yes, emphatically. The Veilguard is spectacular. BioWare is back," our Bertie wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Eurogamer's Dragon Age: The Veilguard review</a>.</p>
<p>The game launched to "solid" sales here in the UK, though has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-sales-solid-in-uk-softer-across-rest-of-europe-report">numbers "nearly 21 percent lower" than Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth across Europe</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, GSC Game World <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1859930792564285907" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced </a>via social media that STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl has already sold one million copies, and 'many more' have joined the Zone via Game Pass. It's not entirely unsurprising given the massive amount of hype (and Steam wishlists) the game had garnered over the years.</p>
<p>It's probably not nearly enough to recoup the development costs, though. GSC Game World told me during <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-gamescom-qa-gsc-game-world-talks-about-the-final-rush-to-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Gamescom 2024 chat</a> that the studio was massive, with over 430 employees working on STALKER 2. The social media blast also claimed this was only the beginning, and indeed, on launch day, GSC Game World wrote an open letter to fans acknowledging the game's rough edges outlined in reviews.</p>
<p><em>There are so many things in the game that we are incredibly proud of. Nevertheless, STALKER 2 is a massive game. We understand that in such a game, there may still be rough edges: we literally haven't released anything of this scale before. We're absolutely committed to being here, monitoring your feedback, and quickly fixing any issues that need our attention. In the first days after release, we'll be working with hotfixes, rolling them out as precisely as possible, but as frequently as we can. Then, we'll switch to larger updates that include constant improvements. There will also be free in-game content — we'll share its roadmap later in December. We have big plans for the STALKER universe. In a way, today is both a return and the beginning of a grand new journey.</em></p>
<p>We already <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-getting-hardware-rt-cross-platform-mods-and-multiplayer-post-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know</a> that features like hardware ray tracing, mod tools to make cross-platform mods and even multiplayer modes will be released after launch. The Ultimate Edition of STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl also includes access to the Season Pass, which is already guaranteed to add at least two expansions to the game at some point in the future.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[STALKER 2 Has Sold 1 Million Copies, With ‘Much More’ Players on Game Pass]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-1-million-copies/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-has-sold-1-million-copies-with-%E2%80%98much-more%E2%80%99-players-on-game-pass.1042743/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-1-million-copies/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>GSC Game World has just revealed that STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl has sold one million copies since being released on November 20. In a post on social media, the team also revealed that ‘much more Stalkers’ played the game through the Game Pass subscription service.</p>



<p>STALKER 2 is a relatively divisive game that’s proving to be either a hit or miss for players worldwide. However, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my recent review for STALKER 2</a> branded it a major success that’s well worth your time.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-success-in-the-zone">Success in The Zone</h2>



<p>In the post on social media, GSC Game World wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>No wonder it feels a bit crowdy in the Zone. </p>



<p>A million copies were sold, and much more Stalkers joined the artifact hunt with Game Pass. </p>



<p>This is just the start of our unforgettable adventure. The Heart of Chornobyl emanates stronger with each of us. </p>



<p>Thank you, Stalkers!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>STALKER 2 was a long time coming. On and off, the team was working on Heart of Chornobyl for more than a decade, undergoing many struggles and tribulations, least of all being the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which uprooted the studio and led to the tragic passing of some GSC developers.</p>



<p>It’s a big win for Game Pass, it seems. GSC hasn’t been forthcoming with the numbers, but stressing that ‘much more Stalkers’ are enjoying the game through the Game Pass service is an indication that it’s popular enough on the platform. Despite it being ‘free’ on Game Pass, the game sold like wildfire on some platforms – on Steam, it peaked at over 100,000 players on launch day.</p>



<p>Have you given STALKER 2 a try yet? If not, let us know why on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>Sega's iconic fighting series is making its 3D PC debut on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3112260/Virtua_Fighter_5_REVO/">Steam</a> this winter with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter-5">Virtua Fighter 5</a> R.E.V.O, 18 years after its original release.</p>
<p>It's a remaster of the fifth entry in the series, but with all the modern requirements: 4K graphics, high-res textures, and rollback netcode support to optimise online play.</p>
<p>It will also include new online modes to compete with up to 16 other players, including Tournaments and League. You can check out the game's intro in the trailer below.</p>

<p>Virtua Fighter 5 was first released in 2006 in the arcades and was followed by PS3 and Xbox 360 ports in 2007. A number of revisions were made over the years since, culminating in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter-5-ultimate-showdown">Virtua Fighter 5 Ultimate Showdown</a> on PS4 in 2021. It's this version that is being ported to PC, with the new moniker R.E.V.O.</p><p>Technically it's not the first time it's been playable on PC, though, as Virtua Fighter 5 features as a minigame in Yakuza 6, which is available on PC. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter-2">Virtua Fighter 2</a>, the 2D Mega Drive fighter, is also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/71115/Virtua_Fighter_2/">already on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Still, this is excellent news for fans of Sega's somewhat dormant series. In an interview earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-developing-another-virtua-fighter-game">Sega confirmed a new Virtua Fighter game was in development</a>. It's unclear, though, if this was referencing this PC port or a new game entirely - presumably <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/virtua-fighter">Virtua Fighter</a> 6.</p>
<p>Both Capcom and Bandai Namco have seen great success with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> and Tekken 8 respectively, so perhaps Sega is hoping its own Virtua Fighter can make a triumphant return.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-announces-flurry-of-projects-including-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi">Sega is also looking to revive classic series</a> like Crazy Taxi, Shinobi, and Jet Set Radio.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new Silent Hill 2 patch is now live on PC and PlayStation 5, addressing some PS5 Pro-specific issues and much more.</p>
<p>The 1.06 patch focuses on fixing various issues on both platforms, including the widely reported visual glitches on PlayStation 5 Pro. Other PlayStation 5-specific fixes include audio, map and blocker fixes, boss animations, and more.</p>
<p>The new patch also addresses many issues on PC, including the interference between saving a game and properly performing vibrations on the controllers, improved mouse sensibility and mouse input, and more. The full patch notes are available on Konami's <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/silenthill/2r/news/eu/en/update_106" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>
<p>Despite some issues here and there, developer Bloober Team did an excellent job remaking Silent Hill 2, developing their best game to date. You can learn more about it by checking out Chris' <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Silent Hill 2 is the best game Bloober Team has made. A faithful reimagining of the original, bringing it to the modern day without losing what made the original the best horror game ever, using modern game mechanics to improve where they could, and expanding on what was already an engrossing world. Without any shadow of a doubt, a resounding success, one that will likely come as a surprise to many.</em></p>
<p>Silent Hill 2 is now available on PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

            <p>Long before Hideo Kojima made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">the first triple-A walking simulator</a>, he was trying to spin sunlight into bullets. The game in question, Boktai: The Sun Is In Your Hand, is a Game Boy Advance title from 2003, in which you play a vampire-slaying gunslinger. The gun you're slinging is a "solar-powered" pistol, which you could charge up using a cartridge-mounted photometric sensor by physically standing in sunshine. This was 13 years before the launch of Pokemon Go. Sadly, Boktai's debut didn't result in city parks or rooftops being flooded by crowds of GBA-wielding undead killers. But it was a fun gimmick and the game itself is good enough to carry it - an isometric dungeon-crawler in which you have to find a vamp's coffin and drag it to the surface for purgation.</p>
<p>Three sequels followed, and then Daddy Konami called time on the series. But Boktai lives on in the shape of <a href="https://chickenhat.itch.io/kura5-bonds-of-the-undying">Kura5: Bonds Of The Undying</a>, a non-canonical fangame which remixes the first game with one of its successors, Lunar Knights. It's a free downloadable experience, and as such, the old baked-in photometric functionality is gone, but the solar charging mechanic has been overhauled to work with an online real-world weather-tracking system. The 1.0 version launched this month - here's a trailer.</p>

<p>And here's some blurb from developer ChickenHat.</p>
<blockquote><p>It's neither a full remake nor a sequel, but a remix of both familiar Boktai staples and new elements that seek to recreate the magic that we all loved from the series. Kura5's weather system knows where you are in the real world, so there's no need for a solar sensor. In-game events may even play out differently depending on if you play in darkness or in light... And that's just the start!</p> </blockquote>
<p>The game gives you two characters, sun-gunning cowgirl Annie and vampire swordsman Emil. You can switch between them by playing in the day or after dark. That's right, Kura5 is designed to be played round the clock, but you can switch off the weather/day-tracking functionality and play offline if you prefer.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kill-the-man-in-the-house">Kill The Man In The House</a> is a video game title I can get behind. It tells me exactly what I need to do before I even boot up the game, which is otherwise powerfully weird-looking. The cover art is reminiscent of a children's book, if it were for adults. Or a lost episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BPLXepRC8E">Ed Edd and Eddy</a>, where a fourth older sibling (Eddie) acts on his murderous intent and engages in some slick <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPSing</a>. Either way, there's a demo out on Steam and despite being very short and limited, I am excited for its future.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In Kill The Man In The House - Kill House, I'm going to call it - you have a revolver, an uzi, and a shotgun. Press F for a satisfying kick. Press Space to double or even triple jump. Land a headshot and there's a chance you'll enter slow-mo for a brief period. Oh and red barrels explode. Follow the compass at the top of your screen to lead you to the aforementioned Man, and once he's been killed, you need to get back to your car. Fin.</p>
<p>While the assassination process is similar to lots of other minimalist FPS games, I do think Kill House' foundation is strong. The controls are responsive, the guns have character, and the gore is gratifying. Also, the layout of the demo's level is well thought out, with buildings and barrels positioned in ways to promote stylish violence.</p>

<p>Really, I think it's the game's surreal, polygonal art style and how that intertwines with the violence that elevates it beyond a normal FPS to a fun, experimental one. I love the feel of being a cold-blooded assassin seeking awful bastards who have taken up residence in kaleidoscopic reflections.</p><p>It's all about the little things, like how you start off next to your car, a bodyguard with his back turned to you -  a cue to punt him into the stratosphere. And how the demo opens up as you round a corner and the sharp corners unveil a jagged valley of reds and greens and yellows, the man's house nestled in this surreal condo. Not to mention that some enemies will slide and ragdoll upon death, leaving bloody trails that act like you've constructed your very own cobbled path to the next victim.</p>
<p>It's worth mentioning that there's no official release date just yet and that the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2467950/Kill_the_Man_in_the_House/">Steam demo</a> is very short and composed of a single mission. But more updates are planned, with "many features and refinements to come". These include NPCs, pickupable, stackable and destructible objects, fire propagation, driveable cars, customisable loadouts, and large open-ended levels. Goodness me.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> is set to receive "some surprises" later this year, the game's director Feng Ji said, suggesting DLC is indeed on the way.</p>
<p>The game won the fan-voted Game of the Year award at last night's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTDmABPisP8&amp;t=10102s">Golden Joysticks</a>, with Ji making the comment during his acceptance speech.</p>
<p>"Of course, you might have already completed our game," he said. "That's perfectly fine too, Keep following us, and there might just be some surprises waiting for you later this year."</p>

<p>So what could those surprises be?</p>
<p>At the very least, Xbox players are still waiting to get their hands on the game. Its release on Microsoft's platform was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-wont-be-on-xbox-at-launch">delayed as it needed more time for optimisation</a>, though rumours swirled around a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confusion-over-black-myth-wukongs-missing-xbox-release-follows-claims-of-playstation-exclusivity">PlayStation exclusivity deal</a>.</p>
<p>At the least, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-not-due-to-platform-limitations-microsoft-reiterates">Microsoft reiterated the delay was not due to "platform limitations"</a>. A release date still has not been given, three months after its launch, but could still arrive before the end of the year.</p>
<p>More interestingly, Ji's comment further suggests DLC is on the way. Back at launch, an FAQ on the game's website noted DLC and "non-pay-to-win in-game purchases" may be released in future.</p>
<p>After release, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-05/investor-who-risked-it-all-on-wukong-scores-another-sales-win">Bloomberg</a> reported Game Science was working on an expansion for the game, following in the footsteps of FromSoftware with its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a>.</p>
<p>Multiple rumours have also circulated the DLC will release in early 2025 to coincide with Chinese New Year. So perhaps Ji's surprise is merely a release date announcement this side of Christmas. Looking at you The Game Awards!</p>
<p>"Its dramatic and spectacular boss fights just about keep Black Myth: Wukong afloat, but behind all its glitz and glamour is a frustratingly hollow and rudderless action game," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-review">Eurogamer Black Myth: Wukong review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/22/dynasty-warriors-origins-takes-the-series-back-to-its-roots-to-find-its-future/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We have been here before. Dynasty Warriors Origins is the tenth mainline entry in a franchise that has spun out into samurai, giant robots, JRPG heroes, and even the odd Hyrulean legend along the way. But Dynasty Warriors is where it all started, where the Musou hack and slash genre began, and with Dynasty Warriors Origins the team at Omega Force are starting once more, reimagining their headline series for the modern day. Our hands on was a commanding four hours long, and crucially, when time was called, we didn’t want to stop!</p>
<p><iframe title="DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS - Gameplay Features" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C25kV-6Qrs8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In the moment-to-moment gameplay, this is classic Dynasty Warriors. While it might be a reset for the series, your approach to battle is the same here as it has been across all of the Musou games. Red indicators on the map show you where enemy strongholds and officers are, and you make your way to them to support the allied forces, and to progress the battle further, gaining ground as you go. As any fan of the series knows, it starts out easily enough, but soon you’re trying to fight on multiple fronts and juggling thousands of enemies. It’s a simple gameplay loop, but one which continues to engage and enthral, even after all this time.</p>


<p>Omega Force has given you plenty of tools to despatch those thousands of enemy troops, and combo after combo, swinging blade after swinging blade, you’ll chop those numbers back down to zero. It’s fair to say that Dynasty Warriors will immediately test the quality of your Square button, but the further you progress, the more variety you can find in this lethal game of last one standing.</p>


<p>Parrying and evading play a substantially bigger role than they have done previously, though it’s not suddenly turned Dynasty Warriors into a Soulslike. You’ll need to utilise them both to defeat the stronger enemies you come across though, and getting it right rewards you with some very cool animations, and a hefty chunk off the enemy’s guard gauge.</p>
<p>At its best, Dynasty Warriors Origins makes you feel like a super-powered warrior, capable of dispatching entire battalions of enemy soldiers by stringing together dynamic and visually rewarding combos. Even hours into our hands on, I was having a hell of a lot of fun, helped along by your steadily increasing skills, improved weaponry and new tactics.</p>
<p>One of the key differences is the addition of more meaningful RPG elements. As you progress you gain experience, and in turn rank up the main protagonist, with the skill tree broken into different military ranks. Each rank has its own skill panel, and a selection of stat boosts and new moves to unlock using your accumulated experience, though it’s entirely up to you how you choose to spec your character, and what you unlock, though in some cases you have to have unlocked a previous skill to access the next.</p>

<p>There’s nine weapon types, and your proficiency with each of these can also be levelled up, boosting damage and unlocking new combos as you do. While there’s the standard blades and lances, there’s the more unique weapons like the Rings which add in some ranged abilities alongside the melee ones. You can buy new weapons from merchants across the map, or they’ll sometimes be dropped by enemy commanders, potentially giving you an immediate boost on the battlefield</p>
<p>It doesn’t end there either, and once you’ve found the element known as Pyroxene on the world map, you can exchange each one for a random gem that you then equip for different boons and bonuses. I primarily focused on the Wellspring gem, which rewards you by recharging your health for every 100 enemies you’ve slain, and as you find more Pyroxene and level up each gem, the boosts become more favourable. I found messing with all of the different systems and swapping out weaponry for ones with special characteristics really rewarding, and made for a good balance between combat and downtime.</p>
<p>You can also build bonds with other officers. Talking and training with these characters and making the right choices will strengthen the bond, and later on in the game you’ll be able to focus on their relationships via the Shui Jing Retreat. It’s a nice addition, and though it’s one that we’ve seen before in other RPG franchises like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/17/fire-emblem-engage-review/">Fire Emblem</a> and the recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/metaphor-refantazio-review/">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, it makes sense here as you forge bonds on and off the battlefield.</p>

<p>The new world map represents the Three Kingdoms period in China. You can explore this on foot, discovering secrets and side missions, but it’s not an open world, having more in common with an RPG map than something from Ubisoft. As you quell the trouble in each region you raise the level of Peace there, which in turn will give you some undisclosed advantages.</p>
<p>When in town, you’ll stay at the inn, and from here you can read your letters – some of which will advance the story – change your equipment, or plan your battle tactics. Alongside that, other utilities will be available, including weaponry shops to expand your arsenal.</p>
<p>The map only really serves as an interactive menu, but it helps to make your skirmishes and battles feel like part of a greater war, and that you are liberating areas from oppression. It’s a shame that there isn’t more of a visual reward for doing so, as you’re bringing life and prosperity back to a region, but it’s a minor thing.</p>
<p>It’s Year 6 of the Guanghe era. Drought and famine have pushed the people to the limit, but the government have done nothing to ease their suffering. You step in as an unknown warrior, joining series stalwart Guan Yu in protecting the villagers. You’re told of Zhang Ziao and his steadily growing cult of worshippers The Way of the Great Peace, and this is the beginning of the Yellow Turban Rebellion, which, for anyone that’s played a Dynasty Warriors game before, is where the journey always begins.</p>
<p>You join up with Liu Bei’s army, alongside Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, and the first order of business is to tackle Zhang Ziao’s horde. However, there’s more here than we’ve seen in the past, with your amnesiac protagonist wrapped up in a further mystical storyline. You encounter Zhuhe, a warrior committed to eliminating those who would sow chaos. It seems as though you might have previously been a Guardian as well, and while you might have played all of the previous games, this is a welcome new narrative thread to pull on. That’s not to say that it doesn’t still feel like a Dynasty Warriors game, as during our hands on we encountered more and more of the central cast, with favourites like Cao Cao and Xiahou Yuan all present and correct.</p>

<p>It’s been almost a whole console generation since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/02/13/dynasty-warriors-9-review/">Dynasty Warriors 9</a>, and with the jump to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> as the baseline, the visuals have taken a clear step forward, managing to be crisp, clear, and expansive while there isn’t a hint of slowdown even when there’s a huge number of enemies on the screen. The cutscenes are also of a much higher quality than we’ve seen before, and though I’m not normally a fan of the English localisation, it’s perfectly effective here. You’ll still want to play it in Mandarin to get the full effect.</p>
<p>While I mean no disrespect, I was surprised at just how much I enjoyed Dynasty Warriors Origins. We’ve come to know what to expect from this series and its spin-offs, and while Origins doesn’t throw away the Musou rulebook, it makes smart changes to the formula that just make it more compelling. I can see myself pouring hours into this, and so might you.</p>
<p>And the best thing is that you can start right now, with a demo now available across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-2-1-patch-detailed-armory-witchcraft-powers-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Blizzard Entertainment <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRgtN1sMf6M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hosted</a> a Campfire Chat with Diablo IV developers to discuss the upcoming 2.1 patch that will go live on the Public Test Realm between December 3 and 10, exclusively on PC's Battle.net.</p>
<p>The team talked about the main features and new content that will be in the new update, starting with the long-awaited Armory feature, which allows players to save and switch between different builds easily without any respeccing costs. With the Armory, Blizzard seeks to improve player flexibility in the endgame content. They noted that controller support for the feature would not be available right away, though. Worries about accidentally selling items saved in the Armory were put to rest, too, with the developers assuring players that saved items will be favorited automatically to prevent any accidental sales. They will also have an icon indicating they are part of a saved build.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The other highlight of Diablo IV Patch 2.1 is the new system based on Witchcraft powers. Players will engage with witches around the Tree of Whispers, offering a new currency called Restless Rot (earned after defeating the new Headrotten enemies) at altars to learn new witchcraft abilities through a streamlined menu system. The season also introduces a reputation system called Covens Favor for unlocking rewards, including new witchcraft powers. Additionally, players can discover lost powers by finding Forgotten Altars in the world. Over 20 powers will be available, with popular options like the poison frog summon, Doom orb, and vengeful servant. Another Witchcraft Power called Pano sucks enemies into a swirling vortex of destruction.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Players will find Headrotten enemies through the new seasonal activity called Headhunts, earning the new Occult Gems as rewards. These gems are special socketables that boost defense and provide unique effects to fine-tune player builds. The developers showcased examples of occult gems like Elder Sigil, Killing Wind, and Dust Stone, each offering different bonuses based on player preferences and playstyle. Additionally, quality-of-life improvements have been made to the town around the Tree of Whispers, adding more services and streamlining navigation to enhance the player experience during Headhunts. Of course, Diablo IV Patch 2.1 will also come with a plethora of class changes and overhauls. The full patch notes will be released on Wednesday, November 27.</p>
<p>By the way, did you know Blizzard <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-was-at-some-point-a-roguelike-game-with-arkham-like-combat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experimented </a>with making this game a roguelike with Arkham-like combat early in development?</p>

<p>As you explore The Zone in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>, you’ll come across an abundance of items to pick up, from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-to-do-with-pdas-in-stalker-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PDAs</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-use-artifacts-in-stalker-2-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Artifacts</a> to guns like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-find-lullaby-stalker-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lullaby</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/find-riemann-solve-safe-code-stalker-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riemann</a>. Speaking of guns, some that you find while <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-fast-travel-in-stalker-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roaming the open world</a> may have a red shield icon indicating their broken status. </p>



<p>If you’ve come across these diminished weapons and are wondering what your options are, we have you covered. Here’s what to do with broken weapons in Stalker 2, as well as what we recommend depending on your desired outcome.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-do-with-broken-guns-in-stalker-2">What to do with Broken guns in Stalker 2</h2>



<ul>
<li>Repair it at a Technician</li>



<li>Take the ammo and leave it</li>
</ul>



<p>If you want to keep and use the weapon, we recommend having it<strong> repaired by a Technician</strong> like Lens in Zalissya. This should only be done if you really like and want to use the weapon, as it can be an expensive process. You can check out our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-repair-weapons-in-stalker-2-easy-best-method/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guide on how to repair weapons</a> for a full breakdown.</p>



<p>You <strong>can’t sell broken weapons</strong>, and repairing them to sell is inefficient since you won’t make any profit. So, if you don’t want to use it, it’s best to <strong>take the ammo out of the weapon and leave it behind</strong>.</p>



<p>This all goes for broken weapons with the red shield icon, but you’ll also find weapons with a yellow shield icon.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image via GSC Game World</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-what-to-do-with-damaged-weapons-in-stalker-2">What to do with damaged weapons in Stalker 2</h2>



<p>A yellow shield icon in <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Stalker 2</a> means the weapon is <strong>damaged but not broken</strong>. It can still be used, but it can also be sold for some quick cash. As expected, damaged weapons will sell for less, but it’s still not worth repairing them before selling, as it’ll only cut into your profits.</p>



<p>You can track a weapon’s health with the Durability stat, which is found at the bottom of the weapon tab when hovering over it in the inventory. </p>



<p>The best option here is to sell it if you’re not too fussed with the gun, but if you like the weapon and want to continue using it, get it repaired for safekeeping.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/path-of-exile-2-will-not-leave-adventurers-disappointed-even-during-early-access.1042686/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After a very long wait and a last-minute <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-date-gets-pushed-back-by-three-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delay</a>, Grinding Gear Games' Path of Exile 2 is finally launching in two weeks in Early Access. However, it will be an early access game only in name, as it will boast a massive amount of content and even some endgame activities that will make the wait for the full version of the game easier to bear.</p>
<p>While I was not able to try out the game once again following the opportunity I had during <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-date-gets-pushed-back-by-three-weeks/">Gamescom 2024</a>, which left me thoroughly impressed, Grinding Gear Games made it abundantly clear during yesterday's presentation that Path of Exile 2 will even exceed my expectations, offering a staggering amount of content to sink my teeth into right from its initial release on December 6th. The Early Access version will include the first three of the six story campaign acts, which will take players up to level 25, as well as Cruel Mode. This mode, which will be removed once version 1.0 is out with the other three acts, will allow players to experience the first three acts at a higher difficulty that will take them to level 65 to be ready for the endgame content.</p>
<p>Having endgame content straight from the beginning became a focus during the development of Path of Exile 2, as the studio realized that one of the biggest issues for an action RPG at launch was not having enough. As such, after spending 25 hours completing the campaign the first time and clearing it again in Cruel Mode, players will be able to spend a lot of time clearing the random encounters spread across the Atlas, a huge overworld map filled with different areas completely separate from those seen in the campaign. The endgame content will be further expanded by systems not available during the campaign, such as Breaches, a mechanic returning from the first entry in the series, where players will have to defeat enemies as quickly as possible, and Rituals, where players will have to survive multiple waves of enemies in quick succession.</p>
<p><iframe title="Path of Exile 2: Endgame Content Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZpIbaTXJD4g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Path of Exile 2 will not skimp with character classes right from the get-go as well, offering players six different classes - Warrior, Ranger, Monk, Mercenary, Witch, and Sorceress - all coming with very different play styles, ranging from short-range to long-range and magical warfare. This already massive variety of combat styles will be further expanded down the line with six more classes that will bring the total number of classes to twelve. Even with just six classes, Path of Exile 2 will have a lot to offer to players who want to create unique builds, thanks to the extremely versatile customization systems in place that don't tie skills to specific classes.</p>
<p>Path of Exile 2 will be free to play once its 1.0 version launches, but those who wish to dive in straight away in the Early Access version will need to purchase one of the <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/purchase">Early Access Supporter Packs</a>. The basic pack will cost $30 on PC and consoles and will only grant access to the game, while the more pricey packs will include some additional in-game and physical goodies, although the physical goodies are only available for the PC versions of the Thaumaturge of the Vaal, Warlord of the Karui and Liberator of the Wraeclast Supporter Packs. You can check out the full chart below.</p>

<p>From what I have experienced and what the developers Grinding Gear Games have shown so far, Path of Exile 2 has the chance of becoming one of the best action RPGs ever released, if not the very best, taking everything that made the original great and competently modernizing it while expanding the experience in so many ways that it wouldn't be surprising to see players spend hundreds of hours in the game and still not having seen the full potential of the systems and mechanics powering the game. As such, I really cannot wait for the Early Access version to release and be able to spend more time with a game that I feel I will be playing for a very, very long time.</p>
<p>If you've been waiting to hear the system requirements for the PC version of Path of Exile 2, they are below.</p>
<p><strong><em>Minimum</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>OS: Windows 10</em></li>
<li><em>Processor: Intel® Core™ i7-7700 or AMD™ Ryzen 5 2500x</em></li>
<li><em>Memory: 8 GB RAM</em></li>
<li><em>Graphics: NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 960 (3GB), Intel® Arc™ A380, or ATI Radeon™ RX 470</em></li>

            <p>Konami has deployed a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> update to address graphical glitches affecting the horror game on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>.</p>
<p>The patch comes after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-fans-want-to-know-when-the-game-will-run-properly-on-ps5-pro">Silent Hill 2 Remake players called on Konami to address the technical issues still plaguing the game on PS5 Pro</a> almost two weeks on from the Pro's release.</p>

<p>Patch  v.1.1.248,905 is now available across PS5 and PC. The PS5 patch specifically targets "graphics glitches" on PS5 Pro as well as trophy counting, whilst the Steam patch fixes "an issue that caused interference between game saves and controller vibration", mouse sensitivity and input, and controller issues.</p>
<p>Gameplay fixes across both platforms fix door markers on Brookhaven Hospital map, stops enemies getting hung up on environments, and several other bugs and glitches - the <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/silenthill/2r/news/jp/ja/update_106">full list of fixes is here</a>.</p>
<p>The patch also resolves a "minor blocker" that prevented some players from escaping the Labyrinth after getting the map, an unspecified "progression-blocking issue" in Brookhaven, and an issue where the final boss was missing for some.</p> <div>

<p>"Overall, the philosophy for any PS5 Pro update should be that we get an upgrade over the base PS5, with no noticeable trade-offs," Digital Foundry's Thomas Morgan wrote earlier this week after breaking down <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-silent-hill-2s-ps5-pro-patch-is-another-update-with-glaring-image-quality-issues">Silent Hill 2 Remake's PS5 Pro patch</a>.</p><p>"The reality for Silent Hill 2 Remake's Pro upgrade though is that there are pros and cons. PS5 Pro does improve the game's performance at 60fps - and gets us to a vastly improved 30fps lock - both of which are welcome improvements."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Oh, my nostalgic heart is happy to tell you that Donkey Kong Land is available now for Nintendo Switch Online members.</p>
<p>The Game Boy classic once again asks players to set off in monkey form to find that banana horde. "Cranky Kong doesn't think Donkey Kong has proven himself to be a hero yet," reads the official description. "So, he decides to work out a deal with the closest villain that he knows."</p>
<p>Yes, K. Rool, that dastardly fiend, has hidden the bananas with a little help from his cronies. And, of course, Donkey and Diddy Kong won't stand for it. You can check out a trailer for its Nintendo Switch Online debut below.</p>

<p>Nintendo Switch Online members can get themselves access to multiple NES, Super NES and Game Boy games.</p>
<p>Those who plump for Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack option will also be able to get their mitts on Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance and SEGA Mega Drive games, along with other perks. That includes things like expansions for other Nintendo games, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-8-deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>'s Booster Course Pass.</p>

		<p>Nintendo has brought the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/game-boy">Game Boy</a> platformer Donkey Kong Land to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-online">Nintendo Switch Online</a>, the company having remembered that there’s another rich vein of Rare’s DK adventures that had previously gone untapped.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Land – Game Boy – Nintendo Switch Online" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_iYkwaVyGTY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Donkey Kong Country trilogy from the SNES was added to Nintendo Switch Online library back in 2020, the celebrated platformers being a key part of Rare’s legacy from when they were a part of Nintendo. But alongside those games, they also released a trilogy of Game Boy games, following the naming convention of &nbsp;Super Mario Land to mark them as a bit different.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Land was released by Rare and Nintendo in 1995, ahead of Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy’s Kong Quest, and while they couldn’t hope to capture the technicolor wonders of playing on a colour TV, they absolutely kept they same art style adapted to the green-tinted greyscale – greenscale? – of the original Game Boy screen. Add to that being able to retain a lot of the same platforming controls and style, and this was another hit for Rare.</p>
<p>There’s two more Donkey Kong Land games (plus a Japan-exclusive Game Boy Color port of the third game) that could be released in future, so keep an eye out for those!</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hobbit">The Hobbit</a> movies are a mixed Baggins indeed - at once thunderous and thin, like butter scraped over too much bread - but one sequence I love from The Desolation of Smaug is Bilbo searching Erebor for the Arkenstone, while trying not to rouse the titular dragon from his slumber. Don't Wake The Beast is sort of that sequence plus Spelunkified procgen levels and Thief-esque stealth mechanics.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Created by Artificial Disasters - whose other works include eco-minded reverse city-builder <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1795470/Flooded/">Flooded</a> - it's a roguelite stealth affair where you sneak through randomly arranged dungeons, avoiding the eyes and ears of walking skeletons and the like. There are pressure plate traps and other environmental obstacles to deal with, but the biggest "terrain hazard" of them all is the screen-filling red dragon on the dungeon's lowest level. Disturb its rest, and it'll smash the scenery apart pursuing you to the exit.</p>

<p>As you rove these top-down labyrinths, you must deal with the problem of footstep noise and the rattling of any items you pick up or disturb, with sounds manifest as expanding white rings. While this is a loot-driven experience, the game has a nifty way of punishing avarice. Every pearl necklace or gemstone you pocket adds to your weight, making your footsteps louder.</p><p>Sometimes, you might have no choice but to cause a racket - blasting through a cracked wall to reach a door, for example. Thankfully, you have a zipline which is useful for speedy withdrawal behind cover. Bilbo could have done with one of those. Other player items include a Thiefy gadget that covers the ground with footfall-dampening moss, and a cloak that increases detection time. It looks like a game where complexity arises more from the terrain puzzles and enemy varieties than the acquisition of new tools, but there's a town layer with merchants and, seemingly, a few sidestories.</p>
<p>I'm not sure it's possible to escape without eventually rousing the dragon, but even if you do, you can expect "new traps and dangers" on the way out. It can't be worse than having to sidestep rivers of fire, surely. </p>
<p>I dislike the cheesy voiceover in the trailer - the Statute of Cringe has officially elapsed on the practice of starting videos with "Yep, that's me - you're probably wondering, etc". But I'm guessing there won't be any chitchat during the actual catacombing, so I'll let it slide. Speaking of sliding, the only request I have at this stage is a giant hall entirely full of gold coins, where stepping incautiously might trigger an avalanche.</p>
<p>Don't Wake The Beast is out... at some point. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3258580/Dont_Wake_the_Beast/">Read more on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Let's take a look at what's on offer.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What You Need to Use PSVR 2 on PC</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Hardware-wise, you need the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-playstation-vr-2-pc-adapter">PC adapter </a>and a PSVR 2 headset – as well as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-gaming-pc">VR-capable gaming PC</a>, naturally. You’ll also need to download the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580190/PlayStationVR2_App/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation VR2</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/250820/SteamVR/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamVR</a> apps from Steam.

It makes everything look bright and clear and vivid. However, the drawback for using PSVR2 on PC is that PCs can’t take advantage of some of the unique features you can access when playing on PS5. That includes things like eye tracking, HDR, and adaptive trigger support.</p></div><div catalogid="40739933-4e75-453f-b51f-6875fcca6df9" id="206473"><div id="206473" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>PlayStation VR2 PC Adapter</h3></p></div><h2 data-cy="title2">When Is Black Friday 2024?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual date of <strong>Black Friday in 2024 falls on November 29</strong> this year, but the deals have already kicked off.

			<p>Dungeons &amp; Dragons is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year in style. The IP is healthier than ever, and Wizards of the Coast has just released the new 2024 Player's Guide and Dungeon Master's Guide, while the Monster Manual is slated to be available on February 18, 2025. But the company is betting big on videogames, too, following the big success of Larian's Baldur's Gate 3, which earned the D&amp;D IP owner over $90 million in its first six months.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-20/hasbro-s-gamer-ceo-refocuses-on-play-after-selling-film-business?srnd=undefined&amp;embedded-checkout=true&amp;sref=P6Q0mxvj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a>, Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks confirmed that there's another videogame in development in addition to the ones we already knew of. Let's recap: the co-op game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-in-development-at-starbreeze-for-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> by Starbreeze in December 2023 for a 2026 release; this one will be set in Waterdeep, one of the biggest cities of Faerûn. Then there is the D&amp;D Virtual Reality game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dd-virtual-reality-game-announced-by-demeo-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> this January by Resolution Games, and the regular Dungeons and Dragons Unreal Engine 5 game in development at <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-aaa-unreal-engine-5-from-dark-alliance-dev-invoke-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Invoke</a> (formerly Tuque, the studio that made Dark Alliance). This latter Dungeons &amp; Dragons videogame might feature some sort of PvP mode, as gleaned from a job advertisement.</p>
<p>It's not even all about D&amp;D, anyway, as Hasbro has also invested in Archetype Entertainment's sci-fi RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-sci-fi-rpg-gets-new-cinematic-trailer-narrated-by-matthew-mcconaughey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Exodus</a>, featuring Matthew McConaughey as one of the main characters and developed by former BioWare designers and writers. Moreover, they've got a G.I. Joe Snake Eyes game in development at Atomic Arcade and a horror game in the making at <a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-opens-austin-studio-for-aaa-game-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skeleton Key</a>. The article also said there's a new Magic title in testing with the Commander format; this would be separate from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/magic-the-gathering-arena-something-magical/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magic: The Gathering Arena</a>. All in all, the company is investing over a billion dollars at a rate of $100 to $150 million a year to release one or two games per year starting in 2026.</p>
<p>On the flip side, Hasbro is paring back its investments in film adaptations. Following the slightly underwhelming box-office performance of Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves and Transformers One, it won't co-finance any new movies or TV series. On the subject, Cocks said:</p>
<p><em>We want to reach fans where they want to play, and increasingly that is through digital expressions of their favorite brands.</em></p>

            <p>If the surprising number of you brought scurrying out of the woodwork by the announcement of Redwall-style <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hawthorne">Hawthorn</a> is anything to go by, the medieval rodent fanatic to RPS reader pipeline is a sturdy one, despite being constantly nibbled at. Here’s some more delicious bait for you, then. <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/mossflower-tw">Mossflower TW</a> is a campaign mod for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/medieval-ii-total-war">Medieval II: Total War</a> expansion Kingdoms that lets ranks of mace-wielding mice, helmeted hedgehogs, and ornery otters skitter wildly all over the venerable <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game. It’s been about since Summer, and the team have been working on patching since. It seems very playable, if the footage of people playing it is anything to go by. Here’s a video by YouTuber Tharshey so you can see it in action:</p>

<p>Modder <a href="https://www.moddb.com/members/flesheatingbeans">FleshEatingBeans</a> describes Mossflower TW as “a campaign themed around the titular Redwall novel”. I’m not sure exactly how many different beasties you’ll be able to recruit, but at a glance, I count mice, hedgehogs, otters and…wait! That’s not an otter at all. It’s a weasel! Typical weasel behaviour. You’ll also get more beasts on your side as you liberate settlements. There are two factions to choose from: the pirates of Cluny the Scourge, or Redwall Abbey.</p>
<p>“We seek to follow the world presented in the books, audiobooks and an animated show as closely as reasonable,” says Mr. Beans, “while adding canon-friendly content of our own to fill out gaps and up the fun factor”. Alongside the units, there are custom structures, and also some custom banners.</p><p>The team were on hiatus, but seem to be back now. Such is the allure of several different types of battling mammal where only one type of less-interesting mammal - the lowly human - existed previously. There's a bird of some sort too, but who cares about that guy.

		<p>Ubisoft has released <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> Title Update 1.4.0, which makes a huge change for one of the most hated aspects of the game. Stealth sections have been revamped to remove instant fail conditions, letting players blast their way out of a sticky situation, instead of being booted back to a save point.</p>
<p>As well as removing this condition, the enemy AI has also been tweaked so that players will be better signalled if they’re being detected, letting them make the choice of whether to try and back up and get back into cover, or just reach for their blaster and start going for it.</p>


<p>Elsewhere, enemy weak points have been added to add some explosive new options, Kay’s blaster has been returned and you can use two-handed weapons more often, and there’s a new toggle for the cinematic lens, which could clean up the image for those who hate fake camera effects.</p>
<p>Hoping to bring a bunch more players into the fold, Ubisoft has chucked Star Wars Outlaws into the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> sales this week, cutting 25% off the price of the game digitally. Of course, shops might have other ideas if they’ve got a few too many discs that they want to shift, so keep an eye out.</p>
<p>On the whole we rather enjoyed the game (stealth sections and otherwise), with Gamoc saying our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/26/star-wars-outlaws-review/">Star Wars Outlaws review</a>, “Star Wars Outlaws is an open world scoundrel-’em-up that clearly builds on Ubisoft’s familiar format, but that’s not a bad thing. The rep system in particular is interesting, as the constant fluctuations belie any kind of loyalty you might show otherwise, but most importantly, this game lets you just be in the enduring Star Wars Universe. It’s not perfect, but stealing for crime syndicates, fighting the Empire, speeding across alien landscapes, and so much more is a dream come true.”</p>
