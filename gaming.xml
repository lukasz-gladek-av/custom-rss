					<p>Open-world racing games have become fairly commonplace in recent years, but before the likes of Forza Horizon or The Crew rolled out, we had Test Drive Unlimited. Despite innovating many staples of the modern open-world racer, the franchise has laid dormant since 2011, so there was a fair amount of excitement when a third entry in the series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a>, was announced back in 2020.</p>
<p>Now that the game has finally arrived after several delays, does Test Crown Unlimited Solar Crown return the series to the top of the open-world racer leaderboard? Or should this franchise have stayed in the garage? Time to fuel up and find out.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFtestdriveunlimitedsolarcrown6.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Most attempts to deliver narrative in open-world racing games are pretty regrettable, but even given that low bar, Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown’s world and story (if you can really call it a story) are exceptionally uninspired. Players can join one of two clans, the posh Sharps or the cool and edgy (“cool” being very much in quotation marks) Streets. None of the characters you meet on either side are interesting in the least, with the only benefit to joining a side being some unique cosmetics and challenges.</p>
<p>But again, you don’t play this type of game for the story. The racing is what’s most important, and on that basic level, Solar Crown largely delivers. The game is developed by KT Racing, which previously stewarded the long-running and generally well-liked WRC franchise, so they know what they’re doing when it comes to basic driving physics and handling. This is no hardcore sim, with cars that obediently drift around corners with a quick tap of the handbrake, but it’s a bit less arcade-like than a lot of other competitors in this space. Cars feel properly weighty and there are number of options to make the game more sim-ish if that’s your thing. The game makes good use of the PS5’s adaptive triggers for acceleration and breaking and the sense of speed when you put the hammer down is impressive, even in lower-level vehicles.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFtestdriveunlimitedsolarcrown7.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Perhaps most refreshingly, Solar Crown avoids the issues many other open-world racers have with confusing and/or overly-cluttered course layouts. This game’s circuits are generally clean, easy to follow, and free of annoying excessive debris that unnecessarily slows down your momentum. Solar Crown’s courses often feel as well laid-out as ones you’d find in a more traditional closed circuit racer, which is a rather difficult thing to pull off.</p>
<p>So far, my impressions of Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown may sound fairly positive, but an open-world racer can’t slack on the open-world part. Unfortunately, that’s where this game wobbles. While generally quite drivable, Solar Crown’s version of Hong Kong feels lifeless, which is a bit of a feat when you’re drawing inspiration from one of the most bustling and stimulating places on earth. This game’s Hong Kong is made largely of empty roads, neat and orderly back alleys, and sterile wilderness.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFtestdriveunlimitedsolarcrown8.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Visuals that would have been considered middle-of-the-road a generation ago don’t infuse this tame version of Hong Kong with much extra excitement. This is particularly true on the PS5, which offers two visual modes: Quality and Performance. The former is almost unplayably chuggy with lots of extra visual glitches, while the latter drops the resolution to 1080p and still can’t maintain a solid 60fps, with busy nighttime races being a particular sore spot. As you’d expect, Solar Crown does look better on PC, but the game laughs in the face of optimization, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-gets-steam-demo-and-pc-requirements-rtx-4090-needed-for-4k60fps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an RTX 4070 and DLSS being required to run the game at High settings and 1440p</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond the general blandness, there’s just not a lot to&nbsp;<em>do</em> in Solar Crown’s open world, or at least not much that feels unique or leaves a strong impression. There are your standard race types like multi-lap circuits, sprints, and time attack challenges, as well as some more original offerings, like Domination Races, where you earn points based on your placing as you pass through gates, and Clan Races, where your results contribute to your overall team standing. In practice, though, neither Domination nor Clan Races feel all that unique when you’re in the midst of them. Beyond races, there are the baseline activities you’d expect to see in any open-world racer – speed traps, hidden car wrecks, etc. – and not much more. Don’t expect any new or novel ideas here.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFtestdriveunlimitedsolarcrown10.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Past entries in the Test Drive Unlimited series have offered then-innovative sim features, like the ability to trick out your own house and visit an in-game casino, but unfortunately, this aspect of Solar Crown is very underdeveloped. You’re given a largely featureless and purposeless apartment that grows in size somewhat as you level up, but don’t expect any real customization options. You can unlock cosmetics for your avatar, but your character is so seldom seen and so goofy-looking when it is that there is not much point.</p>
<p>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown’s online features don’t add much to the package. You can join other players’ races and even challenge other humans you encounter in the world to impromptu “Instant Challenges,” but both of these things are fleetingly rare as only around a dozen players will ever be exploring the map with you at once, and, usually, it feels like far less than that.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFtestdriveunlimitedsolarcrown9.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The short list of benefits offered by Solar Crown’s online features certainly don’t justify the <em>many</em> downsides they come shackled to. Solar Crown is an always-online game that requires you to sign up for both a MyNacon account and PS Plus or Game Pass Core on consoles to even get past the title screen. Even then, that’s not a guarantee, as I was frequently locked out of the game by server issues or the game’s inability to log me into my account.&nbsp;<span>Even when I got into the game, the lobby system would frequently be broken, which is a problem because the game forces you into lobbies&nbsp;<em>just in case</em> another human player might want to join you, even though you'll mostly play against AI opponents.</span> If the lobby system is down, you can only do free-roam activities or single-player challenges like time attacks.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFtestdriveunlimitedsolarcrown11.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>And the headaches don’t stop there! Your Solar Crown save is stored in the cloud (there’s nothing on your local drive) and anything related to saving is extremely wonky. A short list of issues I’ve had:</p>
<ul>
<li>Progress and XP earned from races not being properly recorded.</li>
<li>Landmarks I’ve discovered not being saved.</li>
<li>Time attack ghosts not being saved, or, alternatively, seemingly random ghosts showing up.</li>
<li>And the coup de grâce, I completely lost my progress at one point. Thankfully, I only lost about two hours, but I’ve heard tales of others losing much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s all a bit of a mess. Updates have been released, and further fixes have been promised, but I haven’t noticed much improvement and am not particularly optimistic about how Solar Crown will perform when it launches wide this week. The unreliability of the game’s servers and cloud saves make what might have been a passable, if unremarkable, open-world racer <em>very</em> hard to want to invest any time in.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/haF4IjS-_8k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>And you’ll have to invest time to get anywhere. Solar Crown’s devs have touted an old-school progression system that forces you to really earn cars, and sure enough, the sweetest rides require you to grind to a high level and shell out a hefty amount of in-game cash, but it’s hard not to feel like this was done to disguise a fairly paltry car list. Solar Crown only offers around 100 rides at launch, well short of the 800-something in a competitor like <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/forza-horizon-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forza Horizon 5</a>, and while Nacon has promised plenty of post-launch support, “you have to wait for seasonal updates for content” and “we’re keeping progression old-school” are two messages that can’t really share the road.</p>
<p><em>This review was based on a PS5 Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown code provided by publisher Nacon. </em></p>

<p>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown offers some solid fundamentals in terms of driving mechanics and course design, to the point the game might have been worth a qualified recommendation despite its surprisingly-bland recreation of Hong Kong, so-so visuals, and spotty performance, but ultimately, the game’s egregious always-online requirements make that impossible. Persistent server issues and a completely unreliable cloud save system send this racer careening off-track and it’s going to take some serious elbow grease to get this Solar Crown shining like it ought to.</p>

<p>Gameplay footage of Call of Duty: Future Warfare, internally called NX1 has leaked online.</p>



<p>NX1 was developed around 2010 by Neversoft following Infinity Ward’s major restructuring after Jason West and Vince Zempalla left the studio. Neversoft moved on from the development of Guitar Hero and started worked on NX1, which was going to be called ‘Call of Duty: Future Warfare’. </p>



<p>Now, nearly 15 years later from its development and eventual cancellation, gameplay footage of the game has started to appears online in mass. According to those who <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/future-warfare-beta-build-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have been able to download and play the game</a>, it features an almost fully-complete campaign. Of course, the game was in early development, but the gameplay footage is fascinating to watch. You can see various clips and gameplay that we’ve found down below:</p>

                <p>Sony will launch its $700 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-release-date-specs-price/1100-6523695/" data-ref-id="1100-6523695">PS5 Pro</a> console later this year, but if that's a little too rich for your blood, it looks like refurbished regular PS5s will be available soon at a more attractive price. A new "Certified Refurbished" section has been added to the <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/certified-refurbished" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Direct site</a>, with pricing starting at $350 for a PS5 Digital Edition and $400 for a PS5 with a disc drive.</p><p>According to the page (via <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/09/sony-to-start-selling-refurbished-ps5-consoles" rel="nofollow ">PushSquare</a>), the PS5 consoles are "as good as new" and each one has been extensively cleaned. Refurbished consoles are typically PS5s that have been returned for a refund for a variety of reasons, thus turning them into pre-owned consoles. There might be some "minor cosmetic imperfections" Sony says on the PS5 listings, but these consoles do come with a 12-month manufacturer's warranty. A shipping date hasn't been revealed yet, but Sony says it will be added soon.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> PS5 Pro Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p>This makes for a more affordable current-gen option, as the price of a PS5 has remained fixed in the US <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-will-become-about-90-more-expensive-in-this-major-market/1100-6526135/" data-ref-id="1100-6526135">and has increased in other parts of the world</a>. Sony has said that these price increases are related to global economic conditions like the COVID-19 pandemic and several other factors, leading to a console generation where prices have not dropped alongside reduced component costs. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-controllers-are-now-more-expensive/1100-6526346/" data-ref-id="1100-6526346">The price of DualSense controllers has also risen by $5</a>, almost four years into the life-cycle of the PS5.</p><p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-revealed-aims-to-double-the-power/1100-6526357/" data-ref-id="1100-6526357">PS5 Pro console will cost $700</a> when it launches on November 7. The console won't include a disc drive either, as anyone looking to upgrade will need to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-buy-a-disc-drive-for-ps5-pro/1100-6526391/" data-ref-id="1100-6526391">purchase the $80 disc-drive attachment</a> if they want to play physical copies of their games or movies.</p>

            <p>The team behind gaslamp fantasy survival game Nightingale is about to release its previously-promised big update, known as Realms Rebuilt.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Inflexion Games' CEO Aaryn Flynn admitted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nightingale-studio-not-satisfied-with-where-the-game-is-at-says-inflexion-ceo-aaryn-flynn">the studio was "not satisfied with where the game is at"</a>, and resolved to address this with an update towards the end of the summer.</p>
<p>Now that time is almost here, with the studio's Nightingale: Realms Rebuilt update, which is set to go live tomorrow, 12th September.</p>

<figcaption>Nightingale Early Access Review In Progress: Is It Worth It? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUVZiKktig" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This update will feature some fairly notable changes and improvements to Nightingale, including a brand new "handcrafted" campaign, more boss battles, additional weapons and spells, cats in hats (see header image) and an overhauled progression system, to name a few.</p>
<p>This campaign rework will feature a "more immersive and substantive quest", Inflexion said, with the developer adding the "core questline of Nightingale has been completely recreated". The new Storied Realms will feature new puzzles, dungeons, and "challenging" enemies. Players will still be able to craft Realm Cards and access Untamed Realms, the developer assured.</p>
<p>This update will also bring bows and arrows to Nightingale, something Infexion said was a "much-requested" addition. There will also be new spells to discover, such as Fionn's Wrath which "conjures up giant fish to attack your enemies". Let minnow your thoughts on that one.</p>
<p>On the progression side of things, the developer admitted players often found progression confusing, so has redesigned it with this update. It should soon be easier to grasp, with a new Progression tab in the guidebook (see image below). Here, players will be able to unlock new recipes for tools and spells.</p>
<p>Further details on tomorrow's update can be found on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1928980/view/4585315413747208446">Nightingale's Steam page</a>.</p>

<p>"We’re still working hard on even more updates; including new biomes, triangular build pieces, and more," the Nightingale team concluded. "Stay tuned to Nightingale on socials to be the first to know when new content drops, and a big thank you to everyone joining us in Early Access as we continue this development journey."</p>
<p>Our Bertie was left rather underwhelmed with Nightingale after release, stating the fun always seems to be "just around the corner".</p>
<p>"Mostly, I've been in dogged pursuit of an excitement that eludes me, hoping it'll be around the next corner I turn, in the next gear tier I unlock," he wrote in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-nightingale-the-fun-is-always-just-around-the-corner">Nightingale impressions feature</a>. "But every corner seems to just bring another corner, and so around and around I go, getting somewhere but never there."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will be playable at the Tokyo Game Show 2024, KONAMI confirmed. The publisher didn't really share any other details on what would be in the demo, but it won't be long until they'll have to, especially since TGS 2024 is around the corner (it will be held as usual in Tokyo's Makuhari Messe between September 26 and 29).</p>

<p>Yesterday, KONAMI also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b86pccn_5SE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a new episode of the Metal Gear Production Hotline, a video podcast with plenty of updates on the franchise straight from the developers. In the episode, KONAMI addressed the early feedback of the select press that got to play Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater at an exclusive event. According to the publisher, over 88% of the impressions were positive. The main criticism was that the game was perhaps too faithful to the original. On that subject, Production Producer Noriaki Okamura explained:</p>
<p><em>I would just mention a few things about this being "too faithful," and the thought process behind that. When people ask, "couldn't they have improved on this?" "Wouldn't it have been better as a more modern stealth game, with much more freedom to it?" I do understand where they're coming from, and in the early stages of development, that was actually our most hotly debated issue. But at the end of the day, well...</em></p>
<p><em>We saw the discussion of how "it feels outdated to go to an area, and nothing you do there affects other areas," but that's just how the game was designed. The rhythm and the shifting pace of gameplay flows from that choice. If we had done anything to change that overarching design, </em><em>it would have changed Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater entirely. And given what we were setting out to do, we questioned </em><em>whether that really fit with the vision for this project. So we decided that we'd rather come down </em><em>on the side of "too faithful," and that we'd rather maintain the original design of MGS3: SE instead of try and rework everything.</em></p>
<p><em>But we're also seeing plenty of coverage where that level of faithfulness was pointed at as a good thing. So, I think players might just need to see the game and try it for themselves to decide if this approach works.</em></p>
<p>Later in the episode, Okamura also provided a progress update on Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater:</p>
<p><em>We're working very hard on the development, I promise, but we're just not yet at the stage where we can say with confidence exactly when it will be out. I can tell you that, from start to finish, the whole game is already playable, so we know it's not going to be years and years. Nothing like that, I'm pretty sure.</em></p>
<p><em>But as far as where we're at... We're at the stage of, "check this part," "fix that," looking over everything and taking care of any issues. And as developers, we want to take our time with that to make sure everything is done right.</em></p>
<p>It sounds like Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will probably require a few months of polishing, making it increasingly likely<a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-slip-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> it will launch at some point in 2025</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-major-remnant-2-dlc-launches-later-this-month.977835/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-major-remnant-2-dlc-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gunfire Games and publisher Arc Games have announced the release date for the final major piece of&nbsp;<em>Remnant 2&nbsp;</em>DLC,&nbsp;<em>The Dark Horizon</em>, and it's coming alongside a major update that brings a new game mode and more.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1282100/view/4568426915139145908" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement on Steam</a>,&nbsp;<em>The Dark Horizon&nbsp;</em>launches on September 24th, bringing with it new dungeons, a new character Archetype, and a traversal system you won't have encountered before in&nbsp;<em>Remnant 2</em>.</p>
<p>In the new DLC, you'll revisit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remnant-2-trailer-shows-eerie-halls-of-nerud">the land of N'Erud</a> in order to visit "a mysterious place preserved in time". You'll be battling a "colossal entity that watches over" N'Erud, meeting "unexpected allies" as you go. Sounds like the perfect way to cap off&nbsp;<em>Remnant 2&nbsp;</em>to me.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/remnant-2-dlc-the-dark-horizon-boss.jpg?itok=tl8LeEly 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/remnant-2-dlc-the-dark-horizon-boss.jpg?itok=EI3gi6eq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I don't know what this thing is, but it doesn't look very happy.</figcaption></figure><p>Along with the new DLC, a brand new game mode will be added, and this one's free for all players. The Boss Rush mode lets you take on&nbsp;<em>Remnant 2</em>'s bosses across three different difficulty levels, cutting out the levels in between.</p>
<p>Each difficulty adds more bosses: Triple Threat pits you against three, Trial by Fire sees you go up against seven, and the aptly-named The Gauntlet challenges you to face 19 bosses in a single run.</p>
<p>You can choose to take on this challenge either by yourself or with other players, and you'll gain temporary buffs and bonuses along the way, hopefully easing the pain of battling boss after boss with no break.</p>
<p>All you need to do if you want to access this mode is to head to Ward 13 and choose the Boss Rush option instead of Campaign or Adventure, so it's easy to get stuck in if you want to give the mode a shot.</p>

<p>It's not just the game mode and the DLC, either; the update is also bringing extra quality-of-life changes and improvements, as well as a new system called Prisms. You can use this feature to add extra stats to&nbsp;<em>Remnant 2</em>'s rebalanced fragment system.</p>
<p><em>Remnant 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1282100/REMNANT_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/remnant-from-the-ashes-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/remnant-ii-standard-edition/9P9278ZMGQLJ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.&nbsp;<em>The Dark Horizon&nbsp;</em>launches across all platforms on September 24th.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> PS5 Pro Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p>Mat Piscatella, the executive director and video game industry analyst at Circana, wrote on <a href="https://www.threads.net/@matpiscatella/post/C_vqnX5PjjA?hl=en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Threads</a> that the PS4 Pro didn't significantly increase the number of total PlayStation 4s that were sold, but it did appeal "to the super enthusiast" and it accounted for 15% of the total dollars that were spent on the system. Harding-Rolls predicts that the PS5 Pro will ultimately reach the same audience, albeit at lower numbers than the PS4 Pro.</p><p>"Ampere forecasts that around 1.3 million PS5 Pro consoles will be bought by consumers in the 2024 launch window," writes Harding-Rolls. "This is compared to 1.7 million PS4 Pros that were sold at launch in 2016. We expect the price point to soften demand with some consumers, but for PlayStation enthusiasts the pricing is less of a consideration. According to Ampere data, over its life, the PS4 Pro sold-through 14.5 million units, around 12% of total PS4 sales. We're expecting a similar dynamic for the PS5 Pro, with the expectation that it will sell-through around 13 million units by 2029."</p><p>Piscatella and Harding-Rolls both point to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-breakdown-easter-eggs-references-and-teases/2900-4973/" data-ref-id="2900-4973">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> as a title that could potentially entice players who are still using their PlayStation 4 consoles to finally make the leap to PlayStation 5. Harding-Rolls added that a share of those users are likely to go directly for the PS5 Pro.</p><p>The PS5 Pro will officially launch on November 7, and that's when everyone in the industry should get a better idea about whether the upgraded console can meet or exceed its sales projections.</p>

Speaking to Game Developer at Gamescom 2024, he agrees the company was perhaps flailing when he took charge and seemed content to be a "fast follower in a lot of different categories."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We never really led in any category," he explains. "So we stopped and we said 'okay, if we're going to be here we have to be best in the world at something.' [...] The first thing was to stop and say 'what are we doing? What can we be the best in the world at?' We looked at the brand. We looked at our internal capabilities. We looked at what we have passion for. What we came back with was 'retro gaming,' and specifically 'modern retro gaming.'"</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Atari boss says Digital Eclipse and Nightdive buyouts have become 'North Star' deals">Atari boss says Digital Eclipse and Nightdive buyouts have become 'North Star' deals</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rosen feels the industry has perhaps responded well to this new, more refined iteration of Atari because the company has developed "subject matter expertise" in that specific market. He cites the buyouts of Digital Eclipse and Nightdive as two examples of Atari expanding its footprint in a way that really makes sense for the brand, referring to those deals as something of a "North Star" for the business.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rosen explains the situation at the company was "complicated" when he arrived. "The numbers didn't look bad, but the cash in the company was a challenge," he says. "That can happen in the game industry for a multitude of reasons. People can report positive EBIT but they'll show negative operating cash flow. So the other thing was the really stop and say 'all right, how do we reverse that trend so we're more focused on building a sustainable business that is cash flowing and could exist for another 50 years.'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When pressed on what the word 'sustainability' means within Atari in the context of wider layoffs and studio closures across the industry (often made in the name of 'sustainable growth'), Rosen feels it's about taking an even-handed approach to expansion. "Something that we wanted to aspire to as a company that had gone through so many ups and downs, and so many of these hyper cycles, was to reduce the cyclicality of that a little bit," he adds. "This is a cyclical business, but how do we not be thrown about so much by that cyclical nature?"</span></p><p>Development and restoration studio Digital Eclipse joined Atari in 2023 in a deal worth up to $20 million</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rosen says that means hiring slowly and expanding steadily–and refusing to put too much stock into perceived industry booms that often result in over-investment. "I think the challenge where sustainable growth [is concerned] is that a lot of companies will double or triple their development costs in a matter of one, two, three years," he continues. "Then we see contraction in the industry–but all of those seeds were sown with the boom. I think, if there's any lesson, it's that if there's a boom to be very skeptical."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He suggests the game industry's biggest problem is taking the past and assuming it will become the future, even when there's no precedent. The obvious example, he says, is how everybody decided to invest more in video games during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite that period of high engagement and spending being the very definition of unprecedented.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"People looked [at the industry during the pandemic] and thought 'oh, demand is up, we should invest more,' not realizing that everybody else was also simultaneously making the same decision. We make decisions that have release two, three, five years later–so everyone was making the decision to ramp up production at the same time, and now we're releasing those things into a market that has decreasing demand and increasing supply.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The pressure comes from demand, but I would say even more so comes from supply and the belief that if everybody is increasing supply the returns will say the same as they did. That's a fallacy of always looking at the past and not looking forward. If demand would have kept increasing it wouldn't be as bad, but there would still be problems because things were so profitable because of a market that wasn't going to exist in three years."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Atari focusing on consistency over high-risk projects, but 'wouldn't say no' to more studio acquisitions">Atari focusing on consistency over high-risk projects, but 'wouldn't say no' to more studio acquisitions</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rosen says Atari isn't adopting a similarly high-risk strategy when it comes to its own release slate. Instead of banking on home runs, he wants to lean on games that can hit "singles or doubles." Projects that will "have success and are likely to be successful," but aren't going to live or die based on whether they soar out of the park.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What does that mean for the fate of the company's more speculative projects? Discussing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://atari.com/pages/atari-x">Atari X</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">–an ongoing web3 venture that aims to "to create a robust blockchain ecosystem that seamlessly integrates community, gaming, and utility"–Rosen said the segment isn't a "major part of the business we do."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"On the blockchain side, it's really just licensing with some of the larger players. It's really just a small part of our business. That team is really just licensing at this point, so there's really nothing to downsize there," he adds, referencing the company's decision to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/atari-cuts-ties-with-crypto-biz-partner-but-will-mint-its-own-tokens-soon-">cut ties with one partner in that space in 2022</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://atari-investisseurs.fr/download/51/2024/5580/full-year-2024-results.pdf">In its latest fiscal report</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Atari stated the "general blockchain environment remained challenging" and said it has "expanded from a web3 only focus towards a larger community led initiative including cross-collaborations with other Atari lines of businesses and select partners, exclusive merchandise, and the launch of Atari Club."</span></p><p>Atari remains active in the web3 space</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company added that it terminated its previously announced new token project, blaming the "current regulatory and commercial environment" and its own shifting "strategic priorities." As for why Atari ventured into the web3 space, including starting new ventures under Rosen, he suggests the cynicism surrounding the technology is warranted but claims there are some who genuinely believe it can be used to create "useful and meaningful" experiences. He does, however, admit those projects have "yet to be proven out."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think a lot of people viewed it much like AI is today, like 'hey, this is where the money is so lets pivot quickly to that.' It's tough to sift through and really make sure you're trying to work with partners who believe in that," he says. "Most of our licensing partners work hard to make sure their coinbase is one of the few you can do much with, and I think they're genuinely trying to create an interesting ecosystem. Whether that will go anywhere or not remains to be seen."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Looking towards the future, Atari remains interested in acquiring more IP as it looks to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/atari-ceo-wants-infogrames-to-become-the-ultimate-preservationist-publisher">cement itself as a preservationist publisher</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Rosen adds the company "wouldn't say no" to more studio acquisitions, but says Atari won't be spending with carefree abandon. "With a studio, you're bringing on capability but also people–and with that comes complexity and the potential for things to go wrong. What people also don't consider is the opportunity cost," he says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As soon as you do that it takes your team a long time to merge and start working together. That will come at the cost of doing something else. [...] I have to remind myself of that all the time. It's not just the cost of paying, it's the fact that I've paid a cost and am now having to give up an opportunity. Those [acquisitions] will make sense, but they're few and far between. We're trying to stay focused on the main goal, which is sustainability."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can hear more from Rosen by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/patch-notes-2-how-does-the-game-industry-survive-beyond-2025-">checking out the latest edition of Patch Notes</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p>Super Smash Bros. director Masahiro Sakurai is "so sorry" to players who have spent "hundreds or even thousands of hours" in the Nintendo fighting game.</p>
<p>In the latest video of his Creating Games YouTube series, Sakurai discussed the importance of being mindful of the time players give to developers.</p>
<p>"There are plenty of people who have spent hundreds or even thousands of hours in Smash Bros., for example," said Sakurai. "I'm so sorry!"</p>

<p>Of course, his apology is a bit of a joke. But his core point is certainly an important one for developers.</p>
<p>"The time players spend in a game is a cost, so it's best to be mindful of the time they're choosing to give you," Sakurai concludes in the video.</p>
<p>Then again, considering he admits "the time you spend on a game should be a result of how fun that game is", perhaps he should be honoured at the dedication of Smash Bros. players!</p>
<p>Sakurai includes a further apology in the video's description: "I know my games have taken a lot of precious time from my players...and I'm sorry for that!"</p>
<p>This video is the last in Sakurai's "Planning &amp; Game Design" category after 30 videos, though he's made plenty more since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/masahiro-sakurai-launches-new-youtube-channel-on-game-development">beginning the channel two years ago</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-pro-is-a-low-volume-product-meant-for-existing-users-analysts-expect-it-to-sell-as-much-as-the-ps4-pro-despite-high-price.977820/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-low-volume-product-sell-much/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro's high price raised quite a few eyebrows when it was revealed at the end of yesterday's <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-specs-release-date/">technical presentation</a>, but players may need to look at things differently to understand the system's pricing.</p>
<p>Following the system's reveal, former Blizzard president Mike Ybarra commented on the console's price, suggesting to see things from a different point of view. Like any mid-generation hardware refresh, the PS5 Pro is about existing users upgrading. As such, when the teams evaluate the cost, they don't want to lose money on each console to avoid putting pressure on other parts of the business while maximizing value to players. As such, the PlayStation 5 Pro pricing took into account the fact that users upgrading will trade in their base models to cover some of the upgrading costs. At the end of the day, the console is a low volume product that also allows Sony to say that they have the fastest and most powerful console in the market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Think of this a bit differently. Pro models, or any in-generation upgrade, is about existing users upgrading. So when teams evaluate the cost - they don't want to lose money on each console as that puts pressure on other parts of the business. And they think about how they can…</p>
<p>— Mike Ybarra (@Qwik) <a href="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1833527742534500820?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 10, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Good news is no one has to buy it. It's a low volume product and I always think it's nice to say you have the fastest and most powerful console in the market.</p>
<p>For many, existing PS5 is fine and people should be happy.</p>
<p>Kind of like the S, it's fine. Some don't need the X. I…</p>
<p>— Mike Ybarra (@Qwik) <a href="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1833579323972112843?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 10, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The high price, however, isn't going to be a major issue for the PlayStation 5 Pro, as analysts at Ampere Analysis, as reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/analyst-expects-ps5-pro-to-sell-at-ps4-pro-levels-despite-relatively-high-price/">VGC</a>, expect the system to sell as well as the PlayStation 4 Pro did. In its launch window, analysts expect around 1.3 million units sold and around 13 million units by 2029. The high price is going to soften demand for the system, but it is less of a problem for PlayStation enthusiasts, according to Ampere Analysis research director for games Piers Harding-Rolls, a statement that falls in line with the statements from Mike Ybarra reported above.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro will launch on November 7th worldwide for $699.99 / £699.99 / €799.99.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-update-114-final-boss-nerf<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>update has been released, and if you're struggling with the DLC's final boss, then this update is very much for you.</p>
<p>The main changes in this update relate to&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>'s final story encounter, which is also arguably the toughest encounter in the entire game, if not in the series as a whole to date.</p>
<p>We're not going to spoil the identity of the final boss here, but suffice it to say that the update decreases the boss' damage, as well as the stamina damage some of its attacks do. You'll also notice the final boss has decreased range on some of its "non-weapon-based attacks".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-update-final-boss-nerf-frenzied-flame.jpg?itok=-aRept6x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-update-final-boss-nerf-frenzied-flame.jpg?itok=Rc_pDbfN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This isn't&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>'s final boss, but if it was, you'd be finding it a bit easier than before.</figcaption></figure><p>The boss' "attack pattern" at the outset of the fight has also been changed, along with the "visibility of some attack effects", so if you've been struggling to see why you're dying over and over again, that struggle should be just a bit more bearable now.</p>
<p>This being an&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>update, you'll also find lots of miscellaneous bug fixes and balance changes, some of which pertain exclusively to PvP play. It's a good idea to read up on those if you're in the business of exterminating your fellow Tarnished.</p>
<p>If you want to see everything that's new in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>update 1.14, then <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-114" rel="noopener" target="_blank">you can do so here</a>. It's not a massive update, but there are still a fair few tweaks and fixes to read up on, including one that might help you with the PS5 version's unstable frame rate.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>is the first (and probably only) DLC expansion for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million">phenomenally popular</a> open-world Soulslike&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>.</p>
<p>The DLC sees the player <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-trailer">exploring the Land of Shadow</a> in order to follow in the footsteps of Miquella, an Empyrean who's mentioned in the base game but never actually encountered. It adds new bosses, enemies, and areas to explore, plus new weapons and more.</p>
<p>Like the base game,&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>has proven pretty popular; it picked up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales">five million sales in less than a week</a>, and it was also met with a very strong critical reception indeed, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree">not least from us</a>.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/elden-ring/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/9PMPZZLKQM43" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.

<p>According to a new document, Pocket Pair might announce Palworld’s arrival on PS5 at the Tokyo Game Show 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As per Gematsu’s post on X, the Computer Entertainment Supplier’s Association (CESA) has released a <a href="https://t.co/X0XnPvu7fa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">document</a> with a list of games for the Tokyo Game Show 2024. This list consists of all the developers who will attend the event, along with their games and platforms. According to the document, Pocket Pair’s Palworld has marked PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam as the target platforms. However, it is worth noting that this list isn’t definitive.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Pocket Pair <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pocketpair-partners-sony-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in July 2024 that they will partner with Sony Music Entertainment (Japan) to ‘promote new developments of Palworld’. This partnership, however, did not include game licenses. If the information in the latest CESA document is accurate, then maybe Pocket Pair has also worked out a deal with Sony to bring Palworld to PS5. We will have to wait for an official announcement to know for sure.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-palworld">What is Palworld?</h2>

But now we have a clear idea of just how popular Space Marine 2 is across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S in addition to PC.</p><p>That two million players figure will no doubt include early access players (Space Marine 2’s effective release date was September 5 for those who pre-ordered any of the special editions), but it’s certainly enough to make Space Marine 2 the most-played Warhammer 40,000 or Warhammer video game at launch of all time.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>While Space Marine 2 is going down well with fans (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review">IGN’s Space Marine 2 review</a> returned an 8/10), there are a number of notable issues. Fans have expressed shock that the game launched without ultrawide support, for example, given it’s a standard feature for video games these days. As a result, ultrawide resolutions are letterboxed, with forced black bars.</p><p>Similarly shocking, there is no function to allow private PvE lobbies at launch. This means you’ll have no choice but to open yourself up to the whims of matchmaking as you play the endgame Operations mode.</p><p>Thankfully, both ultrawide support and private PvE lobbies are coming to Space Marine 2 as part of its first patch, Focus confirmed in a post on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/4599952112536595143" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the game’s Steam page</a> celebrating the launch. The first patch, due out “soon”, will also add a sparring area to the Battle Barge, Space Marine 2’s player hub spaceship.</p><p>“Please believe us when we say we're reading all of your feedback with great attention,” Focus said. “It takes time because of the amount of messages we have to deal with, obviously. But we see and hear you.</p><p>“A first patch will arrive soon enough! We are also completely aware of the different bugs you've been encountering. We're working hard to fix them." It will include:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Ultra Wide Support</li><li>Private PVE lobbies</li><li>Sparring area</li></ul><p>Earlier this week, Focus said <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2s-first-update-detailed">Space Marine 2’s first update would make server improvements and crash fixes</a>. The server problems in particular, and the dreaded “joining server bug,” have made co-op play difficult for some players, and even caused lost progression and rewards.</p><p>IGN has reported on the upcoming addition of class matching for co-op, after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-players-having-awkward-pre-mission-standoffs-because-two-of-the-same-class-cant-play-together"><u>players found themselves locked in a class standoff ahead of Operations mode missions</u></a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, we also have details on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-post-launch-roadmap-includes-new-maps-a-horde-mode-and-more"><u>what fans can expect from Space Marine 2’s seasonal post-launch content model</u></a>. Season 2 runs from October until the end of 2024, and includes a new Operations map, a new enemy, a harder difficulty level, a new weapon, and various other improvements.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> producer Noriaki Okamura has stated the development team would "rather come down on the side of 'too faithful'" than make big changes compared to the original game.</p>
<p>During previews for the Snake Eater remake, a frequent criticism was the game felt outdated compared to modern stealth games and too few changes were made compared to the PS2 original.</p>
<p>However, in a new "Production Hotline" video, Okamura explained the thought process behind maintaining the original vision of the game.</p>

</p>
<figcaption>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - UE5 Remake vs Original <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmPyKTtaxhk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the original game, the world is broken up into smaller areas but your actions in one area don't impact another - resetting your alert status when spotted by guards, for instance. This remains the same in the remake.</p>
<p>Okamura understands the criticism and said it was the development team's "most hotly debated issue", but "that's just how the game was designed".</p>
<p>"The rhythm and the shifting pace of gameplay flows from that choice," he continued. "If we had done anything to change that overarching design, it would have changed the game entirely. And given what we were setting out to do, we questioned whether that really fit with the vision for this project.</p>
<p>"So we decided that we'd rather come down on the side of 'too faithful', and that we'd rather maintain the original design of MGS3: SE instead of try and rework everything."</p>
<p>Despite this faithfulness to the original, the Delta remake won't include the line "A <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a> Game" and instead the opening credits will read "Based on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> 3".</p>
<p>This likely won't come as a surprise, considering Kojima has had no input on this remake after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideo-kojima-left-konami-earlier-this-month-report">his acrimonious split from Konami</a>, but it's a notable change from the original.</p>

<p>In the same video, Okamura acknowledged the existence of the expected Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol. 2, but asked fans to "give us time" before announcing further news.</p>
<p>In a series of fan questions, Okamura was asked about what games would be in the collection and when it would be released. However, the "rough launch" for the first collection means Konami does not want to repeat the same mistakes.</p>
<p>"Of course, we called the first one Vol. 1, so we are making a Vol. 2, that much is for sure," said Okamura. "We're also worried about how Vol. 1 had a pretty rough launch, with all the issues, so we're going to do everything we can not to repeat that, but we just have to ask for everyone to give us time."</p>
<p>After Metal Gear Solids 1-3 were included in the first collection, it's expected the second volume will continue Snake's story with Metal Gear Solid 4, especially as that game remains solely on PS3.</p>
<p>"You can probably connect the dots," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stay-tuned-for-metal-gear-solid-4-in-master-collection-vol-2-says-konami">said Okamura previously on the inclusion of Metal Gear Solid 4</a>.</p>
<p>"Whisper it quietly, but Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater looks like the most exciting Konami project in years," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-metal-gear-solid-delta-what-tech-does-the-new-remake-bring">Digital Foundry's own preview of the game</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new Elden Ring patch is now live on PC and consoles, introducing significant changes to the final boss of the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion and more.</p>
<p>Patch 1.14 makes plenty of adjustments for the final boss battle of the expansion, changing the attack pattern at the beginning of the battle, adjusting some attacks, and decreasing their health and stamina damage. The range of some non-weapon-based attacks was also reduced, while the visibility of some attack effects has been improved. The visibility changes, in particular, are extremely welcome, as I have found one of the biggest issues in this boss battle, other than the massive range of most attacks, is the visual clutter that makes it hard to understand what's going on.</p>
<p>The new Elden Ring patch also includes the usual slew of PvP and general balance changes and bug fixes. You can find the full patch notes by going <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-114" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>Despite the high challenge level, the Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree expansion is a worthy addition to the experience and one of the best expansions FromSoftware has put out to date. You can learn more about it in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree expands the base game by offering more of what made it one of the best open-world games ever. It features a well-sized map dense with secrets to discover, new masterfully designed dungeons, and introduces new, fun tools to help the Tarnished tackle some of the most challenging enemies in the game's dark and brutal world. While the lack of new gameplay mechanics may disappoint some, don't let this deter you. Shadow of the Erdtree is every bit as good as the base game, and it is an essential purchase for all those who loved FromSoftware's amazing action role-playing game</em>.</p>

        <p>Expect "free game drops" throughout the year, rather than one big summer update</p>

            <p>If there's one thing I've heard from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-minecraft-seeds-java-survival-seeds">Minecraft</a> modders when I've asked for their thoughts on the future of Minecraft, it's some variation on "fewer updates, please". This might seem unreasonable if you're not into modding, but the price of updating a game is often that you break any mods designed for it. Hence, the parts of Minecraft's history many seasoned Minecraft modders - together with server owners and pro mapmakers - remember most fondly are the longer lulls between updates. </p><!--more-->
<p>I've heard Minecraft: Java Edition 1.12.2 described as a "golden" period, simply because there was almost a year between it and the next major update. Picture these interludes as sustained magma leaks on the chilly ocean floor, creating a pocket of warmth in which various species of uncommonly inventive organism can dwell and prosper and make little houses out of coral. But then, the magma supply runs out, and the tinkersome critters must hastily relocate to the next thermal oasis.</p>
<p>Repeatedly updating a successful mod is a full-time job which potentially steals time away from other projects. As such, I'm curious to know what Minecraft's modders think of Mojang's recent announcement that Minecraft is switching to a faster "feature development rhythm". It's seemingly reminiscent of the days before Microsoft bought Mojang, when features arrived in more of a when-they're-ready fashion rather than at the bidding of a seasonal "content drop" cadence.</p>
<p>"Instead of providing one free update during the summer, as we've done in the past, we'll now be releasing a number of free game drops throughout the year," <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/the-future-of-minecrafts-development">reads a post on the game's official site</a> from Minecraft general manager Ryan Cooper. "These game drops will vary in size and will bring you features to explore more frequently."</p>
<p>It's not quite clear what "game drops" amounts to, but recent updates contain a few clues. "Sharp-eyed players will have spotted our first trial of these drops all the way back in December 2023, when we made visual changes to bats and turned decorated pots into functional storage containers," the post continues. "Next came Armored Paws - which included armadillos, wolf variations, and wolf armor - and released in April 2024.</p>
<p>"And that's not all our developers will be working on. Minecraft is a game that has been growing since it first released, and alongside these regular content drops, our developers will be focusing on long-term initiatives to ensure we can continue to evolve Minecraft long into the future," the post concludes.</p>
<p>Well, it doesn't quite end there. They also mention that they're bringing "a native version of Minecraft to the PlayStation 5", but I don't know what a PlayStation 5 is and neither do you. They're also "exploring ways to improve Minecraft's multiplayer experience and make it easier to find and connect with friends".</p>
<p>If you don't want to update your mods to keep pace with Minecraft's updates, you'll need to stick with an older version of the game. Mojang made this easier a while back by letting you pick versions from the game's launcher, albeit only on Java rather than the console-specific Bedrock edition. They've also tried to make modding Minecraft easier by means of tools like the data pack system. Still, modders may feel obliged to update their creations to take advantage of new features. </p>
<p>It's strictly anecdotal social media ephemera, not an accurate snapshot of the mood, but I've seen a <a href="https://x.com/legend_xt_oli/status/1833167576987312555">few</a> <a href="https://x.com/SixFootBlue/status/1833177375573418192">arsey</a> <a href="https://x.com/obser_vic/status/1833189234544369914">replies</a> to Cooper's post above. Mind you, all of that is somewhat lost in the <a href="https://x.com/2022krl/status/1833167677948379512">celebrations</a> over the parallel announcement that Mojang are retiring the Mob Vote, a regular fan vote on adding creatures to the game that has cultivated community grudges that go back nigh a decade. Did you vote for the Phantom back in 2017? I hope all your precious mods turn to ashes in your mouth.</p><hr>

<p>Patch 1.14, the full notes of which you can find <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-114">hereabouts</a>, comes bearing the following tweaks for Erdtree’s final boss:</p>

            <p>Noteable games analyst Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis expects the PS5 Pro's sales to follow a very similar trend to those of the PS4 Pro, even with that rather high price tag.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">Sony announced the long-rumoured digital-only PS5 Pro</a>. This souped-up version of the PlayStation 5 will allow for Fidelity level graphics at Performance level frame rates, but it comes with a cost. When it goes on sale later this year, it will retail at £700 for those of us here in the UK. Another £100 is then required to purchase the separate disc drive with a further £25 to buy the vertical stand.</p>
<p>The price point differential between the original PlayStation 5 and PS5 Pro is "between 40-50 percent", Harding-Rolls noted, adding this is "significantly more than the differential between the PS4 and PS4 Pro" on its launch.</p>

<p>"In the US, the PS4 Pro launched at $399 and the slim PS4 was $299 at the time, a 33 percent differential," Harding-Rolls said. "Additionally, the slim PS4 had a retail price of $299 having dropped from the original PS4 launch price of $399."</p>
<p>Harding-Rolls stated Sony's PS5 Pro pricing reflects the company's "adjusted strategy to protect its margin, generally supply chain inflation and a lack of direct competitor to its mid-cycle upgrade compared to last generation".</p>
<p>He noted Microsoft had its Xbox One X console geared up during the last console generation. However, as the PlayStation maker doesn't have this same competition right now, "it is an easier decision for Sony to run with a higher price point to protect its existing margins" with the PS5 Pro.</p>
<p>"For most prospective PS5 consumers, the standard edition will represent the value sweet spot," Harding-Rolls said.</p>

<p>Despite this, Ampere predicts "around 1.3m PS5 Pro consoles will be bought by consumers in the 2024 launch window". In comparison, the PS4 Pro sold 1.7m units on its launch.</p>
<p>"We expect the price point to soften demand with some consumers, but for PlayStation enthusiasts the pricing is less of a consideration," Harding-Rolls said.  "According to Ampere data, over its life, the PS4 Pro sold-through 14.5m units, around 12 percent of total PS4 sales."</p>
<p>Ampere is currently expecting the PS5 Pro to "sell-through around 13m units" come 2029.</p>
<p>"Sony’s PlayStation business is now more global than ever," Harding-Rolls closed. "Eight years on from when the PS4 Pro came to market, PS5 is selling strongly in countries where there are increasing numbers of consumers with growing disposable income such as mainland China and Saudi Arabia. These markets represent a growing opportunity for PlayStation versus the PS4 generation."</p>

<p>So far, Sony has only officially named 13 games set to receive PS5 Pro upgrades on launch day, meaning there's still plenty more to be shared.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Commence Star Wars rolling prologue screen: A minority Ubisoft investor has written an open letter to Ubisoft's board outlining their "deep dissatisfaction with the current performance and strategic direction of the company" and threatening a full-blown coup against the Guillemot brothers, Ubisoft's founders, and their backers at Chinese juggernaut Tencent. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
In the letter (via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisofts-share-price-tumbles-again-as-minority-investor-calls-for-the-company-to-go-private">GamesIndustry.biz</a>) Juraj Krupa of Sloakian hedgefund AJ Investments and Partners <a href="https://aj-invest.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ubisoft-Open-Letter.pdf">cites</a> the delaying of future instalments of Rainbow Six: Siege and The Division together with a lowered revenue outlook for Q2 2024 as cause for shareholder upset, noting that Ubisoft's share price has fallen by over 40% since last year. Accordingly, Krupa wants the board to "take Ubisoft private or allow it to sell to strategic investor", who will "get new air into" Ubisoft's videogames by, amongst other things, carrying out a bunch of layoffs. They're giving the board 60 days to reply.
</p>
<p>
AJ Investments are even now talking to other shareholders with a view to overthrowing the Guillemots. They're going to "use the French minority law to collect enough shareholders to start a proxy fight and initiate SALE PROCESS of Ubisoft to increase shareholder value for all shareholders". In particular, Krupa is calling for long-term CEO Yves Guillemot to be given the boot.
</p>
<p>
"The main reason why the valuation is so low compared to the peers is that Ubisoft at current state is mismanaged and shareholders are hostages of Guillemot family members and Tencent who take advantage of them," the letter reads. "Management is focused on pleasing investors with beating quarterly results and not focusing on long-term strategy to provide exceptional experience for the gamers." 
</p>
<p>
AJ Investments appear to be new kids on the block as Ubisoft minority shareholders. According to Krupa, "we started our Ubisoft position couple weeks ago and are still adding to it". They do, however, boast of their "extensive knowledge about the gaming industry" after being a "long-term shareholder in Activision Blizzard".
</p>
<p>
"We cannot understand the decision-making process of current management that is focused on releasing multiple average games per year that are harming Ubisoft's reputation among gamers community instead of focusing to provide hit games within its exceptional franchise portfolio," Krupa's letter continues. There follows a breakdown of Ubisoft's handling of their games which, frankly, reads like a frothing forum post full of gamer punditry:
</p>
<p>
"Division Heartland which was very much expected game from the gamers was cancelled. Skull and Bones release was not a success, Prince of Persia Lost Crown was okay but not very impressive as nobody talks about the game anymore. Rainbow Siege is doing great, nevertheless franchises such Rayman, Splinter Cell, For Honor, Watch Dogs are sleeping for years despite these games are loved by millions of players all around the world. Latest release of Star Wars Outlaws is expected to bring good numbers, but recent reviews shows that game was not 100% ready to release, despite the fact that whole world was waiting for open-world game under the Star Wars franchise. The Metacritic rating was 76% and IGN has 7/10 rating, which is quite good rating in our view."
</p>
<p>
Krupa, you debonair chancer, you Machiavellian oaf! Forget going toe to toe with the Guillemot dynasty - describing 7/10 as a "quite good rating" is how wars get started. Also, you forgot to mention <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beyond-good-and-evil-2">Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</a>.
</p>
<p>
There are some spicier assertions in the paragraph below. Krupa thinks that Tencent and the Guillemot brothers' holding company are essentially in cahoots to stop Ubisoft being acquired by private equity firms such as KKR and Blackstone - with Tencent buying shares in the Guillemot holding company in 2022, and the Guillemots then buying up more Ubisoft shares "to prevent any future acquisition or takeovers that would make Ubisoft operations more effective and agile against its competitors."
</p>
<p>
AJ Investments believe that Tencent and the Guillemot family are keeping the share price low so that they can scoop up shares on the cheap and eventually take full control of Ubisoft. While he doesn't say that it's a deliberate part of this strategy, Krupa suggests that delaying games is "beneficial" for Tencent and the Guillemots on this count.
</p>
<p>
Hence, AJ Investments' desire to start a shareholder rebellion. Krupa asserts that minority shareholders "own roughly 70% of the company", versus the roughly 25% of shares owned by the Guillemots and Tencent, and as such "based on our talks with other shareholders, we believe that we have enough voting power to challenge Guillemot's". So what would such a takeover and change of leadership bring about? Well, what does any major company strategic readjustment seem to result in these days? You guessed it, more layoffs! 
</p>
<p>
"The company needs to implement significant cost reductions and staff optimization to improve operational efficiency," Krupa adds. "We also suggest that Ubisoft should consider selling certain studios that are not needed for development of main IP's in the portfolio. Ubisoft has over 30 studios, it's obvious to every investor that this structure is too large for Ubisoft and its profitability going forward." He acknowledges "the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-makers-ubisoft-continue-2023s-gutting-of-the-games-industry-as-they-lay-off-over-100-staff">layoffs</a> that Ubisoft has made in the recent years which accounted to approximately of 10% cut of workforce but that is simply not enough."
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, AJ Investments want Ubisoft's current management gone, with the Guillemots continuing in "an advisory capacity" alongside a new, more "efficient" CEO. They also want Ubisoft to go private, because "Ubisoft as a public company is under ongoing scrutiny to report better and better quarterly results to please investors which may harm strategy going forward and is harming Ubisoft at this time, when they need to think long-term to get new air into their exceptional franchises".
</p>
<p>
To me, all this is sort of Aliens vs Predator, except that the Alien and the Predator are cool movie monsters, rather than angry suits fighting for the biggest chunk of a billion dollar company. Best of luck to any Ubisoft developers worrying about the potential fallout.

		<p>Sony revealed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> yesterday afternoon to an almost universal response of “Nope”.&nbsp; That was on the nicer end of the spectrum, with some rather more creative and amusing reactions that we’ve gathered a few below.</p>
<p><em>Please note that there are swears and adult content below.</em></p>
<p>First up we have <a href="https://x.com/RossTweetsGames/status/1833526012417872061" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ross Tweets Games</a> with his suggestion of what went on in Sony’s boardroom when they were working out the price of the new console.<br>

            <p>If you partake of some virtual rubber-burning, you might remember Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/motoring-mmo-the-crew-is-going-offline-in-march-making-it-impossible-to-play">shuttered</a> its open world racing game The Crew in March by turning off its servers. Given that The Crew is an online-only game, that signalled its death knell… or death horn, more accurately. Then in April, they tow-trucked the game out of people's libraries and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-crew-has-started-disappearing-from-game-libraries-after-its-closure-last-month">revoked their purchases</a>. This led to a backlash, as you'd expect, and Ubisoft are accordingly taking a different approach with The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest. They're giving both an offline mode to "ensure long term access to both titles". </p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/TheCrewGame/status/1833543516506435739">Xwitter post</a>, Ubisoft put out a short video saying that they're "currently exploring different solutions", and "can confirm an offline mode". It's more than likely this is in response to how they handled both the previous games' shut down. As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/racing/holy-cow-the-crew-2-is-on-sale-for-dollar1-on-steam/">PC Gamer notes</a>, the game is also currently on sale for $1, which is objectively a good deal.</p>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>We heard your concerns about access to The Crew games</p><p>Today, we want to express our commitment to the future of The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest. </p><p>We can confirm an offline mode to ensure long term access to both titles, stay tuned for more news in the next months. <a href="https://t.co/pZhx4WUBPT">pic.twitter.com/pZhx4WUBPT</a></p></div>— Ubisoft_UK (@Ubisoft_UK) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ubisoft_UK/status/1833543517596954728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 10, 2024</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">

<span data-position="1"></span></p><p>Even when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/need-for-speed-shift-2-the-run-and-more-ending-multiplayer-this-year">EA turned off the online servers for a tonne of Need For Speed games</a> in 2021, they were at least playable offline. Then again, The Crew 2 sells itself more heavily as an online game. Turning off the servers means it'll likely be a lonely experience even if it's still playable.</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-the-crew-2-as-a-single-player-game">single player review</a>, John Walker (RPS in peace) deemed it "an awful lot of not very much", which doesn't bode all too well for when Ubisoft's pit crews arrive and bolt in the offline mode (unless they announce local co-op or something?). Mind you, John wasn't impressed by the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/trying-and-failing-to-find-the-multiplayer-in-the-crew-2">multiplayer offerings</a>, either. "The Crew 2, an online only game, has no inherent multiplayer at all", he said. "Up to four of you can group together as a "crew" and take on its scant co-op challenges. That's it." </p>
<p>I've not played The Crew 2 so I can't comment. The closest I've come to playing a driving game recently is when I logged into Fortnite and the season at the time had you driving Mad Max-style vehicles. Honestly? The best driving game I've played as of late was Warzone's late Armored Royale mode. I still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/keep-armored-royale-as-a-permanent-mode-in-warzone-you-cowards">think about it often</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>FromSoftware has released a new patch for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>, version 1.14, which adjusts the final boss of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> to make it easier.</p>
<p>It's been three months since the DLC was released and many players have struggled to beat its final boss - it's an incredibly tricky challenge in an already difficult game.</p>
<p>Now, changes have been made to ensure more players can finish Shadow of the Erdtree. Notably, the start of battle has been changed to give players a chance to settle into the fight - indeed, many of the DLC's bosses immediately attack the player upon entering an arena.</p>

</figure>
<p>In addition, some attack moves of the boss have been adjusted, with damage dealt decreased, stamina damage decreased, reduced attack range of some non-weapon attacks, and improved visibility of some attack effects.</p>
<p>That last one is important, as this particular boss has plenty of flashy gold effects that can make it hard to clearly see certain attacks.</p>
<p>Other adjustments in this patch include balance changes for PvP play, as well as general changes to some equipment, improvements to some weapon arts, and tweaks to various spells.</p>
<p>Bug fixes have also been implemented, and the patch notes include suggestions to improve unstable performance. You can <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-114?utm_source=SM_Official&amp;utm_medium=official_post&amp;utm_campaign=ER-Patch114">read the full patch notes here</a>.</p>

<p>What's not included in these patch notes is any mention of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-removes-latin-american-translation-staff-from-credits">translation staff who were removed from the credits</a> after the release of Shadow of the Erdtree.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-motivated-amds-development-of-advanced-ray-tracing-says-mark-cerny/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been less than a day since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-specs-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official announcement of the PS5 Pro console</a>. The biggest news (largely a shock) was certainly Sony's pricing choice, but when it came to the hardware features, they were mostly in line with the leaks.</p>
<p>As early as July 2023, insider Tom Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-rumored-to-launch-in-november-2024-with-accelerated-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> that the upgraded PlayStation 5 would feature 'accelerated ray tracing'. This March, YouTube channel Moore's Law Is Dead <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-45-faster-base-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> from a leaked document that ray tracing performance could be twice or even thrice as fast as the original PlayStation 5, which was confirmed yesterday by Sony:</p>
<p><em><strong>Advanced Ray Tracing</strong>: We’ve added even more powerful ray tracing that provides more dynamic reflection and refraction of light. This allows the rays to be cast at double, and at times triple, the speeds of the current PS5 console.</em></p>
<p>While the PS5 Pro GPU is mainly based on the RDNA 3 architecture, it will anticipate several ray tracing enhancements that won't be seen until next year in AMD's first RDNA 4 PC graphics cards, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-rdna-4-gpus-feature-enhanced-ray-tracing-architecture-double-rt-intersect-engine-radeon-rx-8000-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">such as</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Double Ray Tracing Intersect Engine</li>
<li>RT Instance Node Transform</li>
<li>64B RT Node</li>
<li>Ray Tracing Tri-Pair Optimization</li>
<li>Change flags encoded in barycentric to simplify the detection of procedural nodes</li>
<li>BVH Footprint Improvement</li>
<li>RT support for OBB and Instance Node Intersection</li>
</ul>
<p>According to another leak, it may also include thread reordering to reduce data and execution divergence, similar to NVIDIA's Shader Execution Reordering (introduced with the Ada Lovelace architecture) and Intel Arc's Thread Sorting Unit.</p>
<p>Interestingly, PS5 Pro Lead System Architect Mark Cerny told <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/exclusive-hands-on-i-played-sonys-all-new-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CNET</a> that Sony drove the development of these advanced ray tracing features at AMD.</p>
<p><em>PS5 Pro uses the new advanced ray tracing feature sets that AMD created as the next step in their roadmap architecture But if you look around, there are no other AMD GPUs that use it yet. We motivated the development, and I'm very happy we did so -- the response from the developers has been extraordinarily great.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, while AMD GPUs compete well enough in rasterization, they've historically trailed behind NVIDIA in this area. RDNA 4 hardware, starting with the PS5 Pro this November, is looking to change all that at a time when more and more game developers are implementing ray tracing in their games. Of course, NVIDIA is unlikely to rest on its laurels and may well have something up its sleeves for the GeForce RTX 50 Series 'Blackwell' GPUs, whose design is expected to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-550w-5080-350w-september-design-fianlize-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finished this month</a> for a tentative announcement at CES 2025.</p>

<p>Ubisoft has confirmed offline modes for The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest “to ensure long-term access” for the community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December 2023, Ubisoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-taking-the-crew-offline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the original The Crew would be taken offline due to “upcoming server infrastructure and licensing constraints”. The news didn’t sit well with the fans, with many expressing disappointment all across social media. Additionally, the community took it upon themselves to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-crew-is-being-revived-just-months-after-going-offline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revive the game</a>, with a dedicated team working to get it running by the Crew’s 10th anniversary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It seems that Ubisoft understands the community’s sentiment and is committed to providing long-term access to both The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest. According to the new video on <a href="https://x.com/TheCrewGame/status/1833543516506435739" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>, the developers are “currently exploring different solutions and can confirm an offline mode” for The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest. More details about the offline mode will be revealed in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest are online-only racing games, the former released in 2018 and the latter in 2023. The decision to introduce an offline mode for these games has gone well with the fans, with many <a href="https://x.com/KlassikerGamer/status/1833632300824682976" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">praising</a> Ubisoft’s decision. However, some still wonder whether an offline mode is possible for the <a href="https://x.com/DyhZar_/status/1833543606696554961" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">original game</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Ubisoft was recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-being-pressured-to-go-private-as-share-prices-continue-to-fall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pressurised to go private</a> as share prices continue to fall. Also, Ubisoft has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/vulkan-api-rainbow-six-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stripped Vulcan API </a>from Rainbow Six Siege.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/11/the-crew-motorfest-and-the-crew-2-are-both-getting-offline-modes/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ubisoft Ivory Tower have announced that both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/07/04/the-crew-2-review/">The Crew 2</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-crew-motorfest">The Crew Motorfest</a> will be getting support for offline play in a future update, ensuring that they will remain playable long after the servers are eventually shut down.</p>
<p>To mark this announcement, Ubisoft have put both games on sale for the next two weeks. The Crew Motorfest is reduced by up to 70% – it’s cheapest on PC at £18, while the Xbox Deluxe Edition is £22.50, and PlayStation seemingly hasn’t put discounts in place just yet. But you want an absolute steal? Well,&nbsp;you can get The Crew 2 for just 79p!</p>


<p>Say it with me:</p>
<p><iframe title="Robocop - I'd Buy That For a Dollar" width="780" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/85cL1HisrNc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Patching in an offline mode is huge for game preservation, and it will also help Ubisoft get back some good will after making the original The Crew completely inaccessible to play with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/14/the-original-the-crew-is-going-offline-in-march-2024/">that game’s server shutdown earlier this year</a>. Now, The Crew 2 was a much better game than The Crew, but still, it sucks to see games effectively disappearing.</p>

<p>Motorfest owners have a lot to look forward to, as Ivory Tower announced plans for Year 2 in the game’s post-launch support. It will get its biggest update yet on 6th November, with the game map getting 50% bigger when they add the entire island of Maui… for free!</p>
<p>This will be integrated seamlessly, so you’ll be able to head over to the new island by sea, by air, or by driving across a connecting bridge, without any loading screens.</p>
<p>Once again, the team will be trying to honour real life with an abstracted recreation, though it will feature real roads and locations with the road to Hana, bamboo forests, waterfalls, Kaihalulu beach’s red sands, Haleakalā National Park, and more.</p>
<p>Year 2 will have another seasonal content plan, though with three seasons instead of 4. This will start with Season 5 and a new Made in Japan Volume 2 playlist. There will also be a new PvE mode included in the Year 2 Pass called The Chase Squad, which sadly won’t feature Bradley Walsh, but will have you trying to hunt down racing rivals across the island.</p>
<p>The Year 2 Pass is included with new versions of the Gold and Ultimate editions of The Crew Motorfest, or sold separately. It will add 20 more vehicles, nine of which are there on day one and the other 11 added in monthly drops through the year.</p>
<p>Launching last September, we said in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/29/the-crew-motorfest-review/">The Crew Motorfest review</a>, “The Crew Motorfest provides plenty of fun arcade racing, though it does very little to break new ground for the genre. There’s plenty to get your teeth into, but there are some annoying design decisions and a few technical issues that take the shine off it. Still, I can see it finding plenty of fans, particularly on PS5 where the only competition from a ‘Horizon’ game involves robotic dinosaurs.”</p>

            <p>Abandon all hope, ye who are shackled to your workmates in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chained-together">Chained Together</a>. The "co-op" game about escaping hell now has a map editor that'll let you make your own infuriating obstacle courses for condemned souls to throw themselves upon. Finally, you can make the endless mountain of perdition you have dreamed about since being emotionally scarred by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/getting-over-it">Getting Over It</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This update is designed to unleash your creativity," say developers Anegar Games in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2567870/view/4606707511976656411">brief patch notes</a>. The editor will let you place moving platforms, swinging axes, pulsating spikes, and all the rest of the game's horrendous machinery. There are a few levels already up in the Steam Workshop, including the one pictured above, in which I slipped to my death five times before quitting to desktop. You win this time, spinning log. </p>
<p>We at RPS have already enjoyed a brief foray into the fiery pits. It was a journey that saw Edwin, Nic and I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-tried-to-escape-hell-in-chained-together-and-one-of-us-kept-running-ahead-with-no-warning">bickering about the correct way to perform a countdown</a> before committing to deadly leaps and scrambled sprints. The darkest place in hell is reserved for those who run into a gauntlet of lasers insisting "let's just eyeball it, boys".</p>
<p>As a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> multiplayer platformer Chained Together is cheap, silly, and unsurprisingly janky. In other words, pure streamer bait - the video game as meme. But I often admire games like this for their playground simplicity. It reminds me of Sen's Fortress as much as it does Bennet Foddy's cauldronised clamberer. Nic called it a "layer cake of fuckery", a description both accurate and pleasing.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
