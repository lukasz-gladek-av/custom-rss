                <p>A couple of years ago, the idea of PlayStation-exclusive games being ported to PC would have seemed highly unlikely, but times have changed. Insomniac's Spider-Man games, Housemarque's Returnal, and the Horizon series are just a few of the big PlayStation properties that have recently made their way to PC since 2020, and former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida recently spoke about how doing so was almost like having a license to print money.</p><p>"Releasing on PC does many things: it reaches a new audience who do not own consoles--especially in regions where consoles are not as popular," Yoshida said in an interview with <a href="https://www.patreon.com/LastStandMedia/home" rel="nofollow ">Sacred Symbols+</a> (via <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/02/ex-sony-exec-says-pc-ports-of-old-ps5-games-are-almost-like-printing-money" rel="nofollow ">Push Square</a>). "The idea is that those people may become fans of a particular franchise, and when a new game in that series comes out, they may be convinced to purchase a PlayStation. It also adds additional income, because porting to PC is way cheaper than creating an original title. So, it's almost like printing money. And that helps us to invest in new titles now that the cost of games has increased."</p><p>The benefit to Sony's push into PC gaming is that it has also allowed it to reach very lucrative markets like China, where PCs are far more popular than consoles. "China is a growing but very small console market. In order to reach the audience in countries like China then it's crucial to release on PC. So, I believe PC versions really reach a new audience," Yoshida added.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-comes-to-pc-in-april-requires-psn-account/1100-6528451/">Sony's next PC port will be The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered</a>, which comes shortly after the release of Marvel's Spider-Man 2 earlier this year. Yoshida has participated in several interviews since he bid farewell to Sony in January, a company he worked at for 38 years. Starting in 2019, Yoshida was put in charge of a new indies initiative for Sony, a position <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-says-he-had-no-choice-but-to-take-indies-job/1100-6529536/">that he says he had no choice to accept at the time</a> as it was either that or he would have been forced to leave the company.</p><p>Yoshida has also spoken candidly about how he would have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-playstation-exec-says-he-would-have-resisted-sonys-live-service-push/1100-6528881/">attempted to "resist" the push into live-service games</a> had he still been SIE president and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-exec-theorizes-bloodborne-director-is-too-busy-for-remaster/1100-6528852/">why there is no Bloodborne remaster</a> yet.</p>

            <p>Netflix has joined the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sifu">Sifu</a> film project, adapting Sloclap's kung-fu roguelike for the big screen.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sifu-getting-live-action-movie-adaptation-from-john-wick-writer-1">project was first revealed in 2022</a>, with <a href="https://www.story-kitchen.com/projects">Story Kitchen</a> producing - that's the company behind other video game adaptations like the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film-review">Sonic the Hedgehog films</a>, the forthcoming Tomb Raider and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/streets-of-rage-movie-in-development">Streets of Rage</a> adaptations, and more.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/02/netflix-sifu-t-s-nowlin-chad-stahelskis-producing-1236295230/">Deadline</a> has reported, Netflix is now on board and has tapped TS Nowlin to write the script, while inside sources have said Chad Stahelski and his 87Eleven Entertainment company have joined as producers.

<p>Nowlin is best known for adapting The Maze Runner book series into film, and also wrote the 2022 Netflix film The Adam Project, which starred Ryan Reynolds and Zoe Saldana.</p>
<p>87Eleven, meanwhile, is developing various projects including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shogun-star-in-talks-for-ghost-of-tsushima-film-role">Sony's Ghost of Tsushima film</a>, a Rainbow Six film starring Michael B Jordan, a new Highlander film with Henry Cavill, and more.</p>
<p>Story Kitchen partner Derek Kolstad was previously linked with the project, following his work on the John Wick films. The Sifu adaptation was described as "John Wick meets M. Night Shyamalan's Old".</p>
<p>Sloclap's game follows a young martial artist seeking vengeance against the death of his master. Thanks to a magical talisman, he's resurrected after each death but ages every time until old age eventually makes his death permanent.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sifu-review">game reviewed well</a> and proved popular, following Sloclap's previous action game Absolver.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time Sifu has been adapted either, after it featured in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-latest-secret-level-trailer-includes-sifu-megaman-spelunky-and-a-nightmarish-pac-man">Amazon's Secret Level series</a>.</p>
<p>Next for Sloclap is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sifu-developers-next-game-will-give-football-a-fresh-perspective">football action game Rematch</a>, which promises a fresh perspective on the beautiful game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-3-adds-amd-fsr-3-frame-generation-and-path-tracing-support-on-amd-intel/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-mfg-out-now-with-game-ready-driver-in-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-tomorrow-in-delta-force-black-hawk-down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> integrated support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation as part of the game's third update. The game was also updated to support the latest DLAA and DLSS Super Resolution transformer-based AI models, which offer improved quality, as well as Ray Reconstruction, which improves ray tracing. Ray traced shadows also now optionally include all light sources, significantly increasing the quality of shadows in interior locations. But the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2677660/view/502817574909640811" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patch notes</a> also reveal good news for AMD and Intel owners, too:</p>
<p><em>This update brings Path Tracing to supported Intel and AMD GPUs. To use Path Tracing, your Intel or AMD graphics card must support Hardware Ray Tracing and have at least 16GB of VRAM. Please make sure to download the latest drivers from your GPU manufacturer.</em></p>
<p><em>Note that in foliage-dense locations, such as Sukhothai, reducing Vegetation Animation Quality below the “Ultra” settings can reduce the occasional shadow “popping” that may be seen on all graphics cards using Path Tracing.</em></p>
<p>Moreover, the third Indiana Jones and the Great Circle adds support for AMD FSR 3.1 upscaling and frame generation technology, allowing players without GeForce RTX 40 or 50 graphics cards to take advantage of frame generation in the game. Lastly, the patch&nbsp;also adds support for Intel XESS 1.4 upscaling.</p>
<p>There are also a few technical fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improvements have been made to environment lights to present a more natural appearance when Path Tracing is enabled</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Nvidia Low Latency mode would cause inconsistent frame rates</li>
<li>Fixed issue where Nvidia Frame Generation became disabled when HDR was toggled on</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Indy’s hair was missing in reflections when using Path Tracing</li>
<li>Fixed some issues with light leaks in underground locations in Gizeh when Path Tracing is enabled</li>
</ul>
<p>As we had assumed, the previously announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-get-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-and-rtx-hair-with-february-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Hair feature</a> is not available in this update. Indeed, the patch notes mention it as a possible addition for future Indiana Jones and the Great Circle updates alongside HUD modification, which the community has requested.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-lawless-update-chapter-6-season-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has released the&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>Lawless update for Chapter 6 Season 2, and it's bringing sweeping heist-themed changes to the map, as well as a&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>crossover and much more.</p>

<p>New crime-themed locations like the Hostile Hotel, the Wise Guys Bookstore, and the Launder Mat (I see what you did there, Epic) have been added to the map, as well as "high-end hangout luxury spa" the Outlaw Oasis and the rather unfortunately-named Shiny Shafts mining operation.</p>

<p>You'll also have the opportunity to do battle with the lupine crime boss Fletcher Kane, and beating him will reward you with a Mythic Pistol and a Medallion that increases your sprint speed. Of course, like all Medallions, it'll also reveal your location to other players.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-lawless-chapter-6-season-2-big-dill.jpg?itok=YzfNuClL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-lawless-chapter-6-season-2-big-dill.jpg?itok=wr7ZQZ0m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fortnite</em>'s new Season has more than just crime-themed updates to offer.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the aforementioned changes, you'll also find the hip-hop duo known as the Tasty Bois making their debut in this Season, and their debut track "Runamok" is available as a Jam Track in the new Battle Pass.</p>

<p>As a reminder, XP earned in any of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s gameplay modes <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-battle-pass-xp-simplified" rel="nofollow">now contributes to Battle Passes</a> across all of those modes, so you won't need to stick to Battle Royale to earn enough XP to play that track in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival</em>.</p>

<p>Included in the new Season's Battle Pass are a number of skins, many of them originals; you'll be able to get the likes of Big Dill, Fletcher Kane, and Cassidy Quinn as skins if you pick up the paid pass.</p>

<p>However, you'll also get access to Lin Kuei ninja Sub-Zero, who's joining the pass as&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s first&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>crossover skin. Prominent&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>leaker Shiina has also <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1890484917613498532" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> that revenant Scorpion will be available later in the season.</p>




<p>In addition to all of the above, Chapter 6 Season 2 also brings&nbsp;<em>Cowboy Bebop</em>-themed quests, new gameplay systems to engage with across&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s new map, and much more. You can read the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/run-amok-in-fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-6-season-2-lawless?lang=en-US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full rundown of what's new right here</a>.</p>

<p><em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>is available to play right now for free across pretty much every platform going. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/split-fiction-friends-pass-will-support-crossplay-on-any-platform.1115337/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-friends-pass-crossplay<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has revealed that the&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>Friend's Pass will allow you and a friend to enjoy the co-op adventure together on any platform, as long as at least one of you owns the full game.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/split-fiction/split-fiction/features/friends-pass-pc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a> detailing the Friend's Pass, EA says that you can invite a friend to play with you for free on PC, PS5, or Xbox Series X|S, and it doesn't matter which platform you're playing on; "as long as one of you owns the game, both of you can play".</p>

<p>This works in a similar way to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hazelight-josef-fares-new-ip-it-takes-two-sales" rel="nofollow">phenomenally successful&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two</em></a>'s Friend Pass, which also allowed you and a friend to play the whole game together with just one copy, although that pass didn't support crossplay.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-friends-pass-crossplay-sci-fi.jpg?itok=6fQ3REuh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-friends-pass-crossplay-sci-fi.jpg?itok=YciDjkgj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>is the latest game by&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>studio Hazelight.</figcaption></figure><p>The Friend's Pass can also be used as a demo to let you and a friend experience the first few levels of&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>. All you need to do is download the Pass, make sure your friend has done the same, and fire the Pass version of the game up on your platform of choice.</p>

<p>What's more, the Friend's Pass can be used any number of times, so as long as you're playing with someone who owns the full game, your Friend's Pass will work, whether or not you've already used it.</p>

<p>Of course, if all of this doesn't sound like your bag, you can still enjoy&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>in local co-op. There are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs" rel="nofollow">plenty of things</a> about which to (heavily) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-the-veilguard-shared-world-elements" rel="nofollow">criticize EA</a>, but this isn't one of them, it seems to me.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, it's the latest game by&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>A Way Out&nbsp;</em>developer Hazelight, led by Josef Fares.</p>

<p>The game sees two writers, Mio and Zoe, "trapped in their own stories after being hooked up to a machine designed to steal their creative ideas". You'll bounce between sci-fi and fantasy worlds, solving co-op puzzles and learning more about both characters in the process.</p>

<p><em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2001120/Split_Fiction/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/split-fiction/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/split-fiction/9N1WXXD1RL8D" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on March 6th. You can take a look at our Erren's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/split-fiction-preview-double-vision" rel="nofollow">very enthusiastic preview of the game here</a>.</p>

Eating this will temporarily improve how much damage you do to Kith (any humanoid enemies), making it a good food to chomp down on before facing the boss of this tutorial area.</p><hr><p>For finding the hidden room, you’ll also earn the “Hawkeye” achievement.

The second was building out its own PC game store and using Twitch’s popularity to drive players toward it. Finally, there was Luna, Amazon’s game streaming service. </p><p>None of these made a dent, and efforts by EA, Ubisoft, Bethesda and other publishers to build stores by locking their respective PC games <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/desktop-launcher-pc-review-ea-battle-net-ubisoft-app-1850489703&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/desktop-launcher-pc-review-ea-battle-net-ubisoft-app-1850489703">behind annoying proprietary launchers</a></span> eventually failed as well. Even the Epic Games Store, launched back in 2017, is still a <em>Fortnite</em> launcher first and a Steam rival second. Despite giving away tons of free games every year to people just for logging on, Epic’s storefront feels like its stalled out (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/epic-store-free-games-stats-steam-mobile-fortnite-1851764053&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/epic-store-free-games-stats-steam-mobile-fortnite-1851764053">though lots of new features are on the way in 2025</a></span>). <br></p><p>“The mistake was that we underestimated what made consumers use Steam,” Evans wrote. “It was a store, a social network, a library, and a trophy case all in one. And it worked well. At Amazon, we assumed that size and visibility would be enough to attract customers, but we underestimated the power of existing user habits. We never validated our core assumptions before investing heavily in solutions. The truth is that gamers already had the solution to their problems, and they weren’t going to switch platforms just because a new one was available.”</p><p>What the retired executive is essentially saying is that Amazon thought people would show up simply because it was Amazon, when if it really wanted to take Steam on, it needed to actually give players a reason to switch. “We needed to build something dramatically better, but we failed to do so,” he wrote. “And we needed to validate our assumptions about our customers before starting to build. But we never really did that either. Just because you are big enough to build something doesn’t mean people will use it.” It’s a testament to Valve as much as it’s an indictment of C-suite brain rot. </p><p>For all of the valid criticism of Steam—the lack of moderation, terrible discovery tools, Nazi-ridden forums, and aging infrastructure—it still works pretty damn well. Then you have all of the ecosystem lock-in, from the social network aspect to new Steam sales adding more cheap games to players’ libraries every season. Plus it’s now basically the de facto launching ground for the biggest unexpected hits of any given year, from<em> Balatro</em> to <em>Palworld</em>. In addition to everything else, Steam is one of the main drivers of the attention economy around gaming, which is why a cool timed exclusive might hit the Epic Games Store and you never hear a peep about it. </p><p>It doesn’t feel great that one company controls so much about one of the largest and fastest-growing ways people play games, but then again it also sucked when companies tried to compete by making everyone maintain five different windows for booting up PC games. Maybe instead of competing for market share and platform dominance, more companies could follow <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">GOG in creating a DRM-free</a></span> future for PC gaming.

<p>PGA Tour 2K25 Locker Codes reward you for playing the game. It’s a nice feeling, in all honesty, and to make sure you don’t miss out on new rewards such as clothes and consumables, we’ve got the latest PGA Tour 2K25 Locker Codes for February 2025.</p>



<p>2K has a habit of including Codes and Keys across its games. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands</a> is known for using Shift Keys to give players in-game bonuses. Whereas most of 2K’s sports games use the Locker Codes feature. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pga-tour-2k25-release-date-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25</a> is the latest example of incorporating Locker Codes into the gameplay.</p>



<p>Codes can be hidden in the game or on social media. But they’re not so hidden when we’re around.</p>

<p><strong>You need to go to the Settings menu, find the Locker Code Redemption, and input the code to secure your free goodies in PGA Tour 2K25.</strong></p>



<p>Again, this is very straightforward, but here are the steps to follow:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to PGA Tour 2K25’s home menu screen.</li>



<li>Head to your <strong>Profile Menu</strong>.</li>



<li>Scroll across to <strong>Settings</strong>.</li>



<li>Flick through the options until you get to <strong>Redeem Locker Code</strong>.</li>



<li>Click on it.</li>

<li>Confirm your choice to receive the applicable bonus!</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-pga-tour-2k25-expired-locker-codes">PGA Tour 2K25 Expired Locker Codes</h2>



<p><strong>There are currently no expired Locker Codes in PGA Tour 2K25.</strong></p>



<p>As I write this, the game is still very new, so any active codes valid from its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-pga-tour-2k25-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access</a> launch are still going strong. You don’t have to miss out if you get on the codes above early enough. But don’t expect it to stay this way.</p>



<p>Make sure you keep checking back to see if any new codes are available. Plus, it’s always handy to know which no longer works.</p>



<hr>



<p>2K will likely add new PGA Tour 2K25 Locker Codes. The goodies likely vary from code to code, so ensure you’re not missing out on good stuff. Which rewards are you most desperate to be included as part of Locker Codes?</p>

            <p>
The Pokémon Company has won "substantial" damages after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-pokemon-company-sues-chinese-clone-seeks-62m-and-public-apology">long-running battle against a Chinese mobile rip-off</a>, following years of legal wrangling.
</p>
<p>
While the final amount has not been made public, The Pokémon Company previously said it was owed $72m (£57m) by the makers of an unlicensed Pocket Monsters smartphone app that clearly used Pokémon characters and gameplay.
</p>
<p>
The Pokémon Company looked to have initially won its case last September, though two of the companies involved (Guangzhou Maichi Network Technology and Khorgos Fangchi Network Technology) appealed the decision, prompting a further delay (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/the-pokemon-company-reaches-costly-settlement-in-copyright-infringement-lawsuit-over-chinese-mobile-game/">Automaton</a>).

<p>
Now, a Chinese court has decided upon the matter for good, and the companies have been forced to admit defeat and issue a public apology.
</p>
<p>
"We have deeply realised that our acts had violated relevant laws during the second-instance trial and settlement process," the companies said in a <a href="https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/PostImages/pokemon_news__2_3_4_5_6_7_8_9.pdf">joint public statement, published on The Pokémon Company's corporate website</a>. "[Our] game has extensively used design elements of the well-known Pokémon video game series, infringing the copyrights related to the Pokémon video games, and has unfairly taken advantage of the fame and reputation of the Pokémon video games, thereby constituting acts of unfair competition. 
</p>
<p>
"Our copyright infringement and acts of unfair competition have caused significant economic losses to the rights holders and severely damaged the image of the original Pokémon video games. We hereby sincerely apologise to TPC and other rights holders, as well as the vast number of players, consumers, and the general public."
</p>
<p>
The game, known variously as Pocket Monster: Remake or Pocket Monster: Issue/Reissue, has now been permanently removed from sale. The companies behind the game also say they have paid "a substantial economic price and incurred significant reputational damage".
</p>
<p>
"We have deeply reflected on it and learned our lessons."
</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-sues-fortnite-cheater-takes-back-winnings-and-forces-them-to-post-humiliating-public-apology-video-as-a-stark-warning-to-others">Fortnite maker Epic Games forced a competitive cheater to publicly apologise</a> after unfairly winning thousands of dollars in prize money. The money was taken back, the cheat was banned from playing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> competitively for life, and they had to publish a humiliating public message as a stark warning to others.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tales-of-the-shire-delayed-again-to-july.1115313/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-shire-delayed-july<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Private Division and developer&nbsp;Wētā Workshop have announced that cozy hobbit life sim&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>has once again been delayed, this time to summer.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/talesoftheshire/status/1892635375165731165" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X,&nbsp;Wētā announces that the game's new release date will be July 29th. Rather endearingly, the studio says it wants&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>"to feel like a warm hug from Middle-earth" for all players, "no matter where you play".</p>

<p>While the platform isn't mentioned by name, that wording could suggest that the delay has been put into place to make sure the Switch version of the game is up to par, given that the console is significantly less powerful than its peers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-delayed-july-home.jpg?itok=sFfIdc1L 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-delayed-july-home.jpg?itok=_In8arGv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>is now launching in summer.</figcaption></figure><p>Wētā goes on to say that it wants to make sure "every detail" is just right, "from foot-hair styles to the fluffiest cakes". Well, it wouldn't be a hobbit life sim without those things, I suppose.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there's no sweetener to go along with this announcement, so if you were hoping to try out a&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>demo ahead of the game's release, it looks like you're out of luck, at least for now.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire</em>, it's a cozy life sim set in the sleepy hobbit village of Bywater, where you'll be able to carve out a life for yourself as a peace-loving hobbit. Don't worry; you won't be tasked with throwing any rings into any volcanoes.</p>

<p>Instead, you'll be fishing, chatting to the locals, and arranging your hobbit-hole so that it looks just right. In general, if you've ever fantasized about living life in the Shire and shirking all of that pesky adventure nonsense, this is the game for you.</p>




<p>Revealed in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cozy-hobbit-game-tales-of-shire-announed" rel="nofollow">September 2023</a>,&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-shire-gameplay-announce-pc-consoles" rel="nofollow">set for a 2024 launch</a>, but was subsequently delayed to 2025, eventually receiving the aforementioned <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-shire-release-date" rel="nofollow">March release date</a> (which sadly no longer stands).</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2016460/Tales_of_the_Shire_A_The_Lord_of_The_Rings_Game/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10010195/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tales-of-the-shire-a-the-lord-of-the-rings-game/9pkkjbvpp4gw" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/tales-of-the-shire-a-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on July 29th.

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/persona">Persona</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/shin-megami-tensei">Shin Megami Tensei</a> composer Shoji Meguro is making a turn-based sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> about private military companies gunning through the ashes of a nuclear war. He's working with Ilya Kuvshinov, the illustrator who created character designs for Ghost in the Shell: SAC 2045, and Lotus Juice, a rapper who has contributed sick beats to any number of Personae. So if nothing else Guns Undarkness is probably going to look and sound quite fancy.</p>
<p>But how does it play? Meguro has made his name as a musician: I have no idea how well that expertise translates to designing combat systems. It's something to think about while you watch and listen to the below trailer for the game's first demo, out on 24th February.

<p>
Published by Kodansha, Guns Undarkness is set in 2045 and is a story about a social divide and, oh hey woah! They are certainly invoking some... rich material with this one. As summarised on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1801140/Guns_Undarkness/">Steam</a>, the game takes place following a near-future period "of abeyance that allowed technology to flourish, but deepened the social divide between the rich and the poor, the Haves and the Have Nots". Please tell me those aren't the literal faction names.</p>
<p>Apparently, a bunch of "primitivist" poor people got together to pull off a "Great Reset" in the shape of a worldwide nuclear war. Now, it's up to your rookie soldier "to discover the truth behind love in a world wracked by devastation and whether humanity is capable of being revolutionized."
</p>
<p>
For context, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Reset">the "Great Reset" in reality</a> was an initiative launched by the World Economic Forum to kindle economic growth (or at least, further enrich the plutocrats) following the Covid 19 pandemic lockdowns. It's also the name of a bunch of conspiracy theories which hold that corporations are trying to brainwash people with vaccines so as to destroy the very concept of property. So there is... ample topicality to unpack here, given some pretty delicate writing, and the Steam page blurb is anything but. It cites <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> as an inspiration, which worries me further - I'm not sure any other video game writer has Kojima's ability to somehow clown his way through a bunch of realworld parallels without setting anything on fire.
</p>
<p>

Still, let's shelve those concerns for the moment, and talk about the game's combat. You control a squad of four, including your protagonist, who venture out to mission maps from a submarine base. Battles are initiated during exploration by sneakily stacking people up at cover points and taking a pop at the foe - kind of like synchronising killshots in Rainbow Six, except that it's the prelude to a turn-based brawl. 
</p>
<p>
There are two broad kinds of action - regular attacks, which don't consume points, and skills, which are more powerful but do consume points. If you're in cover, however, you can fire off skills for free. If you're out of cover and you attack an enemy's weakpoint with a regular attack, "you'll be able to duck into cover". So a free move, then? 
</p>
<p>
There are also buffs and debuffs applied by guns, which level up separately to characters. Oh, and there's a Persona-style reputation system with characters improving their capabilities when fighting alongside their best mates. It seems like they have the makings of an enjoyably synergistickal framework, here. With any luck the game will be all about those synergies and not some kind of veiled/accidental piece of anti-vaxxer propaganda.
</p>
<p>
Guns Undarkness is out sometime this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Former PlayStation exec Shuhei Yoshida has admitted porting PlayStation-exclusive games to PC is "almost like printing money", and provides an opportunity to invest in further games.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.patreon.com/LastStandMedia/home">Sacred Symbols+</a> (via <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/02/ex-sony-exec-says-pc-ports-of-old-ps5-games-are-almost-like-printing-money">Push Square</a>), Yoshida revealed he wanted to bring first-party games to PC sooner, but this wasn't Sony's business model at the time.</p>
<p>"Releasing on PC does many things: it reaches a new audience who do not own consoles – especially in regions where consoles are not as popular," he said. "The idea is that those people may become fans of a particular franchise, and when a new game in that series comes out, they may be convinced to purchase a PlayStation."</p>

<p>Beyond those benefits, it also allows Sony to reinvest money into other projects.</p>
<p>"It also adds additional income, because porting to PC is way cheaper than creating an original title," he said. "So, it's almost like printing money. And that helps us to invest in new titles now that the cost of games has increased."</p>
<p>What's more, releasing games on PC allows PlayStation to spread to new regions where that platform is more popular - China, in particular.</p>
<p>"China is a huge PC game market," said Yoshida. "And China is a growing but very small console market. In order to reach the audience in countries like China then it's crucial to release on PC. So, I believe PC versions really reach a new audience."</p>
<p>Beginning with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> in 2020, Sony has gradually been porting its PlayStation exclusive games to PC.</p>
<p>Most recently, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> released on PC, while The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered is set to follow in April.</p>
<p>And while these releases have seen diminishing returns in terms of player numbers on Steam at least, the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> was a huge success for Sony - it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">PlayStation's fastest selling game</a> owing to huge success on PC. That success was hampered, though, by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements">Sony's insistence on requiring PSN to play</a>.</p>
<p>In the same interview, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-was-great-former-playstation-exec-says-but-naughty-dog-couldnt-make-it-alongside-new-ip">Yoshida also discussed Sony's live service plans</a>, revealing he played <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s ill-fated The Last of Us Online, which he described as "great".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A lawsuit between Sony and a fired Bungie director is getting messy. Sony have revealed the text messages sent by the former director, which they say are proof of his "predatory behaviour" and justify their decision to dismiss him. Christopher Barrett was removed from his position last year <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-replace-marathon-director-amid-reports-of-creative-leadership-shake-up">in a dramatic reshuffle</a> and it was later revealed that the reasons included <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-reportedly-fired-marathon-reboot-director-chris-barrett-for-unwanted-and-inappropriate-messages-to-female-staff">alleged "inappropriate" and "unwanted" messages</a> to female staff at the studio. In response to the allegations, Barrett sued Bungie and parent company Sony for breach of contract and defamation, claiming that the investigation that led to his dismissal was a "sham". The real reason for his firing, he says, was to stop a big bonus payout of over $45 million. </p>
<p>But lo, the Streisand effect has been initiated. His lawsuit has invited Sony to roll up their sleeves and dip their arms into their big gritty bag of exhibits. Examples of the texts he allegedly sent to employees have been revealed in a court filing.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/830250465/Christopher-Barrett-v-Sony-Interactive-Entertainment-LLC-and-Bungie-Inc-2024-1285-No-97653544-97653546-Del-Ch-Feb-12-2025-1">128-page legal document</a> is basically a line-by-line response to all the claims Barrett is making in his lawsuit against his former company. It was first reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/sony-bungie-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-response">Stephen Totilo of Game File</a>, who's been following the case <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/christopher-barrett-sony-bungie-lawsuit-marathon">since the lawsuit began</a>. In the document Sony first repeat their claims against Barrett, citing the original investigation they did into his conduct.</p>
<blockquote>"The investigation revealed that Barrett's misconduct with each employee was consistent: he targeted a lower-level, female employee he wasn't working with directly, initially engaged in friendly conversation, and progressively pushed boundaries with the employee by making subtle references to her physical appearance or expressing his interest in her romantically. Barrett attempted to create an unprofessional level of intimacy with his victims. He requested to follow personal Instagram accounts and would express anger to the women if they failed to respond to his messages. He would bring up inappropriate topics like their body, their relationships, his marriage, or his desire to date them. He would demand that they participate in sexually charged games of "Truth or Dare" and "Ask Me Anything." He texted them at all hours of the day and night. He offered to buy them gifts. He often referenced his wealth and his ability to advance their careers.</blockquote>
<p>Sony then goes on to include specific examples of the texts Barrett allegedly sent to female employees, as well as behaviour they say he engaged in, such as calling female employees while drunk to ask who they were dating. Here's some of what's included in the document:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Barrett asked VICTIM 1 to play "Truth or Dare" over text message and inquired, "what do you think is your best and worst feature physically[?]" He later told her in a text message that she was "hot".</li>
<li>Despite VICTIM 1's explicit request in writing for Barrett to recognize "boundaries," he called her late at night while drunk and after keeping her on a FaceTime call for hours, moved down a dark hallway to his bedroom and suggestively told her, "I can't believe I am lying in bed talking to [VICTIM 1]." She abruptly hung up.</li>
<li>Barrett sent VICTIM 2 Instagram direct messages stating, "You are the holy grail. I hope you find a person worthy of your attention" and qualified it with, "I'm not hitting on you. I hope it doesn't feel like that. I'm married. But I can be honest. You are the .000001 and better be treated like that forever." When VICTIM 2 responded that her boyfriend treats her very well, Barrett responded, "He better[.] Cuz i would hit on you if he wasn't."</li>
<li>Barrett also sent VICTIM 2 an Instagram direct message asking, "You want to be worshipped, I think? Why are you against that actually happening?" And a few days later messaged VICTIM 2, "[w]hat are the steps one would have to take [to date you?] What's the strategy guide[?]"</li>
<li>Barrett similarly told VICTIM 3, "I hope [your boyfriend] doesn't mind I text you a lot" and "I just worry. Like I really enjoy texting you and talking. I don't want him to get the right idea." Later in the conversation, when VICTIM 3 told Barrett she was busy, Barrett stated, "I want your attention, so annoying."</li>
<li>In another Microsoft Teams exchange, Barrett asked VICTIM 4, "Are you still in PJ s?" and "[i]s it like a button down top and bottoms? Sweat pants? Lululemons?".</li>
<li>Just three weeks into VICTIM 5's tenure at Bungie, Barrett called her late in the evening, while drunk, and told her intimate details about his personal life and asked her about who she was dating and what her "type" was. He sent her a personal Instagram follow request to connect that night, which she did not accept.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Sony goes on to say that many of the women involved eventually reported these incidents to Human Resources, but were nonetheless afraid for their positions. </p>
<p>"Barrett's predatory behavior caused victims to seek guidance from other Bungie employees on how to manage Barrett's constant boundary-pushing given that he was a long-standing, senior member of the company," they say.

</p><p>"Some victims did tell Barrett to stop. But even in cases where he initially feigned compliance, Barrett promptly picked back up again with his disturbing behavior in his next communication."</p>
<p>All this essentially means that Sony is sticking to their decision to fire Barrett for reasons of "gross misconduct and gross negligence", which would cover them as terminating his employment "for Cause". </p>
<p>This is the part that Barrett disputes. He claims that he has been "scapegoat[ed]," "falsely" accused, and "defame[d]" all because Sony don't want to pay out a big bonus he says he is entitled to - a multi-million-dollar payout he is reportedly owed thanks to Sony's purchase of Bungie in 2022.</p>
<p>"Sony continues to disingenuously cherry pick text messages and alleged conversations," said Barrett's legal team in a message to Totilo at Game File. "[They] make unsupported and conclusory statements to defame Christopher and justify terminating him to avoid paying him what he was owed under his employment agreements. It is telling that Sony does not include the full text messages as exhibits, or the full content of these conversations, and nothing in Sony’s response provides a legitimate legal or factual basis to terminate Christopher for cause."</p>
<p>Barrett's lawyers argue that the company did not have cause to fire him, as he did not "engage in any financial improprieties" or "have or solicit any improper sexual relationships with his colleagues."</p>
<p>Sony calls this line of argument "outrageous considering the evidence".</p>
<p>"Hundreds of Barrett's own written statements and the direct testimony of his many victims will demonstrate his termination for Cause was justified and this lawsuit is meritless," they say in the document.</p>
<p>It is hard to know how legal cases such as this will shake out. Totilo notes the "aggressive" tactics of both parties, and comments that many cases involving such sums of money are eventually settled. </p>
<p>Bungie has been in the spotlight over such issues before. In 2021 they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-ceo-apologises-after-damning-report-about-toxic-studio-culture">accused of a "toxic" studio culture</a> in which women and others did not feel safe or valued. A senior leader at the company called one woman "an unmanageable bitch", for example. Another senior leader allegedly made frequent racist remarks. The CEO of the company, Pete Parsons, apologised and promised changes to the studio, saying it was "clear we still have work ahead of us".</p>
<p>In related news, the studio has recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-seek-to-reassure-everyone-that-marathon-is-still-alive-by-saying-almost-nothing-about-it">sought to reassure fans</a> that their next game, an extraction shooter reboot of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, is still in production with new director Joe Ziegler having replaced Barrett. Though there hasn't been much news about the game since its reveal, and the studio has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-layoffs-couldnt-be-avoided-even-if-destiny-2-the-final-shape-had-blockbuster-performance-says-report">since suffered from recent layoffs</a>. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-cheating-low-severity-violation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/twitch-thinks-cheating-in-games-is-a-%E2%80%98low-severity-violation%E2%80%99.1115289/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-cheating-low-severity-violation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Twitch recently posted an update to its terms of service, outlining changes to the platform’s enforcement system. In this update, it was confirmed that violations will now ‘expire’, and the less severe the violation, the faster it’ll disappear from your account history. The most abhorrent violations will remain on your account for up to two years.</p>



<p>However, the policy update penned by Twitch Support also confirmed that the platform believes cheating in video games is an example of a ‘low severity violation’. As such, it will remove any trace of these incidents from your record, if you’ve faced punitive action, in as little as 90 days.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-getting-away-with-it">Getting Away With It</h2>



<p>Twitch’s <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/article/An-Update-to-our-Enforcement-System?language=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">enforcement update</a> came with a graphic that shows how things work on the platform.</p>



<p>Every account starts in ‘good standing’ with zero violations. If you’re caught cheating in a game, you’ll get a <strong>one-day </strong>suspension and the record will be marked against your account for 90 days. If you’re caught cheating <strong>again</strong>, you’ll get a <strong>three-day </strong>suspension and that 90-day threshold will reset and be pushed further out.</p>



<p>Following that 90-day window, you’ll be returned to ‘good standing’.</p>



<p>That means that you can be caught cheating multiple times, and as long as you serve your suspension, you’ll only have to wait three months before Twitch views you as a model citizen once again.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Is this justice?</figcaption></figure>







<p>Cheating is one of the most disruptive acts in modern gaming – and it has been a growing issue for years. Some games are borderline unplayable at times because of cheaters ruining everyone’s fun, and publishers and developers have taken ‘cheat makers’ to court and sought out damages in the tens of millions of dollars.</p>



<p>And many have been successful in their pursuits of justice.</p>



<p>In South Korea and China, you can face a fine or even jail time for manufacturing or using cheats in a game – but Twitch is banned in China and around a year ago, the company withdrew from South Korea.</p>



<p>As a lover of all things multiplayer, I find it bizarre that you can publicly cheat in a game on Twitch and a) face just a one-day suspension, and b) have your record scrubbed in 90 days.</p>



<p>What about those cheating in professional tournaments to win cash prizes? Should that just face a one-day suspension?</p>



<p>At the least, you’re standing firm as a testament to the slacking policies of the platform, but in the worst-case scenario, you’re letting others know where and how to cheat in popular multiplayer games. Many cheaters will use their streams to actively promote the sale of cheats, with some dastardly operators securing referral bonuses for pointing malicious gamers to cheating sites.</p>



<p>Do you think Twitch should come down harder on those caught cheating in games? Let us know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

R. Martin has issued the strongest tease yet that an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> movie may come to pass, but has acknowledged a significant blocker to his potential involvement with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Game of Thrones creator famously dreamed up the world and history of FromSoftware’s Elden Ring, which went on to become one of the best-selling games of 2022. FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco leaned heavily on Martin’s involvement in promotional material, and the game credits begin by saying the Elden Ring world was created by FromSoftware chief Hidetaki Miyazaki and George R. R. Martin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, would George R. R. Martin be interested in coming back for a sequel to Elden Ring, if he’s asked? That’s the question IGN put to the man himself as part of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/fanfest">IGN Fan Fest 2025</a>. In his response, Martin sidestepped Elden Ring 2, but did drop a big hint that an Elden Ring movie could be in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Well, I can't say too much about it, but there is some talk about making a movie out of Elden Ring,” Martin said.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/21/gettyimages-1472023146-1740134288274.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">George R.

And indeed, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hidetaka-miyazaki-open-to-elden-ring-movie-if-a-very-strong-partner-were-to-step-in">FromSoftware president Hidetaka Miyazaki has said he’d be open to an adaptation of Elden Ring</a>, but only if a “very strong partner” were to come into play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don’t see any reason to deny another interpretation or adaptation of Elden Ring, a movie for example,” explained Miyazaki in an interview with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/26/pushing-buttons-meeting-hidetaka-miyazaki" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Guardian</u></a>. “But I don’t think myself, or FromSoftware, have the knowledge or ability to produce something in a different medium.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So that’s where a very strong partner would come into play,” continued Miyazaki. “We’d have to build a lot of trust and agreement on whatever it is we’re trying to achieve, but there’s interest, for sure.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, speaking to IGN, George R. R. Martin acknowledged that there may be a significant blocker to any heavy involvement he may have with the Elden Ring movie: he’s still working on The Winds of Winter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We'll see if that [the Elden Ring movie] comes to pass and what the extent of my involvement was, I don't know,” he said. “I'm a few years behind with my latest book, so that also limits the amount of things that I can do.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire fantasy novels have long, long, <em>long, </em>awaited the planned sixth entry in the series, The Winds of Winter. But after more than a decade of delays, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/george-r-r-martin-isnt-sure-hell-ever-finish-the-winds-of-winter-but-its-still-a-priority">even Martin is acknowledging the possibility that it may never come to be</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In December, Martin said: “Unfortunately, I am 13 years late. Every time I say that, I’m [like], ‘How could I be 13 years late?’ I don’t know, it happens a day at a time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But that’s still a priority," he continued. "A lot of people are already writing obituaries for me. [They’re saying] ‘Oh, he’ll never be finished.’ Maybe they’re right. I don’t know. I’m alive right now! I seem pretty vital!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's only the latest in what's been an increasingly bleak wait for The Winds of Winter, with the most recent entry in the series, A Dance With Dragons, publishing in 2011. That's the same year that HBO premiered the insanely popular TV series Game of Thrones, which is based on the A Song of Ice and Fire series and drew <em>a lot</em> more eyes to the world of Westeros.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Elden Ring, Martin explained his work on the game, telling IGN how he helped FromSoftware on worldbuilding.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“... when they came to me, FromSoftware, they wanted the world. They knew the action of Elden Ring that the players would get into would be in the ‘present.’ But something had created that present, had created that world. So where did that world come from? And I've done a lot of world building, most notably on Westeros and the backgrounds of A Song of Ice and Fire and Game of Thrones. And I like doing world building. So what had happened 5,000, 10,000 years before the current day action in Elden Ring that led them to that place? And I had some ideas about the magic and the runes. There was a lot about runes. And I worked it all out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was interesting that the team flew in and we had a number of sessions and they would fly back and do their magic, and then they would come back here a couple months later and show me what they had, which was always amazing to see what they came up with.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Was everything Martin wrote used in the game, or is there more material that could be used in future installments?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, I think especially when you're world building, there's always more that you actually see on the screen,” Martin replied.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And that's true of any of these big epic fantasies. I mean, you look at Tolkien and there are hundreds of pages of past history before you get to even the era of the Hobbit and dozens of kings and wars and things like that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Amanda Edwards/WireImage.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>
Cosy Hobbit life sim Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game has been delayed once again, this time until 29th July.
</p>
<p>
It's the second hold-up for the game after an earlier delay announced last year. Back in September 2024, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cosy-hobbit-life-sim-tales-of-the-shire-delayed">Wētā Workshop said it expected the game to arrive in early 2025</a>. Now, there's another five months to wait.
</p>
<p>
A statement <a href="https://x.com/talesoftheshire/status/1892635375165731165">published today on the game's social media account</a> does not go into detail on why the game has been postponed once again, other than to say that Wētā Workshop wanted to ensure "every Hobbit, on every platform, can enjoy the same cosy experience".

<p>
It seems possible that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/take-two-interactive">Take-Two Interactive</a>'s recent sale of Private Division, Tales of the Shire's original publisher, may have had some impact on the game's progress. But some Lord of the Rings fans have also raised questions about the game's quality level, based on previous trailers.
</p>
<p>
"We want this game to feel like a warm hug from Middle-earth," today's statement notes, "and we are making sure that no matter where you play, you'll feel right at home in The Shire. From foot-hair styles to the fluffiest cakes, every detail will be just right."
</p>
<p>
It's been reported that Tales of the Shire, alongside other Private Division games such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kerbal-space-program-2">Kerbal Space Program 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-annapurna-interactive-staff-reportedly-taking-over-private-division-portfolio-following-take-two-sale">will now be aided by staff members</a> who previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-sees-exodus-of-entire-staff-as-negotiations-break-down">quit indie publisher Annapurna Interactive in a mass exodus</a> last year.

		<p>THQ Nordic and Alkimia Interactive have announced that a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gothic-remake">Gothic 1 Remake</a> demo will feature as part of Steam Next Fest next week. The demo will be available from Monday 24th February at 6PM GMT.</p>
<p>This preview of the broader project will take players back to the Valley of the Mines in a faithful remake of the classic RPG. However, this is a standalone prologue that is separate from the main game. You won’t be playing as the Nameless Hero, but instead get to explore the Colony through the eyes of Nyras, a member of the Brotherhood of the Sleeper who plays a fairly significant role in the original’s story.</p>


<p>Nyras is a character that many will know from the original game, and playing as him in this prologue, he is a nobody, an inexperienced newcomer to this region. Through the self-contained prologue, you’ll see a slice of the Colony, get to experience the challenging combat, figuring how to survive through patience, skill and improving equipment.</p>
<p>This is a publicly playable build of a demo that has been previewed by some outlets over the last couple years – presumably Alkimia has brought some updates to this game to make it fit for public consumption.</p>
<p>Gothic has been in the works for quite some time. It was greenlit off the back of some canny marketing by THQ Nordic, first commissioning <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/12/14/gothic-remake-playable-teaser-steam-download/">a playable teaser</a> that was made and released in 2019 to show what a Gothic remake might be able to offer, and then gathering what ended up being<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/02/19/next-gen-gothic-remake-development-unambiguous-feedback/">&nbsp;“unambiguous feedback” from fans</a>. Off the back of this, they founded Alkimia Interactive in Barcelona specifically for the remake, and they’ve been plugging away at it ever since.</p>

<p>There’s obviously some real progress being made, and we had <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/get-a-deep-look-at-gothic-remakes-world-gameplay-and-story/">a deeper dive into the remake’s gameplay last summer</a>, though there’s still no sign of a release date. This playable demo is a nice touch, though we hope for a meatier reveal and announcement, perhaps at this year’s THQ Summer Showcase?</p>

            <p>Split Fiction will include crossplay for the first time across all platforms - PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC (Windows, Steam, Epic) - via the Friend's Pass function.</p>
<p>This means Hazelight's forthcoming co-op adventure will be playable by two players online across any platform with only one copy of the game required.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/it-takes-two">It Takes Two</a> similarly included the Friend's Pass function, but players had to be on the same platform. Now, that's changed for Split Fiction.</p>

<p>As long as you own a copy of the game, you can invite any friend on any platform to join you online for free. The catch is that you both need EA accounts linked to your platform account in order to be friends.</p>
<p>Friend's Pass can also be used with "as many different friends as you want, one friend at a time", reads the <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/split-fiction/split-fiction/features/friends-pass-playstation">FAQ</a>, essentially meaning it's not a one time use code so as long as you own a copy of the game, you can share the experience with an infinite number of friends. The host player will also determine the starting point, meaning they can invite a different friend to continue playing (or restart the game).</p>
<p>A demo version of the game will also be playable for free across platforms using Friend's Pass, or in local couch co-op. It includes the first few levels of the game.</p>
<p>And, of course, the game will be fully playable offline in local co-op without using Friend's Pass.</p>
<p>Further, all progress made while playing using Friend's Pass will be carried over into the full game, whether you're the player joining someone else's game via the function, or you're playing the demo version.</p>
<p>However, Trophies and Achievements will only be unlocked by players that have purchased the full game - that would be the host only, and not the player joining for free.</p>
<p>Split Fiction is set for release on 6th March - it's a co-op only game about two authors whose sci-fi and fantasy worlds collide. It follows It Takes Two, which won Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2021 among other accolades.</p>
<p>"What developer Hazelight has essentially done here is build on everything it's done so well with its previous co-op games A Way Out and It Takes Two, and dialled up its ambitions even further," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-is-a-riot-and-its-use-of-a-meat-grinder-might-one-up-that-infamous-elephant-scene-from-it-takes-two">hands-on preview of Split Fiction</a> from Victoria.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Neople’s The First Berserker Khazan has sleeper-hit potential, and its 2025 release isn’t one to miss. Whether you want to know which platforms it’s on, how much it costs, or how to play its exclusive demo, we have everything you need to know before you become a berserker yourself.</p>



<p>2024 smashed it in the Soulslike department. FromSoftware delivered its long-awaited Shadow of the Erdtree DLC—Radahn still gives me nightmares—and Stellar Blade was more than stellar. Now, it’s time to look ahead to 2025. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a> is the first hard-hitting heavyweight in the Soulslike division.</p>



<p>Khazan’s backstory is nearly as brutal and horrific as the punishing gameplay. But to see if this is the start of something special, I’m here to guide you through the title’s key tidbits before launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-first-berserker-khazan-come-out">When Does The First Berserker Khazan Come Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’re hyped. Credit to Neople</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Prepare yourself for The First Berserker Khazan’s March 27 release date.</strong></p>



<p>Yes, the vengeance-hungry warrior graces screens in March. Not content with battling those who wronged him, <a href="https://khazan.nexon.com/en/main" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The First Berserker Khazan</a> also has to stave off the presence of other March 2025 games including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-first-berserker-khazan-platforms">The First Berserker Khazan Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC users can prepare for The First Berserker Khazan launch.</strong></p>



<p>I’m afraid it’s bad news if I haven’t mentioned your platform. PS4 and Xbox One users have to miss out, as do Nintendo Switch owners. I keep questioning if any 2025 releases will get an eventual <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a> port. The console is supposed to be a million times more powerful (might be an exaggeration) and a future Switch 2 launch might not be out of the question.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-the-first-berserker-khazan-demo">How to Play The First Berserker Khazan Demo</h2>



<p><strong>Search for The First Berserker Khazan demo on PlayStation, Xbox, or PC, download it, and get playing.</strong></p>



<p>It’s honestly this simple. But here are some handy instructions to follow precisely if you’re struggling:</p>



<ol>
<li>Choose which platform you want to play The First Berserker Khazan demo on.</li>



<li>Go to the PlayStation Store, Microsoft Store, or Steam.</li>



<li>Search for <strong>The First Berserker Khazan</strong>.</li>



<li>Select the free demo.</li>



<li>Click to download it.</li>



<li>Once it’s ready, you can jump straight into the The First Berserker Khazan demo.</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-the-first-berserker-khazan-editions-amp-price">The First Berserker Khazan Editions &amp; Price</h2>



<p><strong>The First Berserker Khazan has two editions: Standard Edition ($59.99/£49.99) and Deluxe Edition ($69.99/£54.99).</strong></p>



<p>Neople is dispensing with luxuriousness where The First Berserker Khazan is concerned. It’s just a Standard or Deluxe Edition to pick from. Most games release with several editions, so this is a more straightforward selection for once.</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s not a full-price release, nor is it getting the hype of a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA 6</a> or even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-assassins-creed-red-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, but don’t sleep on The First Berserker Khazan. It looks brutal and bold. Do you think it could be this year’s Shadow of the Erdtree? Or is it another Soulslike clone? Leave your thoughts in the comments.</p>



<p>We have many other release date hubs for you to keep checking back in with: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lost-soul-aside-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Soul Aside</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/killing-floor-3-release-date-platforms-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Killing Floor 3</a>, <a href="https://www.talesoftheshire.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tales of the Shire A Lord of the Rings Game</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25</a>.</p>

            <p>
The Epic Games Store for mobile's next free games are <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</a> and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2.
</p>
<p>
You can nab them without paying a penny now via the Epic Games Store app on Android devices, or on iOS if you live in the EU (but not here in the UK - thanks, Brexit.)
</p>
<p>
These titles are Epic's second set of freebies since it began rolling out the mobile store's free games program. The offer began last month, with Dungeons of the Endless: Apogee and Bloons TD6.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Will you embrace the light, or fall to the dark side?  ☄️  Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II are available now for FREE on the Epic Games Store on Android worldwide and iOS (in the EU)!</p><p>Check out the full list of new games that… <a href="https://t.co/FOH5G1ba5V">pic.twitter.com/FOH5G1ba5V</a></p></div>— Epic Games Store (@EpicGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/EpicGames/status/1892610693792236031?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

It's still early days for Epic's mobile storefront, though the company is currently investing in its future with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-unveils-bold-plan-to-pay-penalties-levied-by-apple-to-tempt-developers-onto-its-mobile-store">bold plan to pay penalties levied by Apple to tempt developers over</a>. The company also has big hopes to grow its third-party offering and launch the shop in more territories - including the UK and Japan - in the relatively near future.
</p>
<p>
Epic's mobile expansion plans are currently awaiting various challenges to Apple and Google's app store dominance. Here in the UK, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-set-to-pile-pressure-on-apple-and-google-app-store-dominance-as-fresh-investigation-launched">the CMA has announced it will use the recent Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Act legislation as part of a fresh push to potentially limit their app store dominance</a>.

            <p>
Just when you thought it was safe to go back to the Airship library, Innersloth and Schell Games have announced a 3D version of popular social stealth sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/among-us">Among Us</a>. Or at least, they have taken the existing VR version and made it non-VR. It's a stab in the back for the Meta Questers, perhaps, but it's great news for me, a person who has only ever owned the launch model of the PS4's VR headset, and is currently using its box as a draft excluder.

<p>
Among Us 3D will get a demo in Steam Next Fest next week. Here's a teaser trailer full of jaunty music.
</p>

<p>
"Experience the core Among Us gameplay you know and love -- tasks, sabotages, Emergency Meetings, and venting -- now in an extremely immersive, 3D environment where everything (yup, everything!) is close up and personal," explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3168600/Among_Us_3D/">the Steam page</a>. It'll support native proximity voice chat and crossplay functionality with VR users (but not the original Among Us game, unfortunately). You can expect "new and returning minigames" with first-person controls, and cosmetic customisation that makes use of a new Stardust currency. The Steam demo doesn't include all the core features - there's no crossplay with VR. 
</p>
<p>
After launch, they'll  be adding more modes, tasks, collaborations, hats and limited time events. So when is the full game launching? That's for Innersloth to know and you to wonder about until they spring up behind you and shove a release date through your guts.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/saber-interactive-is-making-a-new-game-based-on-one-of-hasbros-tentpole-franchises/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Saber Interactive is officially making a new game based on one of Hasbro's big franchises. The news comes directly from Chris Cocks, formerly president of Wizards of the Coast and now CEO of parent company Hasbro (quote <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/20/hasbro-has-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via The Motley Fool</a>):</p>
<p><em>We have many new digital collaborations in the works, but I'm especially excited to announce this one today, being a personal fan of many of this team's games. Hasbro and Saber Interactive will be collaborating on an all-new video game partnership developed by the team behind 2024's megahit Warhammer 40,000 Space Marine 2, combining high octane single-player action and amazing multiplayer with Saber's Swarm Tech. This new AAA title, one of our tentpole IPs, is sure to be a hit.</em></p>
<p>Speculation is already running rampant about what it could be. Hasbro has several big franchises that could be adapted into a videogame: Transformers, G.I. Joe, Power Rangers, Dungeons and Dragons, and Magic: The Gathering, to name the most important ones. However, Transformers seems to be the most fitting for the developer behind the highly successful Warhammer 40K Space Marine 2. There's already a G.I. Joe game starring Snake Eyes in development at Wizards of the Coast-owned developer Atomic Arcade, after all, and Dungeons and Dragons already has its own lineup: a co-op game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-in-development-at-starbreeze-for-2026-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in development at Starbreeze</a> targeting a 2026 launch; a new game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-aaa-unreal-engine-5-from-dark-alliance-dev-invoke-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in development at Invoke</a>, formerly Tuque, developer of Dark Alliance; another game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dd-virtual-reality-game-announced-by-demeo-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in development at Demeo developer Resolution Games</a>, now announced as <a href="https://www.resolutiongames.com/battlemarked" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dungeons: Battlemarked</a>; and another game that Chris Cocks had <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-dragons-is-getting-another-videogame-while-hasbro-wont-finance-any-more-film-adaptations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mentioned</a> a few months ago.</p>
<p>Transformers fans, on the other hand, had to deal with the recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/splash-damage-ends-development-of-transformers-reactivate-lays-off-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancelation of Transformers: Reactivate at Splash Damage</a>. Plus, there's the fact that the studio's expertise seems much more suited to a shooter game rather than, say, a Magic: The Gathering game. Still, we'll have to wait and see. It might be a while before we learn more about this project.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Saber is also working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/turok-origins-is-an-upcoming-co-op-game-by-saber/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turok: Origins</a>, a triple-A RPG based on Avatar: The Last Airbender, Jurassic Park Survival, and, of course, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-kotor-remake-is-alive-and-well-promises-saber-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic remake</a> that was once in the hands of Aspyr. If that sounds like too much work, it's worth reminding that Saber is a massive company with many offices across the globe and nearly 2,700 employees.</p>

            <p>Supergiant Games has confirmed it hasn't recast any actors for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>, following accusations from the voice actor of Athena the studio is unwilling to utilise the SAG-AFTRA interim agreement.</p>
<p>The US actors' union is currently on strike due to concerns over the use of AI in the games industry, but an interim agreement is in place to ensure acting work can still continue until a full agreement is signed.</p>
<p>Marin Miller, the voice behind Athena in both Hades and Hades 2, has accused Supergiant of recasting the character because the studio "refused to flip to an interim".</p>

<p>"It's possible you may hear me get recast in a particular game that is very popular," they wrote on social media. "If I am, it was not because I stepped away from the character willingly. It's because the employer refused to flip to an interim."</p>
<p>And while they didn't explicitly mention Supergiant, their follow up post wasn't subtle: "It would be SUPER helpful if you wrote a GIANT email asking them to flip for their actors."</p>

</span></p><p>Supergiant has responded with a lengthy statement, confirming it has not re-cast any characters, but noted its games have not been subject to SAG-AFTRA contracts "for a variety of reasons".</p>
<p>"Voice talent has been integral to each of our games," the statement begins. "Recently, questions arose here about how we work with our voice talent, which we want to address."</p>
<p>Supergiant boasts it offers "the strongest AI protections in the industry to our talent, as we think their work is irreplaceable".</p>
<p>It continues: "Our games are intentionally made by human beings; no generative AI is being used in the creation of the voiceover, artwork, or any other content that goes into them.</p>
<p>"We have not re-cast any of our characters in Hades 2, and wish to keep working with each and every member of our wonderful cast.</p>
<p>"We have respected and will continue to respect any actor needing to pause work during the ongoing SAG-AFTRA video game strike. While none of our games have ever been subject to SAG-AFTRA contracts for a variety of reasons, we wish SAG-AFTRA the best in their negotiations to compel larger signatory studios to provide the kinds of protections we think actors deserve."</p>
<p>It's unclear what the reasons are for not using SAG-AFTRA contracts, though many of the voice actors from Hades 2 are either in-house staff or British (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a>'s Ben Starr, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>'s Colin Ryan, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s Amelia Tyler) and therefore not part of the US union. Or perhaps the studio believes its own protections are enough.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Supergiant for more information.</p>

</span></p><p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marinmmiller.com/post/3likhkirnp22q">follow up thread</a>, Miller emphasised their reliance on SAG-AFTRA for protection, noting this is the seventh month of the strike. "SAG-AFTRA contracts are protected by their legal staff - I can't afford a lawyer without the union," they wrote.</p>
<p>"Clients keep asking me, 'If we include a no-AI rider, will you work non-union or on a 2020 agreement?' Will you be willing to cover the costs of my legal fees if you violate my agreement? Why are you refusing to sign a contract I can enforce?"</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">SAG-AFTRA strike began in July last year</a>, with AI usage the primary concern of the union.</p>
<p>"We're not going to consent to a contract that allows companies to abuse AI to the detriment of our members," SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher said in a statement. "Enough is enough. When these companies get serious about offering an agreement our members can live - and work - with, we will be here, ready to negotiate."</p>
<p>Audrey Cooling, a spokesperson for the video game producers that have signed the existing Interactive Media Agreement, responded: "We have already found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals, including historic wage increases and additional safety provisions. Our offer is directly responsive to SAG-AFTRA's concerns and extends meaningful AI protections that include requiring consent and fair compensation to all performers working under the IMA. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry."</p>
<p>At the start of the year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/negotiations-over-ai-are-still-holding-up-video-game-development-mass-effects-jennifer-hale-explains-why">Eurogamer spoke with celebrated voice actor Jennifer Hale</a> (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, Bayonetta 3) about the strike and why it's taking so long to reach a resolution.</p>
<p>"It's a huge issue for all of us and the repercussions are vast," she says. "So to me, it makes sense that everyone needs to take their time. As performers - and we saw this in the writers strike and the theatrical contract strike - we're just the canary in the coal mine."</p>
<p>The news follows the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-second-major-update-adds-god-of-war-but-still-no-full-release-date">second major update to Hades 2</a> revealed yesterday, as the game remains in early access, without a full release date.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/among-us">Among Us</a> developer Innersloth has announced Among Us 3D for PC, with a Steam Next Fest demo set to debut next week.
</p>
<p>
This 3D, first-person version of the game isn't brand new, however. Virtual reality headset fans will notice this is very much Among Us VR without the VR.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, Among Us 3D features crossplay with Among Us VR (though not, unsurprisingly, with the original 2D game). Essentially, this new version of the VR version allows a much wider 'flatscreen' PC audience to join in.

</figure>
<p>
Otherwise, this is the Among Us you know and have probably played before, now with an additional dimension. The game caters for between four and 10 players, and of course lets you customise your bean with hats.
</p>
<p>A new Stardust currency will be introduced to let you acquire more cosmetic items for your bean. Post-launch, the game will add new modes, tasks, collaborations, and additional limited time events. As well as more hats.
</p>
<p>
There's no full release date for Among Us 3D yet, and no word of it appearing outside of PC at all. Still, if you're interested, and if you're a Steam user, you should probably keep an eye on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3168600/Among_Us_3D/">Steam page</a> for when its demo arrives as part of Steam Next Fest in just a couple of days.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-hotfix-1-1-2-won%E2%80%99t-crash-when-spamming-keys-at-the-eula.1115217/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/21/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-hotfix-1-1-2-patch-notes-crash-bug-fixes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Warhorse Studios has released a new <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> patch, with hotfix 1.1.2 targeting a clutch of crash bugs so the game won’t keel over when “looking at certain locked doors”, “interacting with a cart” or when “spamming keys on the EULA screen”.</p>
<p>I think spamming keys at the EULA is pretty much universal gamer behaviour, because who’s got time in their finite lives to actually read that legalese gibberish? But once you actually get into the game, looking at doors of all kinds and interacting with carts are both pretty integral to the immersive medieval experience that KCD2 provides.</p>


<p>I’m poking a little bit of fun, of course, and it’s always good to see developers stamping out the odd little bugs and crashes that inevitably remain in games after release. Warhorse has plenty plans for more support with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/21/kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-roadmap-includes-updates-and-future-expansions/">three major questline expansions coming through the rest of 2025</a>.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 launched at the start of February to plenty of praise from critics – see <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/03/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/">our KCD2 review here</a> – and players alike, continuing down the immersive RPG style of the original. The game has already turned a profit <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1771300/view/542223437984170029">on its way to 2 million sales</a>, and the positive word of mouth could see that number keep on climbing, even in an absolutely stacked start to the year with big game releases.</p>
<p>Here’s the KCD2 Hotfix 1.1.2 patch notes:</p>

<p><strong>Fortuna&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Bozhena and Pavlena will no longer report the player for crimes during the quest.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The King’s Gambit&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The quest interactor for wine will no longer disappear, allowing players to continue pouring wine for the guests.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Combat</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the crossbow aiming zoom on ultrawide resolutions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Platform-specific fixes</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>PROS</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved the issue with rewards sometimes requiring game restart to be awarded.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stability</strong></p>
<ul>

<li>Fixed a crash when spamming keys on the EULA screen.</li>
<li>Fixed a crash when having conflicting versions of the Bink library.</li>
<li>A few dozen additional stability fixes and improvements.</li>
</ul>
