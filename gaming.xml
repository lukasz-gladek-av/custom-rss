			<p>Silent Hill 2 Remake has already been confirmed to be a PlayStation 5 exclusive as well as on<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124490/SILENT_HILL_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> PC</a>, but officially, it has been confirmed not to be on 'other formats' until 10.08.2025. The release date for Silent Hill 2 is just around the corner. It will be released on 8 October, just in time for Halloween. Whether this means that it's confirmed that Silent Hill 2 will be available on Xbox in the future remains to be seen in 2025, with the possibility it will also be released on the Nintendo Switch successor, should the console be powerful enough.</p>
<p>At the moment, it hasn't been confirmed whether the game will be given any new sparkly features for the PlayStation 5 Pro or whether it will even be added.</p>
<p>A new trailer for Silent Hill 2 has also been released, giving players another glimpse into the game. For those using a DualSense controller, Haptic Feedback will mimic every impact with a melee weapon, and Adaptive Triggers will offer resistance with the Shotgun.</p>
<p><iframe title="Silent Hill 2 - Immersion Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OWACgbMeg8Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The horror game will also have 3D audio support, which is perfect if you plan on using a headset to immerse yourself in the game. The sound is also available on TV speakers and analog/USB stereo headphones, so it isn't required to have the Pulse 3D Wireless headphones for the PlayStation 5, especially if you're playing the game on PC instead. 4K resolution will also be supported for those that have the relevant display, giving more of a movie-style feel to the game as well as deeper immersion and visual quality.</p>
<p>One of the cooler features is the DualSense Lightbar, which turns red if you need healing and stays green if you are in full health.</p>
<p>There are plenty of features coming to the updated version of Silent Hill 2 to make the game more accessible to those who want to play it. Whether you're a returning player to the franchise or just getting stuck in, there are features that can enhance your time in the game, such as the capability to turn of the UI or activate the 90s filter so that it feels just like the classic game.</p>
<p>Although the remake is shaping up to be rather faithful to the original, there will be s<a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-completionist-route-will-take-more-than-20-hours/">ome extra features</a>, like new exploration and new puzzles to solve. However, the original leads have returned to the remake, so it's bound to be good if Masahiro Ito and Akira Yamaoka are actively involved.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">2021's Battlefield 2142 was a disappointment in the eyes of some longtime Battlefield fans, but the developers at DICE have said they <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-battlefield-is-a-reimagination-of-the-series/1100-6516478/">took the feedback on board</a> to help make the next game better. Recently, the first key details on the next Battlefield game emerged, and for now at least, the developers seem to be saying all the right things to help people believe the next game could be a return to form.</p><p dir="ltr">Only time will tell if the team delivers, of course, but fans are already buzzing with excitement on the news that the new Battlefield will seemingly emulate older titles and do away with some of the things that Battlefield 2042 did. Most importantly, the new Battlefield game will not have 128-player matches or Specialist characters--two highly criticized elements of Battlefield 2042.</p><p dir="ltr">The game is set in the modern day, and that's also a welcome change for fans and a change of pace from the latest games that took place in the future and the past. It also sounds like the new Battlefield game could have a battle-royale element, too. At least four studios are handling development on the new Battlefield game, which doesn't have an official title as of yet.</p><p dir="ltr">Following the first official information being released this week at an EA event, we're rounding up all the key information to know about the next Battlefield game.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>When will the new Battlefield be released?</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">EA has not confirmed a release date for the next Battlefield, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-battlefield-game-will-have-a-free-to-play-battle-royale-report/1100-6521440/">a report said</a> it could launch as soon as October 2025. That timeline appears to be reasonable, as there was a three-year gap between the last two games, Battlefield V (2018) and Battlefield 2042 (2021). The new Battlefield game is already being playtested almost daily, EA said, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/large-scale-playtests-for-new-battlefield-will-start-early-next-year/1100-6526539/">some kind of community test program for the new game will launch in early 2025</a>. If EA is already almost ready to put the new Battlefield game into the hands of the public, it would seemingly be pretty far along.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Preorder the new Battlefield </strong></h2><p dir="ltr">The new Battlefield game is not yet available for preorder. Fans should be highly skeptical about any website or store claiming to take preorders for the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4369905-screenshot2024-09-19at1.15.48pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4369905" data-ratio="0.5622866894198" data-width="1172" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4369905-screenshot2024-09-19at1.15.48pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4369905"></a><figcaption>A scene from Battlefield 3</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4369905-screenshot2024-09-19at1.15.48pm.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>New Battlefield trailer information</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">There is no trailer yet for the next Battlefield game. However, the first concept art was released in mid-September, showing a chaotic scene featuring all manner of large-scale combat in keeping with Battlefield's tradition.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>New Battlefield platforms</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Platforms for the next Battlefield game have not been confirmed, but fans can likely expect the game to release on PC, as well as PlayStation and Xbox consoles. Nintendo is cooking up a new console, presumably the Switch 2, but it's too soon to say if the next Battlefield will show up on this platform. Also unknown is what EA might be planning on the mobile space.</p><p dir="ltr">EA's studio run by Halo veteran Alex Seropian was developing a Battlefield game for mobile, but the company abruptly canceled the game and closed the studio. Exactly what EA's plans for Battlefield on mobile in the future are unknown.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>New Battlefield story, setting, and characters</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Very little is known about the story, setting, and characters for the new Battlefield game. However, it's been confirmed that the game is set in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-battlefield-game-returns-to-modern-setting-and-makes-other-key-changes-fans-asked-for/1100-6526511/">modern day</a>, which is a change of pace for the franchise after Battlefield 2042 (set in the future), Battlefield V (set in WWII), and Battlefield 1 (set in World War I). The modern-day setting elicited a number of positive responses from fans who wanted to see the franchise return to the present.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-new-details-on-the-next-battlefield-game/" rel="nofollow ">Insider Gaming</a> reported that the new Battlefield will take place between 2027 and 2030. The campaign is said to focus on a "massive" private military group fighting against NATO. The report further claimed that the game takes place in a number of locations around the world, including the USA and Gibraltar. The site said the first piece of concept art depicted a scene set in Gibraltar.</p><p dir="ltr">"If you look back to the peak or the pinnacle of Battlefield, it's that Battlefield 3... Battlefield 4 era where everything was modern. And I think we have to get back to the core of what Battlefield is and do that amazingly well, and then we'll see where it goes from there," Vince Zampella told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-first-battlefield-concept-art-revealed-vince-zampella" rel="nofollow ">IGN</a>. "But I think for me, [that] peak of Battlefield-ness is in that Battlefield 3 and 4 days. So I think it's nostalgic for players, for me, for the teams even. Those are kind of the heyday...although I would say 1942 also."</p><figure data-align="left" data-size="small" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4369906-screenshot2024-09-19at1.15.54pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4369906" data-ratio="0.55292125317528" data-width="1181" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4369906-screenshot2024-09-19at1.15.54pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4369906"></a><figcaption>Battlefield 3</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4369906-screenshot2024-09-19at1.15.54pm.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>What will it be called?</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">The new Battlefield game doesn't have a name yet, but Insider Gaming reported that EA's teams are currently "weighing up" options, in part by launching surveys. Some of the options reportedly include "Battlefield 6" or simply "Battlefield."</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Battle royale?</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">EA already runs a popular battle-royale game with Apex Legends from developer Respawn. But a report from Insider Gaming said the new Battlefield game will have its own battle royale mode as well, and that this could be developed by Ripple Effect. There isn't anything else to go on at this stage, however. EA did previously experiment with a battle royale mode called Firestorm in Battlefield V. But that was only playable within Battlefield V. Insider Gaming said the new Battlefield battle royale will be a free-to-play standalone game, and that the setup could be similar to how Activision offers a premium Call of Duty release alongside Call of Duty: Warzone.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Who's developing the new Battlefield</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">DICE, the creator of the Battlefield series, is leading development on the new Battlefield game's multiplayer element. Motive, the team behind Star Wars: Battlefront II and the upcoming Iron Man game, is taking the lead on the game's single-player campaign. Need for Speed and Burnout studio Criterion, meanwhile, is handling "content and experiences." Ripple Effect, meanwhile, is making "a new Battlefield experience" that some believe could be a battle royale.</p><p dir="ltr">When former Call of Duty boss Vince Zampella took over as head of the Battlefield franchise, he talked about creating a "Battlefield universe" of connected experiences. This four-studio approach seems to be part of that ambition. The team was originally one group stronger, as Master Chief creator Marcus Lehto was running a studio called Ridgeline that was contributing to this vision, but the team was closed by EA as part of a wider cost-cutting initiative.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Weapons, destruction, and gameplay</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">The Insider Gaming report said the team at DICE is aiming for 45 different weapons at launch, which is more than double what Battlefield 2042 had at release. The report went on to say the team is aiming to have 10 multiplayer maps available at launch, with presumably more to come after launch.</p><p dir="ltr">The Battlefield series is known for its destruction elements, with players able to bulldoze buildings and shoot out walls for tactical or hilarious purposes. It seems the new Battlefield game will carry this forward (of course), and the Insider Gaming report said the game will have "caliber-based destruction" similar to what Rainbow Six Siege offers. On another front, the report said players will be able to pick up and move downed players, and that this feature would be available in the rumored battle royale experience, too.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of multiplayer gameplay, Zampella suggested that 128-player matches are going away. Battlefield 2042 launched with these massive-scale matches, but players complained that the maps were too big and player populations too low (even with bots inserted into matches), and DICE later scaled things back. It seems DICE is not going to repeat this with the next game.</p><p dir="ltr">"The 128 player, did it make it more fun? Like...doing the number for the sake of the number doesn't make any sense," Zampella told IGN. "We're testing everything around what's the most fun. It's a different play space, and I think you have to design around that. So we are designing something that is more akin to previous Battlefields," Zampella says. "I'd rather have nice, dense, really nice, well-designed play spaces. Some of them are really good. I can't wait for you to see some of them.</p><p dir="ltr">Another highly criticized element of Battlefield 2042 were its Specialist characters, which replaced the traditional class-based system that Battlefield fans know and love. Zampella joined the team after the decision to do this, and while he applauded DICE's ambition to try something new, he admitted, "Not everybody liked it." So for the new game, "Specialists will not be coming back," Zampella said. "So classes are kind of at the core of Battlefield, and we're going back to that."</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Taking on Call of Duty?</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Battlefield and Call of Duty are two of the top game franchises in the shooter space, and Zampella said he believes the new Battlefield game has the "possibility" to outsell Call of Duty. However, Zampella stressed that EA is hoping to make a product that stands apart from Activision's Call of Duty series.</p><p dir="ltr">"I mean, is that what we're going for? I mean, not directly, but always," he said about Battlefield outselling Call of Duty. "We're not looking to take down Call of Duty. We're making something that's different and we're making something that's us. But yeah, it definitely has the possibility."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-rumored-to-have-a-60-fps-mode-on-all-platforms/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows isn't far away, and those who plan to pick up the game will be transported to Feudal Japan as of November 2024. The game will be available on all platforms except for the Nintendo Switch, and it's now rumored to offer a 60 FPS mode on all platforms. However, it is said to have the best display quality on PS5 Pro. This rumor comes from <a href="https://x.com/arabhardware/status/1836713669163393197?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1836733526441349582%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es3_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arabhardware on X</a> and was then translated and 'confirmed' by <a href="https://x.com/_L3vi3?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1836733526441349582%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a news account</a> dedicated to Assassin's Creed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: World Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zKua34QXhMA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This post also continued to claim other details in the game, such as enemies suffering from heatstroke if they stood in the sun for too long, tying into the fact that weather changes will affect the game play. We suspect that the weather system will affect game play like it does in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, for example. According to ArabHardware, if it is raining, enemies will not hear you when you are walking in the rain.</p>
<p>There are also reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gamescom-preview-the-most-visually-advanced-assassins-creed-to-date/">huge improvements</a> being made to the game play physics as they are using AnvilNext and have continued to make upgrades to that engine for this game. While these details are simply rumors for the moment, there will be an Assassin's Creed Shadows preview event later in the month which will hopefully clarify some of the points made.</p>
<p>Additionally, in <a href="https://www.magazinesdirect.com/az-magazines/6937074/play-magazine-single-issue.thtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an interview with Play</a>, Art Director Thierry Dansereau spoke about the size of Assassin's Creed Shadows, saying that it is "bigger than Mirage, but smaller than Valhalla," saying that the game is roughly around the size of Assassin's Creed Origins. Compared to previous games, the focal point of the game will be taking place in Honshu, as "this is where all the events related to Oda Nobunaga are taking place."</p>
<p>The post by ArabHardware also claims that players won't be able to hide as Yasuke, due to his size, and the fact he makes a sound when he moves. However, he does have a bow and arrow that he can utilize to stealth kill enemies.</p>
<p>Of course, take this all with a pinch of salt, as none of this information has been confirmed by Ubisoft. The preview of Assassin's Creed Shadows will likely occur at the end of September, and details will be revealed at Tokyo Game Show 2024. This event takes place between September 26 and September 29, and plenty of games will be showcased at the event.</p>

        <p>Rockstar and Valve reportedly working to "find a fix"</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a> is no longer officially supported by Steam Deck, thanks to the introduction of some anti-cheat software which can, in fact, be made compatible with Steam Deck. Say what now?
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Rockstar added BattlEye Anti-Cheat to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> and GTA Online in an update on Tuesday 17th September, together with options to disable the anti-cheat functionality for Story Mode play on the Rockstar Games Launcher or third-party launchers. In the process, support for Steam Deck play has fallen through like a police helicopter into a traffic jam.</p>
<p>"Steam Deck does not support BattlEye for GTA Online," the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/271590/announcements/detail/6356356787200715685?snr=2___">changelog</a> baldly notes. "You will be able to play GTAV Story Mode but unable to play GTA Online."
</p>
<p>
It's all a bit curious because, as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/18/24248585/gta-v-steam-deck-battleye">The Verge</a> point out, it's been possible to set up BattlEye to run on Steam Deck for years, though the Linux-based OS doesn't support it by default thanks to its Proton Windows compatibility layer. Apparently, it's as straightforward as sending BattlEye's vendors a mail. As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/grand-theft-auto/gta-online-is-no-longer-compatible-with-steam-deck-thanks-to-its-new-anti-cheat-software-despite-battleye-having-an-opt-in-system-for-this-sort-of-thing/">PCGamer</a> add, GTA Online is or was one of the most-played Steam Deck games, so all this is causing a bit of a stink down Los Santos way.
</p>
<p>
In their changelog, Rockstar lay the responsibility for the loss of compatibility at Valve's door. "GTAV and GTA Online are not officially supported on Steam Deck and all technical support questions should be directed to Valve's Steam Deck support content and community," it reads. This, players have been doing. One redditor has allegedly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1fk8hp7/weather_update_gta_v_has_been_updated_to/">heard from a Valve rep</a> that they're "working with Rockstar Games to find a fix".
</p>
<p>I'm a bit mystified, frankly, but there's precedent for big publishers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/8/22923163/fortnite-steam-deck-update-epic-tim-sweeney">being iffy about whether they can run anti-cheat software over the Steam Deck's Linux-based OS</a>. Presumably, you can still fire up GTA Online on the Deck if you dual-boot Windows and skip the Proton layer.</p>
<p>
If there's one thing everybody can agree on, it's that GTA Online has a cheating problem. I'm interested to see how they'll <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-biggest-question-gta-6-has-to-answer-is-what-to-do-about-gta-online">tackle that and GTA Online in general</a> after the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>.

The game’s mix of melee combat and gunplay feels good and is a natural evolution of the OG <em>Space Marine</em> from 2011. However, I had some issues with the game’s veteran difficulty and ran into matchmaking problems shortly after launch. Thankfully, these and many other parts of <em>Space Marine 2 </em>are going to be tweaked and improved. </p><p>On September 18, Saber Interactive posted a lengthy FAQ on <em>Space Marine 2</em>'s official Steam page.

So for some of these tweaks, you’ll likely have to wait a bit.

			<p>We've just <a href="https://www.flightsimulator.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-faq/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR3iIdzGYSeTvVTrZh08UrAl8dVMwTUk4okUif2S0hgESJInOmQIUwsN4Ms_aem_gDv4y5NjcKyl6HQjo90tPw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received</a> the official <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> PC system requirements. The major advantage over 2020's game is that the installation size on your local drive is much smaller, with only 50GB required. However, the 'recommended spec' now asks for 32GB of RAM, while the 'ideal spec' lists 64GB RAM, which is certainly more than most gamers have installed on their PCs.</p>
<p>Another improvement of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 will be found in the highly reduced bandwidth consumption, according to Asobo Studio CEO and Co-Founder Sebastian Wloch, who told <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/19/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Wire</a>:</p>
<p><em>The very important thing is overall bandwidth consumption is way down because you only download what you really see when you see it, and we don’t pre-download at hundreds of gigabytes. Microsoft Flight Simulator (2020) already had over two petabytes of data on the cloud. That was the whole world data. We kept adding to that, but we still had planes, airports, meshes, points of interests like castles, and textures that were all installed. That’s the part that kept growing with the marketplace content, which had grown to 2 TB. Now we integrated everything into the cloud, and it is all streamed and kept into a rolling cache on the hardware. You don’t have to install any new World Updates; they’re just streamed seamlessly.</em></p>

The 2TB “Galaxy Black” special-edition Xbox Series X is mostly the same as the standard Series X, but it features a double-capacity SSD and a slick paint job. We’re inching toward its October 15th release, and interested parties willing to pony up the $599.99 asking price can already preorder one at <a href="https://howl.me/cm69OQot1NK">Best Buy</a> and directly from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/configure/Xbox-Series-X-2TB-Galaxy-Black-Special-Edition/8smbrt7wmfp9">Microsoft</a>.</p><p>Those who crave the pricier Xbox are primarily getting three unique things for their money:  </p><div><ul><li>2TB of built-in storage, which is twice the amount available on the standard $500 Xbox Series X (which can still be expanded with proprietary storage add-ons).</li><li>A fresh paint job, if black is your thing, that’s reminiscent of the star-filled darkness of space. It shares some vibes with Microsoft’s previous limited-edition console, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641632/microsoft-xbox-series-x-halo-console-elite-2-controller"><em>Halo</em>-themed Xbox Series X</a>, and features green accents on its bottom stand.</li><li>A unique controller with matching speckles on the D-pad and a splash of green on the bottom.</li></ul></div><p>Those changes aren’t nearly as drastic as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/11/24241002/playstation-5-ps5-pro-comparison-differences-specs-software-ray-tracing">new hardware on the PS5 Pro</a> (which features a new GPU, among other performance benefits), but I must admit, the new Xbox looks sick.</p><div><p><h3><a data-item-id="yXNNu1" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://howl.me/cm69OQot1NK">Xbox Series X – 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition </a></h3></p><p><span>$<!-- -->600</span></p><p>A special-edition Xbox Series X with a unique starry design and an expanded 2TB of built-in storage. It’s the same as the standard Series X otherwise, with features like 4K resolution and Quick Resume.</p></div><p>Outside of the above features, the Galaxy Black Xbox Series X will play all the same games as other Xbox Series X / S models and match the standard edition with its 4K resolution and 120fps frame rate (though it’s locked at 4K / 60fps or lower in most games). It features a Blu-ray drive, too, unlike the compact Series S and <a href="https://howl.me/cm7xSlqtQXQ">discless Series X</a>, the latter of which launches alongside Microsoft’s limited-edition console in October for $449.99.</p><p>While the previous generation of Xbox One consoles saw the release of the mid-cycle Xbox One X, the upcoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24240801/ps5-pro-details-playstation-event-september-2024">PS5 Pro</a> seems to be the lone spec-bumped premium console this generation. Documents revealed during the <em>FTC v.
