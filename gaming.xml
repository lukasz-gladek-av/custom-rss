            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/17/24200072/no-mans-sky-next-update-worlds-part-1<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The developers of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24166275/no-mans-sky-adrift-update"><em>No Man’s Sky</em></a> have announced their next update, which is dubbed Worlds Part&nbsp;I. According to Hello Games founder <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/3/11152396/no-mans-sky-preview-sean-murray-interview-ps4-pc">Sean Murray</a>, this update will be one of the game’s prettiest yet, literally changing the way players see the universe. “In <em>No Man’s Sky</em>, what you see on screen is generated by the computer,” Murray wrote. “The level of variety we are achieving is far beyond what was possible before.”</p><p>The update is largely graphical, adding a host of new weather and terrain features designed to make planets feel even more real. Water will produce waves and reflections, waves will now respond to different weather phenomena, and the game will finally let ships land directly on the water. Worlds Part I will add new atmospheric conditions as well. Lava flows will belch sparks into the air while fog, blizzards, rain, and clouds make the procedurally generated locations feel more like living planets.</p><p>According to Murray, creating realistic clouds presented a unique challenge to the team. With the Worlds Part I update, new cloud technology — no, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/27/24187164/xbox-cloud-gaming-tv-app-fire-tv-stick-amazon-launch">not that kind</a> — will introduce even more variety to planets. He also shared that the update will have a <em>Starship Troopers</em> vibe featuring a new mech players are going to need to fight off enemies.</p><p>Murray wrote about how new technology and work on Hello Games’ next project, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23990841/hello-games-light-no-fire-trailer"><em>Light No Fire</em></a><em>,</em> has allowed the team to go back and work on <em>No Man’s Sky</em>. “Over the last five years making the game, we’ve learnt new things, and we’re feeding that back into No Man’s Sky,” Murray said. </p><p>The update is available today, but with a name like World’s Part I, you can naturally be sure that a part two won’t be far behind.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nintendo's mysterious horror game - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-just-uploaded-a-bizarre-horror-game-teaser">glimpsed last week via a brief and bizarre teaser trailer</a> - is in fact a new entry in the Famicom Detective Club series. 
</p>
<p>
Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club will launch on 29th August, Nintendo confirmed today, showing off a first look at the game's artwork, featuring its creepy paper bag-headed villain.
</p>
<p>
If you're unfamiliar with the retro adventure series, this is a Nintendo-developed franchise originally released in the late 1980s. Two games were released, but only in Japan. And there they remained for more than 30 years, until a Nintendo Switch remake of the pair launched worldwide in 2021.

<p>
Nintendo veteran designer Yoshio Sakamoto, of Metroid fame, is returning to the series for Emio - The Smiling Man, Nintendo confirmed today. </p>
<p>
In a brief developer interview, Sakamoto said the game's creepy villain will pop up in-game after previously being thought of as an urban legend. It's up to you to investigate a murder and discover the truth behind the paper bag-wearing myth.

			<p>Nintendo has announced Emio The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club - the first new game in the series in 35 years.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq_NGMM2FWE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo uploaded a teaser</a> for what looked like to be some kind of horror title. Some suggested that this teaser was related to a new game from Bloober Team, but as it turned out, this wasn't the case. Fast forward one week and Nintendo has now officially revealed a new entry in the Famicom Detective Club series - Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club. We've included the official announcement trailer below:</p>
<p><iframe title="Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club – A Chat with Producer Yoshio Sakamoto" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AHBtMQaj7w0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><em>A student has been found dead! His head was covered with a paper bag with an eerie smiling face drawn on it—much like the victims of Emio, the Smiling Man—a killer of urban legend who is said to place such a bag over his victims’ heads.</em></p>
<p><em>As an assistant private investigator, you are tasked with helping police solve this crime, which is reminiscent of a series of unsolved murders from 18 years ago. Has a serial killer returned, or is this the work of a copycat? Are these crimes inspired by the Smiling Man story, or the origin of it?</em></p>
<p><em>Discover the answers to these questions and more as a member of the Utsugi Detective Agency in this intense story of suspicion, isolation, and fragility.</em></p>
<p>In the game, players take on the role of an assistant private investigator with Utsugi Detective Agency. Players are tasked with helping police solve a crime. Along the way, scrutinize the clues and testimonies you gather for potential connections to the gruesome events of the past.</p>
<p>Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club launches for the Nintendo Switch next month on August 29. As said, this is the first new entry in the series in 35 years - the most recent game (The Girl Who Stands Behind) was released in 1989.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-announces-august-release-date-for-mysterious-%E2%80%98emio%E2%80%99-game.929541/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-announces-august-release-date-for-mysterious-emio-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/NintendoUK/status/1813560024750321730" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, Nintendo officially announced that Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club has a release date for August 29, 2024.</p>



<p>Today’s announcement included a very brief trailer, which again featured the titular Emio. However, the grainy footage transitions from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-reveals-trailer-for-m-rated-game-teases-creepy-emio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the previous teaser</a> into the art style fans might expect to see in-game.</p>



<p>It also confirms that Emio is part of the Famicom Detective Club IP. This classic Nintendo IP originally released in the late 80’s with two memorable games. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Currently, fans can play Famicom Detective Club: The Two-Case Collection, which released in 2021. The collection includes both The Girl Who Stands Behind and The Missing Heir. Both titles currently have strong user ratings on Metacritic, respectively 8.1 and 7.9.</p>



<p>Emio was just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/emio-has-been-rated-in-australia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rated in Australia</a> last week, signaling that the release date was coming soon. The existing trailer gained an enormous amount of interest from Nintendo fans due to its horror atmosphere and M Rating by the ESRB.</p>



<p>The Nintendo brand is often family-friendly, but its connection to Famicom Detective Club reveals the tone players should expect.</p>



<p>Nintendo recently held <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-june-2024-everything-announced/">a massive direct</a> showcase that lasted about 40 minutes. It revealed many games coming in 2024, though Emio was not among them. Some highlights included Mario &amp; Luigi Brothership, Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection, and The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/tmnt-splintered-fate-review-nintendo-switch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Let’s get the obvious out of the way: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate is an awful lot like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/17/hades-review-switch-pc/">Hades</a>. Instead of venturing through the Greek underworld as a demigod, you’re fighting through New York City as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. TMNT: Splintered Fate is a roguelike action RPG where each run is a little bit different, partly thanks to having four playable characters instead of one.</p>
<p><iframe title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate - Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fIaR93sOHRQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>TMNT: Splintered Fate’s story begins with Leonardo training, only to be ambushed the Foot Clan and Shredder, who breaks the news that Splinter has been kidnapped. This starts a chain of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles facing off against the Foot Clan, as well as some other groups that have it out for the Turtles.</p>


<p>As a roguelike, progress is made through repetition. At the start of a run you can choose which of the four turtles you want to play as, with each having their own unique specials and skills. Michelango has the largest attack area size and has the most chance to deal multi-damage. His tool is taunting, which damages enemies and briefly stuns them when they are hit. Leonardo has a master strike that hits at the end of a combo, and his base tool is throwing three shuriken. Raphael has increased chances to deal critical hits, and his tools are a turtle line that pulls enemies towards him while dealing damage. Finally, Donatello has a shield blast that deals damage and briefly makes him immune to damage. His tools also charge 80% faster than the others, and at the start of each level he regains some health.</p>
<p>While all of them have these unique abilities and own weapons, the basic combat remains the same for all. That is getting in close and dealing damage to multi enemies in various ways. Even so, my personal preference was Donatello purely because of the health advantage, and being able to use tools faster than others.</p>


<p>Of course, picking your Turtle of choice is just the first step. Every run is different due to the random nature of the bonuses you can acquire. You may get bonuses that deal flame or water damage, and others that allow you to move faster. Some of the elements, which are flame, water, electricity, ooze, astral light, and astral dark, can be combined together to improve the damage you deal. However, there are also times when one selection can replace another bonus. This could be a good or bad thing. For example, I had an unstable ooze container tool that dealt decent area damage, and accidentally replaced it with a shuriken storm, which dealt less overall damage. If you get lucky, you will have higher powered versions of these abilities appear at the end of each level, which can lead to attacks becoming more powerful.</p>
<p>Like any roguelike, you lose all of your acquired abilities at the end of a run, but can unlock permanent upgrades through the Dragon and Dreamer bonuses. These unlock after a few levels, once you hit that skill brick wall where you cannot advance without permanent buffs. Dragon bonuses focus on direct effects, like increasing attack power, health, and improved rates for critical attacks. Dreamer bonuses impact the intangible aspects of the game, increasing chances of various drops and items appearing during a run. To unlock these you have to collect Dragon and Dreamer coins, which can then be spent back at base.</p>
<p>On top of these, there are artifacts which are unlocked for completing specific events and tasks in a run, like beating specific bosses. You can change which artifact you want to equip between attempts. Some artifacts increase the likelihood of specific element ability options appearing for you to select while others increase odds of dodging an attack.</p>

<p>There are four stages within TMNT: Splintered Fate, with these being The Sewers, The Docks, The Streets, and The Rooftops. These areas follow the same pattern with rooms of enemies to power through, with a miniboss battle taking place halfway through, and a boss battle at the end of the stage. What TMNT: Splintered Fate does well is mix up the mid boss and boss level fights. The mid bosses switch between each run, and a couple of the bosses grow stronger following the end of a successful run. Completing your first successful run is satisfying but it also really marks the true start of the game.</p>
<p>At the end of this run optional Dreamer and Gauntlet challenges are added to the game. Dreamer portals grant boons but can require some sacrifice to obtain those bonuses. Gauntlet challenges are the true tests of TMNT: Splintered Fate. These challenges are available for midboss and end boss fights for every stage, making bosses stronger and introducing additional strong enemies. For example, in one boss fight, the boss gains more powerful elemental abilities while also being accompanied by elite enemies that are essentially mini bosses themselves.</p>
<p>One of the issues with TMNT: Splintered Fate is that while it is entertaining, it starts to feel repetitive and the story is really not that gripping. The voice actors do a very good job, but the story feels elongated to pad the game out. After my fourth successful run, April exclaimed we were likely halfway through the process to rescue Splinter. It is supposed to come across as encouraging, but instead I asked out loud if the game was serious. There is only so many times you can go through the same four stages and bosses, even if they have tweaks each time, before wanting to stop.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Entertainment System is a true industry icon, but has a somewhat more diminished role in the memories of many British gamers. Unlike in the US and Japan where it reigned supreme, the NES was less ubiquitous over here, and I personally found myself more immersed in the Amiga and Atari wars, before Mario-mania took over with the Super Nintendo. I did have a mate with a NES and so had some time with the little grey box, but not enough for it to be deeply embedded in my childhood memories. However, Nintendo’s focus on legacy franchises and rereleasing its most famous titles has resulted in a kind of second hand nostalgia.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition — Overview Trailer — Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wW3rNlfRgyM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Inspired by the occasional real world championships, Nintendo World Championship: NES Edition brings a competitive tilt to retro NES gaming on the Switch as you are challenged to take on bite-sized sections of the console’s most famous titles and complete them in the fastest possible time. With a sizeable line-up of games and dozens of individual missions across each, this is a veritable playable museum of Nintendo’s first console.</p>


<p>Booting up Nintendo World Championship: NES Edition brings you to a menu offering solo and local multiplayer modes. The former contains three main game modes – Speedrun, World Championships, and Survival. The latter two here require a Nintendo Switch Online membership, and with servers only opening at the start of the week, the bulk of my time with the game has therefore been spent on the Speedrun mode. There are 169 micro challenges here to challenge and master, serving as training for the online sections as well as being compulsive in their own right. These challenges are spread across 13 games but not equally as some have over 20, whilst poor Ice Climbers and Excite Bike only have 6 each.</p>
<p>The lineup includes most of the system’s iconic titles, but the lack of games by Capcom and Konami is a missed opportunity. Instead we have Nintendo’s first party range fully represented with four Marios, both Zeldas, Metroid, Kirby, Kid Icarus, Donkey Kong, Balloon Fight and the aforementioned Ice Climbers and Excite Bike. Throughout each set of challenges, you’ll be taking on timed boss fights, tricky platforming sections or even micro tasks befitting a WarioWare game, like collecting the first mushroom in Super Mario Bros in the quickest time possible. The thrill and addictiveness comes from refining your technique to shave off milliseconds each time and aim for the coveted S ranking.</p>


<p>After unlocking all of an individual game’s challenges, your final obstacle will be a more lengthy and involved Legend level. These vary depending on each game but include completing the whole first Mario game using the level skips and completing the first dungeon of Zelda. For anyone outside the <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/">Games Done Quick</a> crew, the Legend challenges include a useful Classified Information page that looks like a guide straight out of an Official Nintendo Magazine. To further encourage replayability (if beating your own time was not enough) every task is ranked and an in-game pin is awarded if you get an A rank or higher. As I write this review I’ve successfully finished all the main challenges and am working on the Legend ones.</p>
<p>One aspect of the game I found a little unnecessary was the coin system. Finishing a challenge opens up the opportunity to purchase the next one for 100 coins (300 for the Legend ones), but while coins are plentiful to begin with there aren’t enough to unlock everything, even if you succeed each time, meaning some grinding is needed. With a handful of levels taking less than two seconds to complete, this grinding isn’t hugely time consuming but it takes away from the feeling of progress.</p>

<p>Online modes are where you’ll be testing your skills against players around the world. First up in Survival you’ll be taking on ghost data uploaded by other players in a series of three challenges randomly picked from the full range. The first round sees eight players whittled down to four and then a final head-to-head for victory. These are fun and there are silver and gold divisions to offer varying levels challenge. If nothing else, seeing how the very best scores are obtained is useful training for your own skills even in defeat. That being said, the default view has eight individual screens showing all your competitors and that is very difficult to focus on when playing on handheld.</p>
<p>World Championship mode contains 5 missions and you can continuously repeat these with only your best time being recorded. New Championships take place every week but there is no indication of how well you are doing until the results come in. This means that there is a nagging compulsion to go back and try and get the time down a little bit more, but doesn’t have the same effect as a traditional high score table.</p>
<p>The other nagging feeling, though, is that it’s a bit rich to demand a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to play these modes. There’s no direct online head-to-head competition, so you’re always just playing against ghost data in glorified leaderboards. Locking fairly minimal online features behind a subscription is pretty cheeky.</p>

<p>Finally there is a local multiplayer mode that allows for up to eight players to take on levels competitively. Obviously I’d recommend only doing this hooked up to a TV as visibility becomes an issue with more than two players. This mode really brings back the glory days of playing with/against my brother and triggered waves of nostalgia, even if the actual games were different from my own experience. My kids enjoyed the micro challenges and I’m hopeful that this will be a gateway into them trying some of the full original games too.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1527950/view/4365760492630422412" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on Steam</a>, Shiro looks ahead to major&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>content drops for August and October, with more to come in the fourth quarter of 2024 as well. Suffice it to say you're eating well if you're a&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>fan.</p>
<p>First up, if you felt like&nbsp;<em>Wartales</em>' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wartales-dlc-the-tavern-opens-release-date">recent tavern DLC</a> was too combat-light for your tastes, you'll be pleased to know a more battle-focused DLC pack is coming in August.&nbsp;<em>The Pits&nbsp;</em>promises 25 uniquely-designed battles across five distinct locations, and you'll need your wits about you to prevail.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wartales-roadmap-new-combat.jpg?itok=AE-EDLl0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wartales-roadmap-new-combat.jpg?itok=Ps_C0WhL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Wartales</em>' new&nbsp;<em>The Pits&nbsp;</em>DLC will offer plenty of new combat challenges.</figcaption></figure><p>Following that, a fourth community update will arrive in October, bringing lots of new additions to the game. Unlike&nbsp;<em>The Pits</em>, the update will be free for all players.</p>
<p>Community Update 4 will offer the chance to engage in drop-in, drop-out co-op with your friends, so you can join an in-progress&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>game whenever you feel like it and leave when things are getting too hairy for you.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can look forward to a new champion and several new places of interest to explore, as well as some balance changes to smooth out your&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>experience.</p>
<p>Beyond that, another DLC is apparently planned for the fourth quarter of 2024, although Shiro is remaining quiet as to what you can expect from that DLC. We'll likely learn more in the coming months.</p>

<p>As such, you can expect a gritty story filled with gray morality, as well as tough turn-based combat that will challenge your strategic planning and forward thinking skills.</p>

            <p>
England superstar Jude Bellingham makes the box art of EA Sports FC this year. 
</p>
<p>
Fresh from unpacking his bags after England's attempt at glory in the Euros, Bellingham was announced today as having taken the coveted cover slot. 
</p>
<p>
It's not a huge surprise. Bellingham also features on the EA Sports FC 25 Ultimate Edition cover, alongside football/product placement legend David Beckham and Spanish star Aitana Bonmatí. Zinedine Zidane and Gianluigi Buffon also appear.

"I played this game with my brother all the time growing up," Bellingham said of the series once called FIFA. "I've always thought about how incredible it would be to one day be featured on the cover. 
</p>
<p>
"There have been so many iconic players on the cover over the years, and I am delighted to be the most recent English player to be bestowed with this honour since 2011."
</p>
<p>
2011 featured Wayne Rooney, if you recall.

            <p>
If you've been hoping for another No Mans's Sky universe refresh, today's your day. The exploratory space sim's latest update is all about bringing more variety to planets - and it's chucking in angry Starship Troopers-esque bug hunts and a flamethrower mech too.
</p>
<p>
No Man's Sky's new Worlds Part 1 update owes at least some of its existence to the developer Hello Games' upcoming fantasy planet sim Light No Fire. "Over the last five years making the game, " it explains, "we've learnt new things, and we're feeding that back into No Man's Sky".
</p>
<p>
Some of No Man's Sky's freshly expanded variety comes from the way its new simulated systems combine. There's new cloud tech that creates skies based on weather conditions, with planets now featuring their own wind patterns. Water has also had a significant overhaul, featuring dynamic waves that react to weather, reflections, and improved oceans.
</p>

<p>
Addtionally, planets have recieved new volumetrics and atmospherics, meaning explorers can expect to see the likes of rolling fog, more dramatic storms, blizzards, and lava sparks on their travels - and all these elements should interact, meaning clouds grow closer during storms while waves rise higher. And beyond the improved atmospherics, World Part 1 introduces new biomes with accompanying flora and fauna (including burnt, noxious, irradiated, and idyllic garden landscapes) for increased variety.
</p>
<p>
Other new features (and there's a <em>lot</em>) include aquatic landing jets so ships can land on water, flamethrower arm attachments for the new Liquidator mech, and new Vile Brood hunt missions. No Man's Sky's latest update also heralds the start of a new limited-time, combat-focused Expedition, this one sending player out among the stars to explore some of the planets now possible with No Man's Sky's improved tech. And while they're there, they'll need to work alongside the community to blast massive angry bugs, Starship Troopers style - earning Expedition rewards along the way.
</p>
<p>
No Man's Sky's Worlds Part 1 update arrives today on all platforms, and Hello Games hints more planetary improvements will follow - as the conspicuous "Part 1" in the title suggests. Lengthy patch notes for today's update are <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/worlds-part-I-update">available on the No Man's Sky website</a>, and there's even a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmU3_6BK-Ro">behind-the-scenes video</a> for today's update, giving some insight into its creation.
</p>
<p>
As for the studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-studio-unveils-procedural-fantasy-planet-adventure-light-no-fire">procedural planet adventure Light No Fire</a>, we've not had an update on that since last year's reveal, but hopefully it won't be long before Hello Games shares more.

            <p>
Robot Entertainment has announced Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap, the next in the popular orc-slaying series.
</p>
<p>
Deathtrap brings four-player co-op, as well as a rogue-lite progression system and new heroes with unique abilities. Players will need to beat waves of enemies while coping with randomised buffs and debuffs, choosing from six War Mages.
</p>
<p>
It's set for release in early 2025 across PC (Steam, Epic) and Xbox Series X/S.

<p>

The Orcs Must Die! series has proven popular since the first game in 2011. The latest third game was released in 2021, continuing the tower defence gameplay either solo or two-player co-op.
</p>
<p>
Deathtrap will support up to four players with adaptive difficulty, and the unique play styles of each War Mage will promote synergy and experimentation.
</p>
<p>
"Our goal has always been to push the boundaries of fun and creativity," said Patrick Hudson, co-founder and CEO of Robot Entertainment. "With Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap, we embraced the challenge of innovating within a thirteen-year-old franchise by listening closely to our fans and their requests. We've stayed true to the classic chaotic action and light-hearted tone, while introducing four-player co-op, new and versatile heroes with deeply unique abilities, expanded level variety, and new roguelite progression choices. This game is all about delivering the most exhilarating orc-slaying experience yet."

What's more, if you're yet to play any of the Orcs Must Die! games, the whole series has been heavily discounted on Steam until 31st July to celebrate the announcement of Deathtrap.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/orcs-must-die-review">Eurogamer reviewed the first Orcs Must Die!</a> back in 2011, awarding it 7/10: "Rewarding and frustrating in equal measure, but rarely boring, it's a memorable dose of mass slaughter."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-worlds-update-part-i-refreshes-the-universes-flora-fauna-weather-and-gameplay/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Hello Games returns once again with a major No Man's Sky update called Worlds, which is only Part I of a larger overhaul. It's so big that the UK studio also created a deep dive video this time around.</p>
<p>Founder and game director Sean Murray explained that this update adds a lot of new technology to No Man's Sky, some of which has been borrowed by the advancements made while developing <a href="https://wccftech.com/light-no-fire-is-a-planet-sized-fantasy-online-multiplayer-sandbox-rpg-from-no-mans-sky-developer-hello-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Light No Fire </a>over the past five years.</p>
<p>For example, the new water tech can create waves and reflections, giving life to oceans that look so different from what you've seen before in the game. Ocean planets feel completely new, and ships can now land on water. Planets have wind patterns. Waves are dynamic and react to the weather. A brand new cloud technology also creates detailed skies with weather conditions, providing beautifully detailed skies with tons of variety.</p>
<p>Hello Games also added new volumetrics and atmospheres to the planets' surface: rolling fog, rain, blizzards, and lava sparks now combine with wind and clouds. According to the developers, this changes the feel of exploring planets in No Man's Sky and adds much more life to the experience. Sometimes, there is a storm, and you might see the waves rising and the clouds gathering. The new wind, the clouds, the oceans, and the atmosphere all come together for a visual spectacle.</p>

<p>The Worlds Update Part I also introduces new creatures to discover in these new biomes, all of which can be pets or mounts. Moreover, Hello Games is trying to add more activities. The new Expedition is reportedly very Starship Troopers-inspired and takes players on a tour of some of these cool new planets. The No Man's Sky community will fight bugs together, and progress is community-driven. There's a new mech with heavy armor and a cool flamethrower arm, and you will need it.</p>

<p>Finally, Murray expressed the desire to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible in No Man's Sky, doing things that people haven't seen before. As hinted by the fact that the update is called Worlds Part I, more improvements to the overall variety and realism of the universe are coming in a future patch.</p>

<p>In a recent <a href="https://x.com/devolverdigital/status/1813380843747914040" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, Anger Foot publisher Devolver Digital revealed plans for a new game announcement tomorrow, July 18, 2024.</p>



<p>The team did not offer further details about the potential announcement, nor a concrete time. However, it will be revealed “Thursday night,” so it should come up around Devolver Digital’s evening time zone.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>[new game announcement siren starts]</p><p>New game announcement on Thursday night.</p><p>[new game announcement siren ends]</p></div>— Devolver Digital (@devolverdigital) <a href="https://twitter.com/devolverdigital/status/1813380843747914040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 17, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Fans are quickly speculating on the possible IP involved. As publisher, Devolver Digital only just released <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/anger-foot-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anger Foot on PC</a> last week to ‘Very Positive’ Steam reviews. </p>



<p>Following solid word of mouth, some players are already requesting a sequel. Insider Gaming called Anger Foot “hilarious,” and “one of the zaniest FPS titles ever made.” </p>



<p>Many will also recognize Devolver Digital for publishing titles like Cult of the Lamb, Stick It to the Stickman, The Talos Principle 2, and more. </p>



<p>It also worked on the Serious Sam IP for years, so it would also make sense to continue that series in some way. Most recently, Devolver published Serious Sam: Tormental in 2022. The roguelite top-down title in the series currently has ‘Mostly Positive’ reviews on Steam.</p>



<p>Devolver often includes striking humor in its marketing and games. Most recently, it held a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/devolver-direct-2024-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Devolver Direct 2024 showcase</a> in June. </p>



<p>During the event, Devolver Digital made a few big announcements for Cult of the Lamb, Tenjutsu, Possessor(s), and more.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/valve-publish-new-cs2-tournament-rules/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve-publishes-new-cs2-tournament-rules.929487/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/valve-publish-new-cs2-tournament-rules/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Building on a new ruleset released before the launch of Counter-Strike 2 last year, Valve has just published an update to the CS2 tournament ruling. The latest batch of rules concerns tournament licensing and organisation regulations for tournament operators working with Counter-Strike 2 <strong>after </strong>2025. Valve recognised the substantial overhaul as potentially disruptive, with the company writing in a blog post, <em>‘… we expect that there will be some rough edges as we transition to the new requirements.’</em></p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-new-cs2-rules">What Are The New CS2 Rules?</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://www.counter-strike.net/newsentry/7090437900079084674" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new rules</a> pertain to the CS2 ‘Open Circuit’, and at the top of the table sits the core requirement that all events are split into two types: Ranked and Unranked. Both of these will require operators to seek differing licenses. To put a definition on those terms, Unranked events <strong>will not </strong>contribute towards the centralised team standings operated by Valve. They also have prize pool restrictions – $100,000 per event or $250,000 per year.</p>



<p>Ranked events must rely on Valve’s standings and a qualification structure – they’re prohibited from directly inviting teams to compete. There’s also a new ‘Tier’ system that determines which teams can compete in a tournament based on their position in the overall standings. </p>



<p>Any operators looking to hold Tier 1 events in 2026<strong> must </strong>announce said tournaments before January 2025. <a href="https://escorenews.com/en/csgo/news/59416-blast-2025-schedule-features-new-formats-shows-how-valve-s-open-circuit-might-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BLAST’s latest roadmap</a> is one of the few working examples we have of this new operating model being put into practice.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, some players have voiced concerns about the new competitive update. We’ve seen complaints surfacing online talking about how the same teams will get their invite to the top-tier tournaments every time, making it impossible for new or low-level teams to rise.</p>

                <p>Tim Sweeney, the founder and CEO of Fortnite studio Epic Games, has weighed in with his thoughts on AI and generative AI. Advancements to these technologies have been much-discussed of late in the world of video games, entertainment, and numerous other business sectors. Speaking to researcher <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/sweeneystephenson" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Matthew Ball</a>, Sweeney said AI will change the world and create a lot of jobs, while also noting there are numerous issues and problems in the road ahead as well.</p><p>Starting off, Sweeney commented on how companies train their AI models. Sweeney said companies should not train their models on data if they do not have "clear and explicit permission from the creator of the data to do that." Researchers at universities who are not creating commercial products, however, could consider training data this way, Sweeney said.</p>

<p>"If a company buys ownership of the data from the creator of the data or gets permission to use it for training AI, it's fair game. And they shouldn't train AI on that data if they don't have that permission," he said.</p><p>Research institutions can be treated differently, Sweeney said, because there is "much more compelling public interest" in this area.</p><p>Part of what's giving AI a bad name for some people in the current market is how AI has been "taken over by the Wild West," Sweeney said, with companies doing whatever they want to train their models.</p><p>"I think that's unfortunate because AI is a really important technology that is going to change the world. I think that after this first generation of rather wild practices fades away, we're going to see companies with a lot much more responsible data usage practices coming to the forefront and use of AI in a way that's much more well-thought-out and specialized to particular usage cases," he said. "I still think that the idea of creating a chatbot that's supposed to have all the world's knowledge and be an agent of good is a very long way from coming to fruition. And the folly of all the current efforts, both being lamed down to the point where they aren't as useful as they ought to be, but also doing things that are egregiously wrong, like <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd11gzejgz4o" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">telling you to eat rocks</a>. It's kind of an artifact of this technology being adopted way too widely, way too quickly."</p><p>Sweeney went on to say he wished AI researchers didn't immediately turn to commercializing their models, and instead launched programs like ChatGPT as a work-in-progress tool where everyone knows and understands it's going to have all manner of issues.</p><blockquote data-size="small" data-align="left"><p>"We shouldn't let that early misadventure with AI dissuade us from the long-term value of the technology" - Tim Sweeney on AI</p></blockquote><p>"If ChatGPT were, like, some university's chatbot, with this massive disclaimer of this chatbot might make stuff up and say ridiculous things at times and it's just no big deal, don't treat it too seriously. But unfortunately, everybody in their race to have their first-mover advantage has gone away from the standards that govern most forms of technology development, and that's leading to regulatory backlash and all sorts of other problems, and that's very unfortunate," he said. "But I think as optimists for the future of technology, we shouldn't let that early misadventure with AI dissuade us from the long-term value of the technology. And so I'd encourage the same sort of patience I encourage with blockchain and cryptographic technology in the field of AI."</p><p>As for generative AI and its impact on game development, Sweeney said it will lead to "dramatic productivity gains" because creators will be able to create all manner of objects much more quickly than before.</p><p>"If you want a bunch of cool trees, you can go into the Quixel library and get a tree off the shelf from us for free for Unreal Engine use. But if you want a specific tree that meets a specific need for a specific scene in your game, you can have a modeler build it right now, and that takes an enormous amount of time and expense. In the future you're going to be able to create a mashup by giving some high-level instructions as to exactly what kind of tree you create," he said. "And based on training data that was properly owned or licensed, it will make the tree you want. I see dramatic productivity gains coming to a lot of areas of game development."</p><p>Sweeney also predicted that generative AI will increase "employment opportunities" across the technology sector. Games made using generative AI could be far more rich and robust, and this will require more people, he said. "We're going to take all the people we have and perhaps some more and build even bigger, better games using the technology," he said. "And so the technology is going to enable us to improve the scope and quality of our products and build bigger and better games. And so that will certainly come and it will come at different rates. You have to remember, the reason that we had a massive revolution in generative AI and text AI beginning last year was because of the 30 years of research that had gone into the foundations of how to train and manage those sorts of AIs."</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-ai-will-help-its-teams-get-to-holy-grail-of-game-development/1100-6523265/" data-ref-id="1100-6523265">fear of job displacement due to AI is a significant one</a> among video game workers, and companies like EA have been up front in saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/" data-ref-id="1100-6513969">advancements to AI systems will lead to job losses</a> in the short term. In the long run, more jobs could be created thanks to AI, EA and others have said.</p><p>The video game industry is a long way off from implementing generative AI to its fullest extent, however, Sweeney said. "This AI isn't going to come to all fields with equal speed. 3D object generation AI isn't going to be revolutionized next year. It's probably going to take many years because a lot of the things that were done for 2D have not yet been done for 3D, nor does anybody know how to do them," he said. "And so there's a huge amount of research and development effort needed to unblock AI contributing to specific fields in specific new ways and creating game content at the level of quality that you expect."</p><p>Sweeney said he can't predict just how much of a positive impact on video game revenue generative AI might have, but he said it's "definitely going to bring us the capability of building better, bigger, and more compelling games faster."</p><p>He added: "Better games means players will be spending more. Better games means that companies get more returns by investing more in building games. And so you'll probably see increases in employment and you'll probably see a lifting of all ships and also an upending of a lot of things."</p><p>Finally, Sweeney reflected that in the early days of Epic, its artists drew pixels. Now, Epic's artists create 3D objects. And in the future, Sweeney said the things its employees do with mouse clicks will be different still. "I think the value of creators will not be undermined by AI in the long run because all of these companies are competing with each other. We need a lot of humans to make a lot of awesome creative decisions about how these games are to work," he said.</p><p>Epic is not the only big believer in AI in the tech space. Microsoft partnered up with ChatGPT and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-invests-billions-more-into-ai-which-it-believes-could-be-as-big-as-the-internet/1100-6510758/" data-ref-id="1100-6510758">reportedly invested $10 billion into the AI company</a>. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer believes AI will be a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-says-ai-will-be-an-additive-positive-force-for-video-games/1100-6511913/" data-ref-id="1100-6511913">positive, additive force in gaming</a>. Strauss Zelnick, the head of GTA parent company Take-Two, believes in AI as well, but he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-true-gta-competitor-wont-be-made-with-ai-take-two-boss-says/1100-6511244/" data-ref-id="1100-6511244">doesn't think a rival developer could use it to make a genuine GTA competitor anytime soon.</a> PUBG creator Brendan Greene's new game, meanwhile, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-creator-using-machine-learning-to-create-massive-open-worlds-tech-demo-coming/1100-6495912/" data-ref-id="1100-6495912">using advanced machine-learning to create massive and realistic open worlds</a>. Nintendo, too, has said it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-sees-potential-in-generative-ai-but-wont-make-games-created-by-technology-alone/1100-6524707/" data-ref-id="1100-6524707">sees the potential in using generative AI for game development.</a></p>

<p>As a private and generally secretive company, Valve doesn't offer much outside visibility into its inner workings. So when years' worth of data on the company's employee and aggregate payroll numbers leaked recently, we were eager to take a deep dive to see what those numbers could tell us about the operation and evolution of a company that <a href="https://www.enterpriseappstoday.com/stats/steam-statistics.html">has a hand in the majority of PC gaming transactions</a>.</p>
<p>The recent data comes from a poorly redacted document in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/05/judge-brings-dismissed-steam-antitrust-lawsuit-back-from-the-dead/">Wolfire's antitrust lawsuit against Steam</a>, as <a href="https://twitter.com/thexpaw/status/1811727326138310962">first noticed over the weekend by SteamDB's Pavel Djundik</a>. While the key data in the document has now been properly hidden in the court docket, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/13/24197477/valve-employs-few-hundred-people-payroll-redacted">The Verge captured the raw numbers</a> from a table labeled "Employee Headcount and Gross Pay Data, 2003-2021."
</p><p>Breaking down that data by year and department with some simple graphs and statistics, seen below, gives us outsiders a rare partial glimpse into Valve's organization. All told, it's a bit hard to believe that this lynchpin of the PC gaming world has rested on the work of just a few hundred people for many years now.</p>

<p>It's striking to consider just how small Valve is compared to other major players in the game industry. In 2021, Microsoft <a href="https://x.com/piershr/status/1704084070169280658">estimated Valve's annual revenue at $6.5 billion</a>, roughly on the same scale as <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/electronic-arts-ea-earnings-madden-nfl-1235994653/">EA's $7.5 billion in 2024 revenue</a>. But Steam achieved those numbers with around 350 employees, compared to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-cutting-5-of-workforce">well over 13,000 people employed by EA</a>.</p>
<p>The disparity highlights just how much money Valve brings in with a relatively small workforce. And a lot of that is thanks to the chunk of revenue Valve takes from every sale on Steam. The dominant PC gaming marketplace has seen <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/04/ars-analysis-80-of-steam-games-earn-under-5k-in-first-two-weeks/">a massive increase in the number of annual game releases</a> since 2012 or so, thanks to initiatives like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/09/a-100-lottery-ticket-indies-discuss-steam-greenlights-new-fee/">Steam Greenlight</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/02/valve-says-goodbye-to-steam-greenlight-hello-to-direct-publishing/">Steam Direct</a>.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>Yet, surprisingly, the size of the "Steam" department inside Valve has shrunk in recent years, from a peak of 142 employees in 2015 down to just 79 in 2021. From the outside, having just 79 employees keeping track of <a href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases">more than 11,000 Steam releases in 2021</a> is a pretty incredible ratio.</p>
<p>Some readers may also be surprised that Valve's "Games" department has represented a majority of the company's headcount since 2003. That has remained true (though to a lesser extent) even in more recent years, as Valve's output of new games <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Valve_games">has become much more occasional</a>. It seems likely a large number of those Games department employees are devoted to ultra-popular Valve games like <em>Dota 2</em> and <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, which enjoy tens of millions of players and need significant support work.</p>

<p>The leaked data also shows the slow rise of Valve's small Hardware department, which started with just three employees in 2011 as the company <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/03/rumor-valve-potentially-working-on-a-steam-box-console-with-partners/">began work</a> on its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/its-time-to-declare-valves-steam-machines-doa/">doomed Steam Machines initiative</a>. Transitioning into <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/05/one-week-with-the-valve-index-a-vr-game-changer-with-a-few-question-marks/">the Valve Index era</a> in the late 2010s, the hardware department still represented just a few dozen people and a paltry 3 to 4 percent of the company's annual payroll.
</p><p>By the time we hit 2021 and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/steam-deck-the-comprehensive-ars-technica-review/">the run-up to the Steam Deck</a>, the Hardware division still makes up just 12 percent of Valve's small total headcount. Looking back, it's impressive that such a small team was able to create a portable gaming device that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/i-for-one-welcome-our-new-steam-deck-killing-windows-running-overlords/">quickly spawned</a> a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/new-steam-deck-competitor-lets-you-easily-swap-in-more-ram-storage/">whole micro-industry</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/why-more-pc-gaming-handhelds-should-ditch-windows-for-steamos/">imitators</a>. We can only hope the Hardware team got a little more employee support in the wake of the Steam Deck's market success.</p>
<p>"We are relatively recently a hardware company," Valve's Greg Coomer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-deck-interview-valves-designers-on-all-things-hardware-software-and-knowing-when-to-stop">told Rock Paper Shotgun in 2021</a>. "And our DNA is really in software where upgrading stuff, it takes as long as writing some code and shipping it on the internet. So the people who work here, you know, we've hired a ton of experts in the hardware field who have all been slowly teaching us, 'You can't really operate the same way in hardware and just upgrade things whenever you feel like it.'"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24199846/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-review-switch-speedrunning<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are few things I know better than <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em>. Over the last few decades, I’ve replayed the game across basically every Nintendo platform, exploring its levels over and over, searching out each and every secret. But there’s one thing I never paid attention to: the timer. I’ve always taken a slow, methodical approach to the game, ignoring the tiny countdown clock. That changed with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151970/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-switch-release-date"><em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</em></a>, a collection of NES classics that have been chopped into pieces in the interest of pure speed. It showed me a new side to games I thought I knew intimately.</p><p>Named after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_World_Championships">Nintendo’s occasional in-person esports competition</a>, the collection takes 13 of the company’s most iconic titles and divides them into more than 150 different challenges. Instead of playing through a game in its entirety, though, you’re experiencing brief moments, with the aim of completing them as quickly as possible. It’s speedrunning for beginners. And it turns familiar games into something faster and more compulsive.</p><p>It starts simple. The initial challenge I played in the solo mode involved getting the mushroom in the first level of the original <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. After that, I was swallowing an enemy as Kirby, running to the first ladder in <em>Donkey Kong</em>, and collecting the morph ball in <em>Metroid</em>. The earliest pieces are like a tutorial for the basics of how to play each game. Most only last a few seconds. You can even watch a short playthrough video before jumping in, so you know exactly what the goal is.</p><p>Completing a level gets you a score based on your speed as well as some in-game currency you can use to unlock more challenges. It’s a pretty steady progression: you start out doing the very basics, before moving on to completing whole levels or defeating bosses. Eventually, things get <em>really</em> hard. And the structure is pretty open, so you can tackle games in the given order or jump around as you see fit. I found myself initially sticking to old favorites like <em>Metroid</em> and <em>Mario </em>before braving the clunkier titles like <em>Balloon Fight</em> or <em>Ice Climber</em>.</p><p>But even when doing challenges for a game I’ve already played many times before, I’ve found myself playing them differently, which is sort of obvious since the goal here is entirely speed, but I was surprised by how quickly I became really competitive — even with myself. When playing solo, the screen is divided into two: on the left is your current playthrough, and on the right, a recording of your current fastest time. I’m typically not much of a perfectionist, but I’ve been playing challenges repeatedly just to shave a few tenths of a second off my time and get the coveted S rating. Part of this is because everything is so immediate; it only takes a second to restart a challenge and go again.</p><p>For games like <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em>, this has forced me to abandon old habits. There’s no point wasting time collecting unnecessary power-ups or defeating enemies. Instead, I have to find the cleanest line through a level, which usually means avoiding almost everything and making sure I nail my jumps. Meanwhile, the repetition helped me appreciate other games I previously didn’t have much patience for.</p><p>I have always struggled with the twitchy sword fighting in <em>The Adventure of Link</em>, for example, so the challenges around combat were intimidating. But much like beating your head against a wall with an <em>Elden Ring</em> boss, I found myself slowly learning how and when to attack, and I actually got better at the game. The collection hasn’t changed my mind about everything, though. In fact, I might hate <em>Balloon Fight</em> even more after attempting some of the “master” challenges.</p><p>This structure makes for a great party experience. You can play with up to eight people locally, and things get chaotic, with the screen showing everyone’s gameplay simultaneously. This introduces the added difficulty of paying attention to only your playthrough amid everything else happening onscreen, not to mention the inevitable yelling happening IRL. There’s also an online component. In the one mode I was able to test, five challenges will be available each week, and you can replay them as many times as you want to claim a place on the leaderboards. I haven’t found this mode as fun as playing solo or with people in person, but it will be eye-opening seeing how good some players are.</p><p>As much as I have enjoyed playing the part of a speedrunner, the collection is probably best paired with an actual NES or a subscription to Switch Online and its retro games. It has given me a strong urge to replay many of these classics by instilling in me a new sense of confidence: now, I might finally be able to beat <em>The Adventure of Link</em> and its skeleton knights, or <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>’ devious sequel with its poison mushrooms. More than anything, though, I’m excited to have a new excuse to play through <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> again — with one eye on the timer.</p><p><small>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition<em> launches on July 18th on the Nintendo Switch.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

						<h5>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</h5><p><span>July 18, 2024</span>
					</p></div></div>
					<p>You just never know what Nintendo is going to tap for nostalgia next. The Nintendo World Championships are a concept the company has revisited in a scattershot way over the years, but it’s the original 1990 iteration most folks remember, and really, it’s not even the event itself that’s most famous. That first competition was held using unique NES cartridges, which are now the ultimate collector’s item <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nes/nintendo-world-championship-gold" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fetching upwards of $25,000 apiece</a>. <em>That’s</em> the main reason the Nintendo World Championships are still remembered today. Despite that somewhat obscure legacy, the Nintendo World Championships are returning once again, this time as an actual widely-available video game.</p>
<p>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition offers a series of challenges derived from a slate of 8-bit classics, but will they have you running and jumping for joy? Or does Nintendo miss the podium this time around? Limber up your thumbs, it's time to find out...</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/WCCFnintendoworldchampionships2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition purports to follow in the footsteps of The Big N’s competitions of old, the real inspiration for the title seems to be the modern speedrunning scene. While the original 90s Nintendo World Championships, and most of the iterations that followed, were all about high scores, this new game is about doing things <em>fast</em>.</p>
<p>NWC: NES Edition serves up over 150 discrete challenges, drawn from 13 first-party 8-bit Nintendo titles (Super Mario Bros. 1, 2, 3, and the Lost Levels, The Legend of Zelda, Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, Metroid, Kirby's Adventure, Kid Icarus, Ice Climber, Excitebike, Balloon Fight, and Donkey Kong, to be exact). It’s a solid lineup, if a bit by-the-books and missing third-party favorites like Castlevania, Mega Man, and Battletoads. Your performance in each challenge is rated, with coins being awarded for improving your best times and letter grades. You can then use those coins to unlock more challenges and simple cosmetics like icons and badges for your online profile.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/WCCFnintendoworldchampionships7.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Challenges start extremely simple – grab a mushroom as Mario, suck up an enemy as Kirby, ect. – but increase in complexity until you’re being asked to complete entire stages. Eventually, you’ll unlock a final “Legend Challenge” for each game, which, in a cute touch, are accompanied by simple strategy guides. In the case of the original Super Mario Bros., you’re tasked with doing a true speedrun of the entire game, but sadly, that’s an exception rather than the rule. While other Legend Challenges remain fairly daunting, they’re definitely more limited – the Mario 3 challenge asks you to complete the game’s first world, the Metroid challenge only consists of the final escape sequence, ect. This sense that Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition is kind of toying around with the concept of speedrunning, without fully embracing it, kind of pervades the whole package.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/WCCFnintendoworldchampionships4-1.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The games play pretty much like they did back in the day, with optional on-screen controls and prompts for those who want to get back up to speed quickly. While I’m sure true retro fanatics and speedrunners will find differences and anomalies between the true original NES games and these versions, for the most part, this is a “warts and all” presentation, with slowdown, glitches, et all still present and accounted for.</p>
<p>When playing solo to improve your best times, you’ll usually be looking at two screens (unless you opt against that in the options). The left shows your current run, the right your previous best run so you can see at a glance how you’re measuring up. There are some handy features built into the game, like an automatic rewind that kicks in when you die (beware though, it <em>doesn’t</em> rewind your timer). It’s a solid setup, but lacks a lot of options that would make it more appealing and versatile for those already into this kind of speedrunning gameplay. For instance, you can’t manually rewind your run if mess up a sequence, your only option is to start the whole challenge over again. Also, in addition to not being able to play through whole games, you have no way to stake out your own unique challenges. The 150-some included in the package is all you get.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/WCCFnintendoworldchampionships5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The limitations of NWC: NES Edition extend to its online component. While having “World Championships” in its title would seem to imply the game has a direct competitive element, it’s not really the case. World Championships Mode presents a series of five challenges, refreshed every week, that you can work towards perfecting your times in. When the deadline arrives, your place on the leaderboards will be revealed, but until then, you won’t know. While I suppose this approach may keep people coming back to the game, I’d personally prefer a simple leaderboard for each of the game’s challenges.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/WCCFnintendoworldchampionships6.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Survival Mode somewhat simulates the feeling of competition, although, in this case, you’re only going up against other players’ ghost data. You "compete" against 7 ghosts over three rounds, with half of the field with the worst times being eliminated after each challenge. If you want realtime competition, Party Mode, which is essentially a live, local version of Survival Mode, is actually your best bet. Party Mode is fun in a casual sort of way, but, realistically, your rivals probably aren't going to provide much challenge unless they also have the game and have been practicing.</p>

<p>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition isn’t hurting for content, even if said content is nigh-on 40 years old, but I'm just not sure I see the long-term appeal of this package. Serious speedrunners will probably barely give the game a bemused glance, and for Nintendo's $30 asking price, more casual players could get a 12-month Nintendo Switch Online subscription and play full versions of all these games as much as they’d like, which feels like more of a winning strategy to me.</p>

<p>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition presents a promising concept, but a lack of features to support either dedicated speedrunners or any sort of serious online competition limits the package's appeal. There's certainly fun to be had revisiting this lineup of golden oldies, but Nintendo has only scored a bronze at the Nostalgia Olympics this time around.</p>

					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X (available on Game Pass from day one)</span>

						</p></div></div></div>
					<p>Nearly five years after the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ashen-not-dark-but-soul/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ashen</a>, Wellington-based game developer A44 is about to launch its second game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn-hands-on-preview-enjoyable-soulslite-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn</a>.</p>
<p>Whereas Ashen was published by indie label Annapurna Interactive and brought up from the ID@Xbox program as an Xbox/PC exclusive at first, Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn enjoys a raised profile and a full multiplatform launch from the get-go with publisher Kepler Interactive. A44 also doubled in size to make it, bolstering its headcount from 30 to 60 developers, which is admittedly still on the lower end for a developer looking to craft a game not too far from triple-A production levels.</p>
<p>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn follows in the footsteps of its predecessor in many ways but also departs from it in others. It's still largely inspired by the Soulslike genre created by FromSoftware, so you can expect bonfire-like Lodestones and camps as checkpoints, having only one chance to gather your lost experience (called reputation here) if you are defeated before it is gone forever, and a set amount of potions that only recharges after resting at camps; which, however, respawns all regular foes in the world.</p>
<p>However, it is much more accessible for those who, like myself, aren't too keen on standard Soulslikes. To start with, A44 did not shy away from adding a difficulty selection, unlike FromSoftware. While the mere mention of it may sound borderline heretical to diehard fans of Dark Souls and Elden Ring, the Japanese studio's refusal to allow easier settings in their games keeps a good chunk of would-be fans from enjoying those titles. There's a reason why the 'easy' (or rather, normal) difficulty mods are extremely popular on PC, while console users are forced to go through the ordeal as-is or simply walk away.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Flintlock-Screen-2-HD-standard-width-3833px-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>No such thing is necessary in Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, which offers three options when starting a new game: Story (which disables Achievements), Normal (described as balanced but challenging), and Possessed, which delivers something more akin to the punishing experience Souls fans have come to love and hate at once. But there's more: players can also fast travel at will and without any cost to any unlocked Lodestone or camp.</p>
<p>Overall, when playing on Normal, I felt none of the trademark frustration usually tied to the experience of playing a Soulslike game. Granted, there were a few tougher boss fights and enemies that required some tactical adjustments to be overcome, but that's par for the course for any action RPG like God of War, which is also an inspiration for this game. In the review guide, A44 mentioned the desire to position Flintlock as an entry point for the genre that prides itself on not being unfair to players. In this regard, the game passes with flying colors.</p>
<p>It's great that the game is so accessible. This way, players will have the chance to experience a truly unique fantasy world inspired by the rather niche titular Flintlock genre. In this type of setting, firearms and black powder are just as prevalent as magical beings, and that's exactly what you'll find here.</p>
<p>Protagonist Nor Vanek (voiced by Olive Gray, who you might remember as Miranda Keyes in the Halo TV series) is a Sapper, trained since a young age (she was a war orphan) to be part of an elite combat engineering unit within The Coalition army. The Coalition is all that stands between the army of the Dead that has been pouring out of the city of Dawn for the past ten years. At the beginning of the game, his adoptive father, Baz (voiced by Elias Toufexis, known to gamers for playing Adam Jensen in the last two Deus Ex games), goes on a suicide mission with a couple more members of the Sapper unit to bomb the Door to the Great Below, in a desperate attempt to stop the flow of undead. Being highly protective of Nor, he leaves her behind - but she rushes to join the squad as soon as she learns of their endeavor.</p>
<p>The team does appear to succeed at blowing up the Door, but this creates new problems instead of fixing anything. Namely, a few nasty gods escape and cause all sorts of trouble throughout the world (which is a peculiar mix of Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Middle Easterner, and New Zealander influences). Furthermore, Nor herself is initially separated from the Sapper unit. However, she finds a new, mysterious companion, the fox-like god Enki (voiced by Alistair Petrie, mostly known for playing General Draven in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story). Despite her initial mistrust of any god, Nor eventually agrees to work with Enki to defeat those rampaging gods. By the way, if you're worried about Enki being as annoying as Forspoken's Cuff, I can reassure you that's not the case at all.</p>

<p>While not exactly full of twists, the story, told through conventional dialogue and cinematics rather than FromSoftware's cryptic ways, is ultimately enjoyable. Critically, the developers made the cast of supporting characters interesting despite only dedicating a modest amount of quest content to them. While I certainly support the definition of Soulslite for Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn when it comes to being a leaner, more accessible version of Soulslike, the game is perhaps a bit too 'light' on content in general.</p>
<p>A44 claimed a length of 20 hours plus another 10 for completionists, but Steam says I finished the game in just 14.7 hours, and the achievements confirm I completed all side quests, freed all hamlets, unlocked all firearms, found all Enki feathers (which level up your companion for better performance in combat), and fully upgraded my campsite. The side content was pretty good, but there was so little of it compared to the usual action RPG that it's hard not to be a little disappointed, particularly if you're having fun. Granted, the game has a budget price of $39.99, but you're still left wanting at the end.</p>
<p>That extends to character progression. You can obtain new armor and weapons (both melee and ranged), but there's only a handful of them throughout the entire game. The same goes for the skill tree, which lets you specialize in Steel (melee), Black Powder (Ranged), or Magic (gracefully provided by Enki), though you will most likely end up with a mix of all three, given how small the tree is. On the bright side, you can experiment with skills more easily than in other games, as Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn lets you 'unlearn' a skill while refunding a good amount of reputation to invest elsewhere.</p>
<p>Overall, the game's combat is relatively fast-paced and requires full usage of Nor Vanek's tools. For example, an unblockable (red) attack can be dodged, but a better option might be to use your trusty firearm, as that will stun the enemy for a brief time. There are also grenades and various types of firearms, including a cannon and a flamethrower.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/FLINTLOCK_Gameplay_SCREENSHOT_UHD_003-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Traversal is also pretty fun, taking advantage of a high degree of verticality in the design of the maps. The developers previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn-has-spider-man-like-traversal-and-soulslike-combat-says-a44-games-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described</a> it as Spider-Man-like, although I'm not sure that's accurate. In Spider-Man's games, you can move more or less freely while web-swinging, whereas here, you're just zipping in a predetermined path through magical rifts. Still, it's a good way to reach some secret areas and fully explore the world.</p>
<p>Visually, Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn looks good without being mind-blowing. It is powered by Unreal Engine 4; an upgrade to UE5 could have done wonders for the game, not only for the visuals with the likes of Lumen and Nanite but mostly for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-2-out-now-adds-improvements-to-anti-stuttering-system-enhances-lumen-and-nanite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stuttering improvements introduced by Epic</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the game suffers from the stuttering seen in many UE4 games released in the past two years. Mind you, it's not nearly as bad as The Callisto Protocol, but it's there, even when playing on a PC with an RTX 4090 and NVIDIA DLSS 3 enabled.</p>

<p>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn is an enjoyable and highly accessible Soulslite. A44 created a great entry point for the genre, not to mention an exciting fantasy setting that mixes black powder, magic, and influences that go beyond the usual European medieval style. The combat is fun and won't cause you to break any controllers. The story is also worth following, although the game perhaps end up too soon, leaving narrative and gameplay possibilities to be explored by a sequel.</p>

The dead persist violently among the living. What remains of humanity following a cataclysm I helped trigger is now at each other’s throats. I carry my share of the blame, but it’s clear the gods must pay for what they’ve done to us. There’s a path to seeking justice, and it must be cut through legions of monsters, human and undead alike. I’m up to the task, equipped with strength, resolve, and help from an unlikely source. With each foe I strike down, I learn more about myself. I learn that I’m not powerless. States of failure and struggle aren’t permanent. Nothing will stand in my way. </p><p>Even gods can die. And I’m going to kill them.</p><hr><p><em>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn</em> is the latest game from developer A44 Games, the team behind 2019’s <em>Ashen</em>. A soulslike set in what the developers refer to as a “Flintlock fantasy,” where magical fantasy is fused with black powder-powered firearms, the roughly 10- to 20-hour story follows the struggle of Nor Vanek, a trench digger who finds herself in the middle of a world-changing event that unleashes the power and wrath of ancient gods upon the world, sending it into a state of misery and despair as undead roam the land and human factions find themselves corrupted by twisted ideologies and faith. With an ax in one hand and a black powder pistol in the other, Nor sets out to take on the gods and right what went wrong. But she’s not alone. </p><p><strong>Buy <em>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn:</em></strong><em> </em><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Flintlock-Siege-Dawn-Deluxe-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CN3TQMRN/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/flintlock-game-review-soulslike-ashen-difficult-1851595559&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0CN3TQMRN" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmGpIXW9198&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmGpIXW9198" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span></p><figure id="" data-id="44b38bf2f6556fa7a17e8c6b4c2efcd8" data-recommend-id="image://44b38bf2f6556fa7a17e8c6b4c2efcd8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nor meets Enki for the first time." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nor meets Enki for the first time." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->A44 Games / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="44b38bf2f6556fa7a17e8c6b4c2efcd8" data-recommend-id="image://44b38bf2f6556fa7a17e8c6b4c2efcd8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nor meets Enki for the first time." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Accompanying her is Enki, a god taking the form of a small, adorable, feathered fox. After convincing Nor of his seemingly good, though mysterious, intentions following the cataclysmic event that sends the world spiraling into chaos, Enki grants Nor the gift of magic as well as companionship as the two set out to make things right in the world. </p><p>Those magical abilities provide Nor with the ability to deal extra forms of damage and unleash status effects on her enemies, as well as traverse the world through triangular rift gates to access new areas and speed along on trips through previous routes. The core structure is standard soulslike: You explore the world to take on challenging foes, earning a form of experience as you do to level up your character. Die and you drop all the experience you have on you until you return to reclaim it. Die before reclaiming the experience and it’s lost forever. Study your enemies’ moves carefully, strike when the time is right, block, parry, and dodge to ward off their attacks, and you just might make it through alive. </p><p>Where <em>Flintlock </em>departs from many of its genre siblings is that here, you almost certainly <em>will</em> survive because, though it has much in common with the likes of <em>Dark Souls</em> and <em>Elden Ring</em>, it’s remarkably more forgiving across its three adjustable difficulty modes, one of which allows you to turn on infinite health. Though a lower level of difficulty might not exactly be an irresistible siren’s call for those <em>Souls </em>fans who love the genre for its robust challenge, by lowering the difficulty threshold, <em>Flintlock </em>may allow more players to experience the very good action on offer here. Make no mistake, the game is still very happy to knock you on your ass if you’re charging in recklessly, but importantly, the combat, more often than not, feels like it wants you to have fun. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree </em>Review: Massive, Menacing, And Magnificent</a></span></p><p>In providing a less punishing challenge, <em>Flintlock</em> isn’t just concerned with showing you that you, too, can overcome difficult gameplay. It’s here to show you that this kind of combat-oriented, tough action RPG is <em>fun</em>. Though I had qualms with <em>Flintlock</em> early on, and more than a few issues that persisted up until the credits rolled, I walked away from this game with a new appreciation for the genre. I’m now eager to take on some of its harder cousins. <em>Flintlock</em> was what I needed to play to reorient my relationship with soulslikes and games that require a certain level of fortitude and commitment. And not just because I now understand that I <em>can </em>do hard things, but because I’m reminded of the <em>fun </em>involved in it.</p><figure id="" data-id="c7a19e368a2578ab98414c9873f8a20d" data-recommend-id="image://c7a19e368a2578ab98414c9873f8a20d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nor looks out at some jagged peaks." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nor looks out at some jagged peaks." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->A44 Games / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c7a19e368a2578ab98414c9873f8a20d" data-recommend-id="image://c7a19e368a2578ab98414c9873f8a20d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nor looks out at some jagged peaks." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While <em>Flintlock</em> may very well serve the purpose of introducing or re-introducing you to a sometimes-abrasive genre, it’s also unique and fun in its own way. But oh, dear reader, I didn’t feel that way at first. I’m very happy to say that <em>Flintlock</em> grew on me, but it had to claw its way out of some <em>bad</em> first impressions.</p><h2 id="h230803"><a id=""></a>A rough start to a rough world</h2><p>In my first hour or two of <em>Flintlock</em>, I didn’t think we were going to get along. I’d bemoan playing this game to coworkers, friends, and even once on a date. And while I did come to appreciate elements of the narrative by the end, I’m not convinced <em>Flintlock</em> introduces its story, world, and characters very well. </p><p><em>Flintlock</em> rushes through essential opening moments in a way that prevented me from fully soaking in all the important, foundational story beats. As a result, I spent much of the game not really understanding exactly what was going on. Sure, it was clear that there were undead. There were bad gods. Humanity was in a shitty state. Enki was maybe a trustworthy friend? At the very least, he was beyond adorable.</p><figure id="" data-id="9344b4df273689e1de5f8390f8495934" data-recommend-id="image://9344b4df273689e1de5f8390f8495934" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Enki looks out at a mountainscape." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Enki looks out at a mountainscape." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->A44 Games / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9344b4df273689e1de5f8390f8495934" data-recommend-id="image://9344b4df273689e1de5f8390f8495934" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Enki looks out at a mountainscape." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The game was eager to talk about what was going on as if I <em>should</em> know, but it was rough. I reached a point where I just accepted what I was supposed to do: Gods bad. Swing ax and shoot. But it felt like I was just being swept along in a story whose basics had gone over my head . An in-game glossary or codex of some kind that could define basic terms or give me a running summary of events would’ve dramatically improved this. </p><p>Part of my misunderstanding, I suspect, was due to <em>Flintlock</em>’s very unfortunate audio treatment. While A44 did stress that the pre-release build I had access to during my review (which was mostly issue-free aside from a strange, non-game-breaking UI bug) didn’t have adjustable “2D cinematic audio,” there were issues with the sound that I worry a day-one patch might not be able to fix.</p><p>It was remarkably difficult to hear what characters were saying at times. I repeatedly dove into the audio settings to try and address this, but more often than not, characters would sound muffled and distant. And even when the voices were direct, there was a strange timbre to the audio recordings that made it hard for me to understand them. I had to turn the subtitles on and leave them on for the whole game.</p><figure id="" data-id="5466a95e00a767c5eb8af7fc7a4fec1d" data-recommend-id="image://5466a95e00a767c5eb8af7fc7a4fec1d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nor and Enki talk near a fire pit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nor and Enki talk near a fire pit." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->A44 Games / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5466a95e00a767c5eb8af7fc7a4fec1d" data-recommend-id="image://5466a95e00a767c5eb8af7fc7a4fec1d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nor and Enki talk near a fire pit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Flintlock</em> also has frequent ambient character dialogue between Nor and Enki, almost to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/forspoken-review-dialogue-rpg-square-frey-open-world-1850048781&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/forspoken-review-dialogue-rpg-square-frey-open-world-1850048781"><em>Forspoken</em></a></span> levels of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/forspoken-chatter-cuff-best-settings-parkour-1850029744&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/forspoken-chatter-cuff-best-settings-parkour-1850029744">persistent chatter</a></span> (seriously, Enki, stop commenting every time I pickup crafting materials or jump into rifts).

Oftentimes, they would just erupt in remarkably loud and abrasive ways (and that’s coming from someone who enjoys loud, abrasive music and sounds). </p><p>It’s a shame because the fundamental quality of the sounds and the soundtrack are quite good (boss fight music in particular, though often too loud, is well-written and evocative).

But it amounts to more than just an on-ramp to this kind of game. While I’m now looking at my calendar to figure out how to schedule in some quality personal time with other games of this kind, I’m sad I won’t be playing more <em>Flintlock</em>, at least not without a New Game Plus option, which the game currently lacks. </p><p>Nor gets a melee weapon—an ax or hammer—along with a black powder gun that recharges its ammo as you land successful hits. You also have access to more powerful rifles, grenade launchers, and other armaments that typically require you to manually reload each shot and can be aimed like a gun in a standard, over-the-shoulder third-person shooter. Firearms do decent damage on their own at times, but they’re also very useful for stopping an enemy from unleashing a more powerful, unblockable attack. And when you’re in the heat of a boss fight and manage to manually reload a black powder rifle just in time to bring it up to aim, fire, and stop them from hitting you with a devastating blow, it’s great fun every time. </p><figure id="" data-id="a1c8ffe5ba1b56d8840b75043fe07888" data-recommend-id="image://a1c8ffe5ba1b56d8840b75043fe07888" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nor strikes at an enemy with her hammer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nor strikes at an enemy with her hammer." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->A44 Games / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a1c8ffe5ba1b56d8840b75043fe07888" data-recommend-id="image://a1c8ffe5ba1b56d8840b75043fe07888" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nor strikes at an enemy with her hammer." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Nor’s companion, Enki, provides her with magical augmentation to her attacks.

Combined with her occasional taunts at enemies, combat in <em>Flintlock</em> makes you feel powerful, and it wants you to. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/senua-saga-hellblade-2-sacrifice-review-xbox-pc-1851489149&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/senua-saga-hellblade-2-sacrifice-review-xbox-pc-1851489149"><em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em>: The <em>Kotaku</em> Review</a></span></p><p>One particularly interesting element of <em>Flintlock</em>’s combat is how it handles XP, or “Reputation” as it calls it. As you defeat enemies and pull off successful combat maneuvers, you’ll earn Reputation that you can spend on upgrading your proficiency with firearms, magic, and melee weapons. You lose the Reputation you’re carrying around if you die twice without recovering it. That part’s pretty standard. But what’s unique is that during combat, you build up Reputation in a separate meter, where it’s increased by a percentage multiplier that goes up as you continue to land successful hits and dodge attacks. You can pull your Reputation out of that separate meter at any time to “cash it in,” as it were, by holding a button, or you can choose to let it build up and increase in value as you continue to play the game more proficiently. Get hit, and the multiplier gets reset, adding what Reputation you earned to your current total. The longer you’re able to sustain your Reputation multiplier by avoiding damage, the more you’ll earn. </p><figure id="" data-id="b5b7112f4760d27468dece759aaed96f" data-recommend-id="image://b5b7112f4760d27468dece759aaed96f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nor communes with the Host." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nor communes with the Host." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->A44 Games / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b5b7112f4760d27468dece759aaed96f" data-recommend-id="image://b5b7112f4760d27468dece759aaed96f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nor communes with the Host." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This mechanic encourages you to do better in combat in more ways than just punishing you with death should you fail. The HUD indicates the successful combat moves you pull off, and you come to learn the system pretty well while playing, picking up on ways to avoid hits and find better openings to land attacks. By the end of the game, its benefits were less about the experience multiplier, and more about helping me conceptualize the fighting in a way that I expect will cross over to other games in the genre. <em>Flintlock</em>’s mechanics are well composed and easy to understand, helping you sustain the highs of doing well in a hard action RPG rather than learning from suffering crushing lows too often. </p><p>That said, it is an easier game than many it takes clear inspiration from, both in its lower level of difficulty and its systems that encourage you to play smarter. In my single run of the campaign, I died less than a dozen times and only switched to easy mode because I encountered a boss whose second phase was so hectic, it was beyond anything the game had taught me to fight before. Still, though it was relatively easy, I still feel like I learned a combat system that had nuance and interesting challenges. And I was eager for more.</p><p>Unfortunately, as soon as I really got into the groove of this combat system, and was starting to finally catch up with a story that felt like it had left me behind, the game was nearing its conclusion. </p><figure id="" data-id="4aa52afee39541e23e522d392d2e640b" data-recommend-id="image://4aa52afee39541e23e522d392d2e640b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nor stands before a massive building." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nor stands before a massive building." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->A44 Games / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4aa52afee39541e23e522d392d2e640b" data-recommend-id="image://4aa52afee39541e23e522d392d2e640b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nor stands before a massive building." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I ultimately completed it in about 10 hours with a full run of the story and a sizable chunk of the side quests. Some might delight at the prospect of such a short, manageable runtime, especially as many modern games seemingly want to occupy endless hours. But I’d argue that <em>Flintlock</em> deserves to last longer on the merits of its own satisfying, approachable, and fun gameplay loop.</p><p>The game features an introductory sequence, two semi-open-world environments filled with enemies, camps to liberate, coffee shops to visit, side-quests, and a conclusion. I so wish <em>Flintlock</em> would’ve had at least one more semi-open world environment to explore. The game sells for less than $40 brand new, but I don’t feel like I want more <em>Flintlock</em> for the sake of value. I want more <em>Flintlock</em> to play more <em>Flintlock</em>. </p><h2 id="h230805"><a id=""></a><em>Flintlock </em>deserves more, now and hopefully later</h2><p><em>Flintlock</em> won’t provide you with your next “get gud” level of challenge. It’s not an invitation to bark down at people who don’t have the time or experience to invest in harder games over “skill issues.” I was a bit let down by some of its presentational issues and murky storytelling, but in the end, I found myself just wanting more of this combat. <em>Flintlock</em> has encouraged me to jump further into a genre that used to turn me off. If you’ve struggled with the soulslike genre in the past, you might find this game to do the same.</p><figure id="" data-id="20815f3334a13bca47fbeb9d0ba4ebdd" data-recommend-id="image://20815f3334a13bca47fbeb9d0ba4ebdd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Enki and Nor stand before a god who's seated in a lotus pose while holding a sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Enki and Nor stand before a god who's seated in a lotus pose while holding a sword." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->A44 Games / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="20815f3334a13bca47fbeb9d0ba4ebdd" data-recommend-id="image://20815f3334a13bca47fbeb9d0ba4ebdd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Enki and Nor stand before a god who's seated in a lotus pose while holding a sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But it’s not just the combat. The setting and world design is very inspired, with some gorgeous art and wonderful environmental designs. Nor and Enki’s discussions as they explore the world bring up topics of human traditions in response to the duality of life and death. There’s personality and heart at the core of <em>Flintlock</em> that I’d like more of, and that’s especially welcome considering how cryptic and austere games in this genre often are. I found the ending to be a little ambiguous, perhaps hinting that there’s more story to tell. And I really hope that’s the case. I want to see more of these characters, this world. They deserve more time on screen.</p><p><em>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn</em> has its issues, but I think A44 Games has hit upon something special here, creating both an approachable form of soulslike gameplay and a unique, non-conventional fantasy setting that isn’t just another pseudo-European medieval landscape dominated by white men. The game could’ve really reached something greater with an extra five or so hours of gameplay. But what’s on offer here is a low barrier to entry for a genre that is often too eager to delight in your misery. <br></p><p><strong>Buy <em>Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Flintlock-Siege-Dawn-Deluxe-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CN3TQMRN/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/flintlock-game-review-soulslike-ashen-difficult-1851595559&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0CN3TQMRN" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmGpIXW9198&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmGpIXW9198" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Xbox recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-announcement-tease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> that another Game Pass announcement will arrive soon when announcing the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-reveals-new-titles-coming-to-game-pass-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new titles for their game catalogue</a>. Many speculate that this tease could be related to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 arriving on Game Pass, along with other Activision Blizzard titles. A prominent leaker believes that another mystery title will be coming with MW3 to Game Pass, and that game is Dave the Diver.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Recognized Xbox leaks source eXtas1s corroborated Insider Gaming’s report that Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 will arrive on Game Pass this month in their latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXefXBCiP4M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube video</a>. In the same video, eXtas1s discusses another game arriving with the popular FPS game, Mintrocket’s casual, single-player adventure RPG, Dave the Diver.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It would be strategic for Xbox to include Dave the Diver in its Game Pass library. Since its initial release, the game has gained significant popularity and garnered multiple prestigious awards. Furthermore, it was recently featured on PlayStation Plus for PlayStation 5 users. This aligns with the prevailing industry trend, where games introduced on PS Plus often become available on Game Pass and vice versa.</p>



<h2 id="h-about-dave-the-diver">About Dave the Diver</h2>



<p>Dave the Diver is a casual adventure RPG cum management simulator which features deep sea exploration. The game will have you exploring the ocean’s depths, fishing during the day, and managing a sushi restaurant at night. During your journey, you will catch many types of fish, upgrade and craft new equipment, find treasure, and unravel the mysteries of the ever-changing Blue Hole.&nbsp;</p>

"OMG, Alfira!?," asked TitanMK0 on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BaldursGate3/comments/1e4laf0/comment/ldfijdn/?utm_name=web3xcss" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>.</p><p>A tiefling bard encountered during Act 1 of Baldur's Gate 3, Alfira tasks the party with helping her compose a song.

"Larian may as well add dialogue and quests for her."</p><p>Even if they can't, Bucket_Of_Magic notes her addition is "prime real estate for mods," because if Larian adds her as a playable character it has "already laid the foundation."</p><p>While mods would normally be great news for PC players and a harsh reality for those on console, Larian is emitting this divide with Patch 7's headline feature: <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-official-mod-support-arrives-this-september">official mod support on all platforms</a>.</p><p>No specific release date beyond "September 2024" has been shared for the update, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-mod-support-sounds-like-its-final-major-update">potentially Baldur's Gate 3's final major patch</a>, but the studio will likely share it soon.
