            <p>The success of Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty DLC was only possible due to the base game's "negative reception".</p>
<p>That's according to senior quest designer Paweł Sasko, who acknowledged that if the original game's 2020 release hadn't been "as negative as it was", "it couldn't have been possible" for expansion Phantom Liberty to have "worked significantly better at launch".</p>

<p>"Phantom Liberty worked significantly better at its launch because we completely changed the production style, something that couldn’t have been possible if the initial reception of the game wasn’t as negative as it was," Sasko told <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/cyberpunk-2077-controversial-launch-helped-phantom-liberty-success/">TheGamer</a> at Gamescom Latam.</p>
<p>"It changed me and us as a studio."</p>
<p>Three-and-a-half years after its disastrous December 2020 debut, after dozens of patches and the launch of last year's Phantom Liberty expansion, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-development-has-finally-wound-down-after-three-and-a-half-years">CD Projekt Red no longer has anyone working on Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>
<p>As Tom summarised for us at the time, just 17 people had been working on the game still as of 29th February this year. As of 30th April, that number dropped to zero.</p>
<p>It's a small but significant moment for CD Projekt as it finally leaves Cyberpunk 2077 behind - with the vast bulk of its development might now focused on its next game in The Witcher series, currently still codenamed Polaris.</p>

            <p>EA Sports FC 25 will release in September 2024, with a seven-day early-access period expected to launch on 20th September.</p>
<p>That's according to French website <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1dw1ozu/ea_sports_fc_2025_releasing_september_27/">Dealabs</a> and prolific leaker billbil-kun, who has accurately leaked gaming intel ahead of time in the past.</p>

<p>"EA Sports FC 25 will be released on 27th September, 2024," the website claims. "The game will be available in 2 editions, Standard and Ultimate. Owners of the Ultimate edition will benefit from 7 days' early access, starting on 20th September, 2024. EA Play members will also benefit from this early access with a 10-hour trial."</p>
<p>According to the same site, the Standard and Ultimate editions are expected to retail for around £60/€70/$70 and £90/€100/$100, respectively.</p>
<p>PlayStation Game Size has also since publicly corroborated Dealabs' claim that the football game will be released on PS4, which may mean it's also coming to Xbox One, too.</p> <div>

            <p>Former LA Noire developers are reportedly working on a new psychological thriller set in 1940s Los Angeles, "Sowden House".</p>
<p>Two separate posts have popped up on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C4FK9_NS4cH/">Instagram</a> from performer, composer, and producer Freyja Garbett, who says they've been working on a "HUGE" project "writing for a video game [...] from the creators of LA Noire".</p>

<p>"From the creators of LA Noire comes Sowden House, a psychological thriller also set in the 1940’s in LA that will have you questioning your sanity," Garbett <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C4FK9_NS4cH/">teased</a>.</p>
<p>"This project has been HUGE and it is still unravelling and revealing itself to me. I never thought I’d be writing for [a] video game but I’m grateful for the opportunity!"</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lanoire/comments/1dp0m8l/potential_leak_of_upcoming_sowden_house/">Potential Leak of Upcoming “Sowden House” Psychological Thriller (From Creators of L.A Noire)</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/gennaroandriani/">u/gennaroandriani</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lanoire/">lanoire</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p>
<p>Whilst the 1940s setting will immediately take fans back to Team Bondi's excellent thriller 2011 LA Noire, it's unclear if Sowden House is a direct sequel, prequel, a spin-off, or an entirely new game that draws on the team's experience.</p>
<p>However, as the sleuths at the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lanoire/comments/1dp0m8l/potential_leak_of_upcoming_sowden_house/">GamingLeaksandRumours subreddit</a> posit, Sowden House was the home of Dr. George Hodel, a physician who was long-suspected of the Black Dahlia murder… which again links us straight back to LA Noire, of course.</p>
<p>Is this cast-iron proof that a new LA Noire game is on the way? Sadly not. But even if it's only a rumour for now, it should be welcome news indeed for fans of Team Bondi. The studio sadly shuttered in 2011, the same year in which LA Noire was released.</p>

            <p>You can't purchase Outrun 2006: Coast 2 Coast digitally on PC anymore, because the Ferrari license expired and it was removed from sale back in 2010. We live in a cruel universe. The excellent, stylish racing game is still playable if you do own a copy, however, and it just received a fan update that'll make it run better on modern machines.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The update, created by developer emoose, is a "wrapper DLL" and a replacement executable that should work with either the Steam or disc versions of the game. The standout tweaks include improved reflections, borderless windowed mode, a UI that supports new aspect ratios, framerate fixes and improved loading times.
</p>
<p>Here are the <a href="https://github.com/emoose/OutRun2006Tweaks/blob/master/README.md">full change notes</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><strong>Graphics:</strong>
<ul>
<li>UI can now scale to different aspect ratios without stretching (requires UIScalingMode = 1 in INI)</li>
<li>Game scene &amp; UI textures can be dumped/replaced</li>
<li>Allows disabling vehicle LODs, reducing the ugly pop-in as they get closer</li>
<li>Fixed Z-buffer precision issues that caused heavy Z-fighting and distant object pop-in</li>
<li>Lens flare effect now loads from correct path without needing to change game files</li>
<li>Stage objects such as traffic cones now only disappear once they're actually off-screen</li>
<li>Fixes certain effects like engine backfiring which failed to appear when using controllers</li>
<li>Anisotropic filtering &amp; transparency supersampling can be forced, greatly reducing aliasing around the edges of the track</li>
<li>Reflection rendering resolution can be increased from the default 128x128</li>
</ul>
<strong>Gameplay:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Built-in framelimiter to prevent speedups, framerate can be partially unlocked with game running at 60FPS internally</li>
<li>Restored XInput rumble code from the Xbox release, allowing gear shifts/drifts/crashes/etc to give feedback</li>
<li>Xbox Series impulse triggers are supported and can be tweaked inside INI</li>
</ul>
<strong>Bugfixes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Prevents save corruption bug when remapping controls with many input devices connected</li>
<li>Fixed C2C ranking scoreboards not updating on Steam and other releases due to faulty anti-piracy checks</li>
<li>Pegasus animation's clopping sound effect will now end correctly</li>
<li>Text related to the now-defunct online service can be hidden</li>
<li>Automatically disables DPI scaling on the game window to fix scaling issues</li>
</ul>
<strong>Enhancements:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Game can now run in borderless windowed mode; mouse cursor will now be hidden while game is active</li>
<li>Load times heavily reduced by disabling framelimiter/vsync during load screens</li>
<li>Music can now be loaded from uncompressed WAV or lossless FLAC files, if they exist with the same filename</li>
<li>Allows intro splash screens to be skipped</li>
<li>Music track can be changed mid-race via Q and E buttons, or Back/RS+Back on controller (CDSwitcher must be enabled in INI first)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If I could snap my fingers and bring a racing game back, it would be Coast 2 Coast. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-beautiful-game-inside-outrun">It is art</a>. To my mind it's the best OutRun game, and it would be wonderful to play it on Steam Deck without needing to buy a physical copy or to ask an older boy for help first. 
</p>
<p>You'll find the latest release of OutRun2006Tweaks and install instructions <a href="https://github.com/emoose/OutRun2006Tweaks/releases">over on GitHub.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clayster-says-it-%E2%80%98might-be-time%E2%80%99-as-he%E2%80%99s-dropped-by-royal-ravens.920577/</guid>

<p>Now that the Carolina Royal Ravens’ CDL season has ended, the organisation is sizing up the road ahead. It was revealed that the team is dropping James ‘Clayster’ Eubanks, one of the most veteran personalities in the Call of Duty esports scene and one of the most impactful competitors still actively playing. This means that the iconic player, who has been competing in Call of Duty for more than fifteen years, won’t appear at the Esports World Cup, where he was due to represent ReKTGlobal.</p>



<p>Following the release of the news, Clayster posted a string of emotional messages on Twitter, one of which mentioned the line ‘think it might be time.’ At the start of this CDL season, Clayster referenced retirement should he need to once again face the anxiety and politics of ‘Rostermania’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-end-of-an-era">End of an Era?</h2>



<p>Clayster has spent many years at the top of his game, and in what could be considered his twilight years, he has remained a stalwart IGL in the Call of Duty League space. He has played through this season with the Carolina Royal Ravens, and while the team failed to make it to COD Champs, the squad contributed plenty of entertaining scenes to the year’s action.</p>



<p>To date, he has won three world championship titles, making him one of the winningest Call of Duty players of all time.</p>



<p>When the news regarding his departure from the Royal Ravens broke, Clayster said:</p>

<p>Really feel like my life has been crashing down over the last couple years and this just might be the final nail in the coffin. Immense sadness and so much regret when all I do is pour myself into my job and my loved ones, just never feel like it’s enough. No f***in point.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He then mentioned ‘disappearing’ social media rather than dealing with another period of desperately hoping he’ll be picked up by a team. Clay has long been known to wear his heart on his sleeve, being one of the most vocal players in the business. During the last Call of Duty League Major, Clay clashed with Toronto Ultra’s Thomas ‘Scrap’ Ernst, suggesting the young player should ‘kill himself’ after a bout of trash talk.</p>



<p>Claster capped off his slew of messages on Twitter by writing:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Any opportunities outside of playing bang my line, literally open to anything at this point. Think it might be time.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When this season kicked off, Clayster said he’d rather retire than go through Rostermania again. This is the between-season period that sees organisations mess with their rosters, and it typically results in many players being dropped – and hopefully picked up again by some other squad. Clayster was hoping he’d stick with the Royal Ravens during the off-season, but it’s clear that won’t be the case.</p>

        <p>The game is thought to be a joint project between Square Enix and Tencent.</p>

            <p>Final Fantasy developer Square Enix has reportedly linked up with Tencent to develop a mobile version of its fan-favourite MMO, Final Fantasy 14.</p>
<p>Further to the strategic agreement both companies signed back in 2018, <a href="https://forums.exputer.com/threads/exclusive-final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-is-in-development.237/">Exputer</a> believes the companies are now working on a mobile port of Final Fantasy 14.</p>
<p>It's not clear if the mobile game will be exclusive to one mobile manufacturer, or available on all devices.</p>

<p>"We are in ongoing communications with Tencent, and there are some projects that are underway but I will refrain from commenting on any details at present, including in terms of any output over the next three years," Square Enix's president, Yosuke Matsuda, <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/library/docs/210618/page04.html">said</a> back in 2021.</p>
<p>Neither company have formerly confirmed what these projects are, but it's thought the Final Fantasy game is in development after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-cancels-unannounced-nier-mobile-game">an unannounced Nier mobile game was shelved</a> last year.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi recently said he's reluctant to work on a Final Fantasy game again <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-creator-would-prefer-to-keep-enjoying-final-fantasy-14-as-a-player-than-work-on-the-series-again">as he's having too much fun playing Final Fantasy 14</a>.</p>
<p>"If I take on the Final Fantasy brand again, I don't know if I'll be able to genuinely enjoy Final Fantasy 14 as much," he said.</p>
<p>Talking of Final Fantasy 14, director and producer Naoki "Yoshi P" Yoshida recently offered his "sincere apologies" for the issues identified in the early access build of its highly-anticipated expansion, Dawntrail.</p>
<p>In a blog post published shortly after the expansion went live for early access players last weekend, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-director-apologises-for-issues-identified-in-the-early-access-build-of-dawntrail">Yoshida thanked players for playing and assured them that the team was "investigating" the causes of the most pressing issues</a>, including transition freezes on Xbox, and broken animations across all platforms.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-lead-says-snowdrop-engine-still-needs-to-be-improved-a-lot-for-an-fps/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Tom Clancy's XDefiant, Ubisoft San Francisco's first game as lead studio since <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South Park: The Fractured but Whole</a>, launched this May, around three years after the original announcement.</p>
<p>The free-to-play competitive first-person shooter game immediately registered strong player counts, becoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-is-reportedly-the-fastest-ubisoft-game-to-reach-1-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft's fastest game to reach one million players</a>. Last week, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot officially <a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-registered-11-million-players-in-five-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that XDefiant had hosted 11 million players over its first five weeks.</p>
<p>Despite the large fan base, the game has some issues, especially bugs. When a fellow player <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1809020713954914444" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> to XDefiant Executive Producer Mark Rubin that the game might have been rushed, the developer replied with a lengthy explanation that the engine (Ubisoft Massive's Snowdrop) wasn't envisioned for that genre and, therefore, still needs a lot of improvement.</p>
<p><em>Rushed out? No. What we have is an engine that has only ever been an MMO. And so all of the infrastructure for an FPS has had to be built up from the ground floor. Even Call of Duty started on ID tech, which was a shooter engine. Apex Legends started on a shooter engine. But for us, we are working on developing all new tech in an engine that was designed for something else. That being said, the engine is really great, but it does require a lot of work, and with that work comes a lot of bugs that other engines have already worked out. We're not a shooter that's been out for 20 years. If you like what we are trying to do, stick around, and you'll see things improve and new features get added. But if the game isn't for you, that's ok; you can move on.</em></p>
<p><em>It's not that it's outdated. It's more just that it wasn't made to do first-person shooters, so there is a lot to do and to improve.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, Snowdrop was devised for Tom Clancy's The Division. Later, its incredible potential convinced Ubisoft to use it in many other games, such as Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle and its sequel, Starlink: Battle for Atlas, and The Settlers: New Allies, among others. XDefiant is not the first game powered by Snowdrop to launch, as Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora launched in December 2023. However, that game was a single player title with optional co-op, whereas a competitive multiplayer shooter has far different needs.</p>
<p>How long will Ubisoft San Francisco need to iron out Snowdrop's kinks remains to be seen. Meanwhile, XDefiant launched Season 1 earlier this week, launching the GS Kommando faction from Rainbow Six, three new maps (Clubhouse, Daytona, Rockefeller), three new weapons available through the free Battle Pass tier, two new modes (Capture the Flag and Bomb, the latter of which is coming later in the season), and Ranked Play.</p>

            <p>Construct 'n' destruct sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/besiege">Besiege</a> recently got a splashy expansion in The Splintered Sea, which Nic enjoyed a lot in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/besiege-splintered-sea-review">his review</a> while calling it compact, small and brisk. Apparently Nic wasn't alone in this opinion: its developers now say they're working on a free update that will expand the expansion and make its campaign 50% longer.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The update will add five new levels to The Splintered Sea and will release on July 22nd.
</p>
<p>One of the levels will feature a tentacle beast that can rip apart your vessels, as seen in one of the previous Splintered Sea trailers. Another will challenge your steering, by having you build a small ship you need to guide through a series of closing gates. Apparently another will feature a battle against a swarm of sharks.
</p>
<p>"We’ve also been experimenting with the idea of adding additional challenges to levels that, while not required for completion, can offer a much greater test of your ability," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/346010/view/4237406000171593409">the announcement</a>. The offered example is a series of crates the player can choose to smash through while still completing a level within the time limit.
</p>
<p>It's nice to see Spiderling Studios taking feedback onboard and working to make the expansion more substantial - particualrly because it wasn't at all bad in the first place, and it would have been easy to leave it as it was. Aside from those dinkonyms above, Nic already referred to it as "an awesome and incredibly complex and worthwhile thing."</p>

<p>While the Descendants themselves steal the show, with their unique abilities and appearances, it’s the weapons that will help push you to new heights. If your primary rifle is weak, you won’t be able to push end-game content. Well, here is where to get new weapons in The First Descendant!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-new-guns-in-the-first-descendant">How to Get New Guns in The First Descendant</h2>



<p>There are multiple ways to acquire new weapons in The First Descendant. You can unlock powerful guns via the game’s battle pass, earn them by completing missions and defeating bosses out in the world, and by purchasing guns and other equipment from Deslin on Albion.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Deslin is the easiest way to acquire new weapons in the game. He sits just down the staircase leading to the left-hand (when looking at the map) portion of Albion. You can’t miss him, as he’s marked with an icon of two crossed rifles and his odd appearance. He wears modified welding goggles and a pilot’s cap.</p>



<p>While the weapons he sells prove inexpensive and readily available, you’ll likely visit him to buy Reactors. You’re more likely to unlock new weapons by completing missions out in the world. They’re bite-size content that rewards you after a few minutes of combat.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-improve-your-weapons-in-the-first-descendant">How to Improve Your Weapons in The First Descendant</h2>



<p>The First Descendant features a system in which the more you use a weapon, the more powerful it can become. You earn <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/weapon-proficiency-first-descendant-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Proficiency XP</a> for every kill and mission you complete, and as your weapon levels, it unlocks Module slots. You absolutely want to slot Modules into your weapon, as they alter the gun’s fire rate, damage type, critical hit chance, and more.</p>



<p>As such, even if you find an end-game weapon that’s more powerful than anything you’ve used previously, you’ll want to grind out missions and enemy kills to upgrade it further!</p>



<hr>



<p>After you pick up a new weapon, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-emote-in-the-first-descendant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learn to use the emote wheel</a> to show it off!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/weapon-proficiency-first-descendant-answered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>The first time you unlock a new weapon and explore the game’s equipment and inventory system, you’ll note your gun has an orange bar beneath its stats. This bar indicates its Weapon Proficiency level, and you can’t click it or hover over it, making it a mystery. So, what does Weapon Proficiency do in The First Descendant?</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-weapon-proficiency-in-the-first-descendant">What is Weapon Proficiency in The First Descendant?</h2>



<p>The game’s Weapon Proficiency system directly affects how powerful your weapon will become as you progress through the game. It’s your skill level with each unique weapon in the game, and the higher the level, the more top-tier Modules you can equip to your gun in The First Descendant.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s a way to increase your power level further upon unlocking one of the game’s best weapons—or a favorite weapon that you don’t want to let go of—to push end-game content. </p>



<p>So, why do you need more Modules on your weapon? Think of Modules in The First Descendant like Gems in an RPG. They alter the effects and affixes of your gun with additional damage, better accuracy, and improved critical hit rate chances. Some even add elemental damage to your bullets, like Fire.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-increase-your-weapon-proficiency">How to Increase Your Weapon Proficiency</h2>



<p>There’s only one way to increase your Weapon Proficiency in The First Descendant. You must equip and use the gun in the field. The more you use a weapon, the more Proficiency XP you earn.</p>



<p>Once you complete a mission out in the game’s various zones, you’ll receive a summary of how much Proficiency XP you earned during the quest.</p>



<p>It’s best to occasionally swap weapons to ensure none fall behind the curve!</p>



<hr>



<p>While you’re grinding Proficiency XP, why not take a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-descendant-story-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep dive into the game’s story</a>?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/satisfactory-finally-leaves-early-access-on-september-10/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Coffee Stain's first-person open world factory building game Satisfactory finally has a 1.0 launch date, over four years after its debut in early access (<a href="https://wccftech.com/satisfactory-massive-hit-epic-games-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originally on the Epic Games Store</a>).</p>
<p>The Swedish development team, also known for the Goat Simulator franchise, <a href="https://x.com/SatisfactoryAF/status/1809241796146331846" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a September 10 PC release date. They also detailed several key changes that will be introduced with the launch version, starting with many changes to the resource modes available on the world map.</p>
<p>According to Coffee Stain, most node reductions have been made in the Northern Forest to encourage expansion from there as players progress into the later stages of the game. At the same time, nodes have been scattered throughout the map, placed where it makes geographical sense to achieve a more even resource distribution. The main materials addressed are Caterium, Sulfur, and Quartz.</p>
<p>In addition, Iron, Copper, and Limestone nodes and water Geysers have been spread across the map to help with basic resource income wherever you build a factory. Coal has also seen changes, with a number of them added in close proximity to The Abyss while also being removed in a few spots around the map.</p>
<p><iframe title="Satisfactory Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/febekpSoEbA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Changes to recipe costs will be made in Satisfactory 1.0 to foster smoother transitions between phases and levels, especially in the later stages of the game. Requirements are generally being relaxed; for example, Programmable Splitters will use AI Limiters and Geothermal Generators will use Highspeed Connectors, whereas both used to be made through Supercomputers.</p>
<p>Critically, Coffee Stain claims to have made major optimization strides when it comes to stuttering and memory requirements, especially for textures. The game, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5s-lumen-completely-transforms-the-visuals-of-satisfactory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upgraded to Unreal Engine 5 last year</a> with great visual benefits, has now been brought up to version 5.3 of Epic's engine. VRAM, NVIDIA DLSS/ AMD FSR, shadow rendering, level streaming, and actors in the world have all been optimized. Moreover, foliage will no longer be destroyed by vehicles as players drive through it, which not only saves a ton of computing power but also looks a lot better, according to the developers. Last but not least, dedicated servers won't be considered experimental anymore and have had a ton of bugs fixed.</p>
<p>These are just the highlights of Satisfactory Update 1.0. More detailed notes will be published closer to the September 10 launch.</p>
