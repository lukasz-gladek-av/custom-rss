            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-private-division-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Take-Two has sold off its indie label Private Division to an unknown buyer, citing a need to "focus [its] resources on growing [its] core and mobile businesses for the long-term".</p>

<p>In a set of <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/e938f73a-cfd7-46ac-b308-3f5b55acaeb7" rel="noopener" target="_blank">prepared remarks</a> accompanying Take-Two's latest financial results, company president Karl Slatoff says that the transaction involved the mystery buyer "purchas[ing Take-Two's] rights to substantially all of Private Division's live and unreleased titles".</p>

<p>It looks like Early Access action RPG&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/no-rest-for-the-wicked">No Rest for the Wicked</a></em>, which was released back in April,&nbsp;wasn't included in that transaction, though, because Slatoff says that Take-Two "will continue to support" the game. He concludes by thanking Private Division for its "contributions" to Take-Two.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/no-rest-for-the-wicked-take-two-private-division.jpg?itok=WqMTJJ-U 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/no-rest-for-the-wicked-take-two-private-division.jpg?itok=C1c891Eh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Private Division has been sold, but it looks like&nbsp;<em>No Rest for the Wicked&nbsp;</em>hasn't.</figcaption></figure><p>Private Division's fate has been uncertain for some time. When Take-Two <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs">laid off 5% of its workforce</a> back in April, a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-01/take-two-interactive-shuts-down-two-game-studios" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Bloomberg report</a> noted that many of the workers who would lose their jobs as part of that layoff wave were Private Division employees.</p>

<p>Later, in May, evidence began to pile up that Take-Two had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/intercept-games-shut-down-kerbal-space-program-2">shuttered the developers</a> of&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Rollerdrome</em>, both of which were games published by Private Division. Take-Two itself, however, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-denies-roll7-intercept-closure">denied shutting down those studios</a>.</p>

<p>Towards the end of that same month,&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake developer Bloober Team revealed that its partnership with Private Division for an upcoming new horror IP <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-private-division-end-partnership">had ended</a>, with Take-Two being the entity that terminated said partnership.</p>

<p>That game may well be new horror project&nbsp;<em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em>, which will now be self-published by Bloober Team. It's circumstantial, of course, but this could be more evidence that Private Division was in the process of being sold even then.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/private-division-take-two-kerbal-space-program.jpg?itok=O8GpP_LW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/private-division-take-two-kerbal-space-program.jpg?itok=QA7WCtgc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You may also know Private Division's name from<em>&nbsp;Kerbal Space Program</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>News of Private Division's sale comes as part of Take-Two's Q2 financial report, in which the company announces that net bookings have risen by 6% overall compared to last year.</p>

<p>According to Take-Two, this financial performance was mainly driven by "strength in the&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Borderlands&nbsp;</em>franchises", and that's without the release of&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025">due to arrive next year</a>.</p>

<p>You can see the rest of Take-Two's <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/ff9f9b55-43a5-4af5-ab54-13a77102d4b9" rel="noopener" target="_blank">financial report right here</a> if you're interested in the nerdy stats side of things. We don't yet know to whom Private Division was sold, but it's possible we'll find out in the coming weeks. Stay tuned.</p>

        <p>Still no GTA 6 PC announcement, however</p>

            <p>A few months ago, the rumour took root that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>'s release date would <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-release-date-could-slip-to-2026-under-rockstar-fallback-plan-according-to-reports">slip back from 2025 to 2026</a>. An anonymous insider averred that studio heads were "worried" about the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> game's progress - hence, perhaps, Rockstar's decision to mandate <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-reportedly-orders-gta-6-developers-to-end-hybrid-working-in-the-name-of-quality-and-polish">a full return to in-office work</a>. Pshaw, say publishers Take-Two CEO. They announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-grand-theft-auto-6-of-grand-theft-auto-6-likes-aka-grand-theft-auto-vi-is-coming-next-fall">a fall 2025 launch in March</a> and have just doubled down on it in <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/e938f73a-cfd7-46ac-b308-3f5b55acaeb7">their latest financial briefing</a>, with CEO Strauss Zelnick subsequently going on the tellybox to say that Take-Two are "highly confident in the timing", though he still has nothing to share about GTA 6 on PC.</p><!--more-->
<p>Asked how Take-Two work out a game's release timing by <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/05/17/take-two-ceo-on-gta-vi-release-upswing-in-mobile-gaming.html">CNBC</a>, Zelnick commented that "there are elements that you can actually measure, for example the number of bugs in a title, and every one of us will make sure we have as few bugs as possible before we launch.</p>
<p>"However, in the case of an extraordinary title, for which there are extraordinary expectations, it's not really about bugs," he went on. "It's about creating an experience that no one's seen before, and Rockstar Games seeks perfection in what they do. And perfection is indeed hard to measure, it really is more subjective than objective."</p>
<p>CNBC were not appeased by these scintillating philosophical <em>bon mots</em>. They pressed ahead, asking Zelnick how confident he was in the fall 2025 timing, given that it wasn't so long ago that Take-Two had GTA 6 pinned for 2025 at large.</p>
<p>"Well, there is slippage in the industry and we're not immune from that," Zelnick replied. "However, we narrowed the timing because we are highly confident in that timing."</p>
<p>Here's another GTA 6 release snippet by way of <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/take-two-interactive-sells-tales-of-the-shire-developer-private-division-strauss-zelnick-on-trump-election-1236202964/">Variety</a>, who had their own interview with Zelnick. In this latter chinwag, Zelnick commented that the game won't release at the same time as Borderlands 4, due between 1st April 2025 and 31st March 2026, because "it's safe to say that we wouldn't, and no one would, stack up huge releases unnecessarily." I think it's also safe to say that if it came to a conflict over launch windows, Borderlands 4 would be the one to make room.</p><p>The fall 2025 release only covers the game's console showing, of course. Take-Two have yet to spill the beans about the GTA 6 PC release date, but Zelnick did say in an earnings call last night that they're feeling pretty good about PC support in general.</p>
<p>"The audience is going to show up if you have great properties, so we just have to make sure to be on an array of platforms," he said, via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/grand-theft-auto/gta-6-publisher-says-it-isnt-complicated-for-us-to-support-pc-and-great-cool-so-wheres-that-gta-6-pc-announcement/">Gamesradar</a>. "If one platform diminishes in value, there's always another one.</p>
<p>"We're seeing great growth in PC right now, for example. I have been of the view that open formats would continue to grow and PC is an open format. I do think PC will continue to be a more and more important part of the console business going forward, and that isn't complicated for us to support at all. So the bottom line is, we are selective about which platforms we support. We make the tech work when we can make it work, as long as the audience is big enough to make that worthwhile."</p>

<p>If I had been present during that CNBC interview, I would have asked Zelnick what he thinks of the fact that GTA 5 players are obsessively trying to predict the next GTA 6 marketing beat <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-fans-desperate-for-an-october-reveal-are-convinced-rockstar-are-trolling-them">based on the phases of the moon</a>. This has blown up again on reddit lately because somebody's realised that the Tom Petty song from the GTA 6 trailer, above, has the words "wait for the moon" in it.</p><p>I would have asked about this in the few seconds before somebody spotted the rando Britisher lurking behind the green screen and phoned security. "TELL ME ABOUT THE MOON, STRAUSS," I would have bellowed, as huge men in tuxedos dragged me away into an unmarked van.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Take-Two has two big releases coming up next year, GTA 6 and Borderlands 4, and the CEO has just confirmed that both titles will not be released close to each other.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/take-two-interactive-sells-tales-of-the-shire-developer-private-division-strauss-zelnick-on-trump-election-1236202964/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick stated that they would not release GTA 6 and Borderlands 4 in the same period, even though they have similar release windows. When asked about this, Zelnick stated, “I think it’s safe to say that we wouldn’t, and no one would, stack up huge releases unnecessarily.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that GTA 6 is scheduled to release in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fall of 2025</a>, as confirmed during the latest earnings call, and Borderlands 4 has been announced for fiscal year 2026, which falls between April 1, 2025 and March 31, 2026. It is hard to figure out Take-Two’s release plans for both titles, but they could reserve 2025 for GTA 6 and let Borderlands 4 find its glory in 2026.&nbsp;We will have to wait for an official announcement to know for sure. </p>



<p>In the same interview, Zelnick also acknowledged the Borderlands movie’s disappointing run; however, he added that<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-says-borderlands-movie-disappointing-but-helped-sell-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> it helped sell more video games within the franchise</a>. Zelnick stated that they are still looking forward to more adaptations of their intellectual properties and have selectively licensed some of them. Currently, they have a deal pending on the ‘Bioshock’ adaptation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the Red Dead Redemption series has sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-series-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 92 million units</a>. Also, a new PGA Tour 2K title has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-pga-tour-2k-game-confirmed-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed for 2025</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-weapon-customization/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stalker-2-weapon-customization-lets-you-add-a-shotgun-to-a-sniper-rifle.1029732/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-weapon-customization/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Since the days of Army of Two, I’ve been a fan of weapon customization in video games. It’s satisfying to take a standard rifle or submachine gun, modify it to your liking, and make it a memorable weapon that remains with you throughout the story. In Stalker 2, weapon customization proves extensive, and you have many unique options—pistols, SMGs, sniper rifles, and even light machine guns.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-weapon-customization-like-in-stalker-2">What’s Weapon Customization Like in Stalker 2?</h2>



<p>Thanks to a recent gameplay trailer, ‘Smoking Barrels,’ we now better understand the weapon customization mechanics in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl. It appears GSC Game World borrowed plenty from past titles, including the weapon upgrade menu and mechanic, which is genuinely nice to see return. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl - Exclusive Smoking Barrels Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NAz3_4uvG0k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The trailer, which you can watch above in its entirety, showcases several unique weapons found across the Zone, along with customization, upgrade mechanics, and even jam and maintenance gameplay. According to the studio, we must account for our weapon’s cleanliness, ballistics, physics, and even the ammunition type we bring to each encounter.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-stalker-2-weapons-that-we-know-so-far">All Stalker 2 Weapons That We Know So Far</h2>



<p>In all, there are 35 weapons in Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl, ranging from early-game handguns to late-game machine guns and launchers. You’ll likely wind up with a favorite. I have my eye on the OTs-02 Kiparis for close-range encounters and the AS VAL for everything else, but I know many will opt for the HK416 for its modularity and accuracy.</p>

Another user, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1g7uo7s/if_you_want_a_say_in_what_you_opponent_plays/?chainedPosts=t3_1gkaiy0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bodeler</a>, pulled a Moltres ex, Rapidash, Charizard ex, Moltres ex, and Alakazam, again all in the incredibly rare alternate art forms. "I pooped," they said.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">God Packs definitely exist in Pokemon TCG Pocket!

Pulling five in one go will certainly speed this process along, however.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This has led many to desperately attempt to figure out if there's a hidden mechanic that can trigger god packs, though beyond the almost definitely not legitimate conspiracy theory about crinkled corners, it comes down to pure luck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Creatures Inc. has shared the actual odds behind these packs, however, which are officially just called Rare Packs. Players have a 0.05% of opening one, Pokémon TCG Pocket tells players, meaning a one in 2,000 chance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some friendly fellow players and some who are, dare we say, jealous, are urging those who shared their god pack pulls to also share their friend codes. Pokémon TCG Pocket features something called Wonder Pick, which lets players dip into others' packs and pull one of those cards, and the list of available packs can be pulled from the friend list.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This means that, if someone is friends with a player who opens a god pack, that secondary player may also get a taste. While Wonder Picks are often reserved to middling packs, leaving plenty of common cards on the table for the random one in five chance, god packs obviously guarantee <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-has-a-secret-mew-card-thats-not-super-difficult-to-get">an incredibly rare card</a> even at their weakest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon TCG Pocket arrived in October as a streamlined, digital version of the beloved trading card game. It has players opening packs, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-is-a-snazzy-way-to-carry-a-pokemon-card-binder-in-your-pocket">collecting cards</a>, building decks, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-players-love-farfetchd-and-theyre-absolutely-right">battling others;</a> a simple formula that's already proved popular given it made <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-early-days-but-pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-already-looks-like-a-smash-hit">$12 million in four days</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creatures Inc. is busy adding all sorts of events to the game, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-gets-first-pvp-event-today">a player versus player battle event released today, November 7</a>. This isn't quite a full competitive mode for Pokémon TCG Pocket but is certainly a step in that direction, and will certainly be the first proper competitive test of which decks are best, with both <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-battles-are-already-dominated-by-two-decks-in-particular">Mewtwo ex and Charizard ex having dominated so far</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Just like in the real world, you can find jobs to make a living while forming deep relationships through interactions. With a complete community simulation of every character acting on their free will, you can experience unexpected events to feel the various emotions life has to offer.

Developed using Unreal Engine 5, the game’s realistic graphics allows the players to let their imagination run free, with easy creation of different resources. Customize your character’s appearance and outfit and build your custom home using a wide selection of freely-movable furniture and structures. You can also adjust different parts of your property and surrounding roads as well as aspects of your residing city for a fully customizable experience.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Here is a message from producer and director Hyungjun “Kjun” Kim posted to the game’s official Discord server today:</p><blockquote><p>To <em>inZOI</em> fans around the world,</p><p>First, I want to express my sincerest gratitude to all of our fans. Your immense love and unwavering support mean everything to us. I was especially touched by the wonderful reception we received at gamescom. Seeing everyone create such unique Zois during our <em>inZOI: Character Studio</em> demo period was truly inspiring.</p><p>Initially, we were uncertain about introducing “Canvas” to the world, not knowing how many people would actually participate. However, the turnout was amazing, with an incredible amount of uploads. Seeing such engagement brought us so much happiness, and it was inspiring to see how deeply people connected with <em>inZOI</em>. Your response and feedback made us realize the responsibility we have to provide players with the most complete experience possible.</p><p>This message is about that realization. After reviewing your feedback from <em>inZOI: Character Studio</em> and analyzing a wealth of data from our various play tests, we have made our decision to release <em>inZOI</em> in Early Access on March 28, 2025. We apologize that we could not bring you the game sooner, but this decision reflects our commitment to giving <em>inZOI</em> the best possible start.</p><p>It is said that among primates, raising a human child to adulthood takes the longest time because humans must be prepared to endure and adapt to their ever-changing surroundings. The extra love and care that is required to properly nurture a child is how I see our journey with <em>inZOI</em>—a game that we will be nurturing together from its Early Access birth. This change in our release date represents our dedication to giving <em>inZOI</em> a stronger foundation, so we can embark on this journey together in the best way possible.</p><p>Until the release date, we’ll continue to improve areas that need attention, striving to create a game that truly captures the essence of life simulation. Our goal is to deliver an experience fans can enjoy for years to come. We’ll keep you updated on our development progress, and we hope you’ll continue to join us on this journey towards <em>inZOI</em>‘s Early Access and beyond. Thank you.</p><p>With love,<br>Kjun</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/inZOI-EA_11-07-24_Art.jpg"></a></figure></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, Hello Games has released a long-awaited feature for No Man's Sky: cross-save. The small developer said it was a huge undertaking, but it was one of the most requested features from the community.</p>
<p>Adding the ability to transfer saves between platforms via a server was particularly challenging for No Man's Sky, as the workload increases with each platform supported and the length of time people have been playing. Hello Games found that many players had accumulated thousands of hours in their saves, which inevitably made it more complicated for them to implement this feature. For these reasons, they have slowly worked on the technology needed for the cross-save update for over six months.</p>
<p>The rollout begins now with a small number of players. Starting today, all No Man's Sky players can link their different accounts <a href="https://cloud.nomanssky.com/cross-save" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at this URL</a>. A subset of players will then be able to select their saves from multiple devices on the in-game save screen. Over the coming weeks, all players will be invited to do so.</p>
<p>Thanks to cross-save, players can play on their console from the comfort of their sofa, continue one of the game's Expeditions on the move with the Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck, build an incredible base on their powerful PC rig, and then view it in incredibly immersive virtual reality. No Man's Sky now supports cross-play and cross-save across the following platforms: PC, PlayStation 4 &amp; Xbox One and Series X/S, Game Pass, GOG, Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, PlayStation VR 1 &amp; 2 and PC VR.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/No-Mans-Sky-Normany-Screen-2-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>That's not all, as today's update marks the return of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-comes-to-no-mans-sky/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collaboration with BioWare's Mass Effect franchise</a> on N7 Day. Starting today and for the next two weeks, No Man's Sky players are getting another chance to meet the SSV Normandy SR1 in a reworked version of the original mission and add it to their collection.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inzoi-release-date-delayed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sims-like-life-sim-inzoi-gets-early-access-release-date-for-next-year.1029681/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inzoi-release-date-delayed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton has announced the Early Access release date for its upcoming life sim&nbsp;<em>inZoi</em>, but there's some bad news if you were hoping for the game to launch in 2024.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1162040845181124618/1207578601008926791/1303969784550920273" rel="noopener" target="_blank">message on the game's official Discord server</a>, director Hyungjun Kim, also known as "Kjun", announces that the&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>release date is March 28th. He then apologizes that the team wasn't able to "bring you the game sooner", but that the delay is necessary to give&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>"the best possible start".</p>

<p>Kjun goes on to say that the response to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sims-like-inzoi-character-creator-tool">its character creator test</a>, as well as its trial of user-generated content platform Canvas, was "amazing", and that seeing "such engagement" led the team to realize the responsibility it has to "provide players with the most complete experience possible".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/inzoi-release-date-delay-parents.jpg?itok=8QxpY1-n 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/inzoi-release-date-delay-parents.jpg?itok=lswu4biy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>will be arriving in March next year.</figcaption></figure><p>Technically speaking, this announcement constitutes a delay; back in October, Kjun himself <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/life-sim-inzoi-is-still-set-to-release-in-early-access-this-year-krafton-confirms/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">confirmed to PC Gamer</a> that&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>was scheduled to launch sometime in 2024.</p>

<p>When it does arrive,&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>will be one of a rapidly-dwindling handful of competitors to EA's titanic&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>, which essentially currently stands unopposed in its niche (and which isn't going to be getting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sims-like-inzoi-character-creator-tool">a new numbered mainline entry</a> any time soon).</p>

<p>Paradox was working on a&nbsp;<em>Sims</em>&nbsp;competitor by the name of&nbsp;<em>Life by You</em>, but the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-paradoxs-sims-competitor-has-been-cancelled">canceled back in June</a>, causing the studio's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-profits-life-by-you-canceled">profits to nosedive</a>&nbsp;as a result.</p>

<p>Perhaps the only other major rival to&nbsp;<em>The Sims&nbsp;</em>that's currently in development is&nbsp;<em>Paralives</em>, which is currently scheduled for an Early Access release sometime next year as well (assuming it doesn't get delayed, of course).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/paralives-sims-competitor-inzoi.jpg?itok=AXlsPpfQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/paralives-sims-competitor-inzoi.jpg?itok=udFgfEJV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Paralives&nbsp;</em>is one of the only competitors to&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>, and, indeed,&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>as well.</figcaption></figure><p>As for&nbsp;<em>inZoi</em>, Krafton describes it as a "deep and detailed simulation" in which you can build houses, customize characters, and watch people live their lives according to your whims, just like in&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>.</p>

<p><em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>is due to land on PC via Steam Early Access on March 28th. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wishlist it here</a> if you want to keep up with its progress.</p>

The existing Priority membership is <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-performance-membership">being renamed to Performance</a>, with 1440p streaming, ultrawide resolution support, and the ability to save graphics settings across streaming sessions. Nvidia is also introducing a 100-hour monthly playtime cap for new Performance or Ultimate GeForce Now members starting on January 1st, 2025.</p><p>New GeForce Now members that sign up for the service from 2025 onward will have a cap on monthly playtime set at 100 hours. That works out to around three hours of usage every day of the month, and Nvidia says it’s putting the cap in place to avoid increasing membership prices “in the foreseeable future.”</p><div><figcaption><em>The GeForce Now membership options.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nvidia</cite></p></div><p>“This allows GeForce Now to continue to provide unparalleled quality and speed — as well as short to no queue times&nbsp;— for all paid members, without increasing membership fees,” says Nvidia in a blog post. “This change will affect less than 6 percent of members.”</p><p>While this cap will only initially impact new GeForce Now members, all active paid subscribers as of the end of this year will still lose their unlimited playtime on January 1st, 2026. After that date, all GeForce Now subscribers will be subjected to the 100-hour playtime cap.</p><div><figcaption><em>You’ll be able to track your playtime in Nvidia’s dashboard.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nvidia</cite></p></div><p>GeForce Now subscribers will be able to carry over 15 hours of unused time automatically to the next month, but if you hit the 100-hour cap, then you’ll need to purchase additional playtime or play using the Basic rigs for the remainder of the month. GeForce Now subscribers will be able to purchase 15 hours of extra playtime, with the Performance 15-hour blocks priced at $2.99 and the Ultimate 15-hour playtime priced at $5.99.</p><p>Nvidia is also offering a 25 percent discount on Ultimate and Performance day passes until November 22nd, which you can then upgrade to a monthly or six-month recurring membership to lock in a full year of unlimited playtime ahead of the 100-hour playtime caps for existing members in 2026.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/life-simulator-inzoi-early-access-release-date-announced/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Life simulator inZOI is heading to Early Access. In a message on the game’s Discord server on Thursday, director and producer Hyungjun “Kjun” Kim announced that inZOI Early Access will launch on March 28, 2025.</p>



<p>The new date <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">moves the game</a> out of the original late-2024 Early Access timeline. </p>



<p>Kim started his message by thanking players for taking part in the Character Studio demo over the summer, and saying that the reception was more than he or the team could’ve expected. </p>



<p>“Seeing so much engagement brought us immense happiness, and it was inspiring to see how deeply people connected with inZOI,” he said. </p>



<p>When the Character Studio was available, over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-character-creator-shows-players-are-ready-for-sims-competitor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">19,000 concurrent players</a> created over 100,000 characters. With that response and feedback, it gave Kim and the studio the insight needed to provide players with “the most complete experience possible”.</p>



<p>“It’s said that among primates, raising a human child to adulthood takes the longest time because humans must be prepared to endure and adapt to their ever-changing surroundings,” Kim said. “The extra love and care required to nurture a child to adulthood is how I see our journey with inZOI—a game that we will be nurturing together from its Early Access birth. </p>



<p>“This change in our release date reflects our commitment to building a stronger foundation for inZOI, so we can embark on this journey in the best way possible.”</p>



<p>Kim closed by saying the team’s goal is to “deliver an experience fans can enjoy for a long time to come”.</p>



<p>Recently, Insider Gaming sat down with Kim&nbsp;to talk about inZOI about the game’s development, his goals, and more. Stay tuned for that in the near future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-games-should-you-play-first-on-nintendo-switch-2/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>You’ll play whatever is brand-new, launching alongside the Nintendo Switch 2 whenever the system finally releases, right? But what about past titles? I don’t know about you, but I have zero intention of tossing aside my old system or games, so I’d like to get additional playtime from them, even with a new console generation in hand. So, here are a few games you should play first on Nintendo Switch 2!</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible">Is The Nintendo Switch 2 Backwards Compatible?</h2>



<p>Following official confirmation that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-backwards-compatible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 offers backward compatibility</a> for Nintendo Switch titles, I thought it would be fun to look at a few of the top games of the current generation. They’ll surely carry forward, with fun gameplay and adequate graphics, even though competition will be stiff with an entirely new series of launch games.</p>



<p>Here’s what Nintendo’s Furukawa said about the upcoming system:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This is Furukawa. At today’s Corporate Management Policy Briefing, we announced that Nintendo Switch software will also be playable on the successor to Nintendo Switch. Nintendo Switch Online will be available on the successor to Nintendo Switch as well. Further information about the successor to Nintendo Switch, including its compatibility with Nintendo Switch, will be announced at a later date.</p>
</blockquote>







<h2 id="h-what-backwards-compatible-games-should-you-play-on-nintendo-switch-2">What Backwards Compatible Games Should You Play on Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>



<p>Since the idea here is to ensure all Nintendo Switch titles work on the Nintendo Switch 2, on day one, we’ll have a massive library of games to choose from, along with anything new coming out for the successor system. But instead of speculating about what’s to come, let’s look back toward the top games on the Nintendo Switch that you’ll want to play on Nintendo Switch 2:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Stardew Valley</strong></li>



<li><strong>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dragon Quest 11 S: Echoes of an Elusive Age</strong></li>



<li><strong>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hollow Knight</strong></li>



<li><strong>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</strong></li>



<li><strong>Octopath Traveler 2</strong></li>



<li><strong>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</strong></li>



<li><strong>Pokemon Legends: Arceus</strong></li>
</ol>



<p>Honestly? We could continue listing exceptional Nintendo Switch titles until the list hits the triple digits. But for now, these ten titles prove time-consuming and extraordinary in their own ways.</p>



<p>If you have any suggestions for exciting Nintendo Switch games anyone should check out on Nintendo Switch 2, let us know in the comments below. You can also visit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forum</a> to discuss the Nintendo Switch 2 with hyped-up fans!</p>



<hr>



<p>Of course, the list of Nintendo Switch games continuously grows with each passing month. Not long ago, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-mystery-dungeon-red-rescue-team-arrives-for-nintendo-switch-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we received Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team</a>!</p>

We don't know for sure, but Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick is not losing sleep over it.</p><p>During <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/11/06/take-two-interactive-software-ttwo-q2-2025-earning/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Take-Two's latest earnings call</a>, Zelnick was asked about the Series S being, by design, a lower-spec console compared to Series X and PS5. GTA VI is expected to be a boundary-pushing game technically speaking, prompting concerns by some that it won't be a great experience on the console.</p><p>"Look, we support the platforms where the consumers are for as long as they're there, and we find a way to support platforms despite different levels of tech. Our labels are really good at that. I'm not really worried," Zelnick said.</p><p>The executive went on to say, "If one platform diminishes in value, there's always another one. So we're seeing great growth in PC right now, for example."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1544660162" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

Many are wondering if GTA VI will come to PC, and Zelnick's commentary here sounds like it's possible, but of course it's not confirmed yet.</p><p>"The bottom line is we are selective about which platforms we support. We make the tech work when we can make it work as long as the audience is big enough to make that worthwhile," he said.</p><p>A former Rockstar developer claimed that if a PC edition of GTA VI is coming, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-rockstar-dev-explains-why-gta-6-pc-port-isnt-coming-at-launch/1100-6519893/" data-ref-id="1100-6519893">it won't launch alongside the console editions.</a> This would be in keeping with tradition, as GTA V's PC version didn't come out until April 2015, almost two years after the game first arrived on PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2013.</p><p>The PC version of Red Dead Redemption II came out about a year after the game debuted on PS4 and Xbox One. For the first Red Dead, the PC edition was only just released in late October 2024, some 14 years after the game launched for Xbox 360 and PS3.</p><p>The analyst's question about GTA VI running on Series S came against the backdrop of ongoing commentary regarding the performance differences between the Series X and Series S. Quite a few game developers from across the industry have commented on the Series S console's relative lack of power and how developers needing to support this system might be doing themselves a disservice. In the case of Baldur's Gate 3,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-in-development-for-xbox-but-theres-a-series-s-snag/1100-6511819/" data-ref-id="1100-6511819"> issues with the Series S edition held back the game's overall release on Xbox.</a></p><p>Stalker 2 developer GSC Game World, meanwhile, said it originally believed bringing the game to Series S was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2-dev-originally-thought-bringing-game-to-xbox-series-s-was-impossible/1100-6527193/" data-ref-id="1100-6527193">"impossible" due to the technical limitations of the console.</a></p><p>The Series S had outsold the Series X in the US since the systems debuted in 2020, but that's no longer the case, as the Series X now <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/september-2024-sales-charts-xbox-series-x-is-finally-outselling-the-series-s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">accounts for 51% of all Series X and S consoles sold stateside</a>. The Series S was more widely available than the Series X during 2020-2022 due to supply-chain issues amidst the pandemic, and this was one of the elements that played a role in the Series S jumping out to an early lead over its more expensive and more powerful sibling. By the end of the Series X|S generation, however, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-s-expected-to-outsell-series-x-according-to-xboxs-phil-spencer/1100-6483412/" data-ref-id="1100-6483412">Microsoft believes the Series S will outperform the Series X due to its lower price.</a></p><p>GTA VI is set for release in Fall 2025, a window that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-is-still-on-track-for-fall-2025-release/1100-6527618/" data-ref-id="1100-6527618">Take-Two re-committed to as part of the company's latest earnings presentation.</a></p>

Even Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick knows the "film was disappointing," but there is a silver lining: The action flick led to an uptick in Borderlands video game sales.</p><p dir="ltr">During a company earnings call, Zelnick touched on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-movie-has-earned-a-shockingly-low-amount-after-first-month/1100-6526440/" data-ref-id="1100-6526440">the Borderlands movie, which earned a shockingly low amount of money after a month</a> in theaters. "Even though the film was disappointing, it actually benefited our catalog sales. So that is a sign that making a movie or a television show based on our very high-quality IP can drive catalog sales, and that can be a good thing," said Zelnick.</p><div tabindex="0"

            <p>Over 60 classic Sega games are being delisted from digital stores, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crazy-taxi">Crazy Taxi</a>, Golden Axe and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jet-set-radio">Jet Set Radio</a>.</p>
<p>Starting on 6th December at 11:59pm PST (so, 7.59am on 7th December, for those of us in the UK), the affected games will no longer be available to purchase. Of course, if you already have a game in your library, it will remain available to download and play as and when.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://support.sega.com/hc/en-us/articles/29776767664145-SEGA-Classics-FAQ#h_01JBWBC4E7NJ9WH4TKAZXJK27N">FAQ</a>, Sega noted select individual classic titles will remain playable for those among us who have a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. No explanation was given for why these changes are being made. Eurogamer has contacted Sega for more.</p>

<p>As for what's still in store for Sega, its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-new-crazy-taxi-game-will-be-open-world-and-massively-multiplayer">Crazy Taxi reboot will be an open-world, massively-multiplayer game</a>, which the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/segas-new-crazy-taxi-game-aaa-in-scope">developer said is "AAA" in scope</a>.</p>
<p>This project was one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-announces-flurry-of-projects-including-jet-set-radio-crazy-taxi">five fresh titles in classic franchises announced last December</a>, alongside new entries in the Jet Set Radio, Shinobi, Golden Axe and Streets of Rage.</p></div>

Once again, this was a PlayStation console exclusive, with a PC release, and—rather bizarrely considering—inclusion in Game Pass For PC.

In promotion of the event, Netflix released the first two episodes of the three-part docuseries <em>Countdown: Paul vs. Tyson,</em> showing a behind-the-scenes look at the lead-up to the bout. It didn’t take long before Paul was knocked out by Tyson...sort of.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195891" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Alan Wake 2" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="156" data-playlist="195891,196196,196452" data-current="195891"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Alan Wake 2</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21406.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Within the first six minutes of the docuseries, before we see more than 10 seconds of Paul throwing punches—and after watching Tyson pummel his trainer’s protective vest—we see Paul endure a fate he’s too young to have seen anyone else suffer: blowing on a <em>Mike Tyson’s Punch-Out</em> NES cartridge, hoping it will work. He unironically remarks that his failed attempts to tap the rust off of the ancient console to play the game “teaches you gratitude, kids, for the consoles we have today,” as if his life experiences are that far removed from the children he addresses. After a few bangs, TV screen taps, and surely some silent prayers to the Nintendo gods, the game starts, and Paul quickly experiences a simulation of what will likely happen when he steps into the real ring with the real Tyson—Iron Mike is nothing to fuck with.</p><p>The first taste of digital Tyson’s overpowered uppercut makes Paul acknowledge he needs to improve his speed and reaction time just before he lets out a frustrated yell after Tyson’s first-round knockout. Then, he was knocked out again. And again. And again. Paul intimated in the episode that Tyson’s boxing prowess only exists to his generation in the myth-building knockout compilations on YouTube, underscoring the generational divide that both makes this fight unnecessary and intriguing. <em>Punch-Out </em>gave him a small taste of just how unbeatable Tyson was in his prime—and maybe a glimpse into his future.</p><p><em>Punch-Out </em>was released in America in October 1987, two months after he became the youngest undisputed heavyweight champion, boasting a 31-0 record and striking fear in boxers trained to destroy people. He was a nightmare in the ring; <em>Punch-Out </em>made him a terror in everyone’s lives. The speed of his punches in the game were coupled with an infamously dangerous upper cut that was almost always a surefire knockout. People <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.espn.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=3729473&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.espn.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=3729473" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">videotaped themselves</a></span> beating Tyson just to prove to people they did it, like they were trying to prove Big Foot exists.

The baddest man on the planet was once the hardest boss to beat in a game.</p><p>Admittedly, 58-year-old Tyson is a Jake Paul lifetime removed from his former boxing dominance and had to postpone this very fight with Paul after a health scare. While Gen Z and younger generations’ thirst for idol dismantling is palpable, there are older crowds who’ll watch the petulant troublemaker struggle to escape the first round in <em>Punch-Out</em> and hope real-life Tyson can duplicate his video game exploits one last time to give Paul the knockout he deserves. </p><p>The final <em>Countdown</em> episode streams on Netflix on November 12. <em>Countdown </em>narrator (and serial check chaser) Ice-T asks a question in the docuseries that kept repeating in my mind while watching Paul struggle against <em>Punch-Out </em>Tyson: “Why are both of them here demanding our attention at all?”</p><p>No matter the answer, I just wish they didn’t. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Not so, according to Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick. Speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/take-two-interactive-sells-tales-of-the-shire-developer-private-division-strauss-zelnick-on-trump-election-1236202964/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, Zelnick said that while he couldn’t offer a release date for GTA 6, the guaranteed megahit won’t cross paths with Borderlands 4. “I think it’s safe to say that we wouldn’t, and no one would, stack up huge releases unnecessarily,” Zelnick said.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">99 Details in the GTA 6 Trailer - Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What does this mean for Borderlands 4’s release date? Well, in order for it to get out of the way of GTA 6 (assuming GTA 6 does indeed release fall 2025), and to fit in with the next fiscal year, it would either have to launch in the April to June 2025 quarter or the January to March 2026 quarter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If GTA 6 does release at some point between September and December next year, Take-Two will probably want at least a three-month gap between it and Borderlands 4, forcing Borderlands 4 into late spring to early summer 2025, or late winter to early spring 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 won’t be the only game desperate to avoid being dragged into the black hole GTA 6 creates within the video game industry. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a>, in development at 2K's Hangar 13, is also due out at some point in 2025. Then there are all the big games coming from other publishers. GTA 6 will probably be the biggest video game launch of all time, so no other game is safe from its gravitational pull. Even the might of Call of Duty, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-reportedly-a-black-ops-2-sequel-set-around-2030">set to launch yet another premium iteration around October or November 2025</a>, will be sorely tested by GTA 6.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Borderlands 4 Concept Art - PAX West 2024</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In other Take-Two news, the company has sold indie publisher Private Division to an unknown buyer in the wake of shuttering Roll7 and Intercept Games, saying it wants to focus on its core and mobile businesses going forward.

Kojima Productions (Death Stranding) will continue to connect more and more players around the world, so please stay tuned.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Death Stranding Director’s Cut challenges players to reconnect a fractured society after the cataclysmic ‘Death Stranding’ event. This has opened a doorway between the living and the dead, leading to creatures from the afterlife roaming the fallen world marred by a desolate society. Carrying the disconnected remnants of humanity’s future in his hands, players take the role of Sam Bridges as he embarks on a mission to deliver hope to humanity by connecting the last survivors of a decimated America.</blockquote><blockquote>Director’s Cut is the definitive experience which also introduces a new ‘Ruined Factory’ location, a treacherous underground compound packed with fresh dangers. Sam also now has a wealth of new delivery assists, from cargo catapults and ramps, to a stabiliser which features thrusters that assist with cargo weight shifts and reduce the impact of landing when jumping from high areas. Melee combat has been amped up with the addition of more moves including a drop kick, whilst the new Maser Gun can stun enemies and short-circuit vehicles temporarily with electricity. Finding the perfect weapon loadout is now achievable thanks to the new firing range location, whilst the new Racetrack enables players to race and compete in time-attack competitions against other players who are connected online. Protagonist Sam Bridges can even ride Buddy Bots to traverse the wastelands with greater ease.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a busy time for Kojima and for Death Stranding. Its sequel, Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, is due out as a Sony-published PS5 exclusive in 2025, and a movie based on the first game is in the works. Elsewhere, Kojima is working on OD for Xbox Game Studios, and Physint for Sony Interactive Entertainment. Could Death Stranding's launch on Xbox signal an eventual Xbox release for Death Stranding 2 further down the line?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Roblox will make further changes to how its large audience of children interact with others on the platform, in response to growing safety fears. 
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/updating-experience-guideline-policies-to-keep-our-younger-users-safe/3249079">latest steps</a> include a ban on users aged under 13 being able to access social hangout experiences in Roblox, beginning later this month. Additionally, though not until December, children will be blocked from seeing or playing experiences that have not been rated for their content.
</p>
<p>
Roblox says the change to kids being allowed into social hangout experiences will help "address user behaviour that can potentially pose a risk to our youngest users". 
</p>
<p>
In July, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-reported-13316-instances-of-child-exploitation-last-year">Bloomberg report highlighted the 13,316 instances of child exploitation</a> reported on Roblox in 2023 alone, and that two dozen people had been arrested for abusing minors following contact in Roblox. The following month, short-selling firm Hindenberg Research published further examples designed to highlight Roblox's failure to keep children safe, in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/damning-roblox-report-claims-company-inflates-player-numbers-to-investors-by-as-much-as-42">report which labelled the platform as an "X-rated paedophile hellscape"</a> rife with "grooming, pornography, violent content and extremely abusive speech". 
</p><p>
Roblox responded to that report by calling it "simply misleading", but last month <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-announces-policy-changes-for-pre-teen-users-amid-ongoing-accusations-of-child-safety-failures">announced plans to require parental permission for children under the age of 13 to access chat features by default</a>. Kids under nine will also need permission to play experiences rated with a maturity rating of "moderate". 
</p>
<p>
Now, children will be further restricted from accessing social hangouts - which Roblox describes as "things like vibe games, clubs, socialising and supportive spaces where the primary theme or purpose of the experience is to communicate (e.g. in text or voice chat) with other users as yourself" - as well as in "free-form user creation" where users can draw in 2D or write without this text going through Roblox moderation. 
</p>
<p>
From 3rd December, unrated experiences will become "unplayable, unsearchable, and undiscoverable by users under the age of 13", Roblox wrote, though users will still be able to access them via a direct link. 
</p>
<p>
For now, creators are being asked to rate experiences themselves, with enforcement beginning properly in 2025. In future, rating experiences will be "closely integrated" into the publishing process, Roblox said. 
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-hit-dress-to-impress-removes-hotdog-outfit-after-players-use-it-to-dress-up-like-male-genitalia">Roblox viral hit Dress to Impress removed a Halloween hotdog costume</a>, after players began using it to cosplay as male genitalia.
