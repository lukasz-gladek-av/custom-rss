<figure data-uuid="3b4f84884ee95"><a title="THE OPEN WORLD" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3b4f84884ee95/the-open-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We may only be a few months into a shiny, new <strong>Mario Kart</strong> game with lush open worlds and challenges aplenty, but as I scrap it out in yet another Knockout Tour or pootle about for P Switches and Peach Coins, I can’t help but yearn for something a little more familiar.</p>
<p>It’s a sentiment shared by many, if social media is to be believed. Why not take a break to go back to a Mario Kart game where every course is a set track? A Mario Kart game I know and love? The most recent home console Mario Kart before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> rode into town? No, not that one.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_live_home_circuit">Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit</a> turns five today and is technically Nintendo’s most recent home iteration of its behemoth franchise prior to World. I have many fond memories of this curious mixed reality experience. I’ve spent hours careening around my house through Mario’s eyes, zipping through makeshift tunnels under the sofa, dodging my children’s feet as they give chase, giggling with my wife whenever one of them would pick up Mario and plant a kiss on his nose - all blown up on the television in real time.</p>
<p>But as I fire it up again, I’m struck by an option presented to me on the home screen, an option I haven’t experienced in nearly half a decade of ownership of this game. Multiplayer. This seems mad to me. Mario Kart is, after all, the quintessential couch co-op experience. How could I have overlooked this entry in the series?</p>
<p>Quite easily, as it happens. Home Circuit is in last place when it comes to sales for the series, managing less than 2 million worldwide. And come to think of it, I’m not sure I <em>actually know</em> anybody else who owns it.</p>
<figure data-uuid="d7e18daf8c77f"><a title="TWO KARTS" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d7e18daf8c77f/two-karts.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Can we make this mixed reality dream a mixed reality reality? — <em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I need to fix this. I need to organise an all-tracks, all-in Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit Grand Prix.</p>
<h2><strong>The starting line</strong></h2>
<p>The game supports up to four players, so four players is what we’ll shoot for. My first thought is to sound out the folks who were mad enough to play through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/death-by-a-thousand-karts-can-we-race-all-96-mario-kart-8-deluxe-tracks-in-a-single-session">every single Mario Kart 8 track in one evening</a> with me last year.</p>
<p>There are a few 'No's: Matt is otherwise engaged, Alfie now lives on the south coast, and Tom lives in Australia - clearly, Tom found the experience the most harrowing. <strong>Jonny</strong> and <strong>Mitchell</strong>, however, are stupid enough to agree.</p>
<p>They’ll need karts. A quick eBay reveals that the physical toys needed to play the game are very reasonably priced these days. I get a Luigi in box for £50 and a Mario &amp; Luigi together (albeit with no box, chargers or gates) for £45! You only need one set of gates, so this is an absolute steal - and a great Christmas present if you’ve got a Mario Kart enthusiast who’s never tried it.</p>
<p>They turn up at my door a couple of days before the event, and in the interim, I get a few more ‘Yes’s - including a face that may be familiar to long-time Nintendo Life readers. But more on that later.</p>

<figure data-uuid="6e1b78f637295"><a title="Mario &amp; Luigi Mario Kart live" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6e1b78f637295/mario-and-luigi-mario-kart-live.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I ask everyone to download the free game software so we’ll be ready to go on the day. We have the karts, we have the players, we have the game; now we need the venue. My last Mario Kart was a standard living room affair, but an event like this demands something a little more <em>theatrical.</em></p>
<p>Those who know me know that I have a background in the performing arts, and I’m still in touch with some of the lovely folks at the Watford Palace Theatre. As it happens, they have just opened up some new spaces nearby and are happy to accommodate our strange request in their Workshop Studio. It’s a big space with a wooden floor and nothing in the way - a proper blank canvas. It’s perfect.</p>
<p>Until I realise it’s a blank canvas. We need tracks. There are 10 Grand Prix to play through, each consisting of three races, which means I need to design 30 tracks. In two days. And I have <em>nothing.</em></p>
<p>A wave of panic hits. I bust out the squared paper and begin drawing huge pixel images - a mushroom, a flower, a star. It’s taking hours, and I’m not sure it’ll work. My wife finds me hunched over the sketch pad - gnawing at the pencil in my hands.</p>
<p><em>“Why don’t you just use tracks from the games?” She asks.<br>
“Because they’re massive - I don’t know how I’d even do that.”<br>
“What, even those old ones?”</em></p>
<p>I pause. Stinging sensation of calling something from my childhood ‘old’ aside, she’s made a great point. The SNES tracks are pretty pint-sized creations, but packed with tight corners, narrow passages, shortcuts. There are some pretty iconic ones, too! Even showing up in World here and there. It’s a great idea!</p>

<p><em>“Thanks, love! Speaking of, do you want to play it for a bit now?”<br>
“I think you should probably get your plan ready.”<br>
“Fine.”</em></p>
<p>Spoilsport. Completely correct spoilsport.</p>
<p>I pull top-down images of all the tracks from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_kart">Super Mario Kart</a> and place them under a pixel grid. It’ll work well in regard to planning it out, but how am I going to size it? What am I going to use to create it? I think of genuine go-karting and the big rubber tyres that line the tracks. Big, cylindrical objects with a bit of give. And it hits me. Toilet paper. No, I was not on the toilet at the time.</p>
<p>Looking at my little Mario (again, not on the toilet, not a euphemism), I see he’s about two toilet rolls wide - that’s what I’m going to make my track out of. Perfectly placed pixel toilet rolls. I’ll make the tracks all four rolls wide to accommodate two racers going neck and neck and we can widen and squeeze where necessary to facilitate some overtaking and hot pursuit.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8f2bec1cf5ec4"><a title="TRACK PLANNING" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8f2bec1cf5ec4/track-planning.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Yes, each of those dots is a toilet roll — <em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are 20 Super Mario Kart tracks in all. I couple this with the pixel images I’ve already created (a giant recreation of each of the cup names) and we have our 30. Everything is in place for the big race.</p>
<h2><strong>Shopping karts</strong></h2>
<p>I set off for the venue with four little cars in the boot of my car. I call up Jonny on the way.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “Hello, have you got much toilet paper?”<strong><br>
Jonny:</strong> “I have <em>some</em> toilet paper? Why?”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “I’m going to pick some up to make the tracks with, I don’t suppose you have one of those big boxes of 48?”<strong><br>
Jonny:</strong> “I’m sorry, did you say 48? I don’t think you fathom how much toilet paper that is.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “We get 48 at home. It’s not that much. It’s fine - we can grab some when I pick you up.”</p>
<figure data-uuid="32a42377e292c"><a title="JON AND KART" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/32a42377e292c/jon-and-kart.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Just when you thought you'd seen the last of him, it's Jon Kart-wright! — <em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Not long after this call, I pick up our first volunteer for this herculean event, it’s none other than former Nintendo Lifer, current <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-CrwNynzNnOz4F9nVfxvkw">Good Vibes Gamer</a> <strong>Jon Cartwright</strong>! And he’s packing a spare Mario Kart, too. What a gent.</p>
<p>As Jon climbs into the car, he spots a bag of zip ties in the back seat.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “It’s normal - don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p>Fully accepting of this, Jon (henceforth <strong>JC</strong>) climbs in and a short while later we pick up Jonny (<strong>JB</strong>) before heading to a big old supermarket. Checking my pixel creations, I know the larger tracks need over 150 rolls to complete them, so we pick up 8 bags of 24 rolls.</p>
<p>Now, I don’t know if you’ve ever had a big shopping trolley stuffed to the absolute brim with literally nothing but toilet roll, but I don’t mind telling you that it gets some odd looks.</p>
<p><strong>JC:</strong> “You just got the best side eye from that man.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “Do you think it would be weird to tell him that we don’t have diarrhoea?”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> “That will make it look and sound even more like you do.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “I didn’t fathom how much toilet roll this would be.”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> “You did not.”</p>
<p>Hauling the toilet paper back to the car and stuffing ourselves in alongside it, I start to break down the day.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “I figure each race will only be a couple of minutes. If we can build quickly and allocate 20 mins to each Grand Prix, that’s three and a bit hours. We’ve got the room for four hours - so that gives us a bit of leeway.”</p>
<p>I acknowledge the plan is ambitious, but I think it’s achievable. We arrive at the Palace and the construction begins.</p>
<h2><strong>Game Building Garage</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="a83658163f182"><a title="THE PLAYERS" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a83658163f182/the-players.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>From left to right, Alex, Mitchell, Janek, Artie, Ossie, JC, JB, and George crouching at the front for some reason — <em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Joining JB, JC, Mitchell, and myself this time are <strong>Alex</strong>, <strong>Janek</strong>, <strong>Artie</strong>, and <strong>Ossie</strong>. This gives us four teams of two and we pair up respectively, but not before setting to work to bring our first course, <strong>Mario Circuit 1</strong>, to life.</p>
<p>I’ve had the idea to tether some of the toilet rolls together to make runs of three, four, and five to speed up the building. While the rest of the team makes this work, I get the karts online. Well, I try.</p>

<p><strong>George:</strong> “No! A tutorial! I need to do a tutorial for these switches.”<strong><br>
JC:</strong> “I’m on it.”</p>
<p>Jon grabs a switch and we rattle through the intricacies of ‘pressing A to go’ and ‘pressing X to honk’, amongst others.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “Why can you not skip this?!”<strong><br>
JC:</strong> “It’s agony.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “Oh my god, they want us to make a track now? I just want to play!”</p>
<p>By the time we have set up the karts, we are already 25 minutes behind. But <strong>Mario Circuit 1</strong> is laid out in front of us. Look at it. It’s glorious. Bring on the mushroom cup, it’s time to race!</p>
<figure data-uuid="f309c59a3b0c2"><a title="MARIO CIRCUIT 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f309c59a3b0c2/mario-circuit-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>MARIO CIRCUIT 1! — <em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2><strong>Mushroom cup: On your marks, get set, faff!</strong></h2>
<p>Except it isn’t. At the start of each track you’ve designed, player one has got to drive through gates one to four in order to establish the actual track for everyone else. No big deal. The track is done, to the starting grid, everyone! Let’s-a-</p>
<p><strong>Jon:</strong> “I can’t start?”<strong><br>
Mitchell:</strong> “Yeah, me neither.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> "You just press ‘X’ when you’re facing the gate.”<strong><br>
Mitchell:</strong> “No, it won’t let me.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “You need to be looking at the gate.”<strong><br>
Mitchell:</strong> “I am - look!”</p>
<p>Mitchell’s Mario is indeed staring down Gate One. What’s going on? What we hadn’t bargained on is the game having a very specific idea about where it wants each player to start, with little floating discs their kart should be on. The trouble is, on our tight little course, this is basically <em>on top</em> of other racers.</p>
<p>Some of us manage to hit 'X', but if we then accidentally tap 'A' or get nudged as someone else is trying to get started, it undoes our ready state. It is absolutely ridiculous. A <em>full three minutes later,</em> we are finally ready to start track one. And it’s worth it.</p>
<p>It’s madness. Delightful madness. Heads are bowed, watching our screens as the toilet paper hurtles by, our teammates cheering us on at the sidelines. Yells of glee and anguish go up as items connect and the track gets absolutely wrecked. I had hoped a nice fringe benefit of tethering the toilet rolls would be that they would stay quite firmly in place if bumped into, and this worked, but I did not foresee quite how easily the single toilet rolls would be smacked around with the slightest of impacts. By lap five, it felt like we were just driving through a jungle. Look at the state of it!</p>
<figure data-uuid="e3aeebc9e0a06"><a title="MARIO CIRCUIT 1 AFTER" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e3aeebc9e0a06/mario-circuit-1-after.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Wrecked. And we didn't even use any items on it — <em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Mario Circuit gives way to <strong>Donut Plains</strong> and the teammates swap over.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “Okay everyone, I’m going to set out the route. Just watch where my kart goes so you can stay on track and everything should stay intact.”</p>
<p>My words are unheeded. Another course absolutely decimated. Around lap three I notice that a Luigi is just floating around outside the track.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “Hang on, is that our Luigi?”<strong><br>
Ossie:</strong> “Yeah, I didn’t really know where I was going.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “But I showed you!”<strong><br>
Janek:</strong> “The tracks are so narrow, it’s hard to know where you’re meant to be going.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “Not if everyone sticks to the track! I planned them, they’re all wide enough for two karts. I promise. Right, I’m Lakitu-ing this.”</p>
<p>I scoop up Luigi and set him back on track, hastily rearranging the track rolls as I do.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “I think this is what we need to do going forward - teammates can be Lakitu and we need to sort of fix as we go along.”<strong><br>
Alex:</strong> “Yeah, sounds good.”<strong><br>
Artie:</strong> “Has anyone seen Ludwig? I think he’s miles ahead of all of us.”<strong><br>
Janek:</strong> “There’s a computer? I don’t think I’ve even seen him.”<strong><br>
Artie:</strong> “I think he’s been in first the entire time.”<strong><br>
Mitchell:</strong> “Damn it, Ludwig.”</p>
<figure data-uuid="060ec4d371443"><a title="Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit 5-Year Anniversary Blowout" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/060ec4d371443/mario-kart-live-home-circuit-5-year-anniversary-blowout.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The computer may be dominating, but things start to get back on track with the final race of the Grand Prix - <strong>the big ol’ mushroom track</strong>. Though there’s still plenty of faff actually getting the race started, the space afforded with this one actually makes for a better experience and a proper hush descends as we compete for the podium. It doesn’t last, though, because as I whip round a corner with rolls streaking by, I can’t help but laugh when I pick my eyes up from the screen and spot my Luigi.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “Oh my God! They look so slow in real life!”</p>
<p>I’m not sure I can summon the words to adequately describe the whiplash of speeding through a mountain of bog roll on a screen, to setting eyes upon the reality of a miniature toy jaunting along the floor covering <em>a minuscule amount of floor space</em>, but sure enough the focus we had mustered comes undone as everyone giggles at the lack of intensity the real karts are displaying. Those tight precision corners and bumper-to-bumper collisions look hilarious when you realise they’re just dinky plastic toys. 100cc suddenly feels like 10cc.</p>
<figure data-uuid="9c0562e6913f3"><a title="Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit 5-Year Anniversary Blowout" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9c0562e6913f3/mario-kart-live-home-circuit-5-year-anniversary-blowout.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>We swear it feels faster than this — <em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The race finishes and the horror of having a CPU take the grand prize with nearly double the points of second place is not lost on us. Time is also slipping away - it’s already been nearly an hour and a half and we’ve only managed one Grand Prix! No time to debrief, we need to get moving.</p>
<h2><strong>The Flower Cup. The definitely-a-Flower Cup.</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="78673c4acf853"><a title="MUSHROOM CUP STANDINGS" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/78673c4acf853/mushroom-cup-standings.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>This one hurt — <em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Ghost Valley 1</strong> takes shape with its infamous jump shortcut in place. I had considered building a ramp, but any thought of this is pushed aside as time ticks away. I do, however, plop a toilet roll in the middle of the narrow stretch.</p>
<p><strong>JB:</strong> “What’s that?”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “It’s for the shortcut. It’s to add a bit of jeopardy, otherwise everyone will just use it as it’s quicker. It’s risk and reward now.”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> “No, it isn’t, we’re just going to plough through it.”<strong><br>
Janek:</strong> “Could the tracks be wider?”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “This one is quite wide, once we get round that first corner, it’ll be good. Ghost Valley is a classic. Trust me.”</p>
<figure data-uuid="317396109beec"><a title="GHOST VALLEY START" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/317396109beec/ghost-valley-start.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Just get past that first corner... — <em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Chaos. Everybody wipes out on the first corner except one sneaky Mario that flies through. As predicted, the shortcut also gets massacred. It’s a good race, though - I beautifully cut Luigi on the inside into first but slip down the rankings when I get nudged off course by that damn shortcut roll I had insisted upon on the last lap.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “LAKITU!! HELP!”</p>
<p>Mitchell pips it. That one stung. Ghost Valley 1 is my favourite. Onto <strong>Bowser’s Castle 1</strong>. I’d like to say cool heads prevailed as the pressure to create tracks quickly is sinking in, but -</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “I wish we could build two tracks at a time to speed things up.”<strong><br>
Mitchell:</strong> “We can do that, can’t we? We’ve got the floor space?”<strong><br>
JC:</strong> “And another set of gates?”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “We don’t have enough toilet roll to build two at the same time.”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> “I don’t think lack of toilet roll is your problem here.”<strong><br>
Janek:</strong> “I think the tracks need to be wider.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “The tracks are wide enough!”</p>
<figure data-uuid="acfc7d139e459"><a title="Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit 5-Year Anniversary Blowout" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/acfc7d139e459/mario-kart-live-home-circuit-5-year-anniversary-blowout.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>They really aren’t. I’m slowly coming to the realisation that the tracks I’ve based these recreations on are, by and large, wide enough for 4-6 racers to sit side by side in-game. These are wide enough for two. Sometimes. Nevertheless, after the customary gate faff, Bowser’s Castle begins. And it’s around lap four that things unravel again.</p>
<p><strong>Artie:</strong> “Oh, I’ve got a Bullet Bill!”</p>
<p>Cue complete track destruction. The Bullet Bill positively smashes the kart through the toilet roll and decimates any semblance of a track. We struggle to get through the last lap as Roy romps into first.</p>
<p><strong>JB:</strong> “No! This is bull! I’ve been first the <em>entire time.</em> I’ve been robbed.”<strong><br>
Mitchell:</strong> “Damn it, Roy.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “Of course! The toilet roll doesn’t affect him. He’s just sauntering through a normal track.”<strong><br>
Everyone:</strong> “Ohhhhhh.”</p>
<p>We probably should’ve realised this sooner. Mitchell is doing well this Grand Prix, though, and not shy mentioning it.</p>
<p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> “Smashed that. I could take this.”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> “Nonsense.”</p>
<p>We construct the final track of the GP, and perhaps I should’ve foreseen things getting a bit bawdy.</p>

<p><strong>JB:</strong> “Err…what are you making?”<strong><br>
JC:</strong> “Yeah, this looks pretty dodgy, George.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “It’s obviously a fire flower you savages. I’m going to set the gates up.”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> “Are you going to block off parts of it?”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “No! We want different paths and shortcuts and stuff. Mario Kart is all about options.”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> “I thought it was all about rage? Blind rage.”</p>
<p>I proceed to drive Mario through the gates.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “Oh no. This isn’t going to help my case.”</p>
<p>Everybody loses it and I cannot repeat <em>anything</em> that was said as the karts shot up and down the track. The fact that it’s a nice, big track (stop it) again makes the race really enjoyable. Thankfully, Jon volunteers to demonstrate the actual scope of it:</p>
<figure data-uuid="14949fed2dea0"><a title="JON FLOWER" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/14949fed2dea0/jon-flower.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>I fear any caption being taken out of context here — <em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The looping nature of the track makes for some great bumps and item hits, with howls going up all round the room.</p>
<figure data-uuid="3756b171012dd"><a title="CROSSOVER HIT" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3756b171012dd/crossover-hit.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>The crime as it happened — <em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “I really like it when there’s a crossover - it’s great to dodge past people when you’re going round.”</p>
<p>Jonny promptly smashes into the side of my kart as I say this, catching my front wheels and dragging me round with him.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “No! I was in first!”</p>
<p>The CPU has once again taken the grand prize, but Mitchell was close. We have an hour and a bit left at this point and I concede defeat on any notion of completing every Grand Prix.</p>
<p><strong>JC:</strong> “Yeah, I think that would take about nine hours at this point.”</p>
<h2><strong>A star-studded finish?</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="fab7576fef2ff"><a title="FLOWER STANDINGS" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fab7576fef2ff/flower-standings.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Mitchell nearly pipped it — <em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “Okay, let’s do one more Grand Prix. We’ll make it a Star Cup as the track I had planned for the Shell Cup is ridiculously narrow. Like, one car wide.”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> “Let’s not do that.”<strong><br>
Ossie:</strong> “What track are we building?”<strong><br>
Alex:</strong> “I think it’s better when the tracks are straighter.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “Agreed. No wibbly wobbly tracks. There is one I wanted to try, though.”</p>
<p>Some toilet rolls later.</p>
<p><strong>JB:</strong> “What am I looking at here?”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “It’s <strong>Koopa Troopa Beach</strong>! It’s quite open, so I’m hoping it’ll give a bit more space.”</p>
<figure data-uuid="e2a8203837dd7"><a title="KOOPA TROOPA BEACH" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e2a8203837dd7/koopa-troopa-beach.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>We could use a holiday — <em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It does, as it happens. The drive through is pretty good, we’re all happily battling it out, when Alex quietly bends down and casually scoops up his kart.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “Are you finished already?”<strong><br>
Alex:</strong> “Yep.”<strong><br>
Mitchell:</strong> “The utter disrespect. I love it.”</p>
<p>My plan to finish with Rainbow Road before wrapping up on the giant pixel star is scuppered when I hit ‘Next Race’ instead of course creation as KT Beach concludes.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “Noooooo! Why is that the first option?”<strong><br>
JC:</strong> “It’s very weird.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “It’s like they don’t want you to change tracks each time!”</p>
<p>I think about this for a second.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “Oh my god. We aren’t <em>meant</em> to change the tracks each time. It’s meant to be the <em>environment</em> that makes each track different. Then there isn’t so much faff setting up the gates and running through them each time. You can just set off and have a different feeling course.”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> “So what you’re saying is, we’ve wasted hours building tracks at your hands as the malevolent dictator of track design.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “No! No, it’s still been fun. Just would’ve been much quicker."<strong><br>
Ossie:</strong> “Can’t we just move the gates?”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “Yes! Let’s do that! Just stick the gates anywhere in the room. See, I’m not a dictator.”<strong><br>
JC:</strong> “So is this open-world? Are we Mario Kart Worlding it?”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “We are Mario Kart Worlding it.”</p>

<p>We spread the gates out across the massive room and proceed to race. It’s mad and brilliant. Watching our karts bomb it across huge straights. Mitchell’s Luigi is storming out front with mine in hot pursuit.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “I swear Luigi is faster.”<strong><br>
Mitchell:</strong> Of course, he’s the superior brother.”<strong><br>
JC:</strong> “Oh no! I’ve got a Bullet Bill but he doesn’t know where the track is!”</p>
<p>Jon’s shuddering kart is a sight to behold as Mitchell and I duke it out for the customary second place behind the CPU.</p>
<p><strong>JB:</strong> “Where’s the computer?”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “He finished ages ago. He doesn’t care about trivial things like where the gates or toilet rolls actually are.”<strong><br>
Mitchell:</strong> “Damn it, Bowser Jr.”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> “Evil.”</p>
<p>I’ve managed to climb my way to first (second) place, swooping tightly round Gate Four, keeping my eyes off the screen and on the IRL kart. I just pinch it through Gate One and fist pumps are shot into the air.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “Yes! That was a great one.”</p>
<p>But when I look at my screen, something is wrong.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “Hey? It says I’m still racing.”<strong><br>
Mitchell:</strong> “Yeah, I just came second.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “What? Oh no - I don’t think it registered a gate!”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> “Sure, sure.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “No, really! I went through them all! You saw, Mitch?”<strong><br>
Mitchell:</strong> “I didn’t see anything, mate.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> "I can’t believe this!”</p>
<p>I storm back round the track and, indeed, Gate Four did not register. I feel hollow.</p>
<p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> “That’s Mario Kart, baby.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “Don’t even.”</p>
<p>Other plans have meant we are down to just JB, JC, Mitch, and myself now, and we enjoy our chunky Star Cup finale - even if the CPU takes the podium again. Though we agree the fact that none of us have <em>actually</em> taken first leaves us all a little bit unfulfilled…</p>

<h2><strong>Mario’s Migraine</strong></h2>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “Okay, how about one final race, no CPU, winner takes all?”<strong><br>
Mitchell:</strong> “Okay - but what’s the track?”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> “Yeah, we don’t want any of that tight cornering nonsense.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “I was going to save the best for last - a giant recreation of pixel Mario’s head.”<strong><br>
JC:</strong> “We’re going to drive through Mario’s skull? Okay, let’s do it.”</p>

<p>Look at the beauty of that track. I could weep. Now let's tear holes in it and set the gates.</p>
<p>Removing the CPU element and introducing genuine stakes has the effect I had hoped for all along. A proper, focused hush falls on us as the countdown begins. Then, almost immediately:</p>
<p><strong>Everyone:</strong> “Oh!”</p>
<p>There’s a sandstorm on the track and somehow you can <em>feel</em> its impact on the karts? A delightful reminder that Nintendo really can conjure up magic in any experience they put their minds to at this late stage in the day. We zip round the wonderfully spacious track and Mitchell takes first.</p>
<p><strong>Mitchell:</strong> “I told you - Luigi is inherently faster.”</p>

<p>Seeing that lean, green machine sitting pretty awakens the green-eyed monster in me. But I play it cool.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “That was a great one, though! One more time, just for fun? I think we can squeeze it in. No weather effect this time and we don’t need to reset the gates.”<strong><br>
Everyone:</strong> “Sure!”</p>
<p>We replace a few stray rolls and line up again. I’m making steady progress and toward the end of lap four I’ve got a pretty commanding lead. I pull the trigger.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “I mean, obviously this is the real final race, right? Winner takes all!”<strong><br>
Everyone:</strong> “What?! No!”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> “You’re ridiculous.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “Ridiculously good!”</p>
<p>I storm through the final gate. Except I don’t. Because <em>once again,</em> I have failed to register a gate somewhere on my last lap.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “What? No! No - NOT AGAIN!”</p>
<p>I’m rattled as I bounce from gate to gate trying to find the offender - it’s Gate Three! And fittingly, it drops me to third. I backtrack sheepishly on my previous gloating.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “Maybe we will count the last one as the real final race.”<strong><br>
JC:</strong> “Is that because you came second in that one?”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “Shh.”</p>
<h2><strong>The podium</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="caa78bff1149a"><a title="THE PODIUM" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/caa78bff1149a/the-podium.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>The winner takes it all — <em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So there you have it - our final ranked positions on what was essentially a very elaborate, one-race winner-takes-all experience. We decide to take a podium picture holding our gates.</p>
<p><strong>George:</strong> “Come on, everyone, grab your rank. Jonny, you came fourth.”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> “I don’t accept that.”<strong><br>
Mitchell:</strong> “That’s Mario Kart, baby.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “How did you all find it?”<strong><br>
JC:</strong> “Life-changing.”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> Decent.”<strong><br>
JC:</strong> “Incredible response.”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> “Nah - I’m only joking. It was lots of fun.”<strong><br>
Mitchell:</strong> “A surprisingly civilised Saturday.”<strong><br>
George:</strong> “Would you do it again?”<strong><br>
JB:</strong> “Yeah, I would. Make better tracks, though.”<strong><br>
JC:</strong> “I think it needs more danger. Get a dog in.”<strong><br>
Mitchell:</strong> “Yeah, get a dog and I’m there.”</p>
<p>A dog it is.</p>
<p>And what about me? Would I do it again? Yes, absolutely, and you should too if you can - but a few words of advice.</p>
<figure data-uuid="2d6dc367d704c"><a title="Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit 5-Year Anniversary Blowout" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2d6dc367d704c/mario-kart-live-home-circuit-5-year-anniversary-blowout.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: George Banks / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Don’t make a new track for every race! Setting it up is an absolute time sink and the tightness of the game tracks translates <em>horribly</em> into a real-life arena.</p>
<p>Make sure everyone has completed the arduous tutorial <em>before</em> you get there, and for goodness' sake, give everyone space to start at Gate One. I cannot overstate how much time we lost just <em>trying to start a race.</em></p>
<p>It’s so, so close to being a gem of a game - it’s just bogged down with a little too much faff and not enough getting going. Classic Nintendo. Turn off the CPU, too. You’re never going to beat a ghost that can drive through walls - keep the stakes between the real-life folks.</p>
<p>I would recommend the huge pixel recreations and letting the in-game effects shape the race. The pile-ups, seeing the hilarious juxtaposition between the thrill of the screen and the meandering of the real karts, the classic Mario Kart gameplay - it’s all here and really worth experiencing in four-player with the right people.</p>
<p>We may have failed on our quest to complete all GPs, but we had a blast trying. And hey, no matter what the outcome, at least we’ll have toilet roll on hand for <em>months.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto" data-qa="message_content" role="presentation"> <p>Former EA developer and <em>Dead Space</em> creator Glen Schofield really wants to make a new game in the sci-fi horror series and is apparently already calling Electronic Arts <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">following the news that Saudi Arabia</a>, with some help from private equity firms, is planning to buy up the <em>Battlefield</em> and <em>Madden</em> publisher.</p> <p>Schofield’s last big game was 2022’s <em>Dead Space</em>-like <a href="https://kotaku.com/callisto-protocol-review-dead-space-pc-ps5-goty-1849848054"><em>Callisto Protocol</em>.</a> It wasn’t a smash hit, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-co-creator-glen-schofield-leaves-the-callisto-protocols-striking-distance-studios">he left the studio he helped found</a> to build the game less than a year after shipping <em>Callisto</em> <em>Protocol.</em> But he’s not done making games. He’s currently the director at Pinstripe Games, a studio that hasn’t announced what it’s working on, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-can-save-you-30-40-million-on-the-idea-i-have-dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-already-making-calls-about-dead-space-4-now-ea-has-new-owners">and he also told IGN</a> in a recent interview that he’s got “quite a few” ideas for more games, including<em> Dead Space 4</em>. But the last time Schofield went to the publisher to talk Dead Space, it wasn’t interested.</p> <p>“I went to [EA] recently and they’re like no, we’re not interested anymore,” Schofield told <em>IGN</em>. “I said, ‘I can get back the leadership team.’ I need the models from [Dead Space remake developer] EA Motive, and I can save you 30 to 40 million dollars on the idea that I have. And, they’re like, ‘no.'”</p> <p>But now that EA is set to be bought up by Saudi Arabia, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-arabia-deal-senate-union-banking-interest-rates-2000636023">assuming the United States government doesn’t get involved and block the deal</a>, Schofield thinks there’s a chance for <em>Dead Space 4</em> to happen, or at least for the franchise to be sold off and expanded into new media.</p> </div><p>“The fact that EA just got bought, I think there’s an opportunity. I’m already making calls. I don’t know where EA’s head is right now. I don’t think they made money on [the remake]. <em>Dead Space</em> needs to be adapted to different mediums — movies, TV series, it would be great. But I am more optimistic [since the sale of EA], because somebody new could buy [IP].”</p></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dead-space-creator-sees-chance-make-dead-space-4-ea-saudi-deal-2000636125]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> Season 11 is poised to bring huge changes to Blizzard's ARPG, and will overhaul item progression, see the return of leaderboards, rework the Renown system, and even dramatically change how the game's potions work. And that's not even everything.</p><p dir="ltr">While noticeable changes to the core of Diablo 4 come alongside nearly every season, most notably with Season 4's Loot Reborn, Season 11 still stands out. None of these changes were detailed in the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-2025-roadmap-highlights-new-crossovers-endgame-updates/1100-6530666/" data-ref-id="1100-6530666">2025 content roadmap</a>, and Blizzard has teased for months that many of players' biggest gripes with the game would be addressed in a coming update. Now we finally know what Blizzard has been cooking.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586075-diablo4masterworkingchanges.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586075" data-ratio="0.56267217630854" data-width="1452" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586075-diablo4masterworkingchanges.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586075"></a><figcaption>Masterworking and Tempering are becoming less random in Season 11.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586075-diablo4masterworkingchanges.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Tempering And Masterworking Overhaul</h2><p dir="ltr">Perhaps the biggest complaint players have had since Season 4 regards the act of Tempering and Masterworking items. In the current live version of Diablo 4, Tempering allows players to add affixes to items but with a catch.</p><p dir="ltr">The act of Tempering has an element of randomness, as each Tempering recipe usually contains up to three possible affixes. Which affix gets applied is random, and players often end up "bricking" an item by being unable to get their desired affix. Masterworking, too, has an element of luck, with bonus affix upgrades every few levels applied at random. Players trying to optimize their gear to the fullest often have to reset the item when the bonus affix upgrade doesn't land on a desired roll and start the entire Masterworking process over again from scratch.</p><p dir="ltr">That's all changing with Season 11. As detailed in a new blog outlined what all is coming to Diablo 4's public test realm, Tempering will finally no longer be random, with players able to apply the affix of their choice to gear. That affix can also be changed as many times as a player likes (as long as they have the necessary resources). The catch is that gear can now only have one Tempered affix. To compensate, non-Unique items are having their base number of affixes raised from three to four.</p><p dir="ltr">Going hand-in-hand with the Tempering changes is an update to Masterworking. Instead of improving the value of affixes, Masterworking instead improves an item's overall quality, up to a quality level of 20. Higher-quality items have increased base damage, armor, or resistances, and Masterworking an item has a chance to increase its quality by two to five levels.</p><p dir="ltr">Once an item hits Masterwork level 20, players can roll for a Capstone bonus, which upgrades a random non-greater affix on the item and turns it into a greater one. These Capstone bonuses can be re-rolled an unlimited amount of times without resetting an item's quality, allowing players to hone in on specific affixes necessary for their build (though it will cost some upgrade currencies).</p><p dir="ltr">More than just changing how Tempering and Masterworking works, Blizzard has additionally added a final step for an item's upgrade journey--Sanctification. This new system lets players use a fraction of Heaven's power to sanctify an item. Sanctifying an item has a random chance to apply one of the following benefits:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Bonus Legendary power</li><li dir="ltr">Turn an affix into a Greater Affix</li><li dir="ltr">Add a bonus Sanctification Affix</li><li dir="ltr">Replace an existing affix with a Sanctification Affix</li><li dir="ltr">Make an item indestructible</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Sanctifying an item makes the item unmodifiable. Blizzard warns that Sanctification should always be the very last upgrade made to an item.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586084-diablo4season11sanctification.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586084" data-ratio="0.56215083798883" data-width="1432" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586084-diablo4season11sanctification.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586084"></a><figcaption>Diablo 4 Season 11 is introducing a final step in an item's upgrade path called Sanctification.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586084-diablo4season11sanctification.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Healing And Defense Changes</h2><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4 Season 11's major rework for item progression isn't the only big change. It's also completely changing how defenses work, and scrapping the game's entire existing potion system in the process. Armor and Resistances are becoming a rating system, and one with diminishing returns at higher levels. Armor will reduce all damage taken, rather than just physical, and the armor and resistance penalties associated with each Torment difficulty will be removed. A new character-stat page that aggregates all of a character's defensive stats into one number, Toughness, will help give players a better idea of how durable they overall are.</p><p dir="ltr">As for healing, Blizzard is ripping out the existing potion system. Instead of needing to upgrade potions every few levels, potions in Diablo 4 Season 11 will instead always immediately heal 35% of a player's total health. Base potion capacity is being reduced to four as a result, but potions will recharge over 30 seconds. To aid with healing, values for all life-gaining affixes like life on kill, life on hit, and life regeneration have all had their values increased.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortify, a unique Diablo 4 mechanic that grants additional defenses when overhealing, is being changed into what is essentially an extra life bar that's slowly drained to heal over time. When Fortified, players will heal a percentage of their max life every second, draining the Fortified health pool.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Renown Reborn</h2><p dir="ltr">Potions aren't the only idea from the launch version of Diablo 4 that is being scrapped. Renown, a zone-specific reputation system that has various rewards like additional potion slots, skill points, and gold tied to it, is going away, at least for the game's Seasonal realm. It will still exist permanently in the Eternal realm, effectively making for noticeably different versions of Diablo 4 to choose from.</p><p dir="ltr">On the game's seasonal server, Renown is being replaced and combined with the game's current Season Journey system to form a new system called Season Rank. Players will earn rewards like additional skill and paragon points, Smoldering Ashes, and cosmetics by completing various objectives and advancing their Season Rank. Altars of Lilith will grant experience and minor rewards, but will no longer grant permanent stats as they have since the game launched.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586086-diablo4season11leaderboards.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586086" data-ratio="0.56215083798883" data-width="1432" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586086-diablo4season11leaderboards.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586086"></a><figcaption>Leaderboards are finally returning in Diablo 4 Season 11.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586086-diablo4season11leaderboards.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">The Tower</h2><p dir="ltr">Leaderboards are returning to Diablo 4 after having previously been deactivated alongside the game's Vessel of Hatred expansion. This time, however, they are taking a new form--The Tower. A new multi-floor dungeon, The Tower works similarly to The Pit, where players will need to battle through monsters and fill a meter within a 10-minute time limit.</p><p dir="ltr">Once enough monsters (or progress orbs that drop from them) have been slain, a random Tower boss will spawn. Defeating them concludes the dungeon and stops the timer, registering the run on the new leaderboard. There will be solo leaderboards for each class, as well as leaderboards for parties of two, three, and four. There will additionally be separate leaderboards for Hardcore characters. Blizzard said the version of The Tower and leaderboard appearing in Season 11 will be considered a beta, and that it hopes to update The Tower in future seasons.</p><p dir="ltr">There's more too, with Season 11 set to add a new world boss for the first time since launch, make enemy monsters tougher, and introduce a whole new set of seasonal powers and mechanics. Testing for Diablo 4 Season 11 will begin on the game's PTR October 21, with the season proper set to debut on December 9.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> may be far more challenging come Season 11, with a slew of updates set to address monster behavior and difficulty.</p><p dir="ltr">As detailed by Blizzard, the goal is to have monsters starting with Season 11 more regularly test players' defenses and force players to interact with them in new ways. Enemy monsters will see changes to make their behavior less predictable, while at the same time making it so each type of monster will have their own clear role and identity in combat. Monsters packs will also group up less, making it more difficult for players to wipe out large groups of multiple packs in a single go.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586093-diablo4season11azmodanworldboss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586093" data-ratio="0.56215083798883" data-width="1432" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586093-diablo4season11azmodanworldboss.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586093"></a><figcaption>Azmodan will be a new world boss coming in Diablo 4 Season 11.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4586093-diablo4season11azmodanworldboss.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">A big part of the update to monsters will be new affixes, with more than 20 additional affixes for players to deal with. Elites will spawn minions that inherit some of their affixes, and affixes will in general be more powerful, requiring players to deal with them before taking out less-dangerous foes. Blizzard said that overall, monster affixes should overlap less in their design, be more visually clear, and be more engaging.</p><p dir="ltr">Those changes, in conjunction with other Season 11 updates like fewer potion charges and item progression changes, should make Diablo 4 overall more challenging than before. But deadlier monsters aren't the only thing players have to be afraid of. Season 11 is also adding a new world boss, as well as ways to encounter endgame Lesser Evil bosses like Duriel, Andariel, and Belial while doing endgame activities like Helltide, The Pit, and Kurast Undercity. The new world boss, the first added since Diablo 4's launch over two years ago, will be a familiar face to Diablo 3 players. Azmodan, the Lord of Sin, has a chance to appear as a world boss in the game's open world but can also be summoned at will using a special altar south of Zarbinzet.</p><p dir="ltr">It's currently unclear if the ability to summon the Lesser Evils is an evergreen mechanic or strictly seasonal one, but defeating bosses in this way will reward Divine Favor, used to level up a seasonal Divine Gifts mechanic and increase players' Season Rank (a new system for the game's seasonal server that combines the game's current Renown and Season Journey systems).</p><p dir="ltr">More powerful monsters and the inclusion of Azmodan aren't the only big changes coming next season, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-11-might-be-its-biggest-rework-yet/1100-6535476/" data-ref-id="1100-6535476">Diablo 4 Season 11 poised to be the game's biggest rework yet</a>. Season 11 will additionally overhaul item progression with sweeping changes to Masterworking and Tempering, reintroduce leaderboards, and more. Diablo 4 Season 11 is slated to begin on December 9, with PTR testing for the season beginning October 21. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-second-expansion-isnt-coming-until-2026/1100-6529452/" data-ref-id="1100-6529452">Diablo 4's second expansion</a> is expected to release in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, Techland has outlined its eleven-week roadmap of updates coming to Dying Light: The Beast. The game launched a month ago and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-sells-over-1-million-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was immediately successful among fans</a>; now, the developers are ready to make it even better in the coming three months.</p>



<p>Confirmed additions include the New Game+ mode, Legend Levels, Nightmare Difficulty, new weapon executions, and Ray Tracing support on PC, which was suddenly removed just ahead of the launch, much to the detriment of the game's visual quality. There's also going to be a collaboration with PUBG Mobile.</p>



<p>Moreover, Techland announced a global community initiative titled Call of the Beast. The event started today and runs until January 7, 2026. New challenges and exclusive rewards will be introduced every week on Thursday.</p>



<p>Throughout this campaign, players worldwide will work together to achieve weekly goals that celebrate teamwork, persistence, and the strength of the Dying Light: The Beast community. Each challenge offers exclusive rewards that appear in participants’ in-game stash once the objectives are met. Every week, from new weapons to unique car skins, brings fresh surprises and reasons to celebrate the collective success. Players must contribute to that week's goal to receive the weekly rewards.</p>



<p>Sticking together with the community to complete at least 17 of the 22 goals will unlock a secret Legendary Reward, which players will receive at the end of the event. Additionally, if the community completes 20 goals, everyone who participated in at least one challenge will receive all the rewards, regardless of when they started playing Call of the Beast.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The first community challenge is called Season to Dismember and asks players to cut off 30 million limbs for a Lumberjack Car Skin and 60 million limbs for a Woodchopper Axe. This challenge will last until Thursday, October 23 at 4 PM CEST.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-expansion-cheap-sale-bundle-star-wars-2000636124</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/get-every-destiny-2-expansion-including-the-new-star-wars-one-for-just-35-right-now.1326835/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The<em> Destiny 2</em> 2025 Charity Bundle is almost too good to pass up. I say almost because the actual state of the sci-fi MMO right now is so rough that this might be the <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-free-final-shape-edge-fate-expansion-ps5-1851785927">worst time to hop into Bungie’s loot shooter in years</a>. At the same time, the bundle includes every paid piece of content for the game, including the upcoming <em>Star Wars Renegades</em> expansion, for half the price of a new game.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.greenmangamingbundles.com/bundles/destiny-2-expansion-bundle-2025/">charity bundle</a> is being sold in partnership with Green Man Gaming and is only for the PC version of the game, but the majority of the $35 price tag all goes to the Bungie Foundation which uses gaming to help children in need. Here’s everything included in the bundle:</p>

 <ul> <li><em>Destiny 2 </em>base game</li> <li><em>Forsaken Pack</em></li> <li><em>Bungie 30th Anniversary Pack</em></li> <li><em>Beyond Light</em></li> <li><em>Shadowkeep</em></li> <li><em>Witch Queen</em></li> <li><em>Lightfall</em></li> <li><em>The Final Shape</em></li> <li><em>The Edge of Fate</em></li> <li><em>Renegades</em></li> </ul> <p>That’s everything there is to play currently (the original story campaign and other content were sunset years ago). It’s a great deal, and the only thing stopping me from recommending it to everyone I know is that <em>Destiny 2</em> tends to live and die by the most recent expansion, and 2025’s <em>The Edge of Fate</em> is one of its worst. That’s infected the rest of the loot shooter with changes to the grind, gear, and progression that make the entire game <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-renegades-star-wars-power-reset-2000632488">a drag right now</a>. Bungie responded with a series of fixes, including promises to roll back some of the most controversial changes, but that requires placing a bet on <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s future rather than investing in its present.</p> <p>The addition of <em>Renegades</em> is the one big silver lining for this bundle. The <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-destiny-2-renegades-trailer-release-date-1851779376"><em>Star Wars</em>-themed expansion</a> is teasing some interesting ideas and new modes. At the very least, there will be a lightsaber sword everyone can obtain and mess around with. And if <em>Renegades</em> doesn’t help right the ship, well, I’m not sure anything will. So if nothing else, consider the charity bundle a super cheap ticket to witness the rebirth of <em>Destiny 2</em>. Or, if things don’t turn around, its eventual end.</p>

			<p>Owlcat Games announced that its next cRPG, Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy, will launch in Open Alpha on PC in Q4 2025. Thus, aspiring Inquisitors will soon be able to command a diverse warband, shaping the fate of the Imperium one decision at a time.</p>



<p>In Warhammer 40,000: Dark Heresy, a narrative-driven tactical RPG set in the grimdark universe created by Games Workshop, players lead a warband of diverse companions in a desperate battle against heresy and corruption against the backdrop of Noctis Aeterna and the mystery of the Tyrant Star. These companions range from loyal Imperial subjects, such as a veteran Guardsman from the death world of Catachan, to nefarious xenos, including a bird-like Kroot mercenary.</p>



<p>Featuring intricate investigations, a turn-based combat system, and choices with grave consequences, Dark Heresy promises to greatly expand on the ideas previously seen in Rogue Trader. Unlike that game, it will also feature fully voiced dialogue. You can find <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-dark-heresy-gamescom-preview-inquisitors-are-always-right/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our Gamescom 2025 preview here</a>.</p>



<p>Speaking about Rogue Trader, Owlcat also announced that the cRPG will soon be released for the Nintendo Switch 2. It will be the first game made by the developer to launch on the new platform. Previously, Owlcat had released a cloud-only version of Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous for the first Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>Rogue Trader earned an 8 out of 10 score on Wccftech from Francesco De Meo:</p>



<p><em>With the great amount of love for the setting that was poured into the game evident from every line of dialogue and every little detail, Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is one of the best games based on the universe created by Games Workshop, and a solid tactical turn-based role-playing game that can provide hundreds of hours of fun.</em></p>



<p>The game has also been greatly refined over the past two years and has received two DLCs: <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-rogue-trader-void-shadows-q-launch-had-way-too-many-bugs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Void Shadows</a> and Lex Imperialis. Two more upcoming expansions have been announced. In the third expansion, players will enter a Necron vault curated by the iconic Trazyn the Infinite. There, they will challenge ancient guardians and uncover relics tied to the Von Valancius legacy. In the fourth DLC, players will explore the Processional of the Damned, a surreal graveyard of voidships where they will descend into madness and mystery.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/quantic-dream-competitive-multiplayer-game-spellcasters-chronicles/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/spellcasters-chronicles-is-quantic-dream%E2%80%99s-new-f2p-3v3-competitive-multiplayer-game.1326817/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Shortly after Quantic Dream <a href="https://wccftech.com/quantic-dream-announces-multiplayer-game-star-wars-eclipse-work-continues/">announced that it would be making a competitive multiplayer game</a>, the studio went ahead and revealed the game to be <a href="https://www.spellcasterschronicles.com/en-US">Spellcasters Chronicles</a>, a free-to-play, 3v3 action-strategy game with third-person combat, where players clash in "<em>vertical arenas</em>."</p>



<p>You play as a 'Spellcaster,' and face off against other players in squads of three, in 25-minute battles where players have to capture altars, gain territory, and destroy the opposing squad's 'Lifestones' to achieve victory.</p>



<p>Spellcasters have their own spells they cast, though the more significant element of their gameplay seems to be summoning creatures to fight for you in these battles. Each Spellcaster has its own archetype though, so players can jump between them to find ones that suit their playstyle. Beyond those archetypes, you'll also be deck-building by selecting various spells and creatures to summon as part of our character's loadout.</p>



<p>Quantic Dream debuted a gameplay trailer for Spellcasters Chronicles, which you can check out below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="SPELLCASTERS CHRONICLES | REVEAL TEASER" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sEXC2rMYWTY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>We are honoured and excited to introduce Spellcasters Chronicles to players today, developed in our Paris and Montreal studios</em>," Quantic Dream co-founder and president David Cage says in a press release. "<em>Stepping into a new genre with a fresh artistic approach has been both a challenge and a source of growth, allowing us to evolve as a team. We now look forward to shaping the game further with players' feedback and to perfecting this journey together. This project reflects the creative spirit and technical ambitions guiding Quantic Dream for nearly three decades. With Spellcasters Chronicles, we sought to bring a new form of gaming experience blending action and strategy to life, while exploring community-driven narrative.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>It has been an exploration of bold ideas, a chance to expand into social and multiplayer experiences, and an adventure shared by a new talented team of experts within our studios in Paris and Montreal who brought this original universe to life and are continuing to develop new experiences including Star Wars: Eclipse</em>."</p>



<p>Quantic Dream will host a closed beta for the game at the end of 2025, which you can currently sign up for if you're keen to try Spellcasters Chronicles yourself. The closed beta is invite-only, so signing up doesn't ensure you a spot; it just puts you in the running for one.</p>



<p>While the gameplay trailer does its job of making the matches look interesting, even potentially exciting, how the game plays will be what decides its fate. It'll be interesting to see how players react when they get their hands on the game for the first time, which is happening much sooner than the closed beta.</p>



<p>Tomorrow, on October 17, at TwitchCon in San Diego, on the LAN stage, people will get to play Spellcasters Chronicles for the first time. We'll also get a gameplay deep dive of the game, and there will be a community Q&amp;A session for curious players to learn more about Spellcasters Chronicles.</p>



<p>Hopefully, for Quantic Dream's sake, it goes well. We'll see how the world reacts when we get a proper look at Spellcasters Chronicles.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Star Wars: Eclipse Developer Quantic Dream Working on "Competitive Multiplayer" Game]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/quantic-dream-competitive-multiplayer-game</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-wars-eclipse-developer-quantic-dream-working-on-competitive-multiplayer-game.1326814/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Star Wars: Eclipse&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Detroit: Become Human&nbsp;</em>developer Quantic Dream has teased another project in the works, and according to studio head David Cage, it's a departure from what the company is known for.</p>

<p>That's according to a new blog post on Quantic Dream's official website, titled "Writing a New Chapter". In the post, Cage says his studio has "decided to take a new step" after "years as a single-project studio", and that new step is a "competitive multiplayer experience".</p>

<p>Cage acknowledges Quantic Dream's lack of experience in the area, but he says that together with the community's "support and feedback", he believes the studio can create "something truly unique".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/heavy-rain-quantic-dream-competitive-multiplayer-game.jpg?itok=WBttiqcK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/heavy-rain-quantic-dream-competitive-multiplayer-game.jpg?itok=oArym7_3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Heavy Rain&nbsp;</em>studio Quantic Dream is trying its hand at competitive multiplayer games, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>In the post, Cage also acknowledges that the competitive multiplayer game in question is "very different" from Quantic Dream's usual fare and that it "may surprise [the studio's] fans", but that he believes "taking risks" and "attempting what seems impossible" has always formed "part of [Quantic Dream's] DNA".</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Eclipse</em>, Cage provides a rather disappointingly brief update on that game's development. He says&nbsp;<em>Eclipse</em>'s development "continues", and that he and Quantic Dream are "eager to share more" at some point in the future.</p>

<p>Just as a quick reminder,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Eclipse&nbsp;</em>was first revealed during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-announcement-from-game-awards-2021" rel="nofollow">2021's Game Awards ceremony</a>, and since then, Quantic Dream has been rather quiet about the game, although reports from early 2022 suggested that the announcement had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-eclipse-failed-to-attract-new-talent-at-quantic-dream-report-says" rel="nofollow">failed to attract new talent</a> to the French developer.</p>

<p>Quantic Dream itself was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/quantic-dream-acquired-by-netease" rel="nofollow">subsequently acquired</a> by Chinese gaming giant NetEase, but the developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/quantic-dream-unaffected-netease-layoffs" rel="nofollow">remained "unaffected"</a> by the layoffs and cancellations that have recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">swept</a> many of that company's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rich-vogel-t-minus-zero-entertainment-netease-shut-down" rel="nofollow">subsidiaries</a>.</p>

            <p>Too many <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a> rounds of Conquest have been ending in a dissatisfying time-out, Uncle EA have found, with rival teams failing to completely devour each other's supply of spawning tickets. We've all known engagements like that - tit-for-tat exchanges between mostly AFK recon players. Irresolutions that might yawn forever were it not for everybody's <em>real</em> enemy, the clock. The gutsy response would have been to retitle Conquest "Bathos", or "War on Terror" if they wanted to sadden George Bush, or "Waiting for Bravo" if they wanted to amuse the Beckett fans, or "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a>" if they wanted to tweak Valve's whiskers. Instead, EA have taken the coward's way out and chopped the allowance of tickets on a per map basis.
</p><!--more-->
<p>"We've reduced the starting ticket count across all Conquest maps so matches finish at a more natural pace," the devs explain on <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1978462075488817479">MechaHitler.com</a>. "Previously, many rounds were hitting the time limit instead of ending when one team ran out of tickets. We'll keep monitoring feedback and data to make sure the flow of each match feels right." 
</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of the cuts, from which you might be able to deduce map sizes, if you've yet to play Battlefield 6. Operation Firestorm is a whopper with much open/burning desert between capture points, hence the dramatically lower new ticket total. Empire State is relatively tiddly and crowded, and has accordingly received a smaller haircut. There are probably more nuanced observations to make of each map's layout. Hey, don't look at me - I spend most of my Operation Firestorm matches pretending to be a cactus.
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Siege of Cairo from 1000 to 900</li>
<li>Empire State from 1000 to 900</li>
<li>Iberian Offensive from 1000 to 900</li>
<li>Liberation Peak from 1000 to 800</li>
<li>Manhattan Bridge from 1000 to 800 </li>
<li>Operation Firestorm from 1000 to 700 </li>
<li>New Sobek City from 1000 to 900 </li>
<li>Mirak Valley from 1000 to 700 </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The chops follow a number of Battlefield 6 updates and hotfixes to, amongst other things, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-gets-a-hotfix-targeting-bugged-hit-damage-and-ea-are-busy-inspecting-bouncy-ladders">get rid of ladders that behave like trebuchets</a>,  and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-backend-tweaks-tune-down-some-sniper-rifles-and-shotguns-as-ea-keep-fiddling-with-little-knobs">defang certain sniper rifles and shotguns</a>. How are you getting on with it, if you're playing?</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-warhammer-40k-review-how-long-review-ps5-1851639029"><i>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</i></a> is getting a free demo for anyone who hasn’t already played one of the best shooters of 2025. It’ll give players access to a couple of story missions and almost the full suite of multiplayer activities before they decide if they want to buy it or not.</p> <p>The free demo will be available from October 16-20 on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S and until October 23 on PC via Steam. It’ll include the intro and first mission of the story campaign as well as unlimited multiplayer for the Inferno, Decapitation and Vox Liberatis Operations (online co-op missions) as well as all Eternal War modes except for the recently added Helbrute Onslaught which is basically the game’s horde mode.</p>

 <p><em>Space Marine 2</em> is a sequel to the cult-favorite Xbox 360-era third-person shooter that delivers an old-school emphasis on meat and potatoes gunplay but with the impressive visuals of a modern blockbuster. It takes place during the Fourth Tyrannic War and is steeped in the lore and politics of the Warhammer 40K universe but doesn’t require you to have any working knowledge of the tabletop source material to enjoy the great art direction and <a href="https://kotaku.com/space-marine-2-saber-ceo-asmongold-youtube-comment-1851650858">old-school, AA charm</a>.</p> <p>If you choose to take the plunge, <em>Space Marine 2</em> is currently half-off on console ($35) and 55 percent off on PC ($30). The DLC is all discounted as well. But don’t forget, you’ll need a Game Pass or PS Plus subscription to play multiplayer on Xbox and PlayStation, even with the free demo, unfortunately.</p>

              <p>Quantic Dream, responsible for just&nbsp;<em>so</em> many over-hyped, anticlimactic, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-super-fans-of-detroit-become-human-hate-most-of-th-1828260985">faintly</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/heavy-rains-most-gruesome-scene-is-still-gut-wrenching-1796855768">racist</a> games, is back with some big news! Not only is it still, allegedly, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-biggest-gaming-disappointments-of-2021-1848249172">developing a&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> game</a>, but the studio known for single-player story-focused games is now also working on a competitive multiplayer game called <em>Spellcasters</em>.</p> <p>David Cage’s Quantic Dream is world-renowned for its cinematic story-driven games that promise extraordinary levels of interaction and choice and sometimes instead deliver <a href="https://www.endlessmode.com/video-games/quantic-dream/david-cages-writing-has-a-message-but-its-not-what">badly written nonsense</a> about ninjas or something. So who better than the developers of&nbsp;<em>Indigo Prophesy</em> and&nbsp;<em>Detroit: Become Human</em> to pick up the endlessly dropped baton of the next great <em>Overwatch</em>-like? That’s the plan according to Cage who, in <a href="https://blog.quanticdream.com/writing-a-new-chapter/">a blog post on the company’s site</a>, explained the much-expanded studio is working on a “competitive multiplayer experience, born from the same spirit of curiosity and creativity that has always defined us.”</p>

 <p>“This new title may surprise our fans as it is very different from what we have done so far,” Cage continues. “But taking risks, challenging ourselves, exploring new ways of playing and telling stories, and attempting what seems impossible, has always been part of our DNA.”</p>

  <p>It’s honestly hard to see any of this innovative originality in the trailer that dropped as I was writing this.&nbsp;<em>Spellcasters</em> might end up being completely brilliant for all I know, but the 3×3 hero shooter looks astonishingly generic to my eyes, indistinguishable from a dozen other wannabes.</p>

 <p>Quantic Dream has had quite the odd last few years, perhaps driving its desire for radical change. <a href="https://kotaku.com/david-cages-quantic-dreams-accused-of-being-a-toxic-wor-1822068440#_ga=2.116815942.1198361688.1524304403-255961593.1515548411">The studio was accused by multiple former and current staff of being a “toxic workplace”</a> that featured homophobia, racism and punishing crunch; claims which were furiously refuted by the two bosses, Cage and Guillaume de Fondaumière. So angered were the pair that in 2018 <a href="https://kotaku.com/detroit-developer-quantic-dream-sues-french-media-over-1825453518">they sued the French media outlets that published the claims</a>, which led to <a href="https://kotaku.com/report-quantic-dream-executives-cry-ask-if-they-can-l-1847036252">astonishing scenes in a 2021 court case</a> where de Fondaumière asked if they were allowed to lie because they weren’t under oath, while Cage was reported to have cried, stamped, screamed and eventually stormed out of the court room. Then, for one final surreal twist, <a href="https://kotaku.com/detroit-dev-quantic-dreams-wins-lawsuit-without-actuall-1847716375">Quantic Dream won part of this case but without ever disproving the allegations</a>. (It’s even weirder, because despite&nbsp;<em>Le Monde</em> and&nbsp;<em>Mediapart</em> collaborating on its reporting about the studio, QD somehow won against one and lost against the other. Meanwhile, the third outlet involved,&nbsp;<em>Canard PC</em>, wasn’t sued at all.) However, given it lost another part, it means much of the reporting was upheld by the courts.</p>

 <h2>But what about&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Eclipse</em>?</h2> <p>So anyway, it’s that lot making the next hopeful to enter the live-service multiplayer arena. And that’s also, we are led to believe, still making <em>Star Wars: Eclipse.</em> The game was&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/your-first-look-at-quantic-dreams-dramatic-new-star-war-1848176894"> announced in 2021</a> (following <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-we-ve-heard-about-a-quantic-dream-star-wars-game-1847708431">widespread rumors</a>), before going extremely quiet for a couple of years. Then in 2023 <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-eclipse-quantic-dream-game-delayed-anyone-die-1850865409">we learned it would not feature any “game overs” and that any character could die</a>. But then, another two years of silence. So is it dead? Apparently not. Cage makes a&nbsp;<em>very</em> brief reference to the game in his post, stating, “Of course, development of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Eclipse</em> continues, and we are eager to share more with you in the future.”</p>

  <p>But literally nothing else. It doesn’t bode well, honestly, given it’s been four years and you have to think Disney would like something to show off. It has in fact been over seven years since the developer released a game, with its focus seemingly shifted toward publishing in the interim. It published last year’s&nbsp;<em>Dustborn</em>&nbsp;alongside&nbsp;<em>Under the Waves</em>, in addition to helping out with motion capture for <em>Elden Ring</em>.</p> <p>Now the company is splitting its focus, clearly hoping to do what Sony and so many others couldn’t, and release a hit hero shooter.</p>

              <p>If you’ve ever tried transferring a batch of 4K videos to an external hard drive and ended up waiting forever, you know how crucial a good SSD can be. <strong>Speed, reliability, and toughness</strong>: that’s what really matters when you’re juggling files between your laptop or camera. The SanDisk 2TB <em>Extreme</em> portable SSD checks all those boxes while hitting its lowest price ever on Amazon. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4826/">it’s down to $149 from $209 which is the cheapest it’s ever been for this storage powerhouse</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4826/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Portable Power, Tough Build, And Lightning Speed</h2>
<p>Let’s begin with speed, since that’s where this SSD really boasts its strongest performance: The SanDisk Extreme SSD employs <strong>NVMe technology and up to 1050 MB/s read and 1000 MB/s write speeds are possible with it</strong>. That’s about ten times the speed of the run-of-the-mill external hard drive (HDD) so you can transfer massive video projects or backup your laptop in minutes, not hours.</p>



<p>Apart from its ruggedness and light weight, the reason for the popularity of this drive is consistency: You plug it in a Mac, PC, or tablet and the performance is rock steady. It <strong>plugs in via USB‑C and comes with USB 3.2 Gen 2 for full bandwidth</strong> and also operates with older USB‑A with the cable included.</p>
<p>On top of the existing 29% discount, it’s probably the lowest price-to-performance ratio available from SanDisk in years.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-free-to-play/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/will-battlefield-6-battle-royale-be-free-to-play.1326793/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s going to be a huge moment when we get to drop into Battlefield 6’s battle royale mode. The spiritual successor to Firestorm and Hazard Zone will be a historic occasion, and we’re checking to see if it’s free-to-play, plus anything else cost-related, or what you need to hop in.</p>



<p>Battle royale is an interesting one in 2025. The genre’s peak days feel behind us more than they are ahead, but millions of players are still dropping into huge maps slowly being engulfed by electricity, storms, and gas. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-biggest-launch-series-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> launched with a decent campaign and a brilliant multiplayer mode, but we’ve always known a battle royale extra was lurking in the background.</p>



<p>It’s fascinating to see how destruction is factored into the fray. Before we get there, however, let’s see if you’ve got to pay to take the ride.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-battlefield-6-battle-royale-free-to-play">Is Battlefield 6 Battle Royale Free To Play?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>An all-out war approaches. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>According to Insider Gaming sources, yes, the Battle Royale game mode will be completely free-to-play under the Battlefield 6 umbrella.</strong></p>



<p>We exclusively reported on Feb. 27, 2024, that EA was working on a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">battle royale mode</a> for the (then) upcoming Battlefield 6. Pretty much everything in that story came to fruition. But the story also added:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Ripple Effect, the studio that is working on a ‘new experience’ for the Battlefield franchise is working on a new Battle Royale title that’s currently aimed to be <strong>free-to-play</strong> and follow a similar strategy to the highly successful Call of Duty: Warzone that will see the free-to-play experience tie-in with its premium release.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Officially, all we know in this moment is that BF 6’s battle royale is happening. EA hasn’t confirmed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-pois-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date</a>, nor officially confirmed our report that it will be free. Stay tuned for further updates, but we’ll be shocked if you have to pay an extra penny for BF 6’s battle royale—perhaps with one slight caveat.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-battlefield-6-battle-royale-be-a-standalone-game-like-warzone">Will Battlefield 6 Battle Royale Be A Standalone Game Like Warzone?</h2>



<p><strong>There has been no news or leaks to say if Battlefield 6’s battle royale game is included in the overall BF 6 package, or if it’ll be a free-to-play download like Call of Duty: Warzone.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s that caveat we mentioned. We haven’t heard anything regarding EA’s final decision on the battle royale being completely free, or only free to paying Battlefield 6 customers.</p>



<p>Warzone is a Call of Duty game, but it’s a separate (free) download. We’ll have to see if the new battle royale component follows its path.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) - Official Release Date Reveal | Trailer 2</p>
      </div>
<p>"Our research suggests that GTA 6 will generate more revenue at a standard $69.99 price point than the much discussed $100," MIDiA Research's Head of Data and study co-author, Perry Gresham, told IGN. "A $100 price point would actually leave money on the table.”</p><p>The firm's games analyst, Brandon Sutton, echoed Gresham's sentiment, saying that GTA 6's price--whatever it ends up being--should "serve as a caution" to other publishers looking to raise game prices.</p><p>"Our research shows that 59% of consumers have some interest in purchasing GTA 6, highlighting the immense appeal and commercial potential of the game," Sutton said. "This notoriety also makes GTA 6 the perfect test case to understand consumer expectations around video games pricing."</p><p>IGN pointed to some other findings within the study, too. MIDiA Research found that 60% of consumers said they'd "definitely" or "probably" buy GTA 6 at $70, while just 35% said the same thing if the game were $100. Of course, that number jumped to 79% if Rockstar dropped its crime sim at an improbable $50, and a whopping 16% would scoop the game up at an eye-watering $150 tag.</p><p>This suggests that, according to MIDiA Research, the "optimal" $70 price would equate to nearly 9% of US adults buying the game, which could total to about 22.9 million copies sold and roughly $1.6 billion in revenue.</p><p>That means that, unlike former Saints Row developer Chris Stockman, who said in an October 2025 Esports Insider interview that he "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/at-least-one-dev-hopes-gta-6-is-100/1100-6535457/" data-ref-id="1100-6535457">really hope[s]</a>"GTA 6 launches at $100, most others in MIDiA Research's study completely disagree with this feeling.</p><p>However, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-addresses-rumored-price-hike-for-grand-theft-auto-6/1100-6533788/" data-ref-id="1100-6533788">dodged questions around raising game prices</a>, so we just have no clue how much GTA 6 will cost when it launches on May 26, 2026 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p>Game developer Hideo Kojima is famous for his unconventional approach to, well, everything he does--but even one of his sillier marketing moves for PS5 title Death Stranding 2: On the Beach didn't immediately hit as intended.</p><p>Speaking to Japanese magazine <a href="https://ananweb.jp/categories/entertainment/62013" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">An-An</a> (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/no-one-was-accepting-hideo-kojimas-free-death-stranding-2-tissues-on-the-streets-of-tokyo-until-he-tweeted-about-it-online/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automation</a>), Kojima recalled an on-the-ground marketing stunt that he and other Kojima Productions team members carried out in the streets of Tokyo, passing out Death Stranding 2-branded tissue packs that included a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/secret-death-stranding-2-video-has-been-revealed-but-dont-get-too-excited/1100-6531775/" data-ref-id="1100-6531775">QR code for a rather cryptic trailer</a> of the game.</p><p>It's a campaign that might sound unusual to some, but passing out tissue packs was once a common advertising tactic in Japan, akin to advertising businesses on matchboxes. The idea here is that passersby are being handed something with functionality instead of simple flyers, which are promptly discarded afterward.</p><p>Kojima himself admitted that the practice was outdated, but the act of physically handing objects to people was in line with the themes of his game. Unfortunately for Kojima and his compatriots, no one was biting.</p><p>"Hardly anyone was willing to take one. Even when I reached out, they wouldn’t take it. They’d walk away without even making eye contact. Some even went out of their way to avoid us, as if they were walking around something dangerous," Kojima said.</p><p>It's fair to attribute that aversion to human interaction to the shifting cultural norms after the COVID-19 pandemic, along with the prevalence of digital advertising.

            <p>EA and Battlefield Studios have confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> has sold over 7m copies since launch, breaking records for the series.</p>
<p>In an official press release from EA, interesting stats are featured prominantly. In addition to sales, over 172m online matches have been played across all platforms. On top of that, the game was watched for over 15m hours on streaming services like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a> and YouTube during its launch weekend.</p>
<p>This official statement <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-has-sold-over-seven-million-copies-in-five-days-data-analyst-company-claims">confirms estimates laid out by an industry analyst earlier in the week</a>. These analysts from Alinea Analytics also believed that roughly 55 percent of players came from Steam alone.</p>

<p>Alongside the celebratory press release, quotes from senior Battlefield 6 leads were included that offer a peek into the sentiment at EA and from Battlefield's developers.</p>
<p>Battlefield general manager Byron Beede wrote: "First and foremost we want to thank our players. Battlefield 6 was built with our fans. From the initial concept through to the implementation of Battlefield Labs and into the record-shattering Open Beta we have been obsessed with player feedback. Together, with our players we've had a singular goal: to craft the best Battlefield ever. And this is just the beginning - our first season of new content is just 12 days away."</p><p>Executive vice president Vince Zampella added his own thoughts, writing: "We never take moments like this for granted, so I want to express our sincere gratitude to our global Battlefield Studios and passionate community that has helped get us to this point. We appreciate you joining us for Battlefield 6's momentous launch. We have so much more to come in the weeks ahead."</p>
<p>It's a milestone moment for EA, especially given the history of Battlefield and its lesser presence over recent years. If you've not played it yet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">why not read Eurogamer's Battlefield 6 review</a>! In it, Rick Lane writes: "Battlefield 6 delivers a thrilling multiplayer reset and a decent, if derivative single-player. But it still displays nagging doubts about what makes Battlefield special."</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how Call of Duty compares this year, especially given the feud between both Battlefield 6 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> that has been continuously bubbling away this year. Who knows? Maybe the tide is turning on the king of mass-market FPS games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following Alinea Analytics' report that Battlefield 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-smash-hit-more-6-5-million-units-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had sold more than six and a half million units</a>, publisher Electronic Arts has now confirmed that the game has indeed sold more than seven million copies just in the first three days.</p>



<p>This means Battlefield 6 is officially the biggest franchise launch ever. Over 172 million matches were played online during the first weekend, and players accumulated over 15 million hours of streaming. As previously reported, the game also <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-servers-hit-capacity-at-launch-steam-charts-747k-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">registered the most concurrent players in Battlefield history</a>. </p>



<p>Byron Beede, General Manager of Battlefield, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>First and foremost we want to thank our players. Battlefield 6 was built with our fans. From the initial concept through to the implementation of Battlefield Labs and into the record-shattering Open Beta we have been obsessed with player feedback. Together, with our players we've had a singular goal: to craft the best Battlefield ever. And this is just the beginning - our first season of new content is just 12 days away.</em></p>



<p>Vince Zampella, Executive Vice President, added:</p>



<p><em>We never take moments like this for granted, so I want to express our sincere gratitude to our global Battlefield Studios and passionate community that has helped get us to this point. We appreciate you joining us for Battlefield 6’s momentous launch. We have so much more to come in the weeks ahead.</em></p>



<p>The game earned an 8.5 score in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wccftech's review by David Carcasole</a>, who pointed out that while the single player campaign is lackluster, the multiplayer modes are rock solid, marking the franchise's comeback after Battlefield V and 2042.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the developers are <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-naval-warfare-reportedly-in-development-ea-battlefield-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">allegedly already working to add naval warfare</a>. On the live servers, they have also <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-gets-reduced-ticket-count-conquest-mode-players-arent-happy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reduced the starting ticket count on Conquest maps</a>, although that change didn't go over too well with the community.</p>

No giggling allowed. Obey the track limits, spend hours playing around with damper setups, do not touch my bumper or I'll call three different police forces level of serious.

<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/iracing">iRacing</a> Arcade, its new sibling with a Steam Next Fest demo, is thankfully not as serious.</p>

<p>"Funlop", reads the parody-centric text scrawled across a bridge over the game's version of the Japanese Tsukuba Circuit. To be honest, the simple fact developers Original Fire Games and iRacing have opted for a classic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gran-turismo">Gran Turismo</a> track as the venue for the single Porsche one-make race which makes up the Next Fest demo had me 90% sold before I'd even turned a wheel.</p><p>First up was a two-lap qualifying session, with each 911 out on track at the same time, but separated by intervals. As I quickly found out, getting close to another car in one of these sessions just sees it turn into a ghost to prevent collisions, so even if you race up to those in front, there's no danger of being blocked. However, you can very much get a track limits penalty which slaps you with a temporary forced slowdown period as punishment for your corner cutting. It's a reminder in case you needed one that this is still iRacing, so you'd better locate the brake pedal rather than trying to bounce at full speed off of walls, sonny Jim.</p>
<p>Provided you keep it between the lines, driving the licensed GT racer with a controller is brilliant. The model's a cute mini-me of a full-size 911, but packs the same punchy soundtrack of straight-six screaming. It feels great to fling into one of Tsukuba's tight hairpins, and tricky to balance on the edge of adhesion as you try to maximise velocity through the flowing chicane midway through the lap or hang on for dear life through the sweeping right of the final corner.</p>
<p>Once the grid's decided, it's on into a six lap race, which sadly doesn't allow you to test out the cartoon pit crews standing vigilant watch along the pit lane. To be fair, Tsukuba's a less than 30 second tour in a iRacing Arcade's Porsches, so there's hardly enough tyre wear in this length of sprint to warrant fresh rubber. Things get nice and chaotic right away if you're running mid-pack, with the AI drivers glomming together like swarms of hornets to try and dice your way through.</p>
<p>Shhh. Come here so I can whisper this without big iRacing hearing. You can drive into people. You won't get penalised. Each minor hit will only cost you a single one of your car's very generous hundred health points. These bumps and scraps are nowhere near as satisfying or played up as they are in more anarchic arcade racers, only offering a dull thunk resulting in little to no visible damage on contact, but this is progress. Who knows, in ten years time we might get iRacing's take on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckfest">Wreckfest</a>.</p><p>Admittedly having not double checked the assigned handbrake button, I also couldn't manage to get the rear-wheel-drive racer drifting all that much. Please keep that quiet too, I don't want to get a letter in the post which reads 'LOOK AFTER YOUR TYRES. GRAINING, MARBLES, CONTACT PATCHES, SIDEWALLS. DO THESE HOLY TERMS MEAN NOTHING TO YOU, HEATHEN?'. I apologise, o racers of the lowercase i. </p>
<p>iRacing Arcade's due to release on December 2nd this year, and you can grab the keys to its Next Fest demo from its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3226450/iRacing_Arcade/">Steam page</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning, folks! I’m back after my week-long vacation. A big thanks to Ethan for handling Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news and other stuff you might care about, for the last week. But the vacation is over, and I bring you news about Nintendo getting hacked, another Sony franchise leaping to PC, 2K not giving up on that extraction shooter it announced last year, Sakurai’s manga, and a report that Jim Carrey might star in an upcoming <em>Jetsons</em> movie.</p> <h2><strong>Nintendo Claims Nothing Was Leaked Following Recent Hack Attempt</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/nintendo-allegedly-hacked-by-crimson-collective-hacking-group-screenshot-shows-leaked-folders-production-assets-developer-files-and-backups">Earlier this month,</a> hacker group Crimson Collective claimed to have gained access to private, unreleased Nintendo information and data. However, the company behind Mario has pushed back against these claims, <a href="https://www.sankei.com/article/20251015-6H66THKNKJKJLCI2BKXWZYB72Y/">sharing in a statement</a> that no “personal” or dev-related info was leaked, though the company did confirm some external servers that display Nintendo’s website were affected.</p>

 <p>“We have not confirmed any leak of personal information, and there has been no leak of development or business information,” claimed Nintendo.</p> <h2><strong><em>MLB The Show</em> Might Be Getting A PC Port In The Future</strong></h2> <p>Sony’s San Diego Studio, the company behind the long-running and popular baseball sim <em>MLB The Show</em>, is currently looking to hire a “Senior PC Graphics Programmer” for a “AAA PC” game. Hmmmm. What could that game possibly be? Oh, it’s probably <em>MLB The Show</em>. The franchise has become the de facto MLB game over the last few years and even made the leap to Xbox and Switch due to a lack of other baseball sims and pressure from the MLB. So it would make sense that Sony’s baseball series would land on PC, too.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">PlayStation Studios – San Diego Studio (MLB The Show) is seeking a Senior PC Graphics Programmer for a "AAA PC title" <a href="https://t.co/arat0yL1W2">https://t.co/arat0yL1W2</a> <a href="https://t.co/WsMRDaFKD9">pic.twitter.com/WsMRDaFKD9</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1978574996575490486?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2><strong>2K Isn’t Giving Up On That Extraction Shooter You Already Forgot About</strong></h2> <p>Remember colorful, <a href="https://kotaku.com/project-ethos-2k-games-twitch-f2p-fortnite-overwatch-1851675279"><em>Fortnite</em>-like extraction hero shooter <em>Project Ethos</em></a>? Probably not. I write about games for a living, and I forgot about this thing until just now. <em>Project Ethos</em> is from 2K-owned 31st Union and was announced last year to a resounding “meh” from folks online. <a href="https://kotaku.com/michael-condrey-projet-ethos-31st-union-2k-games-1851756173">We’ve not heard much about the game since then</a>, but as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2k-reaffirms-support-for-project-ethos-names-apex-legends-executive-producer-as-head-of-31st-union">reported by <em>IGN</em></a>, an internal memo indicates the game isn’t dead. In fact, 2K has brought on Ben Brinkman, a longtime executive producer on<em> Apex Legends</em>, to help develop the game. I’ll be curious the next time we get a look at <em>Project Ethos</em> and see what’s changed since its big reveal in 2024.</p>

 <h2><strong>A New Manga Based On The Life Of Masahiro Sakurai Is Out Soon</strong></h2> <p>Masahiro Sakurai, the creator behind <em>Super Smash Bros.</em> and Kirby, is getting a manga adaptation of his life. <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/images/202510/55235/506460">As reported by <em>Famitsu</em>,</a> the 160-page book will be released in Japan on November 18. There are currently no plans to release the manga in the United States. Sakurai supervised the creation of the book, which will launch two days before <a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-trailer-2000618410"><em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a>, directed by Sakurai, arrives on Nintendo Switch 2.

Sure! I guess. I mean, why not? They made a <em>Flintstones</em> live-action movie (and it got a sequel), so I guess it’s only fair that <em>The Jetsons</em> get their own Hollywood movie. I’m not sure how many people are chomping at the bit for this reported adaptation, which might explain why the studio is going after Jim Carrey for the starring role. As someone who doesn’t care at all about <em>The Jetsons</em>, I’m mildly interested in seeing this movie simply because it might have Jim Carrey in it, and I’m always down to see him be a cinematic buffoon.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-singalong-theater-return-halloween-2000635744"><em>KPOP Demon Hunters</em> Is Coming Back To Theaters&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-review-performance-issues-steam-deck-switch-2-2000635652">Xbox’s new handheld device is fine, but expensive</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-plants-vs-zombies-remastered-replanted-trailer-cringe-fake-twitch-stream-2000635689">This new trailer for the remastered PvZ game is hard to watch</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

              <p>LEGO has officially rolled out its full lineup of Advent calendars for 2025 and the holiday deals are already turning heads. As the countdown to December begins, several sets are seeing unexpected discounts but they’re unlikely to last long. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4264/">LEGO Minecraft Advent calendar is now available at an all‑time low price of $26, down from $44.99</a>, which makes it the <strong>cheapest LEGO Advent calendar</strong> on Amazon right now. With the popular City Advent Calendar already sold out, this Minecraft edition is now the best‑seller.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4264/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Daily Dose of Minecraft Fun</h2>
<p>One of the joys of the Advent season is the combination of excitement and reminiscence and that tiny moment each day when you pull back the wrapper on a new surprise in the run‑up to Christmas. LEGO has made that experience a playtime ritual for youngsters and nostalgic adults in equal measure. The Minecraft Advent calendar brings the popular blocky world to the table with <strong>24 buildable gifts designed to keep holiday mornings fun</strong> and creative.</p>



<p>Apart from the holiday break, the building setups and models are completely <strong>compatible with current LEGO Minecraft building sets</strong>. So the enjoyment needn’t cease at Christmas: it merely extends your child’s block-constructed world.</p>
<p>Amazon customers seem to agree, <strong>with the 2025 edition sporting a very respectable 4.8‑star rating</strong>. The reviews speak repeatedly about the value vs. fun equation, and specifically at this sale price. And with the holiday stock cycles for LEGO in view, the discount now seems less like an overstock sale and more like a scarce early‑bird discount.</p>
<p>A word of caution: after Halloween, Advent calendars begin to disappear from the shelves of Amazon at lightening speed. Since this one happens to be at its all‑time lowest price and reduced in price by no less than 40% already, early shoppers are in for a treat since this is a total bargain.</p>
