<p>The 'Freeze Break' event kicked off today (<strong>20th Jan</strong>) and will be sticking around until <strong>27th Jan at 7:59am GMT / 8:59am CET / 11:59 PT (26th)</strong> — so there's plenty of time to get in and grab the rewards.</p>

<p>As we've seen previously, 'Freeze Break' will challenge you to complete the Emerald Rush roguelike mode only using a limited number of perks and upgrades. This one takes place entirely on the Freezer Layer, fittingly, so prepare to mix up your approach with whatever boosts are available.</p>

			<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-marathon-release-date-following-xbox-store-leak/">In a little over a month</a></strong>, Bungie will release <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Marathon</strong>, an extraction shooter that found itself at the center of<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">controversy</a></strong> and was eventually <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">delayed</strong> following its somewhat disappointing <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">early showings</strong>.</p>



<p>The launch of the studio's first new IP in years since the launch of Destiny in 2014, however, will be remarkable even for those who own a <strong>PlayStation 5 Pro</strong> but may not be fans of the team which created the iconic <a href="https://wccftech.com/its-a-bold-claim-to-reconnect-with-the-community-without-multiplayer-can-halo-campaign-evolved-really-bring-players-back-together/"><strong>Halo</strong></a> back in the days of the original Xbox, as <em>Marathon</em> will be putting the power of the system to some interesting use.</p>



<p>In the game's <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marathon/"><strong>landing page on the PlayStation Official Website</strong></a>, it is confirmed that the extraction shooter will be a PS5 Pro Enhanced title. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"PS5 Pro Enhanced PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) blends 5K internal rendering into a clean, stable 4K image so your Runner’s view stays sharp, even when the action gets hectic,"</em> the dedicated box on the website reads.</p>



<p>Barring a potential mistake, this would make <em>Marathon</em> the first P<strong>layStation 5 Pro Enhanced competitive title that renders internally at 5K resolution</strong>. Although this isn't really surprising, considering the power of the Sony console and how the game doesn't seem to be <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-reveals-mild-marathon-pc-system-requirements/">extremely demanding</a></strong>, it may have made more sense to tout how the <strong>PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution would deliver a 4K resolution output with 120 FPS support</strong>, which would definitely be preferable for a shooter than the sharpest image quality., </p>



<p>Hopefully, the system will still be able to deliver the high-framerate <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">gameplay experience that is perfect for a game such as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Marathon</em>, possibly with the&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">new version of PlaySt</strong></span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ation Spectral Super Resolution,&nbsp;</strong>which will reportedly be available by March 2026. What is colloquially known as <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-2-higher-quality-proper-4k-120-fps/">PSSR 2.0</a></strong> is said to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-2-0-is-allegedly-launching-between-january-and-march-delivering-higher-resolution-for-classic-games/">significantly boost </a></strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-2-0-is-allegedly-launching-between-january-and-march-delivering-higher-resolution-for-classic-games/"><strong>performance</strong></a>, which would definitely help a game rendering at a high internal resolution achieve higher framerates.</p>

It's coming to PC and Xbox Series X|S (and, presumably, other platforms) on March 26th.</p><p>The goal, according to the <em>Life Is Strange </em>team, is to give Chloe and Max "the ending they deserve" and to provide a "thrilling finale" to the stories of both characters in a reunion "thought impossible".

<p>If you're wondering how Chloe was able to return after the events of the original <em>Life Is Strange</em>, well, the team says it "may be due to Max's power", making reference to the conclusion of 2024's episodic<em> Double Exposure</em>, in which Max merged parallel timelines and recovered her Rewind ability.</p><p>Chloe, however, is "no prize to be won", as the <em>Life Is Strange </em>folks say; she's her own woman, which is why she'll be the co-protagonist of this game alongside Max.</p><p>They'll be trying to find their way back to each other over the course of <em>Reunion</em>, each offering "alternating views of the world" and "different-but-complementary perspectives" on the events of the story.</p><p>Once again, Max is able to rewind time, a power she'll be using to both escape and get herself into some pretty tricky situations. Chloe's Backtalk ability returns, too, allowing her to smart-talk her conversation partners.</p><figure role="group">

            <link>https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-reunion-chloe-announcement-release-date-2000661323</link>
            <guid>1411138</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-5-reunion-chloe-max-summary-plot-leak-2000658198">The rumors were true</a>. <em>Life Is Strange: Reunion</em> is coming, and it’s bringing Chloe Price back into the fold after 2024’s <em>Double Exposure&nbsp;</em>hinted at her return. Perhaps most surprisingly, however, it’s coming out in just two months.</p> <p>The official announcement is <a href="https://x.com/LifeIsStrange/status/2011829955592585531?s=20">set to go live at 1 p.m. Eastern</a>, but Xbox Wire posted <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/20/life-is-strange-reunion-reveal/">its announcement blog a bit early</a>.&nbsp;<em>Reunion&nbsp;</em>will star both Max Caulfield and Chloe as co-protagonists, with both having different gameplay mechanics. Max is able to rewind time as she did in the first&nbsp;<em>Life Is Strange</em>, while Chloe will use her argumentative “Backtalk” mechanic from the prequel&nbsp;<em>Before the Storm</em>.</p>

 <p>The big question is how Chloe is able to return despite her possibly dying at the end of the original&nbsp;<em>Life Is Strange</em>, a choice that&nbsp;<em>Double Exposure&nbsp;</em>made a point to import. Based on this line in the blog post, it seems like it may be as a result of the timeline jumping Max did in&nbsp;<em>Double Exposure</em>, though I expect the minutiae of this to be affected by which choice you made way back in 2015.</p> <blockquote><p>Chloe’s return may be due to Max’s power, in particular, the power Max gained in <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em>&nbsp;to Shift between parallel timelines — a power Max subsequently lost when she merged those timelines back together and recovered her ability to Rewind.</p></blockquote> <p>Whatever the case, it does seem like&nbsp;<em>Reunion</em> is not undoing either choice, as the blog says “Whether Chloe lived or died in Arcadia Bay, and whether she and Max were friends or lovers — these choices are key not just to the&nbsp;<em>past</em>&nbsp;you’ll confirm as you play, but to the&nbsp;<em>future&nbsp;</em>you’ll fight for the chance to build.” So I will hold judgement for the time being, and I won’t have to wait long, as&nbsp;<em>Reunion</em> is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on March 26.</p>

 <p>It’s very likely that more details will be coming when developer Deck Nine posts its actual announcement, so we’ll update this story with that info as it comes.</p>

<p>Microsoft has announced the next Life Is Strange game, “Life is Strange: Reunion,” which will conclude the story of fan favorites Max and Chloe. Due out on March 26, the game is coming to current-generation consoles, and <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/20/life-is-strange-reunion-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a> appears to have shared the news ahead of a dedicated stream officially announcing the next game in the series.</p>



<p>The title of the game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unannounced-life-is-strange-reunion-rated-by-pegi-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">revealed through a PEGI rating </a>early in January 2026, and now players know there’s just a little more than 2 months until they can begin the journey to end the story of Max and Chloe.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-fate-of-max-and-chloe-is-in-your-hands-in-life-is-strange-reunion">The Fate of Max and Chloe Is in Your Hands in Life Is Strange: Reunion</h2>



<p>Andrew James, the Senior Brand Manager of Life Is Strange, wrote the blog on Xbox Wire announcing the next game. In the piece, he spoke about his own emotional connection to the story and promised fans the opportunity to decide how to bring Max and Chloe’s story to a definitive conclusion.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Max and Chloe’s relationship is at the core of the story, a relationship that YOU will choose how to develop over the course of the game. Whether Chloe lived or died in Arcadia Bay, and whether she and Max were friends or lovers — these choices are key not just to the past you’ll confirm as you play, but to the future you’ll fight for the chance to build.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>A live stream is scheduled to begin at 1:00 p.m. ET on January 20, with further details provided by the development team. Insider Gaming may update this story with new information following the stream.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade has been out for a few years, but you poor Xbox and Nintendo Switch players have had to wait your turn. Square Enix has heard the cries of the planet, and yours, and the FF7 Remake Intergrade release date beckons for the forgotten consoles.</p>



<p>It feels like a lifetime ago that the FF7 Remake debuted on the PS4! It arrived during a weird time for the real world, mirroring the thematic struggles of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remakes-buster-sword-almost-had-a-more-realistic-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a>‘s planet. A lot of time has passed since then, so let’s check out the difference in platforms and new release dates.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-coming-out-on-xbox-series-x-s-amp-nintendo-switch-2">When Is Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade Coming Out On Xbox Series X|S &amp; Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Cloud nine. Credit to Square Enix</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>A January 22 release date is currently locked in for Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade on Xbox Series X|S and Nintendo Switch 2 owners.</strong></p>



<p>PlayStation has gotten to enjoy Intergrade for years, and even a PC port has been commissioned in between. The final bridge that needed to be crossed was the one connecting to Xbox and Nintendo. There were doubts if it was ever going to happen.</p>



<p>The timeline on this has been fun, though: Firstly, we heard in June 2025 that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-releasing-on-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Remake was finally releasing on Xbox</a>. After a few months, FF fans learned that the full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogy-officially-confirmed-for-xbox-and-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Trilogy was confirmed for Xbox and Switch 2</a>!</p>



<p>The experience should be amazing, but if you’re on Nintendo Switch 2, be warned that it will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-will-be-close-to-100gb-on-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">close to 100GB on Switch 2</a>!</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-buy-final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-on-ps5">Can You Buy Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade On PS5?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, a PS5 version of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade is real, and has been available since June 10, 2021.</strong></p>



<p>The PS4 was first associated with FF7 Remake and the Intergrade upgrade. However, it seemed sensible to clear up all platforms and reveal if Intergrade has made its Chocobo-w on PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>Come January 22, FF7 Remake Intergrade will be available on most main formats.</p>



<p>Let IG know if you’re planning on picking up the Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade on either Xbox Series X|S or Nintendo Switch 2. The place to do this is simple: <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Insider Gaming Official Discord Server</a>.</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s time to look ahead to FF7’s future. Read about the report that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-game-experience-is-more-or-less-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3’s game experience is ‘More or Less Complete’</a>.</p>

		<p>As anyone that watched the last few seasons of Lost will tell you, it’s quite difficult to go back to the island. That’s something that I definitely felt when loading back into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Thankfully, getting back to my island isn’t so traumatic. Having transferred from Switch to OLED to Switch 2, my old island from 2020 is still there, the one that I visited almost every day for over a year, and it’s been nice to revisit it, to soak in some of the relaxed charms, the idle busywork, and explore <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/15/the-animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-update-went-live-a-little-bit-early/">what’s new in Update 3.0</a>, but will it draw me back in to resume my daily grind? Will I become the new Jacob… again?</p>
<p><iframe title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons – Free Ver. 3.0 update, out now!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BVT_aPcKZZU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The best thing that Nintendo has done for Animal Crossing with this update is to bring it to both the Nintendo Switch 2 and original Switch. Everything from the new dockside hotel, through to Resetti and smaller quality of life improvements, is available across both systems. The paid Switch 2 upgrade is a fairly light garnish on top of this.</p>


<p>Let’s start with the headline feature, the new hotel on the pier, run by the Kapp’n family. While it’s obviously a shrunken-down echo of the Happy Home Paradise DLC, the hotel is still a lovely free addition to the game that tickles your interior designer creativity with eight hotel rooms to decorate and theme. It’s also a great way to explore the support for Joy-Con 2 mouse mode support on Switch 2, which brings a pretty natural and fluid way to click, drag and place items within a room. But there are limits to mouse mode, which are a touch disappointing, as you can only use it when decorating a building interior, and it really is just for placement, so you have to resort to buttons to sift through the billions of items it feels like you have in the design inventory.</p>


<p>There’s also a new crafting mission box, with Tom Nook asking you to craft specific items for Kapp’n to sell, with more hotel store tickets as a reward. For an established player, it’s pretty easy to dip into this, with the first four items of each day awarding double tickets. What makes it even easier is the excellent quality of life improvement, so that you can craft using materials from your home storage, instead of needing to fill your inventory with the specific materials, that your home storage can go up to 9,000 items now, and that you can craft in multiples. It drains so much of the tedium out of crafting that it will feel awful to go back to anything less.</p>

<p>Once you’ve exhausted the possibilities there, the challenge for a returning player is what to do next? There’s the temptation, between the new consoles and these new updates, to start a completely new island and reshape it from scratch, but that’s honestly not for me. There’s also the option to dramatically overhaul your existing island, and Resetti can help with cleaning up chunks of land for you, but I find that comes with a hefty mental burden as well. So I’m thankful for the new Slumber Island, to give a lower stress path to creating a new island without removing what you previously built up.</p>
<p>You have the full creative tools available to you in the Slumber Island, and you’re presented with a fresh island to act as your canvas. It’s great being able to really share this with other players, giving other players full creative input alongside you. I can absolutely see this mode as Nintendo experimenting with the future of Animal Crossing multiplayer and collaboration.</p>

<p>This brings us to the Switch 2 of it all, with a fairly demure upgrade tied to a relatively minimal fee. The game resolution has been improved, which helps a bit with clarity since you’re not forcing 720p on a 1080p screen, but it’s a fairly minor-feeling improvement, especially as the game remains at 30fps.</p>
<p>Heading online, Switch 2 players can enable CameraPlay alongside GameChat and have their face beamed across the internet in a little bubble by their character. That works both in a Switch 1 compatible session (though is only displayed for Switch 2), and in the expanded 12-player sessions that are for Switch 2 Edition players only. A nice feature for those still with a dozen friends and family who are keen for a big meet up, but not one that I was able to test to this extent. You do still have the same fussiness with the game halting every time someone flies in and out.</p>

<p>I think Nintendo struck a great balance while updating Animal Crossing: New Horizons for Nintendo Switch 2. It’s not really enough to transform the game back into a daily obsession for me, but I can appreciate what it offers to players that never left their island behind or who are coming to the game for the first time on Nintendo Switch 2. It’s still the ideal island escape from the real world and remains free of smoke monsters.</p>

<p>As easy as A, B, Sea</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sail_forth">Sail Forth</a> floated onto Switch back in 2022 with its adorable seafaring adventures reminding us of a beautiful blend of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/no_mans_sky">No Man's Sky</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a>. A little over three years on, developer Festive Vector and publisher The Quantum Astrophysicists Guild have launched a new version to make the most of the Switch 2's fancy features.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sail-forth-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Sail Forth - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, as it is creatively called, is now available on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Sail-Forth-1695260.html">Switch eShop</a> for <strong>$19.99</strong> <em>or</em> as a free upgrade pack to all those who already own the game.</p>
<p>There's no new content, per se (bar the last three years of updates and DLC), but it certainly sounds like a much better experience from a technical standpoint. The new edition boasts 1080p resolution in handheld, 4K in docked, faster load times and a boosted frame rate. Water shadows and reflections have now also been enabled, and there's the power to render more boats on screen at once.</p>

<p>It sounds like some welcome changes, especially given that our main gripes with the game back in 2022 were on the technical side of things. "While it isn’t perfectly put together, and the playful nature of the graphics might not be to everyone’s taste," we wrote in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/sail-forth">our review</a>, "Sail Forth has more going for it than against it." Hey, it might just be the perfect way to unwind on a grey January evening.</p>

            <p>Following such recent news highlights as "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathons-final-release-date-locked-in-by-bungie-with-the-shooter-finally-set-to-run-out-of-cover-soon">It’s out on March 5th</a>" and "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-reveals-marathon-cast-baldurs-gate-3-clair-obscur">It’s got that Ben Starr guy in it</a>," <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>’s announce-o-blaster continues firing with a newly unveiled set of PC system requirements. As seen on the Bungie FPS’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065800/Marathon/">Steam page</a>, they’re nicely accommodating to cheapo rigs and older tech, though are missing any storage requirements.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I wouldn’t bet on Marathon being much of an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming">SSD</a> muncher, though. Last year’s closed technical test barely bothered the scales with its 15GB download, and the fact that it only wants a 4GB Radeon RX 5500 XT as a minimum GPU suggests it’s not going to be stuffed to its hot pink robosuit seams with high-rez textures. Presumably none of which have been stolen, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-used-an-artists-work-without-permission-in-marathon">anymore</a>. Full specs are as follows:</p>
<h3>Marathon minimum PC specs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10 64-bit (latest Service Pack)</li>
<li><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel Core i5-6600 / AMD Ryzen 5 2600</li>
<li><strong>RAM:</strong> 8GB</li>
<li><strong>GPU:</strong> Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti (4GB) / AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT (4GB) / Intel Arc A580 (8GB, with ReBAR on)</li>
<li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 12</li>
<li><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection</li>
</ul>
<h3>Marathon recommended PC specs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10 64-bit (latest Service Pack)</li>
<li><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel Core i5-10400 / AMD Ryzen 5 3500</li>
<li><strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB</li>
<li><strong>GPU:</strong> Nvidia GeForce GTX 2060 (6GB) / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT (8GB) / Intel Arc A770 (16GB, with ReBAR on)</li>
<li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 12</li>
<li><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection</li>
</ul>
<p>And no, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-light-gets-updated-system-requirements-with-iois-apologies">there aren’t fictional processors in these ones</a>.</p>
<p>I like how Bungie have noted the need for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-is-resizable-bar-and-should-you-use-it">Resizable BAR</a> on Intel GPUs; a lot of modern PCs, especially prebuilts, will have this enabled already, but it serves to remind us of these budget cards’ most unusual quirk. It’s also nice to see a modern shooter keep its requirements down, in general; hopefully this in turn means MAXIMUM FRAMERATES GRRR ARGH for mightier PCs.</p><p>Not sure about the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, though. The sight of the GTX 1050 Ti in minimum specs is almost as reliable a shorthand for "Yes, this will run on tiny baby handheld hardware" as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-stress-again-that-therell-be-more-steam-machine-verified-games-than-steam-deck-ones-with-fewer-constraints-in-their-testing-programme">Valve’s own Verified programme</a>, but the real issue here is Marathon’s use of BattlEye anti-cheat. While this can work in harmony with SteamOS – <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/vendor/battleye/">Gaming on Linux</a> have a handy game compatibility list – it currently doesn’t on Bungie’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>, so Marathon is likely off the table as well. We’ll know for sure on March 5th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo presidents past and present are in the news this week. One of 2025’s biggest blockbusters might finally have a Switch 2 release date again. And if you bought <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> and barely played it, you’re hardly alone. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture.</p> <p>It’s currently <a href="https://kotaku.com/reviews/backlog">Backlog Week around these parts</a>. I spent the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend playing a ridiculous amount of <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-october-november-2025-powerwash-sim-2-2000638198"><em>Dome Keeper</em></a> with my kids. It came to Game Pass recently and is a clever little roguelite tower defense game that’s surprisingly hard to put down. The winter doldrums are ending this week, though. Lots of fresh 2026 releases are just around the corner.</p>

 <h2><em>Borderlands 4</em> seems slated to finally release on Switch 2 in February</h2> <p>A store listing on Portuguese site <em><a href="https://www.gamingreplay.com/pt/pre-reservas-nintendo-switch-2/32061-borderlands-4-game-key-card-switch-2-5026555072694.html">GamingReplay</a></em> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/borderlands-4-switch-2-release-date/"><em>TheGamer</em></a>) states a release date of February 27, 2026 for the sci-fi sequel. That’s a Thursday, so that tracks. It also puts it after a potential February Nintendo Direct to perhaps remind everyone it’s still coming. The port was <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-switch-2-delay-cross-save-performance-2000628055">indefinitely delayed</a> last fall as Gearbox Entertainment addressed performance issues with the PC version of the loot shooter.</p> <h2>It’s a good thing<em> The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em> didn’t charge by gameplay minute actually completed</h2> <p>Alinea Analytics’ <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rhyselliott_my-ps5s-an-xbox-now-apparently-earlier-share-7417556440577470464-cl55/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rhys Elliot recently pointed out</a> (via <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-sold-just-over-a-million-copies-on-ps5-but-50-of-gamers-played-just-15-hours-before-quitting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>FRVR</em></a>) that while <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> sold over 1 million copies on PS5, about half of those buyers played less than 15 hours of the sprawling RPG. The Steam data is similarly stark. <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/oblivion-remastered-ps5-half-players-15-hours/">Per <em>TheGamer</em></a>, only 55 percent of PC players got the game’s first story quest achievement, only 11 percent entered the Shivering Isles, and only 7.5 percent completed the main quest.</p>

 <h2><em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em> just had its best sales month in over 8 years</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sales for both BG3 and D:OS 2 have been incredible since the announcement of  Divinity. </p> <p>D:OS 2 really surprised us by having its best month since release in 2017.  Wish I’d removed the squirrel in time 🙂 <a href="https://t.co/fXTEUtuS7r">https://t.co/fXTEUtuS7r</a></p> <p>— Swen Vincke @where? (@LarAtLarian) <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/2013481225030094906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The announcement of <em>Divinity</em> in December spurred players to return to both<em> Baldur’s Gate 3</em> and the 2017 RPG. No doubt part of that was a big Switch 2 upgrade and a half-off sale.</p>

 <h2><em>World of Warcraft</em> veteran will work on Riot’s MMO</h2> <p>Blizzard producer Raymond Bartos has joined Riot Games (via <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2026/01/19/riot-games-unnamed-mmorpg-project-picks-up-a-former-world-of-warcraft-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cy="styled-link"><em>MassivelyOP</em></a>). “I’m incredibly excited to be joining Riot on the MMO team!!!” he posted. “I’m deeply grateful for the opportunity to join such an inspiring group of people, and I can’t wait to get started — showing up every day to provide value for Riot gamers and help deliver an MMO experience players truly enjoy.” He’ll be back with past collaborator Orlando Salvatore and said he thinks the team will be “moving fast on day one.”</p> <h2>New <em>Fable</em> art work has surfaced</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fable | Concept Art<a href="https://t.co/OuQzqybQut">https://t.co/OuQzqybQut</a> <a href="https://t.co/ci23N0n0xW">pic.twitter.com/ci23N0n0xW</a></p> <p>— Klobrille (@klobrille) <a href="https://twitter.com/klobrille/status/2013499425688039483?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It looks very neat (via<em> <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/fable-rebootconcept-art-showcase-locations">MP1st</a></em>). Will it be a modern open-world RPG? Who knows. But hopefully at least some of the game’s scenes can match the promise of its concept art. Will it actually come out in 2026? I’m still skeptical.</p>

 <h2>A message from Nintendo of America’s new leader</h2> <p>Recently promoted veteran Devon Pritchard appeared in a video at the New York Game Awards to encourage the next generation of creators (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-of-americas-new-president-devon-pritchard-makes-her-first-industry-appearance-since-taking-on-the-role/"><em>VGC</em></a>). “And remember, like any good video game character, you’re on an adventure, and every step you take matters,” she said. “There are some gnarly bosses, sure, but also many good friends along the way who will support you and powerful rewards for those who persevere. So, keep believing, keep playing, and know that you truly belong in this game.”</p> <h2>Doug Bowser joins Hasbro’s Board of Directors</h2> <p>The ex-Nintendo of America president <a href="https://newsroom.hasbro.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hasbro-announces-additions-board-directors">will now be part of the corporate governance team</a> overseeing the owner of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, <em>Transformers</em>, and more. Is this the first step toward Nintendo doing a Universes Beyond <em>MTG</em> set? Probably not but I would, against my better judgement, buy the hell out of one.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-baldurs-gate-3-takedown-2000660987">A<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em> VR mod has been nuked after its creator tried to charge people for it</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-lawsuit-ubisoft-marc-alexis-cote-hexe-2000660833">The former head of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> is suing Ubisoft over allegedly pushing him out of the company</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/i-cant-stop-flicking-coins-and-hiring-tiny-dudes-in-this-new-steam-game-2000660664">This coin-flicking indie game is surprisingly good</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <p>Hytale boss Simon Collins-Laflamme has called the Minecraft-like's recent early access launch "the most challenging but rewarding experience" of his life.</p>
<p>Hytale <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-a-brand-new-game-from-giants-of-the-minecraft-community">started development in 2015</a> and soon began garnering a lot of attention. However, Riot Games, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-snaps-up-studio-behind-promising-minecraft-like-sandbox-game-hytale">acquired Hytale developer Hypixel Studios in 2020</a>, opted to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-minecraft-like-hytale-cancelled-after-ten-years-in-development">cancel the project last June</a>. Thankfully, though, Hytale was saved when Hypixel co-founder Collins-Laflamme <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-saved-riot-sells-cancelled-minecraft-like-game-back-to-its-original-co-founder">successfully re-acquired the game from Riot</a> at the end of last year. Then, seven days ago, and after years of waiting, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-launch-million-players">Hytale finally released in early access</a>.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the past week, Collins-Laflamme has now thanked the community for its support, and offered a "big thank you" to the "rebuilt Hytale team" for trusting him to get the game "to the finish line" in just a few months.</p>
<p>"I haven't been involved with Hytale development for many years and coming back was a big unknown and risk for me, and my family," Collins-Laflamme <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2013636980626595976">wrote on social media</a>. "I fully trusted the people and it just worked. Amazing team, every single one made a big difference."</p><p>Ahead of Hytale's release, Hypixel announced its Minecraft-alike <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-awaited-minecraft-a-like-hytale-has-already-sold-enough-to-fund-the-next-two-years-of-development-and-its-not-even-out-yet">had already sold enough copies to fund the next two years of development</a>. "Combined with my personal commitment of ten years," Collins-Laflamme said at the time, "we are looking very strong for the future."</p>

            <p>Raymond Bartos, producer on the World of Warcraft team, has announced his new role at a rival studio. He'll now be working on a whole new MMO, the much-anticipated and very mysterious Riot Games MMO no less.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7417390270268329984/">In a post on Bartos' Linkedin</a>, he wrote the following alongside a collection of pictures at Riot Games' LA office: "From my very first conversation with Riot, I immediately gravitated toward their values--and I was genuinely impressed by how clearly those values showed up throughout the interview process. It made it obvious that kindness, respect, and care aren't just words here, but something the team truly lives by.</p>
<p>"I'm deeply grateful for the opportunity to join such an inspiring group of people, and I can't wait to get started--showing up every day to provide value for Riot gamers and help deliver an MMO experience players truly enjoy."</p>

<p>Bartos was part of the team which shipped the popular Plunderstorm mode for World of Warcraft, as well as multiple limited-time remix modes and the game's 20th anniversary event. Bartos also noted he'll be working alongside one Orlando Salvatore, another former World of Warcraft veteran who jumped ship to Riot Games late last year.</p><p>There are in fact quite a few big names, formerly of Blizzard, that have ended up working on this MMO. Natalia Leenhardt was an 11-year alumni at the company before joining Amazon Game Studios in 2021 for New World, later joining the Riot Games MMO team in 2023. Kevin Carter joined Riot back in 2017 after over ten years at Blizzard, and of course the old executive producer on the Riot MMO Greg Street was a legendary World of Warcraft developer,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/league-of-legends-mmo-producer-departing-riot-games"> though he left back in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>So what do we know about the Riot MMO? Not much! We know it's set in the Runeterra universe, like most of Riot Games' works are. We know the game had a "reset in direction" some years ago, and that there's been very little in the way of on-the-record discussion about it. That is, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkyjsM31Epk">except for an interview with League lore content creator Necrit back in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>So there's been no word of any sort of reveal as of yet, nor any sort of timeline as to when we're likely to see it happen. Still, the continued hiring of staff is certainly a good indicator that serious work is being done.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>On March 25, 1996, on stage at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles, Will Smith announced the winner of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg84O9AldXk&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Academy Award for Best Visual Effects</u></a>, <em>Babe</em>. Four crew members accepted the award. The last to speak, Scott E. Anderson, spent his precious seconds at the mic saluting the film’s director. "To Chris Noonan," he said, holding the golden statuette aloft, "this is for you, your friends, and your friendship. Thanks a lot."</p><p>On May 9, 2021, in a share house in Sydney's inner west, Xavier Rubetzki Noonan was nearing their own <em>Babe</em> triumph. Not only were they completing the PlayStation 2 video game of the same name, but they were claiming the game’s first ever speedrun record in a Twitch livestream. Under Xavier’s careful guidance, Babe moved one last sheep into the pen, and the screen lit up with fireworks, a gold trophy, and the words "Champion Pig - Well Done" written in Comic Sans. "World record!" Xavier cheered, before cautiously adding: "Maybe!"</p><p>Xavier would be the first to admit this doesn’t quite match the globally televised spectacle of the Oscars. Nevertheless, it is the unique and charming way they have honoured their uncle Chris, whose name adorns the beloved story of a pig turned sheepherder that just marked its 30th anniversary.</p><p>With a Rotten Tomatoes score of 97% and a further four Oscar nominations, <em>Babe</em> is a considerable artistic achievement in the Noonan family. It entered Xavier’s life at a very young age, when Chris sent them letters from the set in Robertson, Australia. Being too young to appreciate the magnitude of the George Miller-produced endeavour, Xavier enjoyed more innocuous details.&nbsp;</p><p>“This isn’t a movie that’s full of every kid’s favourite movie star,” they told Aftermath. “If I had heard that Danny DeVito was involved or something, that would have warmed me up a bit. But instead of getting any of that information, I was being told, ‘We did a big scene with ducks today. There were so many ducks.’ And that was what was getting me fired up as a kid. ‘Woah, my uncle met a horse?'"</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yuzXPzgBDvo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Babe Official Trailer #1 - Miriam Margolyes Movie (1995)"></iframe></figure><p>Global audiences enjoyed the movie’s plentiful talking animals, but its pastoral charm and fierce championing of kindness have made it stand the test of time. For Xavier, the personal connection planted it firmly in the land of the real, even as it landed Uncle Chris on an Oscars broadcast with the likes of Nicole Kidman and Oprah Winfrey – a “mind-boggling assortment of people,” as Xavier put it. And once the statuette came home and years rolled on, the whole affair played an important, though not all-encompassing, role in Xavier’s own love for the film. “I think part of what interested me about cinema in my early years of liking movies was ‘what is this thing that my uncle did?’ And rather than probably just talking to him about it or getting a better understanding through him, I was just trying to pull this apart for my own.”</p><p>Adulthood brought about several idiosyncratic pursuits in Xavier’s life, including musical performance with beloved Australian pop acts like <a href="https://www.ben-lee.com/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Ben Lee</u></a> and <a href="https://hidrspaceman.bandcamp.com/music?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Dr Spaceman</u></a>, a decade of podcasting on the reality TV recap series <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bohpod/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Bachelor of Hearts</u></em></a>, and a prolific run of cinematic musings on <a href="https://letterboxd.com/xavierrn/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Letterboxd</u></a>. But when COVID lockdowns in 2020 and 2021 drastically limited such endeavours, the porcine family legacy revealed itself again in a most unexpected way.</p><p>First to fill the void of interaction for Xavier was Twitch streaming, which was enjoying a wider audience in this unprecedented time. “There was a real concerted effort to make Twitch not just a place for gaming and gamers,” Xavier said, “despite the fact that I ended up just using it for gaming stuff anyway.” Xavier started their own streaming career with <em>Clone Hero</em> guitar sessions, then crossed over into playthroughs of games like <em>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</em> and <em>Resident Evil </em>(2002). Later, Xavier found inspiration in speedrunning, the subculture that breaks beloved titles into small parts by finishing them as quickly as possible. Most inspiring of all to Xavier was the way it didn’t discriminate between good and bad games. Sometimes, the more scorned the game was, the more entertaining its run could be.&nbsp;</p><figure data-kg-thumbnail="https://aftermath.site/content/media/2026/01/AT-cm_1244807956_thumb.jpg" data-kg-custom-thumbnail="">

        <img src="https://aftermath.site/content/media/2026/01/AT-cm_1244807956_thumb.jpg"></figure><p>Xavier saw the chance to spotlight unloved games from their youth, and they didn’t come much more unloved than licensed movie tie-ins, games that turned successful blockbusters into insipid but profitable merchandise for children. Xavier vividly remembers one instance of this during a teenage birthday, when they asked for a copy of the unmistakable mega-hit <em>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</em>. “My parents cottoned on to some of the stuff that was going on in there, and they were like, ‘that’s not gonna happen.’ So instead, they got me <em>Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events</em>, the movie, the game, for the PlayStation 2. You could not imagine a more disappointing birthday!”</p><p>Out of this mildly traumatic memory came a desire to broaden the scope of speedrunning past its usual suspects and into the uninspiring brand products of yesteryear. Hence, <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/users/XavierRN?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Xavier’s speedrun.com profile</u></a> boasts record-setting runs for a murderer’s row of licensed fare, including <em>The Bachelor</em> for Nintendo DS, two different Paddington Bear games (one of Xavier’s favourite series), and – most importantly – a 2006 PS2 game based on the same plucky pig that catapulted their uncle to the world stage.</p><p><em>Babe</em> for PS2 is a punishing game. It was developed by Blast Entertainment, which in its relatively short existence from 2006 to 2009 put out several shovelware spin-offs like <em>Garfield’s Lasagna World Tour</em>, <em>Mr Bean</em>, and <em>Little Britain: The Game</em>, the latter of which boasts <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/little-britain-the-video-game/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a 4.2 on Metacritic</u></a>. The premise of its <em>Babe</em> reduction makes basic sense: play as Babe himself, herd sheep into their pens, and become the best sheep-pig in history. Where this goes awry is its isometric puzzle gameplay, which turns “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MbFux7_RQpA&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>baa ram ewe</u></a>” into a maddening trial of <em>Sokoban</em> block-sliding. The player must use Babe to push sheep through labyrinthine paddocks, airports, and hotels, all built on an isometric grid, but since that grid’s boundaries are invisible, consistently determining where the sheep will wind up is a Herculean effort. Add doors, keys, and Kevin MacLeod music loops to the mix, and you have a concoction of despair that any sensible child would spit out like a bad taste.</p><p>“One thing that defines <em>Babe</em>,” Xavier said, “is the way that you fall in love with all of the characters, both human and non-human, and both villainous and heroic. It is a movie about getting to know the inner lives of these animals. And the game’s the complete opposite of that.”&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>But with a family name to uphold, Xavier could not be discouraged from setting the game’s first speedrun record… though not with too much effort. “Preparation was what someone did if they weren’t related to the director of the movie on which the cheap tie-in cash-grab game was partially related, you know?” Xavier joked. “For me, it was just like, ‘I’m gonna rock up and own this, because that’s my legacy. I’m part of my family, and so this will flow through me. I am the chosen one.’”</p><p>On a momentous Sunday afternoon in 2021, Xavier went live on Twitch and sought their destiny. They remember the two-plus hours as an amusing time full of jovial interactions with viewers. “A huge amount of positivity came from the chat, [and that was] a huge amount of what allowed me to stick through it, even as the many frustrations of the game begin to pile up. It really is just so exhausting.”&nbsp;</p><p>There were points in the run when Xavier lost their way and had to restart a level, during which they received frequent encouragement from their ebullient partner Evie, who also helped by organising dinner, drawing pigs, and answering chat requests for a guitar shred despite not being a musician. There was a palpable sense of relief, rather than pride, when they claimed the virtual gold trophy, and the whole thing would hardly have been out of place at <a href="https://aftermath.site/agdq-2026-interview-speedrun-convention-charity/" rel="noreferrer"><u>GDQ</u></a>.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CcsKlZ5C7TI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Babe (PS2, 2006) Any% PB/WR: 2:40:13.55"></iframe></figure><p>Years later, despite Xavier’s extended absence from both streaming and speedrunning, <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/babe?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the record remains uncontested</u></a>. Xavier posited a simple reason why: “The game’s very bad, and I was visibly having a bad time playing it.”&nbsp;</p><p>But the internet’s appetite for strange gaming achievements is boundless. When asked how they might feel about this article summoning challengers for the top spot, Xavier said, “There’s a part of me that feels a little defensive, I won’t lie. This was a big moment for me, and obviously the family connection is there. But I think I applaud anybody who wants to subject themselves to this. I want there to be a community around these things. Come at me, please, if you’ve got roughly two hours and 40 minutes spare. Let’s do it!”</p><p>And does Uncle Chris, who delivered “that’ll do, pig” to the world and brought this about in the first place, have any notion of what’s happened? </p><p>“I mentioned that I was playing the game to him, and he said he was not aware that there was a game. And then he was happy for me, I think, in a vaguely brushing-off kind of way. I don’t think I ever told him I am the world record holder, which feels crazy.” Xavier laughed. “Maybe I should call him today, you know?”</p>

Rubato is "an experimental, 2D physics-based take on the collect-a-thon genre", according to developer dconn, which doesn't really do justice to the below trailer full of screaming skulls and Mode 7 first-person driving bits and fleeting Minecraft references and PS1-era dancefloors. I guess I'm too used to the watering down of "experimental" as a descriptor. The blurb doesn't even communicate that you play as a frog. Seemingly. Fortunately, there is a demo. Please watch the trailer while I go play it.

OK, I'm back from my brief demo time with some quick and dirty bulletpoints. It doesn't feel appropriate to attempt a holistic account off the back of five minutes, but I would score those five minutes 8/10, if such things were permitted round these parts. It's sort of a cursed Mega Drive romhack, but funnier. Anyway, here are those bullets.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Press ESC button to start - sort of edgy!</li>
<li>Banger Mega Drive-esque music</li>
<li>Earth go boom</li>
<li>fell into toilet</li>
<li>toilet is a tutorial level</li>
<li>tips given by smaller dancing toilet that looks like prehistoric Tumblr gif</li>
<li>Frog is Sonic?</li>
<li>I like Sognic's rocking-chair movement</li>
<li>Sognic can swing and throw 2D crates like some kind of golden era Flash puzzler</li>
<li>Playing pool with planets?</li>
<li>The Company?</li>
<li>Space Police?</li>
<li>Fell into Bakery</li>
<li>Even bangerer music</li>
<li>Press O to explode?</li>
</ul>
<p>
Rubato is out on March 20th. That much we can report with reasonable confidence. You can read more and try the demo yourself on <a href="https://dconn.itch.io/rubato">Itch.io</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2244030/RUBATO/">Steam</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Every Old Game Deserves A 60FPS Update]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/every-old-game-deserves-a-60fps-update-2000661290</link>
            <guid>1411039</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Returning to old games isn’t always easy. Depending on how old the game is, you might run into various problems, including unusual controls or compatibility issues. Another common point of friction you might encounter is an older game running poorly. This can make it a slog to replay some of the modern classics, even if they’re just a decade or so old. So I’m happy to see Ubisoft going back and updating performance in games like <em>Far Cry Primal</em> and <em>Assassin’s Creed Unity.</em></p> <p>Over the weekend, Ubisoft announced that <em>Far Cry 3 Classic</em> is getting an update on January 21 that will let it run at a smoother, higher 60FPS on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. It’s a free patch and, assuming nothing breaks, it should just work once players have updated the remastered version of the tropical shooter. Later, on January 19, Ubisoft announced that<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3mcrtpa5iy22r"><em> Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon Classic Edition</em> is also getting a 60FPS patch</a> on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. And then, on Tuesday, Ubisoft revealed that<em> Far Cry Primal,</em> the primitive-era caveman spin-off, is getting a 60FPS patch for those same platforms. Both of these are landing on January 21, too.</p>

  <p>Updating three older PS4-era games for free to add in performance improvements on newer consoles is cool enough. But Ubisoft has actually been doing this for a bit now. In December 2025, <a href="https://x.com/TheDivisionGame/status/2001336590119866505?lang=en">Ubisoft updated the OG <em>Division</em> on PS5 to unlock 60FPS.</a> Last year, Ubisoft updated <em>Far Cry 4</em> for current-gen machines, and now it runs like butter at 60FPS. In 2024, <em>Assassin’s Creed Syndicate</em> got <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/fuCzsNMoMUkbdiYyJCWQU/assassins-creed-syndicate-60-fps-console-patch-out-now">a nifty 60FPS patch for free as well</a>. And the year before that, <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/6b7bacKsgYhFEhoamVRmx2/far-cry-5-gets-60-fps-patch-for-xbox-series-xs-ps5"><em>Far Cry 5 g</em>ot a 60FPS patch</a> for Xbox Series X/S and PS5.</p> <p>Ubisoft doesn’t have to do this. A lot of publishers don’t do this, which you can tell by all the people in the comments below Ubisoft’s announcements begging for similar updates to other games from other companies. And look, sometimes, it’s not an option. Some games are built around 30FPS and updating them is very tricky or too resource intensive. It’s not impossible, though. Just look <a href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-60fps-mod-hack-remaster-sequel-ps5-dmca-1851752593">at fan updates to <em>Bloodborne</em></a>.</p>

 <p>Still, if you can update an older game without too much trouble to get it running at 60FPS or higher, I think it’s a smart move. From a business point of view, Ubisoft can now continue to market these older games and likely sell new copies. <a href="https://kotaku.com/far-cry-tv-show-alien-earth-hulu-disney-rob-mac-2000647139">And with a<em> Far Cry</em> TV show in the works at FX</a>, Ubisoft has already ensured that if the show is a hit, people coming back to the older games it was inspired by will find a 60FPS experience that matches many of today’s games.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, for me, these updates make it more likely that I’ll return to one of these classic Ubisoft games in the future if I feel the urge to stab people in the throat. Which franchise am I talking about? Either. Both. My point is that I’m a bit of a performance snob when it comes to games, and returning to the choppy 30FPS era of the PS4 and late Xbox 360 is always painful for my eyes and never feels great. Emulation isn’t really a solution either, as PS4 emulation is currently still in its early stages and not nearly as robust as what you’ll find in modern PS2 or PS3 emulators.</p> <p>So it’s very helpful that Ubisoft is going back and doing the work to get its back catalog of PS4-era games, including some bangers like<em> Far Cry 4</em>, running at 60FPS. <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-even-is-a-video-game-backlog-in-2026-2000659435">I mean, I don’t really need more games to add to my damn backlog,</a> but still, thanks.</p>

<p>Fortnite is stepping into the Forgotten Realms. Wizards of the Coast has announced a new collaboration with community creators Chartis and Teravision Games, bringing a series of Dungeons &amp; Dragons-inspired Fortnite islands to players worldwide.</p>







<p>The partnership introduces five fan-made islands designed to merge <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-pimlico-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite’s creative sandbox</a> with the fantasy adventure and storytelling that D&amp;D is known for.</p>



<h2 id="h-five-dungeons-amp-dragons-islands-have-arrived-in-fortnite">Five Dungeons &amp; Dragons Islands Have Arrived In Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Good luck. Image by EPIC Games.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Built using Epic’s UEFN toolset, the islands were created by long-time D&amp;D fans as part of Wizards of the Coast’s “launch and learn” initiative—an experiment aimed at exploring new ways for D&amp;D to reach wider audiences. The line-up includes a PvP battle arena, a social hub, a platforming challenge, a co-op boss fight, and what’s being described as the largest co-op roguelike mode ever created in Fortnite.</p>



<p>Players can expect plenty of classic <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warlock-dungeons-and-dragons-coming-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> flavor throughout. The islands take place across iconic Forgotten Realms locations, including the Yawning Portal tavern, the Spine of the World mountains, and Mount Hotenow. Familiar threats also await, with players facing legendary foes such as Klauth, the ancient red dragon, and the necromancer Valindra Shadowmantle.</p>



<p>Wizards of the Coast says the project is inspired by the homebrew spirit at the heart of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dungeons-and-dragons-cancelled-by-payday-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tabletop D&amp;D</a>. “We’re bringing the spirit of D&amp;D homebrew to Fortnite—supporting creators, experimenting in new mediums, and learning how we can introduce D&amp;D to new players,” said Nick Strann, Franchise Strategy Director for Dungeons &amp; Dragons. “We hope we can make it just as meaningful for millions of Fortnite fans.”</p>







<p>All five D&amp;D Fortnite islands are available now via the following Island Codes:</p>



<ul>
<li>D&amp;D Boxfights – 1190-4691-0255</li>



<li>D&amp;D Treasure RNG – 4958-2624-5634</li>



<li>D&amp;D Dungeon Deathrun – 5806-6430-0158</li>



<li>D&amp;D Bossfight – 2218-1049-5866</li>



<li>D&amp;D Zombie Dragon Adventure (Early Access) – 2525-9596-3235</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Though it may seem like new games are the talk of the town in 2026, there’s plenty to come from titles you have already sunk hours into, including a huge drop with the Cult of the Lamb Woolhaven DLC.</p>



<p>Initially launched in 2022, Cult of the Lamb has received plenty of updates since, with cosmetic DLC and free in-game content, but the Woolhaven expansion will be bigger than ever.</p>



<p>For all the release date details and the exact time you can jump in to play, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-does-cult-of-the-lamb-woolhaven-dlc-release">When Does Cult of The Lamb Woolhaven DLC Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New challenges await. Image via Massive Monster</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Cult of the Lamb’s Woolhaven DLC will be released on Thursday, January 22, providing a major expansion to the game.</strong></p>



<p>While the game is turning six later this year, additional content has become a regular occurrence throughout Cult of the Lamb’s lifespan, and the Woolhaven DLC is the biggest update so far.</p>



<p>Previous DLC for Cult of the Lamb has featured mostly cosmetic additions, but Woolhaven will be different, adding new areas, dungeons, bosses, weapons, and new characters.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-time-does-cult-of-the-lamb-woolhaven-dlc-release">What Time Does Cult of The Lamb Woolhaven DLC Release?</h2>



<p><strong>The Woolhaven DLC for Cult of the Lamb releases at 9 AM PT on January 22 across all platforms.</strong></p>



<p>Naturally, due to time zones, this means the release date for some players is actually in the early hours of the morning on January 23, but there won’t be any delays for players on a particular platform, as the release is simultaneous.</p>



<p>That means that whether you’re playing on PC, console, or on the go via Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck, the Woolhaven DLC will be available at exactly the same time as other platforms, as long as you’re connected to the internet to initiate the download.</p>



<p>The table below shows the release time for the Woolhaven DLC for Cult of the Lamb in major time zones across the world.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Cult of the Lamb Woolhaven Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">9 AM – Jan. 22</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">11 AM – Jan. 22</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">12 PM – Jan. 22</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">5 PM – Jan. 22</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Time (AET)</td><td data-align="center">4 AM – Jan. 23</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <p>Kenny Sun and Friends' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ball-x-pit-review">Ball x Pit</a> was among <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-50-best-games-of-2025-ranked">Eurogamer's favourite games of 2025</a>, so imagine our excitement when <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCmmoL2Mtq0">it was confirmed</a> free content drops were set to arrive this year. Now, the wait for the first major update is almost over.</p>
<p>On 19th January, publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/devolver-digital">Devolver Digital</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2062430/view/99775316462930481?l=english">the game's official channels</a> confirmed The Regal Update is coming on 26th January to all platforms. That's really soon and before we expected, but with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/upcoming-video-games-2026-releases#section-2">February looking far busier</a> than January when it comes to new game releases, I guess it makes sense to push it out now.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>BALL x PIT’s first FREE major update, The Regal Update, launches on January 26th on all platforms! </p><p>Adding:<br>🤠2 new characters - The Carouser &amp; The Falconer<br>🏐8 new balls<br>🎯New passives<br>✨Plus a nice surprise you’re going to love! <a href="https://t.co/t0tYlwjOXk">pic.twitter.com/t0tYlwjOXk</a></p></div>— BALL x PIT 🏐 OUT NOW (@BALLxPIT) <a href="https://twitter.com/BALLxPIT/status/2013296280261234716?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>As explained by the official posts and the short but goofy trailer, we can expect to get two new characters, eight new balls, and an unspecified number of new passives. We're also taking bets on what that extra surprise might be. Patch notes should be with us soon.</p>
<p>The first hunter (more like juggler) is The Carouser, "whose returning balls orbit around him." Start thinking about those area-of-effect and defensive builds now. The other one makes use of two ball-shooting birds to up the DPS and is fittingly called The Falconer. As for the eight new balls, the powers that be have decided to keep them a secret, but looking at the many possible combos already in the game, getting several new additions to the arsenal at once will shake meta builds up for sure.</p><p>Similarly, there's no word on the teased new passives, but a fair criticism of the game is its lack of an actual endgame beyond re-doing the entire journey on a higher level of difficulty or maxing out stats that kinda become pointless past a certain point. In a space dominated by roguelite winners with a more ambitious approach to endgame loops, we're curious to see whether the team behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ball-x-pit-the-kenny-sun-story">Ball x Pit</a> can keep the diehards busy in the long run.</p>

And, speaking at this weekend's New York Game Awards, the former NoA president shared a little tidbit about his time early on in his career at Nintendo (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/pokemon/only-a-week-into-his-job-nintendo-legend-reggie-fils-aime-had-to-deal-with-retailers-upset-there-werent-enough-copies-of-pokemon-ruby-and-sapphire-i-never-let-that-happen-ever-again/">Gamesradar+</a>!)</p>
<p>Just a week into his role as executive vice president of sales, Reggie had to deal with an issue surrounding one of Nintendo's biggest names — <strong>Pokémon</strong>, specifically the first GBA titles, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/pokemon_ruby_and_sapphire">Ruby &amp; Sapphire</a>.</p>
<p>He didn't bring this up by coincidence — Reggie was at the ceremony presenting the Andrew Yoon Legend Award to the franchise. And it's here where he brought up his first professional brush with the series which he says he "had a long history with Pokémon when I was at Nintendo."</p>
<p>Kicking off, Reggie told the audience about his first week at Nintendo in 2003: "I has just joined the company and [was] there for only about a week when I had to work with our retail partners because they literally did not have enough copies of Pokémon Ruby and Pokémon Emerald [note: Reggie probably means Sapphire as Emerald launched in the West in 2005] for the Christmas rush."</p>
<p>Reggie recalls that retailer were understandably "a little upset", and given the huge popularity of the series even then, that's pretty understandable. It was an early test, and lesson, for the then-new exec, who said that "I never let that happen ever again."</p>
<figure data-uuid="74299cdf66f71"><a title="Pokemon Ruby &amp; Sapphire" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/74299cdf66f71/pokemon-ruby-and-sapphire.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2wqNVnh2OE">The Pokémon Company</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Reggie concluded his speech with this, before rolling a heartfelt clip from industry members sharing their memories of the series: "I always enjoyed working with The Pokémon Company and I loved all of their games — even the Pokémon Plus controller [the Poké Ball Plus] with the Mew inside, remember that? One of my favourites."</p>
<p>So, perhaps not the best start, but at least it allowed Reggie to make things right quickly <em>and</em> improve relations between Nintendo and TPC. So, all in all, a valuable moment in his career.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Research Firm Predicts a “Global Price Hike” for the Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026 Driven by Tariffs, Memory Costs, and More]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/research-firm-predicts-nintendo-switch-2-global-price-hike-2026/</link>
            <guid>1410997</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong><a href="https://nikopartners.com/">Niko Partners</a></strong>, a research firm that provides global data analysis and insights into the video game industry in five regions, namely China, East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA), has published its <a href="https://nikopartners.com/niko-partners-2026-predictions/"><strong>2026 predictions</strong> report</a>, with 10 trends for consumers to be aware of, and it's not good news for anyone who has held off on buying a <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>.</p>



<p>Namely because Niko believes that the best time to buy a Nintendo Switch 2 is: right now, before <strong>Nintendo issues a "<em>global price hike</em>" for the new hybrid device</strong>. According to the research firm, at some point in 2026, the added weight of "<em>tariffs, increased memory costs, and broader macroeconomic conditions</em>" will drive a global price hike for the console, with Nintendo following in <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">Sony</a></strong> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/"><strong>Microsoft's</strong> </a>footsteps after both companies increased the prices of their consoles post-launch.</p>



<p>Niko's prediction doesn't include an exact price consumers should expect, but it does add that the Mario company "<em>may opt to discontinue the $449 SKU and only sell a $499 or higher bundle SKU instead</em>," which would mean we'd see at least a <strong>$50</strong> price increase.</p>



<p>It should be noted that the latest word from Nintendo on a potential Switch 2 price increase came from a <a href="https://wccftech.com/we-must-monitor-the-situation-closely-current-high-ram-prices-wont-immediately-impact-the-nintendo-switch-2/">recent interview with Nintendo president <strong>Shuntaro Furukawa</strong>,</a> who simply said that the company "<em>must monitor the situation closely</em>." Before that, back in November 2025, Furukawa told shareholders that the company expects the price of the Switch 2 to remain where it is,<em> </em><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-remain-stable/"><em>"unless there are significant changes in external factors, such as a shift in tariff assumptions, or other unexpected events</em>."</a></p>



<p>Ever since the Nintendo Switch 2 was unveiled on the same day the current US government announced its new tariffs back in <strong>April 2025</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2s-price-could-go-even-higher-due-to-trumps-tariffs/">concerns of a Switch 2 price increase have been sky-high.</a> It didn't help that Nintendo had to pause pre-orders and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pricing-shipped-units-more-previous-six-months/">follow the flow of news regarding where the tariff negotiations were going before it could lock in a price</a>. Or that when pre-orders were finally back on, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-us-hardware-pricing-stays-the-same-accessories-bump/"><strong>the price of Switch 2 accessories had already increased</strong> compared to what they were initially meant to be</a>.</p>



<p>Even though the price of the Switch 2 has remained the same, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-us/">we've had multiple warnings</a> that the price could go up, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-president/">tariffs being cited as a potential cause more than once</a>. Now, adding in the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/no-one-can-escape-memory-shortages-says-samsungs-co-ceo/">memory shortage situation</a></strong> (even if <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/micron-exclusive-why-consumers-have-gotten-the-memory-shortage-narrative-all-wrong/">consumers reportedly have the narrative around the shortages wrong</a></strong>), the fact remains that a price hike for the Nintendo Switch 2 feels more like a question of 'when' rather than 'if'.</p>



<p>With all that said, this report doesn't factor in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-has-been-leaky-maybe-they-need-a-plumber-new-potential-nintendo-switch-2-model-discovered-on-official-website/">recent rumours of a <strong>Switch 2 Lite</strong> model</a> potentially arriving soon, which could offer a happy medium for people who want to grab a Switch 2 but don't want to pay its current $449 price. So long as Nintendo doesn't increase the price of the Switch 2 to $499 and release a Switch 2 Lite at $449. </p>

As such, they don’t usually come cheap. However, they’re fairly affordable to upgrade to today thanks to a deal on <strong>Corsair’s Vanguard Pro 96</strong>, which is cheaper than ever at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FKHPRZ45/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fcorsair-vanguard-pro-96-rgb-wired-magnetic-mgx-linear-hall-effect-96-gaming-keyboard-with-flashtap-socd-rapid-trigger-black%2FJ39TSCPZC5%2Fsku%2F6637498" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, selling for $159.99 (originally $229.99).

And, you know what? I can see some similarities between it and the Vanguard Pro 96, despite the underlying switch tech being different. The Vanguard has a rotary dial, an info-dense LCD screen, nice aluminum housing for the keyboard, plus a magnetic-attaching wrist rest that’s plush and looks sophisticated. It has six programmable macro keys along the leftmost edge, and you can customize its settings through Corsair’s web app. If you want customizable switches, the Vanguard is the better keyboard to buy.</p><div><p id="other-verge-approved-deals-to-get-your-tuesday-started"><h2>Other <em>Verge</em>-approved deals to get your Tuesday started</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Perhaps you already know you’re going to dive into <em><strong>Resident Evil Requiem</strong></em> on launch day.

The game will launch for $69.99, but you can nab a digital key to add to your Steam library for $57.39. <em>Requiem </em>is the next mainline entry in the franchise, giving players the ability to toggle between first-person and third-person perspective at will.

            <title><![CDATA[SNL’s Stranger Things Skit Stokes The Flames Of A Dying Fan Fire]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/saturday-night-live-snl-stranger-things-finn-wolfhard-2000661307</link>
            <guid>1410985</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span> actor Finn Wolfhard hosted </span><i><span>Saturday Night Live</span></i><span> over the weekend, and given the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-reaction-byler-acting-2000656424"><span>online shitshow that’s transpired</span></a><span> since Netflix’s horror series wrapped up last month, the sketch comedy show had a lot of material to work with. Like most episodes of </span><i><span>SNL</span></i><span>, this one had its assortment of</span> <span>hits and misses, but particularly noteworthy was its </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>spoof, which touched on the backlash that has sprung up in the wake of the finale and mentioned the widespread Conformity Gate conspiracy theory which proposed the existence of a secret, “better” ending to the series.</span></p>  <p><span>Wolfhard’s monologue may not have touched on the backlash </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ final season has received online, but it has come under some fire for some low-hanging misogynistic jokes. The former child actor talks about growing up on the Netflix show over the past decade, and says the first time he learned what a woman looked like “down there” was captured on camera during the show. We then cut to a clip of his character Mike seeing a Demogorgon open its monstrous jaws. You get it? Vaginas are scary! Like a flesh-eating monster!</span></p>

  <p><span>Thankfully the show’s actual </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>skit fared better, envisioning Netflix milking the series into multiple spin-offs, including a </span><i><span>Sex and the City </span></i><span>parody starring Wolfhard’s character as a writer in ‘90s New York City. However, it too has come under fire for what some are calling a tasteless joke about Lucas’ future sex life with partner Max, who now “just lies there like she’s back in that coma,” a reference to her character being in a coma during the show.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, the skit’s joke about Will’s infamous coming-out scene in season 5, which fans </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-coming-out-scene-will-byers-season-5-2000655961"><span>said was sweet but a bit hokey and longwinded</span></a><span>, has gotten an absurd bad-faith response from some viewers. </span><i><span>SNL</span></i><span>’s skit jokes that Will isn’t getting a spin-off because this coming-out scene is still going on. The choice to poke fun at the scene has been </span><a href="https://x.com/w1llb1yers/status/2012864726955380789?s=20"><span>deemed homophobic</span></a><span>, to which I say, making fun of the scene’s notorious length is not the same as making a joke at the expense of gay people.</span></p>

 <p><span>The real joke of note is the skit’s direct reference to the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-secret-finale-conformity-gate-explained-2000656704"><span>Conformity Gate conspiracy</span></a><span> which posits that a secret ninth episode that will “fix” the divisive finale is on the way. Wolfhard and two of his co-stars reunite on a mountaintop in Iceland, and Wolfhard exclaims that “everything we thought happened was an illusion that was planted by Vecna.” When asked for “one good reason” why they should believe him, Wolfhard responds, “How about eleven?” at which point Kenan Thompson steps in for Millie Bobbie Brown, holding an Eggo waffle and spouting gibberish.</span></p>

 <p><span>Though the </span><i><span>SNL </span></i><span>episode has come and gone, the Duffer Brothers were in attendance, and some </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>fans unhappy with the ending </span><a href="https://x.com/bylerhughes/status/2012800392644436357?s=20"><span>heckled them in public</span></a><span> as they were leaving the venue.</span></p> <p><span>The Conformity Gate conspiracy has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-conformity-gate-secret-netflix-crash-2000658155"><span>mostly died down at this point</span></a><span>, though some true believers are moving the goalpost and saying that it might still be coming. While some cast members have been hesitant to comment on it directly, actor Joe Keery has </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@bbcradio1/video/7595593028492856598"><span>flatly denied that any such episode exists</span></a><span>.</span></p>
