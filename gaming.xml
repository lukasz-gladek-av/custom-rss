			<p>Capes is exciting. It’s a turn-based strategy game similar, gameplay-wise, to the X-Com series, but instead of defending the planet from an alien threat you’re leading a team of superheroes. Rather than shooting guns at extra-terrestrials, you’re telekinetically shooting chunks of rock at them, or teleporting to and then stabbing them, or sometimes just punching them, but it a super heroic way. If you want another comparison, it’s a lower budget, non-Marvel Midnight Sons, but with proper movement and no card system for your attacks.</p>
<p><iframe title="Capes: Official Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V9Yn-Fg90PM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We will begin with the game’s presentation, which is…okay. Graphically speaking it isn’t going to blow any minds, even the heroes’ ultimate attacks don’t really impress on that front, but it’s good enough to get the job done and combine with a few aesthetic choices that I like. Things like dialogue being presented with comic-style dialogue boxes in addition to being fully voice acted and some basic, but effective direction in cutscenes when establishing the area a level is set in.</p>


<p>It sounds pretty good too, voice acting is competent-to-good throughout, though there are a few anomalies with the levels on certain clips, where Weathervane’s ultimate scream is way too quiet. The dialogue they’re dealt is sufficiently comic book as well, with just that right amount of tongue-in-cheek campiness present in everywhere from the street level goons to the mustache twirling supervillains. It’s just enough to sell the comic styling outside of the cutscenes at base, which are actually cartoon rather than the 3D graphics of in-game. You won’t spend much time back at base, instead characters will pop up over a mostly static background for a conversation, each of them apparently unable to stand still as they have the exaggerated stances of Street Fighter characters, before you jet off for another mission.</p>
<p>These missions will take you all over King City, a dystopian city where developing superpowers is a crime punishable by being taken away, never to be seen again. The city is a dark, dangerous place where The Company is more than happy to kidnap supers and forcibly silence any witnesses, which is where your team of ragtag superheroes comes in. Gathered together by a mysterious man known as Doctrine to free King City from The Company, your team of heroes are young people who have recently come into their powers. These include, but are certainly not limited to, Facet, who can summon crystal shards as armour to reduce damage or to entangle and block enemies, Rebound, who can teleport around and deal extra damage on backstabs, and Weathervane, who can shoot lightning that chains between nearby enemies.</p>


<p>In combat, there are lot of ways these characters can team up, both literally and just with clever planning. Certain abilities can be enhanced if you are in range of another character – for example, Weathervane can add a gust of wind to one of Facet’s melee attacks to add a knockback effect. Alternatively, if a character is in range of rebound they can spend an action to have her teleport them somewhere. Facet’s crystal growth can conduct electricity, so with some strategic placement you can set it up so that Weathervane can damage more enemies with his chain lightning. Another hero named Mercurial is a Speedster (like the Flash) and has an ability that dashes a long distance, but when upgraded by Facet it leaves crystal growth along its entire route, which is very helpful for when you want to chain lightning every enemy in a level.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, these team up abilities are very powerful, which is good, because Capes is <em>tough</em>. It doesn’t mess around when it comes to throwing enemies at you, constantly bringing in more groups of enemies in numbers that, frankly, seem overwhelming when it first starts happening. With careful use of team ups, meticulous positioning, and heavy use of bottle necks you’ll find that it’s not quite as bad as you think. Especially when you realise that you can knock enemies through surrounding walls where they will fall to an instant death.</p>
<p>There are a few issues though. Certain abilities are so useful that they are basically essential. Facet is the only character I currently have that can soak up a lot of damage due to his crystal armour’s damage reduction and, considering the sheer number of enemies that tend to appear, I’ve taken to him always being in my group of four. Rebound can teleport and, as such, isn’t affected by terrain when aiming attacks, and her main attack is ranger teleport, so she doesn’t take reaction damage, so she’s always in there, too. Weathervane and Mercurial always finish up my team, because of the big growth-dash-chain lightning combo I’ve already mentioned, which is disproportionately helpful as you can have Mercurial connect up groups of enemies as they arrive and then run away so Weathervane can damage all of them at once.</p>

<p>Each hero has an ultimate which is charged differently depending on the character – Weathervane’s is charged by hitting people with chain lightning. If you set it up right you can have him using his ultimate, which damages <em>every enemy</em> in a reasonable radius, every round on top of the one damage from the lightning <em>and</em> his second action, because ultimates are free actions. It’s unbelievably useful, especially since there are objectives in the levels like defending hostages and the Facet’s growths also act like walls, blocking enemy movement.</p>
<p>This is all very cool, but the other heroes that I don’t use because my main team is so effective must be a little lonely by now. They have their uses, but they’re not quite as effective as damaging every enemy on the field plus an ultimate every round. Your heroes all level up using Skill Points that are earned not just from completing levels, but from bonus objectives on those levels as well. You can “simulate” previous levels to retry them and earn some extra SP, complete with your now likely significantly more powerful heroes, and they’ll even earn XP whilst they do it. The SP is shared between all heroes, which is useful in that you can spend SP on lesser used heroes to beef them up a bit, but it mostly resulted in me favouring my main four heroes and leaving the others very underpowered, as I didn’t want to constantly replay levels to level them up.</p>
<p>There is one other issue with combat – frustration. On top of the shocking amounts of enemies, some of them have abilities that seem almost unfair and really limit your options. Some enemies have a free action they can fire from a chest cannon at anyone who’s within a very long range in any of the cardinal directions every turn, so if you leave your hero in range they’ll take a hit in addition to the enemy’s turn. This might seem fine, except that some of these levels have like twelve of these bastards and you can only see the range of each one when you highlight it, which, when positioning characters, is time consuming at best. Most importantly, it feels <em>cheap</em>, which is discouraging in a strategy game.</p>

<p>Other enemies have their own free attacks that need to be disarmed before they trigger to avoid damage, forcing you to damage them less in favour of stopping an attack that won’t feel satisfying in a moment when it’s their turn and they still have an attack anyway. There are even stealth sections, where you can see enemy’s sight range and maneouvre around them taking enemies out without them noticing. I actually love this idea, but again, you need to highlight enemies to see their paths for next turn, and there tend to be a lot of enemies to keep track of – just the abilitiy to see all enemy paths at once would make a big difference.</p>
<p>There are a few little niggly bugs and glitches, like the camera clipping through the environment during attacks so you can’t actually see, the HUD sometimes missing elements like whether an enemy will take damage from displacement into objects/drops, or some fiddly UI, especially in the level up menu. But despite this list of small niggles, I really like Capes. It takes the Midnight Sons formula and adds proper levels and positioning into it, whilst removing the randomness of the cards. It’s a great idea that’s mostly well delivered.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-alters-hands-on-preview/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-preview-and-qa-11-bit-studios-adds-branching-narrative-layers-to-base-building-survival-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Alters</a> is a video game developed and published by <a href="https://11bitstudios.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11 bit studios</a>. A large part of this team also created the outstanding <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/this-war-of-mine-the-little-ones-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This War of Mine</a>. That is the extent of what I knew about The Alters, going into my time recently spent in Warsaw with the studio, and it was honestly all I needed to know. From the Anomaly games to This War of Mine and Frostpunk, 11 Bit Studios is a developer I trust (also as a publisher, following titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/moonlighter-worth-staying-up-for/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moonlighter</a>, Children of Morta and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-invincible-exploring-the-unknown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Invincible</a>), so my recent hands-on time with The Alters and the story mode of Frostpunk 2 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/hands-on-with-frostpunk-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preview of the earlier beta here</a>) offered an opportunity to see if that trust would remain after an early look.</p>
<p>The Frostpunk 2 coverage will be in a few days, so I won't say more than my trust remains unsullied. Speaking solely about The Alters, from a game I knew nothing about except what was mentioned above and the nice amount of pink on show in the trailer, I'm now waiting for it to release because I want to play more.</p>
<figure>
<div>

</figure>


<p>So, what is The Alters? From what I've seen and been told, the best way I can describe it is that it's a story-driven third-person adventure game with survival elements and base-building mechanics. The theme of the game is the question the title of this preview asks: "What if?" What if you had decided to become a fluffer instead of a politician - Would you be happier with your life and feel less dirty? What if you were less careful when burying the corpse of your latest Tinder date? These are essential questions we all face in life and those that Jan Dolski will face.</p>
<p>Jan Dolski, voiced multiple times by Alex Jordan (Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty, Dragons Dogma 2, Final Fantasy XVI, Troy: A Total War Saga, Blasphemous, and many more), is stranded on an alien planet and is all by himself. He needs others to survive, so he will create alternate versions of himself where the "What if?" question is directly altered. The first one you meet is a technician version of Jan, and he is created by changing that to escape his father's abuse of his mother and himself; instead of running away, he fights back.</p>
<p>You'll need these alternate Jans to progress through the story because they have the skills to fix something that's broken, and simply because in the actual gameplay, they will need to man different parts of your base. It raised the question of whether you have some control over which Jan you get and when, which I asked, but with this being a narrative-focused title, you will create the Jan needed. This did worry me at first, but getting to see what's on offer did alleviate that.</p>
<p>When you create Jan Technician, sadly not called Jan Hammer, he is understandably disoriented and angry. He was created because you needed him to fix something, nothing more, and he's now facing the near-inescapable death you're facing. He didn't ask for this, but it also opens up the opportunity to win him and the other Jans over through the discussions you have, your shared memories, and, at times, what your alternate version did differently. It's a compelling scenario and one that 11 bit studios seems to be handling well, though, after the use of emotions in This War of Mine, I'm not surprised.</p>
<figure>
<div>

</figure>


<p>But what of the gameplay outside of your conversations? Here's where The Alters surprised me more than anywhere else. I expect a good narrative and emotional impact from the developers now. Still, I didn't expect what could be a successful gelling of adventure, survival, and side-on base building (think Fallout Shelter). 11 bit studios has managed to do this quite successfully; at least, that's what I get from the first few hours of the game.</p>
<p>The opening doesn't start quickly, and it is arguably the only thing I think could put people off. The first hour, maybe an hour and a half, is all introductions. It sets the scene, introducing Jan and the giant wheel that is your base. I didn't mind it, but it was the issue I heard from others at the hands-on event, and I can understand that, particularly as - in the current climate - the first few hours need to hook you to keep people going past the steam refund period.</p>
<p>Since these were the first few hours, I didn't get to see all the rooms you get to build in your base, but what I did see started to expand quite quickly. You'll also research expansions, manufacture tools, meals, and more. This is where the multiple versions of you come in, where you can task them with different base rooms, each with their strengths. You'll even be able to send them out into the world to mine, but be careful to keep an eye on their radiation levels and overall health - physical and mental.</p>
<figure>

</figure>


<p>All in all, I'm interested. I started my time at 11 Bit studios with nothing. No knowledge, hype, or excitement for The Alters. I left with a game that I am looking forward to and fully intend to play, either reviewing it or purchasing it upon release. If that isn't a sign of something, nothing is.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Alters Preview - Resource Management On A Smaller Scale]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/alters-preview-resource-management-on-smaller-scale</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-alters-preview-resource-management-on-a-smaller-scale.880428/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/alters-preview-resource-management-on-smaller-scale<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week I had a chance to fly out to Poland to get hands-on time with 11Bit Studios' upcoming title, <em>The Alters. The Alters</em> is a resource management game where players take on the role of Jan Dolski, an astronaut stranded on a planet trying to collect resources, build up his base, and continue along the planet's surface trying to outrun the harsh sunrise.</p>

<h2><em>The Alters</em> Immediately Sinks Its Hooks Into You</h2>

<p>Our demo began with the start of the game, here Jan had crashlanded on the planet and found that he was the sole survivor of his crew. Making his way to the mobile operations base he had shelter but quickly learned that he would need to gather resources from the surface to begin to repair the base.</p>

<p>Jan was able to contact those in charge of monitoring the mission, to questionable success, and learn that he could get rescued but he'd first need to make it somewhere safe and far from the ever-encroaching sunlight of dawn that would fry the ship and him inside it.</p>



<p>Understanding that piloting this ship and making it to safety isn't entirely within his skillset Jan is given access to the full power of the Quantum Computer on board and The Womb. Combined the Computer is able to create alternate timelines of Jan, where certain decisions were made differently, resulting in different professions.</p>

<p>Some Jans that I got to see in our time playing included a Technician, Miner, Scientist, and I had just created a Botanist Jan before being told I had reached the limit of the presentation.</p>

<p>There's not much more to say but that <em>The Alters</em> had an incredibly strong opening. There was immediate tension in Jan's predicament, a solid plot hook and objective, and also the lingering question of "how do we survive this?"</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-preview-jan-exploring.jpg?itok=1hMpPV6X 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-preview-jan-exploring.jpg?itok=MTCaMUzI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Spend downtime in your base before braving the outside world</figcaption></figure><h2>Gameplay Mechanics Never At Odds</h2>

<p>For me coming to this event, <em>The Alters</em> was a bit of an unknown quantity, I had remembered seeing its announcement at the PC Gaming Show but the gameplay was a bit all over the place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It showed off <em>Fallout Shelter</em>-like base building, the resource management and survival of <em>Frostpunk</em>, but also third-person exploration and resource gathering that may be more familiar to casual fans of survival games. Playing the game it felt like it all worked together perfectly harmoniously.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-hand-on-footage-resource-gathering.jpg?itok=EjgYBS7W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-hand-on-footage-resource-gathering.jpg?itok=zmRcts88 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Obtain resources to build more and survive in The Alters</figcaption></figure><p>The gameplay began by being very hands-on with what the player should be doing, I can imagine for some it was annoying having their hand held but I enjoyed the blend of story and gameplay as you learned that you needed certain resources to build a structure that could obtain a different resource. With so much going on narratively it never felt like I was simply following a tutorial.</p>

<p>There was no point where the game made me feel lost, and as the narrative was introducing concepts like the Quantum Computer, the story of Jan's life, and the ability to create Alters the pace still felt rapid and kept me engaged.</p>

<p>Within 40 minutes I already had an Alter or two, had learned a bit more about them, and was assigning them to help gather resources from the planet's surface.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-preview-alter-assignments.jpg?itok=MVioeUnP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-preview-alter-assignments.jpg?itok=dbs5tkHX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can assign your Alters to take on different tasks that will help around the base or out in the world</figcaption></figure><p>It felt like pushing dominoes that a resource would let me gather another, which would lead to new structures, I'd create a new Alter, build a new part of the ship for them, and then we'd move on to gather more resources.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unlike the harsh pacing of <em>Frostpunk </em>where a dozen things are happening all at once and it's up to you to somehow balance them all everything in <em>The Alters</em> is very deliberate and smaller in scale. You'll always take steps because you know what you want to do next, and never because you're just reacting to the world.</p>

<h2>Interact With Your Alters, And Your Alters Interact With You</h2>

<p>While there wasn't too much time to interact with the Alters what time we did have laid some good groundwork for where the mechanic would lead.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-hand-on-footage-alter-reacting.jpg?itok=uC2NiJY7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-hand-on-footage-alter-reacting.jpg?itok=EciqhG7J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Jan will remember that</figcaption></figure><p>As soon as you awaken a new Alter you'll see different emotions appearing around their head as they're angry or apprehensive. It's not just enough to manage resources you also need to manage your relationships with the versions of yourself that you might have been</p>

<p>An early example of interaction with my Technician Alter was after learning they were sleeping on the floor at night I was able to craft a dormitory that could house up to four Alters. Looking down the research tech tree I noticed there was also space to create private rooms that could improve moods further.</p>

<p>I was also able to bond with an Alter by gifting them a pocket multi-tool that both he and I had fond memories of. It goes to show how exploration might reward the player with resources, but can also provide you with chances to strengthen your bond with other Alters.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-hand-on-footage-promt-with-an-alter.jpg?itok=028s2_Xm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-hand-on-footage-promt-with-an-alter.jpg?itok=2KRyYe-6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Different conversations will open up giving you a chance to improve relationships or create new structures</figcaption></figure><p>One very unnerving conversation with an Alter came from the birth of the Miner variant of Jan. The memories that led to this Jan's current predicament also included him losing his arm in an accident. Awakening with both of his hands was a rattling experience.</p>

<p>As I was pondering what something like this could mean Alex Jordan, the Voice Actor behind Jan and his different Alters, happened to walk by and tease that where these memories come from will be explored as the game continues.</p>

<h2>The Look Of A New World</h2>

<p>One of the things that most impressed me was the visuals and sound design of <em>The Alters</em>. From the moment you crash down on the planet, you're met with known quantities like rain and lightning, as well as the alien elements like the oil slick look of the waves or strange ferrofluid reactions to the sand.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-alters-preview-rapidium.jpg?itok=w9Y9eCyR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-alters-preview-rapidium.jpg?itok=BIzlWdtz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As you approach Rapidium the ground begins to shake as if altered by digital noise</figcaption></figure><p>It was tense dealing with how little you could be outside your ship during each active day while also marveling at the world that was around you.</p>

<p>Within the ship, it was a bit more of the standard sci-fi fare in the look and feel of the place. The internal environment gave a vibe of a cleaner and slightly more up-to-date aesthetic that you'd see in 90s sci-fi like the Alien franchise.</p>

<p>It was impressive to see how much work had been done on each of the Alters. While some only offered slight differences where were others that held themselves in different ways that you could tell came from a different life.</p>

<h2><em>The Alters</em> Might Be A Gateway To <em>Frostpunk</em></h2>

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed <em>The Alters</em> as someone who enjoys a moderate amount of resource balancing and gets stuck into a good story.</p>

<p>The DNA of <em>Frostpunk </em>and <em>This War of Mine</em> is very present but it feels like <em>The Alters</em> is being set up as a more casual entry into the rest of what 11Bit has to offer. If those elements tickle your fancy then 11Bit already has the next game for you to try.</p>

<p>After getting only a few hours on the game I was left wanting more, I want to know how much deeper the mechanics go as well as what's going on with the mysterious corporation behind Project Dolly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24161457/hellblade-2-psychosis-psychologist-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="0dNaXI">Ninja Theory’s 2017 game <em>Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice</em> is famous for exploring the experiences of people with psychosis through the medium of a vision quest undertaken by Senua, a Celtic warrior in the early Middle Ages. It earned acclaim for its sensitive, thoroughly researched, and audio-visually immersive portrayal of Senua’s condition — something the Ninja Theory team had arrived at through close collaboration with Paul Fletcher, a professor of psychology at the University of Cambridge.</p>
<p id="F3XVew">Following a singular success like this is always challenging, but maybe especially so in the case of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24120021/hellblade-2-senuas-saga-preview-ninja-theory-unreal-engine-5"><em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em></a>, which was released this week on Windows PC and Xbox Series X, and is included with Game Pass. How could Ninja Theory bring players back into Senua’s experience of the world without rehashing the first game — or sidelining or trivializing her condition? How could it raise the stakes for the character without undoing Senua’s growth, or succumbing to the “descent into madness” tropes the first game had so conscientiously avoided?</p>
<p id="F1qXm6">The answer, as it turns out, was quite simple: Have her meet and interact with other people.</p>

<p id="SwyFJC">“We definitely didn’t want to walk back on [the first game] and make it seem as though we’re resetting her,” scriptwriter and Performance Capture Director Lara Derham said during a conversation with myself and Fletcher at Ninja Theory’s Cambridge offices, which Polygon visited a couple months before the game’s launch. </p>
<p id="VZorVS">“She’s still got that sense of a greater sense of peace, a greater sense of opportunity,” Derham said. “But I see the first game as a very internal journey, very personal, and very oriented around herself and what she’s lost. And I think this game, while we’re still obviously seeing the world through Senua’s eyes, it’s more about interacting with the world around her, people around her, and pushing out into the future a little more.”</p>
<p id="MQtWUC">This makes sense dramatically, but for Fletcher it was also an opportunity to get deeper into a crucial aspect of psychosis that the first game, by nature, hadn’t really explored. </p>
<p id="bT7MXX">“I think what Lara and the team are doing now is exploring a bit of the distress of psychosis that perhaps wasn’t so much to the fore in <em>Senua’s Sacrifice</em>, which is what happens when your reality — your construct of reality — conflicts or coincides with that of other people around you,” Fletcher said. </p>
<p id="7ymOR6">One of the most prominent aspects of psychosis for some people is the constant narration of internal voices, characterized in the game as Furies. As Senua interacts with other people on her quest to track down some slavers in Iceland, a natural dramatic tension arises from the way the Furies react during conversations — sometimes encouraging her to interact, sometimes sowing seeds of distrust.</p>

<p id="AgXauG">Fletcher explains that this tension gets at one of the most fascinating aspects of psychosis — one that can be illuminating about the human condition in general, in fact. </p>
<p id="aII4jh">“I think one of the first things [about being human] is that we make contact with each other through a sort of tacit agreement about the fact that we’re inhabiting the same space with the same experiences and same reality,” he said. “Whereas in fact, we’re all carrying our own little environments around with us — and I think, in psychosis, that that rupture is much greater.”</p>
<p id="JXEEIO">For people with psychosis, interacting with other people means bridging the gap between two (or more) quite different realities, which can be a huge challenge. “That kind of split focus between this internal world and the external world can be really difficult to manage,” Derham said. </p>
<p id="MDfbIl">Fletcher agreed: “It’s a very exhausting process to juggle it for people, you know. If somebody still has these psychosis-related beliefs, but they’re also engaging with people who don’t share them at all — and, in fact, think that they’re mad — then there’s all sorts of things that they have to do to suppress them or to hide them. And they also have to somehow negotiate between the two — to find a way of having this cherished inner reality that they don’t let go of, while at the same time functioning within a different one.”</p>
<p id="sbOdMm">That Senua might “cherish” her own experience of reality is one of the key learnings Derham and Fletcher took from the conversations they had with people with psychosis while they were researching for the game. </p>
<p id="LQP3Hv">“The experiences, or voices and visions, [are] actually integral to the sense of self,” Fletcher said. “It’s not a symptom that’s just been stuck on to a person. People will often say: ‘This is a part of me. It’s my reality, it’s my experience, and you can’t just treat it as a... it’s not a tumor.’ Sometimes the experiences are deeply rewarding and engaging, immersive, pleasurable; they’re not always suffering.”</p>

<p id="53bNda">“Obviously, a lot of what Senua experiences is quite dark,” Derham said. “But occasionally, there’ll be moments where she feels a special connection with someone or the world seems to have a special kind of beauty to her. And I think those experiences are very positive. And that reflects what we’ve understood from people we’ve talked to — that occasionally, there’ll be a time where the world just seems a bit brighter than it might to some of the rest of us.”</p>
<p id="C6ZoTD">Researching psychosis for the Hellblade games from a purely experiential perspective, rather than as a problem to be solved or as suffering to be alleviated, also challenged Fletcher’s medical and academic perspectives on the condition. “The sole question here, or the starting question here, was always, ‘What’s it like? What does that feel like?’ And I think it created a whole new conversation for me with people with a history of psychiatric illness, which is very enriching,” he said.</p>
<p id="zs8gKf">After <em>Senua’s Sacrifice</em> came out, Fletcher remembers feeling encouraged by what he saw as a successful effort to destigmatize psychosis and mental health issues at large. That’s still a hope he nurtures for <em>Senua’s Saga</em>, of course, but now he harbors an even bigger ambition: that the game can encourage every player to consider a big metaphysical question. Perhaps the biggest. </p>
<p id="b0ERXk">“The fantasy I have is that people will reflect upon the nature of their constructions of reality,” he said, “and just how tenuous our links with objective reality might be.” </p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1793902842681638976" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X today, reliable leaker @HYPEX revealed potential Lethal Company-themed cosmetics that are possibly coming to Fortnite.</p>



<p>HYPEX did not have further details about the release date for this collaboration. However, they did showcase both a Lethal Company skin and Back Bling.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Lethal Company was a co-op horror indie hit about collecting scrap together on abandoned moons, a welcome surprise for Fortnite. </p>



<p>HYPEX has successfully leaked a variety of information about Fortnite for a long time. That includes details about the recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-star-wars-crossover-announced-for-may-3rd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars crossover</a> and more.</p>



<p>Another prominent Fortnite leaker, user @ShiinaBR, also showcased an upcoming “Company Jig” emote for the Lethal Company crossover. This included a brief video of the emote in action <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1793916082321039698" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Twitter</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Lethal Company launched into Early Access in October 2023 to rave reviews, praised for its atmosphere and more. It still maintains Overwhelmingly Positive reviews on Steam. </p>



<p>In fact, Lethal Company further seemed to influence games like Content Warning, which similarly took the indie scene by storm last April. At this time, there’s still no date for Lethal Company’s full release. </p>



<p>While Fortnite fans await the Lethal Company crossover, many are hoping for more information about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-fallout-crossover-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Fallout collaboration</a>. Fans of the IP enjoyed seeing the T-60 Power Armor suits. Fallout certainly earned wider appeal among casual audiences following the Amazon live-action series.</p>



<p>Epic Games has not officially confirmed anything about the Lethal Company collaboration yet.</p>

                <p>The Alters is a strange, genre-blending sci-fi survival game that's centered around cloning its protagonist. After Jan Dolski--a spaceship engineer--crash-lands on a desolate, uncharted planet he must clone himself to survive. It's an odd premise, but it's one that developer 11 Bit Studios tackles earnestly. Cloning Jan is built around a series of "What If?" questions: What if Jan pursued chemistry instead of engineering, or what if he stood up to his abusive father? These "What If?" questions are at the heart of The Alter's themes and narrative.</p><p dir="ltr">The demo begins as Jan crash-lands on a black sand beach with jagged cliffs and rough water. The Alters has a strong visual identity, with the almost-monochrome world punctuated by bright and colorful flares lighting up the sky as rain pours down. The world looks beautiful, ferocious, and alien all at once. As Jan makes his way to the Mobile Base--a giant wheel-like structure--he learns that his whole crew, including the captain, died on impact. He's alone and very, very far from home.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Alters Is An Ambitious Genre Blending Survival Game</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Upon reaching the Mobile Base, Jan learns that he must relocate the base before sunrise, otherwise the sunlight will fry everything it touches. In order to get it up and running, Jan needs natural resources and a technician. And to accrue the necessary resources, Jan must set up mining outposts on top of mineral deposits in the surrounding area. The materials can then be transported to the Mobile Base by daisy-chaining pylons together. It's a rather straightforward process with just enough quirks and intricacies to keep it engaging. However, recruiting a technician is a bit tougher considering Jan is on the planet all by himself. This is where cloning comes in.</p><p dir="ltr">Each time you clone Jan, you are presented with a timeline of his life, and you can create branches at key moments that result in different Jans with different personalities and skill sets. As you create more Jans, more game systems open up and your odds of survival increase. However, cloning Jan comes with its own set of repercussions that 11 Bit Studios seems eager to explore. The first alternate Jan you create is a technician, and when he finds out he's a clone living in a universe where his childhood did not exist, he's understandably frustrated and confused.</p><p dir="ltr">Jan's decision to clone himself doesn't come easily, either. The logistical and ethical implications weigh heavily on him, but one person can't run the Mobile Base alone. Due to the urgency of the situation and pressure from the unsavory organization that funded the expedition, he suspends his moral dilemma and clones himself.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4307556-thealters_screenshot_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4307556" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4307556-thealters_screenshot_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4307556"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4307556-thealters_screenshot_2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Backed by some light social-sim mechanics and dialogue options, proto-Jan must earn technician-Jan's trust by spending time and bonding with him. Chatting with Jan's alter is surprisingly novel. Sure, they are biologically the same person, but because technician-Jan chose a different path than proto-Jan, it's fascinating to see how their parallel lives have impacted who they are and how they navigate the world. The Alters, based on my two-hour preview, seems like the perfect setup to explore its themes of individualism and identity, and the complicated relationship of nature vs. nurture.</p><p dir="ltr">According to game director Tomasz Kisilewicz, "Learning and understanding their storylines while managing them effectively is at the core of…the game." While not every Jan will be as frustrated as technician-Jan, many of them will have their own flaws and insecurities that proto-Jan must navigate. Sometimes that’s through dialogue and other times it’s by creating a Jan that can compliment or uplift another. It's tough to say how deep these social-sim mechanics go, but considering how many genres 11 Bit Studios is balancing, a bit of restraint might go a long way. Too much sim management might muddle the experience, and too little might make it feel superfluous. After all, The Alters is a survival game first and foremost, and most of my time was spent outside of my ship, exploring the planet.</p><blockquote><p>It's clear that 11 Bit Studios has a story it wants to tell, and this linearity seems to facilitate that narrative.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Like many survival games, much of your time is spent harvesting materials, building structures, and researching new technologies. However, The Alters' survival mechanics aren't as freeform as something you might see in Grounded or Valheim. The Mobile Base--at least in the first few hours--only moves for plot reasons. This means that players will likely experience the world in a similar manner: Explore the same areas, mine the same resources, and inhabit the same sections of the map. While this may turn some survival fans off, this linearity feels intentional. It's clear that 11 Bit Studios has a story it wants to tell, and this linearity seems to facilitate that narrative. Unlike other survival games, The Alters seems to have a definitive ending with clear goalposts: Build up the Mobile Base enough in order to fly back home.</p><p dir="ltr">If anything, the gameplay diversity lies in its management-sim mechanics. After you unlock the technician, a handful of different alters become available, and as long as you have the resources you can create whichever Jan you think is most helpful. From there, you can choose which technologies you'd like to prioritize, which alter is working on what, and how you'd like to arrange and upgrade your ship and its various modules. As you create more alters, you'll need to build more facilities to appease the growing demand. Eventually, your ship could become a small self-sufficient colony populated by Jans.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4307559-thealters_screenshot_8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4307559" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4307559-thealters_screenshot_8.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4307559"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4307559-thealters_screenshot_8.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">When I asked Kisilewicz about how 11 Bit Studios balances and blends all these disparate genres, he said, "We wanted to find the tools and elements of different genres that would suit the message…Combining them together was a big challenge, but also something exciting. If we can make these work together it’s going to be something else. Something different." In order for the player to feel like they are exploring an uncharted planet with a crew of clones, the gameplay needed to support that. That meant social-sim mechanics to give the crew a bit of dynamism, survival elements to make the planet feel dangerous, and management systems to fully utilize the crew.</p><p dir="ltr">Based on my hands-on session, it seems like 11 Bit Studios has found a way to merge these disparate genres in a way that feels elegant. No one mechanic or system felt overbearing, and all of them had a tangible purpose that fit with the overall premise. That said, The Alters is spinning a lot of plates at once, and I feel like it could all come crashing down with the slightest push. It's hard to say if that "push" will ever come based on my playtime, but after chatting with Kisilewicz, it seems like the team is well aware of their lofty ambitions. If 11 Bit Studios manages to blend all these genres together and thoughtfully explore its themes, I think The Alters could be something special.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-franchise-500-million-figures<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has released some new figures for the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>franchise, showing just how popular and enduring the series' legacy truly is.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/en/aboutus/figures/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new set of numbers on the company's official website</a>,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>is nearing 500 million software units shipped worldwide, with the latest figure standing at a whopping 480 million.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that around 24 million of those, at last count, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-has-sold-13936-million-units-super-mario-bros-wonder-sold-1196-million">can be attributed</a> to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</em>, so the series is still going strong sales-wise despite the ambivalent reaction to those games' technical issues.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-franchise-numbers.jpg?itok=F8psW4wr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-franchise-numbers.jpg?itok=b2nvhZXF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Love 'em or hate 'em,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>have earned big bucks for The Pokemon Company.</figcaption></figure><p>In fact, a quick glance at Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">best-selling titles list</a> shows that&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Sword and Shield&nbsp;</em>have sold around 26 million units, so between them, the mainline&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games on the Switch alone make up for more than 10% of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>'s total software sales.</p>

<p>The Pokemon Company points out that&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>has been translated into nine languages around the world, too, so it's a truly global franchise (as if you needed reminding).</p>

<p>On the trading card side, the company pulls out some more staggering statistics. Almost 65 billion&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>cards have been manufactured since the game was launched, and the card game is available in 15 different languages across 93 countries.</p>

<p><em>Pokemon</em>'s animated TV offerings, meanwhile, have been made available in 192 countries and regions around the world. It's a pretty sobering reminder that it's&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>'s world, and we're all just living in it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-franchise-numbers-animated-series.jpg?itok=dJFuQDNX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-franchise-numbers-animated-series.jpg?itok=1-vdDVSj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon</em>'s animated series offerings are truly global.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, it's not like the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>franchise is done conquering the world, so these numbers are likely to get even more impressive over time.</p>

<p>While a mainline&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>game hasn't been announced for this year,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced">lined up for a release on Switch in early 2025</a>, and a new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Trading Card Game&nbsp;</em>mobile app is scheduled to arrive this year.</p>

        <p>As companies start to rebuild the development capacity lost in mass layoffs and closures, much of the focus will be on growing new studios away from traditional high-cost regions</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The enormous wave of layoffs, studio closures, and corporate consolidations which hit the games industry last year is by no means over – but it does appear to have crested, at least, with the pace of such announcements starting to slow down as we've entered the second quarter of this 2024.</p>
<p>The knife will still fall in some painful places before this is over, but at last we're also starting to see early signs of recovery – green shoots amidst the rubble, with new studios being formed and some established ones cautiously starting to expand again.</p>
<p>The scale of the downturn this time around was unprecedented – not least because the industry overall is so much larger than in previous cycles, so there are more jobs to be lost in the first place – but the downturn itself was a familiar story. Companies over-extended in an economic environment where capital was easy to come by and made some bad bets on trends that didn't turn out to have the appeal or longevity they hoped; a shift in economic climate then dampened risk appetite and companies that had voraciously pursued growth for years suddenly found themselves obsessed with cost-cutting instead. This cycle has repeated throughout the industry's history at various intervals and at different scales.</p>
<p>It is a cycle, though, and the wheel that turns downwards eventually reaches its nadir and begins to move upwards again. It's a little too early to proclaim that we've bottomed out, but at some point fairly soon the industry will start the process of rebuilding the capacity it has just lost; hiring will outpace redundancies, and studio openings will become more commonplace than studio closures.</p>
<p>The big question, then, isn't whether the jobs that went away will come back – they will – but where and in what form they'll come back. The capacity the industry will rebuild will have a different focus and form to the capacity it tore down over the past year and a half. Crucially, it may also have a different location.</p>
<blockquote><p>"When the wheel turns back around from contraction to expansion, they'll be able to control costs by building up their new capacity in cheaper places than those in which they previously operated"</p></blockquote>
<p>To that last point, keep an eye on the trickle of announcements of new studio openings and expansions that we've started to see coming through. Just this week, Amazon announced that it's <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/amazon-opens-new-studio-in-bucharest">opening a new studio in Bucharest</a>. Larian, high off the extraordinary success of Baldur's Gate 3, is <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/larian-to-expand-with-warsaw-office">opening one in Warsaw</a>.</p>
<p>The depth of game development talent in Eastern Europe is unquestionable – the era when game companies in that region were almost exclusively working as outsourcing houses for major studios in North America or Western Europe is long gone – but it's also undeniable that the cost of operating a studio in those regions is much cheaper than in traditional game development heartlands like the West Coast of America or the South of England.</p>
<p>As the industry begins to rebuild its lost capacity, that cost calculation is going to be a tough one to avoid. At the same time that the games business was carrying out mass layoffs and closures, inflation in high cost of living areas was running at its highest level in a generation, and salaries in those areas have gone up significantly in response.</p>
<p>Game development is incredibly labour intensive, requiring a lot of people with a wide range of advanced technical and creative skills; the cost of labour is one of the most defining aspects of the overall cost of creating a game. If you can successfully operate a studio somewhere like Eastern Europe or South-East Asia rather than in Los Angeles or London, you can bring down development costs significantly – at least in theory.</p>

</figure>
<p>That cost gap has always existed, of course, and publishers have been experimenting with opening studios in less expensive regions for decades – but in the current climate, the calculus has shifted quite resoundingly in that direction.</p>
<p>That's not just because costs in expensive regions have soared, far outpacing wage growth in less expensive regions; it's also because the skilled labour base with the technical and artistic skills required to build games has improved significantly in many cheaper regions. In many places, especially in Eastern Europe, there's also now a base of skilled workers with significant game development experience, which was always the key thing that was lacking in these regions in the past; there were tons of skilled young people but few who had the kind of experience of development that's required to ensure that projects run smoothly, and relatively easy to find in workforces in those traditional game development heartlands.</p>
<p>The conclusion a lot of companies are going to reach is the same; when the wheel turns back around from contraction to expansion, they'll be able to control costs by building up their new capacity in cheaper places than those in which they previously operated.</p>
<p>However, the question of whether that new capacity will really be able to get up to speed quickly and effectively remains a thorny one. There are certainly more experienced staff in these regions than in the past, but there's still a major gap – and that's problematic when you're trying to maximise the efficiency of your new development resources.</p>
<p>The advantage of experienced staff is that they've made mistakes, and watched others make mistakes, and know how to avoid those mistakes in future; that's experience in a nutshell, and a studio lacking that experience will probably make a ton of costly, time-consuming mistakes that could have been avoided otherwise.</p>
<p>Moreover, many of the staff available in less costly regions, while very highly skilled, are skilled in ways that may look similar on paper to what staff in an established developer would be like, but are very different in practice. For example, there is a new wealth of game development talent in India, but it's almost exclusively focused on mobile game development, and even at that tends to be focused on creating games for lower-spec devices – a valuable and worthwhile skillset, but not one that's easily parlayed into developing for high-end consoles or PCs.</p>
<blockquote><p>"The games industry will build up capacity again in the next year or two, but a large proportion of that will be in cheaper locations"</p></blockquote>
<p>What has tended to happen in the past is that companies establish studios in cheaper regions using less experienced staff, while the experienced staff in more expensive regions find funding and establish their own independent studios; ultimately, many of the studios in cheaper regions simply end up functioning as outsourcing providers for those experienced developers, who have been bought up by publishers on the upturn of the cycle. It's generally been a fairly wasteful way to reach a straightforward outcome – but there's a growing sense that things could be different this time, as regions like Eastern Europe and (for mobile titles at least) South and South-East Asia now have some homegrown experienced talent available.</p>
<p>What's more, rising living standards in many of those places – combined with many people in expensive regions in the West feeling increasingly priced out of a decent standard of living – could make it appealing for experienced developers from western countries to move there and work for these new studios. That's something that has tended to be very rare in the past, with developers generally only moving to such studios when they were taking on senior management roles, but the push and pull factors for people who have been working in extremely high cost-of-living areas are markedly different this time around, and a kind of "reverse brain drain" is arguably on the cards, especially for younger and more mobile staff.</p>
<p>In the short- to mid-term, at least, the outcome is clear; the games industry is going to start to seriously build up capacity again at some point in the next year or two, but a large proportion of that capacity is going to be located in cheaper locations than previously.</p>
<p>What's less clear this time around is what the fate of those new studios in cheaper regions will be; more than any point in the past, there's reason to believe that they could thrive and even start to attract experienced talent from other regions.</p>
<p>For those affected by the industry layoffs, however, this just introduces another thorny issue to grapple with; as hiring begins to ramp back up in earnest, many people may have to face tough questions about their willingness to move to lower-cost regions to continue their careers.</p>

            <p>Arrowhead's chaotic alien-shooter Helldivers 2 became <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever</a>, but despite its initial success, player numbers have since declined.</p>
<p>A look at the game's Steam charts shows a steady drop since February, when the game launched. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/553850/charts/#3m">SteamDB</a>, at its peak in February shortly after launch, there were 458,709 concurrent players. In comparison, its peak over the last 30 days is 166,305. That's a drop of 64 percent.</p>
<p>Looking by average players, February had 208,303 helldivers in the game. That average player count has dropped to 78,634 over the last 30 days (a 62 percent drop).</p>

</figure>
<p>Of course, player numbers are expected to drop over time. But for Helldivers 2 there are a number of factors that may have contributed to this decline.</p>
<p>The most notable reason is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">infamous PSN debacle that kicked off earlier this month</a>. At the start of May, Helldivers 2 publisher Sony announced players on Steam would soon be required to link a PlayStation Network (PSN) account to keep playing. This not only resulted in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements">swathes of negative reviews from a very disappointed community</a>, but the game was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">pulled from sale in 177 countries where PSN was not available</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">Sony soon backtracked on its plans</a>, stating it was "still learning what is best for PC players", calling the monumental spate of feedback "invaluable".</p>
<p>Another factor contributing to the game's decline in player numbers could be the balancing, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-gets-new-ceo-plans-to-remain-an-independent-studio">Arrowhead's newly appointed chief creative officer and chairman Johan Pilestedt</a> previously admitted the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-balancing-has-sometimes-gone-too-far-ceo-admits">team sometimes went too far with</a>. Additionally, the game has sometimes been subject to bugs and other issues, causing player frustration.</p>
<p>In response, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-studio-mulling-slightly-lower-update-frequency-after-hectic-first-few-months">Helldivers 2 team is now considering a "slightly lower" but higher standard update frequency</a> after a busy first few months.</p>
<figure>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>SteamDB/Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While there has undeniably been a drop in player numbers, Helldivers 2 remains popular, and Pilestedt believes the game's success is not because of the price point (Helldivers 2 currently retails at a comparatively modest £34.99 on Steam).</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Pilestedt spoke at the Nordic Game conference, where he addressed Helldivers 2's 'smash hit' status. Here, he stated Arrowhead managed to get the "fundamentals" right and delivered on the "fantasy" of the experience. While many others have made shooters like Helldivers 2 before, Pilestedt said his team "dug into the believability of what it would be to be in that game". </p>
<p>Pilestedt also reasoned Helldivers 2 is an authentic experience in a lot of ways and doesn't put up barriers that wouldn't be actually there. "In Star Wars, how many strikes does it take to cut somebody's hand off with a lightsaber? It's one," he said. "It is fundamental that we adhere to the fantasy... Fine, balance it, but don't make it two strikes. I know that's false, and now we're not making a Star Wars game anymore." </p>
<p>
Another factor that has contributed to Helldivers 2's success is its style, with the developer stating the game is a "representation of those who made it". </p>
<p>Pilestedt lastly touched on its success as a live service game, something others have struggled with. "It's easy to say, 'well, we'll earn more money by being able to drop a content pack here and there'. But that's not a reason why any consumer would want to engage with us," he noted. </p>
<p>Pilestedt said live service games can be good for the industry "if done right", as they become a continuously evolving hobby. "If you forget this when making a live service game, then I think that - I don't want to say it's a problem - but it is a problem. I think that is a problem... I've decided it's a problem, it's a massive problem," he said.</p>
<p>He also implored developers not to shy away from engaging with its community. While he admitted there are "arseholes" out there, that should not prevent a studio from interacting with its fanbase. He noted there will be times when people get "pissed", acknowledging that PSN hoo-ha. "But, at that point, it's like 'ah, sorry! Yeah, that was a bad move by us'... an apology doesn't mean that you devalue your own brand as an organisation, it just strengthens you."</p>
<p>You can hear Pilestedt talk in the video below, starting at the 4hr 37 minute mark.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-update-1003-adds-new-boss-challenge-new-outfits-and-more<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> developer Shift Up Corp. has released patch 1.003, adding a new Boss Challenge, new outfits for main character Eve, and more.</p><p>Stellar Blade is an action game released exclusively on PlayStation 5 in April. IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-review">Stellar Blade review</a> returned a 7/10. We said: “Stellar Blade is great in all of the most important ways for an action game, but dull characters, a lackluster story, and several frustrating elements of its RPG mechanics prevent it from soaring along with the best of the genre.”</p><p>Now, a month after release, the new update adds the Boss Challenge mode, which pits players against the 19 bosses from the base game. Progression in the Boss Challenge requires battle data from bosses you’ve previously defeated, director Kim Hyung Tae explained in a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/23/stellar-blade-adds-new-boss-challenge-mode-on-may-24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a>. You can also fight bosses on the hard difficulty setting after you’ve seen the ending of the game.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/24/sb1-1716548636019.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>To start the challenge, you can either load up and use your own gear you’ve been using or choose one of several presets. “Choose the minimum preset for a true challenge, which is extremely understated, or the maximum preset, which has all of your skills and stats buffed up, if you want to taunt the boss with some spectacular combat,” Kim Hyung Tae suggested.</p><p>After the challenge is over, your battle data is automatically analyzed. You’ll see metrics like battle time, number of perfect parries and dodges, consumable usage, and more. You can compare your results with those of your friends. If you defeat all bosses in the Boss Challenge on Normal difficulty setting or higher, you’ll get to earn the Neurolink Suit for Eve, below.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/24/sb3-1716548657498.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Speaking of new outfits, the update adds two new Nano Suits: White Kunoichi and Black Kunoichi (check them out in the images below). Kim Hyung Tae encouraged players check in-game for more Nano Suits.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/24/sb4-1716548674770.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/24/sb5-1716548689495.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>And finally, quality-of-life improvements mean if you switch to ranged attack mode and switch back while locked on to an enemy, you will automatically lock on to the enemy again. The update also adds an option to always show the compass in the HUD.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

The clip, published by the <a href="https://x.com/ArkhamVideos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Arkham Videos X/Twitter account</a>, shows an icy section of Metropolis alongside an advert for Ho-Ho Frozen Chicken Bites.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The latest Suicide Squad patch added a small tease in Metropolis for Season 2, which supposedly will introduce Mrs. Freeze as a new playable character. <a href="https://t.co/N6w8xvG0AG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/N6w8xvG0AG</a></p>— Batman Arkham Videos (@ArkhamVideos) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArkhamVideos/status/1793319054435877058?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 22, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Rocksteady has yet to announce Season 2 or what it will add to the game, but it is expected to launch with a new playable character. Season 1 added Joker to the live service co-op shooter.</p><p>The addition of Mrs. Freeze won’t come as much of a surprise to Kill the Justice League’s core fanbase, given datamining has suggested playable characters on their way include Mrs. Freeze, Lawless, and Deathstroke. Given Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League's Joker is an alternate-reality Elseworlds variant hoovered into the Arkhamverse by Brainiac, this in-bound Mrs. Freeze may be an Elseworlds variant of Mr. Freeze.</p><p>In February, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-villain-seemingly-leaks-upcoming-playable-character">Kill the Justice League players were surprised to hear</a> main antagonist Brainiac appear to spoil the upcoming addition of Mrs. Freeze in-game. Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideSquadGaming/comments/1aiydw6/am_i_crazy_or_did_brainiac_just_call_me_freeze/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>ZeronintyPlays</u></a> posted a gameplay clip showing their Harley Quinn taking down an enemy, only to be called the wrong name by Brainiac. "I didn't expect you to be the weak link in this chain, Freeze," the baddie said.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>As reported earlier this month, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms"><u>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</u> has disappointed Warner Bros. Discovery</a>, owner of developer Rocksteady, to the tune of a $200 million hit to revenue.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review"><u>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League was panned by critics upon launch</u></a>, with extremely low player numbers on Steam. Some of the frustration stems from Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League not being another Batman game from Rocksteady, despite the fact it is set within the Arkhamverse. The developer’s Batman Arkham series is much-loved by fans, with 2011’s Batman: Arkham City in particular held up as one of the greatest, if not <em>the</em> greatest superhero video game of all time. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, on the other hand, is a live service third-person combat game in which Batman is a villain.</p><p>Rocksteady has faced tough questions around Warner Bros.’ long-term commitment to Suicide Squad’s live service. Warner Bros. is yet to announce Rocksteady's next project, but earlier this month <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-batman-arkham-game-in-years-is-a-vr-exclusive"><u>it revealed Batman: Arkham Shadow</u></a>, a VR game developed by Camouflaj, maker of the Iron Man VR game, and set for release exclusively on the Meta Quest 3 later in 2024.</p><p><em>Image credit: Arkham Videos X/Twitter account.</em></p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

While the Pro parts initially required a specialty guitar controller, the new update will introduce options for playing them on a standard keyboard or gamepad across all consoles and PC.</p><p>Unlike standard Fortnite Festival parts, Pro parts require players to hold down the correct fret key and strum to hit a note. Pro Lead and Bass parts also have unique note types called hammer-ons and pull-offs, which replace standard parts' Lift Notes. To hit these notes, which look visually different to normal notes, you just have to press the corresponding key with no strumming.</p>

<p>With the new update, v30.00, players will be able to keybind their own controls for Pro Lead and Bass, mapping the five colored notes as well as the strum key. This will allow players to use any keyboard or controller they like for Pro parts, in any configuration they like. By default, the keyboard mapping has fretting on keys 1-5 and strumming on Right Shift and Enter, allowing you to hold the keyboard as you would a guitar... if it were missing a string. </p><p>The update is also making some changes to how Pro parts work as a whole, introducing some improvements to hitting hammer-ons and pull-offs without strumming, as well as adding the option to toggle input labels under the note highway on in Pro parts.</p><p>While it won't arrive in this update, Fortnite is also working on improving the feel of guitar controllers, with some players saying fret forgiveness currently feels too strict. Fortnite is also working on plans to expand the number of guitar controllers compatible with the game.</p><p>The new update also has some added options for non-Pro parts, such as the option to view multi-colored notes instead of Fortnite Festival's standard single-color track, and the option to play all parts, including drums and vocals, with a supported guitar controller.</p><p>The new update v30.00 arrives today.</p>

            <p>
GTA 5 will no longer be part of the PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium games catalogue offering as of the middle of next month, as the countdown continues to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Rockstar's hugely-popular open world is now listed among the games labelled as being your "Last chance to play", visible from your PlayStation console.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has spotted a dozen games set to depart the service on 18th June, with other top picks including indie adventure Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons and sci-fi puzzler The Talos Principle. 
</p>
<p>
The full list of games leaving PlayStation Plus Extra/Premium next month are: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons </li>
<li>DC League of Super-Pets: The Adventures of Krypto and Ace</li>
<li>Dodgeball Academia</li>
<li>Grand Theft Auto 5</li>
<li>Indivisible</li>
<li>Monster Jam Steel Titans </li>
<li>MotoGP 23 </li>

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-leads-decembers-playstation-plus-extra-and-premium-catalogue-additions">GTA 5 was only added to the PlayStation Plus Extra/Premium catalogue relatively recently</a> - on 19th December 2023 - so its tenure has lasted just six months. 
</p>
<p>
Its arrival marked a flurry of fresh activity in the decade-old game, as the countdown began to the long, long-awaited arrival of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-coming-in-fall-2025-publisher-take-two-reveals">GTA 6 - now set to launch in autumn 2025</a>. None of this has stopped GTA 5 from continuing to shift yet more copies, of course - it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-sales-have-topped-a-staggering-200m">now passed another staggering sales milestone</a>.

"Publishers shouldn't be judged by their biggest hit. In the end, I think the best way to judge a publisher is by the spread of all of their games.

But not the mean, because the average can always be dragged up by those big hits–but the median is telling.

How they support those developers and whether they stand by them."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bender explains devs should also be wary of publishers "operating in a predatory or opportunistic way," especially in the world of indie publishing. How can you identify those bad actors? He says one warning sign to look out for is publishers that essentially fire from the hip.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You know, [there are publishers that will] sign five games. Four will flop. One will succeed. And they forget about the flops and put all of their efforts into the one that's perceived as having the highest ROI," continues Bender.

Tim Bender, co-founder and CEO of Manor Lords publisher Hooded Horse, believes it's important to avoid becoming wrapped up in another company's success. Instead, look at how publishers treat those project and studios that perhaps underperformed. It's pretty bold advice coming from Bender, whose own company recently found meteoric success with Manor Lords. The strategic medieval city builder amassed over 3.2 million Steam wishlists and topped 1 million sales in rapid time under the stewardship of Hooded Horse, but Bender emphasised that project is a clear outlier.

It's also possible to browse a company's entire portfolio, highlighting the entire breadth of performances from top to bottom.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bender claims the site is "so accurate," which is a rather compelling testimonial given he's well placed to compare Gamalytic's estimates with, say, Hooded Horse's actual numbers. He concedes it still occasionally gets some things wrong, but says the figures it throws out are "pretty damn impressive." Gamalytic itself claims 77 percent of its estimates are within 30 percent margin of error, while 98 percent are within 50 percent margin of error. "At an aggregate level, estimates were 99 percent accurate," adds the site.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When analysing those figures, Bender says developers need to look for signs of "consistent performance."

		<p>I’ve found a renewed love for Overwatch 2 this week, and as such I’ve been spending more time than is healthy in competitive matchmaking. What it has taught me is that if someone else plays as Moira I don’t really know how to play any other support characters. Then everything goes to hell. Still, I’ve mostly been having fun. Other than that, I’ve been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/21/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-review/">Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</a> for review, and dipping into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/20/the-arrival-of-monster-hunter-stories-on-playstation-and-pc-finally-puts-the-series-in-one-place/">Monster Hunter Stories 1+2</a> as well.</p>
<p>Firstly, this week is a big one for one of our News Editors, <strong>Aran</strong>, as he is getting married tomorrow! Huge congratulations, and we wish you all the best on your special day from all of us at TSA!</p>

<p><strong>Jim</strong> is not getting married, instead deciding to wrap up the Thieves Guild quests in Skyrim and turning his sights towards The Dark Brotherhood. He says, “I’ve thoroughly enjoyed my return to The Elder Scrolls series and now have a deep longing to play Oblivion.” He continued, “While I would say that starting another open-world game would be foolish, that’s exactly what I’ve done with Death Stranding. Having abandoned it soon after launch, I felt like I jumped off just before things we’re about to get good. In some ways that’s true – I’ve now surpassed where I was on my original playthrough, and have access to progression unlocks that make the game less of a chore, no doubt bolstered by some post-launch content and QoL improvements. With a sequel on the way, I’m definitely going to stick with it, even if I’m also juggling Ghost of Tsushima which – I’m happy to report – plays nicely on Steam Deck.”</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> has played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/23/crown-wars-the-black-prince-review/">Crown Wars: The Black Prince for review,</a> and you can check out his thoughts right now! Otherwise, he’s been maintaining his pirate empire in Skull of Bones. He tells us, “Gotta say, I’m still thoroughly enjoying the game and am genuinely excited for Season 2 dropping next week! Oh, and I’ve been playing some Star Wars: Jedi Survivor, fantastic blockbuster action game, if that’s your kind of thing the game does not disappoint!”</p>


<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has played Capes, an XCOM style superhero game, as well as Diablo IV, and Baldur’s Gate 3. Meanwhile, <strong>Nick P</strong> has seemingly played a bit of everything. Stellar Blade, Helldivers 2, Dead by Daylight, Street Fighter 6 and Killer Klowns from Outer Space for review next week.</p>
<p>Rounding things out for the week, <strong>Tef</strong> polished off a review of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/21/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-switch-review/">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a>, loving the ability to play the GameCube classic on Switch, and that’s before the lovely makeover in a new engine. He also hopped into some matches of Killer Klowns with Nick and Steve to help fill out the server.</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

            <p>
The developer of MultiVersus has gone "above and beyond" to ensure the game is protected from dataminers.
</p>
<p>
The free-to-play fighter is out next week and includes villains like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-files-point-to-mark-hamill-as-the-joker">The Joker</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-think-the-matrix-is-coming-to-multiversus">Agent Smith from The Matrix</a>, both of which were rumoured long before their reveals.
</p>
<p>
Now, it seems the developer has put stronger defences in place to protect the game from future dataminers, though there's no guarantee there won't be further leaks.

<p>
MultiVersus director Tony Huynh told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/multiversus-director-says-dataminers-do-a-disservice-to-the-players/">VGC</a> that datamining is a "disservice to the players" as they "don't get the grand reveal that we have planned".
</p>
<p>
"It is an arms race, so it'll be constant protections against new and creative ways to datamine," said Huynh. "At the end of the day, we've done a lot, we've learned a lot, but again, it is an arms race.
</p>
<p>
"I can't promise that there won't ever be leaks or anything like that. But on our end, we've done, I think, above and beyond what industry standards and protections there are.
</p>
<p>
"That being said, everyone's very creative and they're... they're just very, very smart. We're reacting, and we put a lot of stuff in place, but I'm just continuously impressed by their level of ability to get through things."
</p>
<p>
He continued: "I think it's a disservice to the players, honestly, that these things are ruined, and it's deflating for the team as well.
</p>
<p>
"But more importantly, it's - I wouldn't use the word 'depressing' - it's just unfortunate for the players. They don't get the grand reveal that we have planned, and a lot of the air is sucked out of the room."
</p>
<p>
MultiVersus held an open beta last year, which then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-to-shut-down-until-2024-with-no-refunds-for-paying-players">closed ahead of a full release</a>. That's happening next week across PC (Steam and Epic), PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S, with cross-platform and cross-progression play.

</p>
<p>
Ahead of the release, developer Player First Games has detailed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/returning-multiversus-beta-players-will-receive-free-premium-battle-pass">season one premium battle pass</a>, which will be available for free for players returning from the beta. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-adds-the-matrixs-agent-smith-jason-voorhees">Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th</a> is the main draw.

			<p>The <a href="https://roguetrader.owlcat.games/">Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</a> DLC expansion called Void Shadows is launching this August, introducing 15 hours of new content to the massive cRPG developed by Owlcat Games.</p>
<p>The Void Shadows expansion, which launches on August 8th, will allow players to delve into the depths of their voidship to fight a new enemy that is trying to bring down the von Valacious dynasty from the inside. The expansion will add two new archetypes with unique abilities, new lore content, a new companion, the Death Cult Assassin Kibellah, new crew members, new locations, and more. All the content will be seamlessly integrated into the main campaign, so it will be possible to bring the new companion along in base campaign's quests and use the new archetypes freely.</p>

<p>Even with the Void Shadows DLC expansion, Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is a massive cRPG filled to the brim with content. While prior knowledge of the Warhammer 40,000 universe makes it more enjoyable, the game does its best to introduce newcomers to the universe created by Games Workshop, although a lack of innovation and some frustrating mechanics do hold the experience back a bit, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader-charting-a-new-course/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>With the great amount of love for the setting that was poured into the game evident from every line of dialogue and every little detail, Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is one of the best games based on the universe created by Games Workshop, and a solid tactical turn-based role-playing game that can provide hundreds of hours of fun. However, while the lack of innovation isn't a major setback thanks to its high-quality campaign, the presence of bugs and frustrating mechanics prevents it from being a must-have for all RPG enthusiasts, limiting its appeal beyond Warhammer 40,000 and Owlcat Games fans.</em></p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p><span>A gallery of weathered posters from the start of Death of the Outsider.</span></p>
		</div><div>
		<p><em>Following a devastating winter and spring for the games industry, and a lot of dismal rhetoric from publishers and platform holders, Rob and Patrick try and reckon with what the future holds for the kinds of games and experiences they have always loved... and maybe the entire concept of commercial art.</em></p><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Hey Rob, earlier this week I finally put the finishing touches <a href="https://remapradio.com/other/i-burned-myself-out-playing-a-game-i-love/" rel="noreferrer">on Final <em>Fantasy VII: Rebirth</em></a>, the second installment in a trilogy (!!) of remakes/sequels to a video game from 1997. It’s been 27 years since I played that original game. So much has happened since then in my life, not the least of which includes the death of my father and the birth of my two children. I’m nearly 40, but still don’t have gray hair. The video game industry has also changed radically, too, with different power brokers entering and leaving, and the form of the devices we play on undergoing radical shifts along the way. But for all that supposed change, nearly 30 years later, I’m still playing a story about a guy named Cloud and a girl named Aeris—sorry, <em>Aerith</em>—and it makes me wonder: how often do radical shifts end up feeling less radical with some distance?</p><p>I say this because on a recent podcast, we collectively wondered whether some of the games we like to play are going away. Thousands have been laid off and dozens of studios shuttered. There are unknowable numbers of games that you and I probably would have loved that we’ll never actually play, because their developers will never get a chance to ship them. What the industry is going through at the moment is, undeniably, <em>change</em>. I just don’t know what’s on the other end of it, and for as rocky as it feels, isn’t there a good chance it looks remarkably similar?</p><p>Who’s going to make the next immersive sim? Arkane Austin isn’t going to make another <em>Prey</em>, but this year, we were also treated to a loving <em>System Shock</em> remake. <em><u>Deathloop</u></em> wasn’t that long ago, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/indie-gaming-is-on-the-verge-of-an-immersive-sim-eruption?ref=remapradio.com"><u>and indies have taken up the design torch with gusto</u></a>. It feels like we’ve poured one out for the immersive sim at least a dozen times, during the eras of Waypoint and Remap.</p><p>Inevitably, are we collectively playing out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjKZzKLpNII&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>“that gum you like is going to come back in style”?</u></a></p><p>There <a href="https://kotaku.com/old-games-2023-playtime-data-fortnite-roblox-minecraft-1851382474?ref=remapradio.com"><u>was an interesting data point going around recently</u></a> about how the most played video games in 2023 were, broadly, old. Games like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Minecraft</em>, <em>Roblox</em>, <em>League of Legends</em>, and others dominated, with precious few “new” games managing to sneak in. Strange days, surely, but if <em>Fortnite</em> is the avenue for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/23/24137577/fortnite-festival-rock-band-4-controllers?ref=remapradio.com"><u>a <em>Rock Band </em>resurrection</u></a>, praise be. But it’s also incredibly scary if you’re a player of a certain age, because you can easily look at that data and tell yourself a story that ostracizes your interests with a few more demographic shifts.</p><p>I don’t know what to make of it. I also can’t help but wonder if, 10 years on, it’ll look shockingly similar to right now, just as Square Enix begins to roll out its three-part <em>Chrono Trigger</em> remake, and we’re watching someone present their new take on a game directly inspired by <em>Dishonored</em>.</p><p>So I put the question to you: how do you feel you, and the games you play, fit in this landscape?</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>The December 1995 issue of Computer Gaming World, back when the Wing Commander Franchise commanded some of the biggest budgets in games.</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>On the one hand, I think you are right that the future will look an awful lot like the present: an industry that is declining and stagnating, yet managing to bring forth flourishing crops of great games. On the other hand, the cycle of boom and bust can still have an overarching trend, the same way you can still get bitterly cold winters against a backdrop of global heating. I think that barring some major, transformative changes to business models, the future of the games industry will almost certainly be&nbsp; less interesting, less original, and less sustainable than it was in the past. It will also keep finding ways to produce the kind of stuff we’re worried will go away.</p><p>I bring this up a lot, but developer Greg Costikyan gave two famous GDC rants a decade apart, each producing impending doom for the industry. The 2004 speech is <a href="https://boingboing.net/2005/03/11/game-developers-amaz.html?ref=remapradio.com"><u>absolutely scorched earth</u></a>: at one point he said, “Iwata-san has the heart of a gamer, and my question is what poor bastard's chest did he carve it from?” This speech doesn’t think there’s such a thing as a “good suit”, putting it at odds with a decade of deferential and even fawning treatment of industry leaders from players and parts of the press.</p><p>But here’s the real crux of his argument:</p><blockquote>Who was at the Microsoft keynote? I don't know about you but it made my flesh crawl. The HD era? Bigger, louder? Big bucks to be made! Well not by you and me of course. Those budgets and teams ensure the death of innovation.</blockquote><blockquote>…My friends, we are <em>fucked</em>. We are well and truly fucked. The bar in terms of graphics and glitz has been raised and raised until we can't afford to do anything at all. 80 hour weeks until our jobs are all outsourced to Asia. But it's ok because the HD era is here right? I say, enough. The time has come for revolution! It may seem to you that what I describe is inevitable forces of history, but no, we have free will! EA could have chosen to focus on innovation, but they did not. Nintendo could make development kits cheaply available to small firms, but they prefer to rely on the creativity of one aging designer. You have choices, too: work in a massive sweatshop publisher-run studio with thousands of others making the next racing game with the same gameplay as Pole Position. Or you can riot in the streets of Redwood City! Choose another business model, development path, and you can choose to remember why you love games and make sure in a generation's time there are still games to love.</blockquote><p>Electrifying stuff! And you read it and there’s a lot here that he was right about… but then you think about how much amazing stuff came out between this rant and his next one in 2014 where he revisited these themes. </p><p>People who believe strongly in the inherent wisdom of markets and their power to give people what they want, and who see that forces of progress (technical or otherwise) often open up opportunities and innovation in seemingly moribund fields, will see these discrepancies and argue that the doomsayers were wrong. The world didn’t end, it got better!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dog-boss-neil-druckmann-says-ai-will-revolutionize-how-content-is-being-created<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">But it brings up "ethical issues we need to address."</h2></div><section><p>Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann has said AI will "revolutionize" video game development process, but cautioned that the controversial technology has “ethical issues.”</p><p>Druckmann, Studio Head and Head of Creative at The Last of Us and Uncharted developer Naughty Dog, issued the comment as part of a <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sony-published interview</a> on the company’s ‘Creative Entertainment Vision.’ Druckmann was asked how he envisions the “fusion of storytelling and technology evolving over the next 10 years” as part of a Sony series that also revealed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-might-a-playstation-controller-look-like-10-years-from-now-sony-has-an-idea">an idea for a futuristic PlayStation controller</a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/24/the-last-of-us-1716544738405.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Last of Us Part I. Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Here’s Druckmann’s response in full:</p><blockquote>We're seeing this exciting marriage of cutting-edge technology with traditional storytelling that's pushing us into a future where enhanced fidelity isn't just about achieving realism, but about broadening the spectrum from highly stylized visuals to ultra-realistic ones. This broadening of possibilities is fueled by increasingly accessible tools that allow even non-technical people to use their imagination and create worlds and narratives to their heart's content.</blockquote><blockquote>Moreover, AI is really going to revolutionize how content is being created, although it does bring up some ethical issues we need to address. With technologies like AI and the ability to do motion capture right from home, we're reducing both costs and technical hurdles, opening the door for us to take on more adventurous projects and push the boundaries of storytelling in games. This evolution is truly empowering creators to bring their visions to life without the traditional obstacles.</blockquote><p>Later in the interview Druckmann said AI will let Naughty Dog "create nuanced dialogues and characters, expanding creative possibilities," but insisted it was "crucial to precisely direct these tools to achieve the intended outcomes."</p><p>"I emphasize mastering fundamentals over tools; with AI, your creativity sets the limits," Druckmann said. "Understanding art history, composition, and storytelling is essential for effective direction. Tools evolve quickly — some tools once essential, now are obsolete. At Naughty Dog, we transitioned from hand-animating 'Jak and Daxter' to using motion capture in 'Uncharted', significantly enhancing our storytelling. AI will allow us to create nuanced dialogues and characters, expanding creative possibilities.

            <p>
The developer behind new gacha adventure <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wuthering-waves-tier-list-best-characters-9436">Wuthering Waves</a> has apologised for the number of bugs and lag issues at launch.
</p>
<p>
The game launched worldwide yesterday (UK time) but has already seen multiple hotfixes, the latest of which forced an uninstall and reinstall of the game, Eurogamer can confirm.
</p>
<p>
An English post on X from Chinese developer Kuro Games has acknowledged the situation and promised players compensation of ten Lustrous Tides - essentially gacha pulls for new characters and weapons. Further, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WutheringWaves/comments/1cz0ua9/wuwa_dev_apology/">BiliBili post in Chinese</a> includes a fully apology.

"We have identified some issues that have impacted your gaming experience and are now actively working on solutions," wrote the developer. "We are committed to constant self-reflection and improvement, with your satisfaction as our top priority. We are incredibly grateful for your understanding and patience during our recent technical issues."

Further, a <a href="https://wutheringwaves.kurogames.com/en/main/news/detail/777">news post on the game's website</a> details a list of known issues. That includes a login timeout issue that's supposedly been fixed, issues of age authentication in certain areas, and needing to repeatedly log in when the game client is relaunched on PC.

</p>
<p>
The post also acknowledges localisation quality and performance issues. "We have received feedback regarding the localisation quality of the game," it reads. "Ensuring high-quality localisation has always been a priority for us, and we are fully committed to improving it. Currently, our team is endeavouring to continuously rectify and optimise the localised texts to provide an enjoyable experience for Rovers everywhere. Fixes to some of the known issues with the current localised texts will be included in the patches to be released soon."

It continues: "Please rest assured that we are dedicated to providing the best possible experience for our players, and we take performance concerns seriously. In future updates, we will continue to optimise the game's performance to improve your gaming experience."

<p>
In the meantime, fans have been sharing posts on the game's subreddit to show the current state of the game, including the below lag issues.

            <p>Activision have celebrated my birthday in the traditional manner by announcing a new Call Of Duty game. Said Call Of Duty game is Black Ops 6, "a dark new chapter" in the Treyarch-helmed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> sub-series which is known for seedier and weirder, alt-historical or post-future stories featuring hallucinations and cybernetics and catchy period music.</p> <!--more-->
<p>What do we know right now about Black Ops 6? Friend, right now I can tell you little other than that the logo art appears to feature a wolf wearing the Capitol building as a hat. Please let this not be my weary end-of-week projection. Please let this be evidence that Black Ops 6's major antagonist (or protagonist?) is a wolf so vast it is obliged to clothe itself in major US landmarks. Perhaps it could wear the Pentagon as a diaper? Ho ho ho I slay myself. Please let this be evidence that Black Ops 6 is secretly a Bayonetta game. Hitting a giga-wolf over the noggin with the Capitol building is absolutely a thing Bayonetta would do. You can keep your silly tactical nukes, Mason.</p>
 <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>2024's Call Of Duty will get <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-2024-and-gears-6-to-get-june-reveal-alongside-avowed-and-indiana-jones-release-dates-claims-report">a proper reveal at Summer Games Fest</a>, and is the subject of many a rumour. For example, the game will reportedly be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-call-of-duty-will-launch-on-game-pass-on-day-one-reports-say">the first Call Of Duty to launch on Game Pass</a>, which one former Microsoft employee has described as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game-passs-only-outside-shot-for-sustainability-is-to-get-gta-6-or-call-of-duty-says-former-microsoft-senior-pr-lead">essential</a> if the subscription service is to do numbers of sufficient magnitude to offset Microsoft's recent billion-dollar inhalation of Activision-Blizzard. It's also rumoured to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-call-of-duty-is-a-black-ops-game-set-during-the-first-gulf-war-according-to-reports">set during the events of the first Gulf War</a>.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as I have emotions about Call Of Duty these days, Black Ops is the aspect of the FPS juggernaut I have the greatest fondness for. It's as basically batshit and half-cocked in its representation of war and history as the Modern Warfare series, but Black Ops at least has the courtesy to be openly batshit and half-cocked rather than making reference to authenticity and fidelity. A giga-wolf would fit in perfectly here, Activision. Make it so. Come on, it's my birthday.</p>

            <p>The Asus ROG Ally X, a sort of semi-sequel to last year’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-ally-review-a-nifty-handheld-pc-with-the-best-and-worst-of-windows">ROG Ally</a> handheld PC, has had its specs spilled over at <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-rog-ally-x-specs-leaked-24gb-lpddr5x-7500-memory-and-massive-80-wh-battery">Videocardz</a>. I’m usually a lot more suspicious of hardware leaks, which are often just out-of-date or otherwise inaccurate info, but I’ve also sat through enough mic-muted prebriefings to know an official slideshow when I see one, and that appears to be exactly what Videocardz got its hands on. Besides, these specs include a gigantic 80Whr battery upgrade (doubling the ROG Ally’s 40Whr capacity), so we can at least file this under "News James <em>wants</em> to be true."</p>

<p>It's not as wide-ranging a refresh as the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> was to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, as the ROG Ally X will apparently keep the same Ryzen Z1 Extreme APU that powered the original model. The display also appears unchanged, sticking with a 7in, 1920x1080 IPS panel with 500cd/m2 peak brightness. But that new battery could be a major improvement, given how quickly the ROG Ally runs out of juice (and how unbefitting that lack of stamina is for a portable device).</p>
<p>The leak also lists a RAM upgrade to 24GB of LPDDR5, running at 7500MHz. Ye olde ROG Ally was no memory slouch, packing 16GB of LPDDR5 at 6400MHz, but that extra capacity and bandwidth might well produce performance upgrades; remember that with an all-in-one APU, memory is shared among the central processor and the GPU, so the latter is getting an indirect power boost.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-microsd-cards-for-steam-deck">microSD card</a> slot has also been moved away from the lower air vent, hopefully avoiding further cases of overheating that ROG Ally owners have occasionally grappled with. The more surprising storage change, though, is the listed support for M.2 2280 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming">SSDs</a> – the same kind you likely have in your desktop PC, rather the smaller, more expensive, less widely available <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-install-ssd-steam-deck">M.2 2230 drives</a> currently used by the ROG Ally and Steam Deck.</p>

</figure>
<p>All this added bigness has, inevitably, forced an increase in the ROG Ally X’s proportions. It will weigh 678g (up from 608g; the Steam Deck OLED weighs 640g) and measure 36.9mm across, so it’s gained 4.5mm of thickness. That’s still not as chunky as the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lenovo-legion-go-review">Lenovo Legion Go</a>, mind. Or as weighty.</p>
<p>Expect confirmation of the ROG Ally X’s specs and pricing at Computex, Taiwan’s computing-focused tech trade show of renown, on June 2nd. Word is it will release the same month, too.</p>
<p>I like the sound of all these changes, at least for a refresh – <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-vs-asus-rog-ally">battery chugging</a> was one of the original ROG Ally’s two biggest issues, and while I’m a Steam Deck OLED convert these days, there was nothing about the ROG Ally’s display or performance that seemed in drastic need of upgrades. It was also slim and light enough that the new design’s modest bulk additions surely can’t spoil it.</p>
<p>That said, its <em>second</em> biggest issue was the fiddliness of using Windows 11 on a small screen with no onboard trackpads, and for all of SteamOS’s occasional <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wuthering-waves-really-really-doesnt-want-to-run-on-steam-deck">compatibility headaches</a>, it’s still just a much more welcoming software experience than what the ROG Ally has ever offered. Asus actually have confirmed a new replacement for the Ally’s games launcher app, ROG Pulse (formerly Armory Crate), but I’m still waiting to be convinced that this and/or the ROG Ally X itself will fully address the underlying mismatch between OS and hardware.</p>

			<p>Persona 6 may not be too far off from release, as it has already been in development for a considerable amount of time.</p>
<p>Well-known ATLUS/SEGA leaker Midori shared today on X/Twitter the game's <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1793762106539684126">placeholder logo</a>, similar to Persona 5's placeholder which hinted at some of the game's themes. Alongside revealing the logo and suggesting the game will have some sort of <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1793797161336926704">"Yin and Yang" theme</a>, the leaker also revealed the sixth entry in the series has entered <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1793866862905958854">full production</a> before all the recently released entries in the series, such as Persona 3 Reload and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/persona-5-tactica-review/">Persona 5 Tactica</a>, so it is likely not too far from release, despite not having been officially announced yet.</p>
<p>Persona 6's "opposites" theme isn't exactly surprising, as another leaker talked about the game having a <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-6-dual-story-playstation-exclusive/">dual sides story</a> earlier this year. One of the characters, however, won't be playable in dungeons. The game is supposedly also employing a semi-open-world formula that should give players more freedom than in previous entries.</p>
<p>The latest entry in the series is the aforementioned Persona 3 Reload, remake of the third entry in the series which introduced many of the features that define the series today. You can learn more about it by checking out Chris' <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/persona-3-reload-review/">review.</a></p>
<p>Persona 6 has yet to be officially announced. We will keep you updated on the game as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <p>
Infused with Mad Max-y vibes, Fortnite's new season is here - bringing with it the game's Fallout crossover. 
</p>
<p>
We knew to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-first-look-at-fallouts-power-armour-in-fortnite">expect the Fallout T-60 Power Armour</a>, and now know the iconic suit is its own skin in the game, not a power-up. Joining it are a range of other punky wasteland warriors, Magneto from the X-Men, and a character named Peabody that's a pod of... peas.

Speaking of power-ups, Fallout's Nuka-Cola is available for you to chug as a health power-up, while the new Nitro power-up will buff both you (your speed, knockback, stamina rate, reload speed and fall damage immunity) and your vehicle (speed, ramming power, fuel consumption, attack mods).

Vehicles look to be playing a key part this season, with returning car mods and a suite of new add-ons that allow you to attach miniguns and grenade launchers to trucks, and upgrade to unpoppable bulletproof tyres. There's also an armoured battle bus to find and drive.
</p>
<p>
Peeking behind the scenes, datamines show a raft of things to come later this season which haven't yet been announced, such as returning pirate-themed items such as the Treasure Map and Pirate Cannon, set to return as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/billie-eilish-coming-to-fortnite-adding-weight-to-a-much-discussed-leak">part of a Pirates of the Caribbean crossover</a>, plus a character skin for Lethal Company. 
</p>
<p>
Fortnite's servers remain offline for the time being while the new season is readied. Here's hoping things get going quicker than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-5-season-2-launch-delayed-due-to-last-minute-snag">last season's delayed launch</a>.

            <p>Skulls! You’ve got one. I’ve got one. Everybody has a lovely skull keeping their lovely face right where it should be. Warhammer is big, so it needs must have multiple of them, hence their yearly event Skulls, which collates a bunch of Games Workshop related announcements into a sort of bizzaro world Nintendo Direct if Yoshi was actually a parasitic corpse emperor. There’s usually at least a few game announcements in there, and this year was a bumper. The headline announcement being an upcoming sequel to well-loved space-pope turn-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy </a><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-mechanicus">Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus</a>. Yes, yes. I’m getting to the dog.</p>

<p>You can check out the whole thing above, but here’s a happy little summary for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus is getting a numbered sequel. The first one was an excellent turn-based jaunt through Necron tombs as a crew of the titular cyborg popes. It was a little <em>too</em> easy on release, but they soon sorted that out with patches.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a> is getting a free legendary hero in the form of Karanak: the hound of vengeance. Calling your dog ‘the hound of vengeance’ is asking for trouble, if you ask me. Also, you’ll sound like tit calling its name, but I suppose Khorne cares not.</li>
<li>We got some new details for Void Shadows,  the next expansion for big talky RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader</a>. It’s got a new romanceable companion, alongside other, less romanceable things</li>
<li>Both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide">Darktide</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-vermintide-2">Vermintide 2</a> are getting updates.</li>
<li>Great boomy shooty <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-boltgun">Boltgun</a> is getting an expansion named ‘Forges of Corruption’</li>
<li><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a> has a <a href="https://youtu.be/jjqYQZxwi-E">new trailer</a> looking into the multiplayer. Everyone gets to be Spice Maureens now!</li>
</ul>
<p>Phew, that was a lot of skulls. Was there an Indiana Jones scene where he’s wading through skulls or am I imagining that? Either way, that’s how I feel. Just swimming through a sea of skulls. If you need a new skull, let me know, because I’ve got loads of them. While you’re waiting for all this newness to materialise, why not have a look at our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-boltgun-review">Boltgun review</a>. It’s a great time, say I. Caelyn Ellis agrees, writing “It’s a highly entertaining shooter that had me grinning from ear to ear on many an occasion, and is one of, if not the best representation of the Warhammer 40,000 universe available on your personal cogitation device.”</p>

Videogames and especially role-playing games are chock-full of sheltered upbringings that go tits up. Innocent times and places like the prologue for Baldur's Gate, which unfolds in the vast, fortified monastery of Candlekeep (beware spoilers from this point on).</p>
<p>BioWare's first ever <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> opens with your unsuspecting Chosen One learning the ropes from the old sage Gorion. There are fetchquests that take you around the enormous citadel, bits of combat training to do, cosy formative chinwags to have with characters like your childhood friend Imoen. But it's not to last, of course: Gorion is murdered, and you must rove the Sword Coast in pursuit of his killer. When you return to Candlekeep later in the game, this once-proud bastion of learning has been filled with doppelgangers of Gorion and other acquaintances, a parade of chatbots waiting to stab you in the back.

<p>
For a while, Larian thought about rebuilding Candlekeep in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, which begins many years later. And who better to take us through those plans, as we reckon with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ign-entertainment-acquires-eurogamer-gi-vg247-rock-paper-shotgun-and-more">the acquisition of Gamer Network</a> and <a href="https://x.com/ABeeWords/status/1792957956599972173">the departure of our incredible deputy editor Alice Bell</a>, than an old friend of RPS - one of the site's own former sages, Baldur's Gate 3's lead writer and our deputy editor till 2019, Adam Smith.

I spoke to Adam about Candlekeep following a characteristically illuminating and uncorporate presentation about Baldur's Gate 3's writing at this year's Digital Dragon's conference in Krakow. Some highlights from that presentation: "the sausage of sadness", a Larian term for when dialogue writing leads the player into a dead-end, and an audience participation element in which Adam asked people to decide whether various Baldur's Gate 3 romance scenes qualify as sex from the perspective of Youtube content guidelines, which amongst other things is the first time I have seen the other kind of sausage screened at a videogames conference, to say nothing of cunnilingus and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrZgnidmYUc">whatever the hell Gale is doing in this scene</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Adam had many additional insights of the sexalicious persuasion when I spoke to him later. Brace yourselves for them once I have worked out what to do with them. In the meantime: the question of Candlekeep in Baldur's Gate 3. "I had a bunch of ideas for it," Adam explained. "I think that it's a good setting, partly because it's going back to where it all began. So that was always compelling. But also because you get an academic dungeon, and there's something interesting about that kind of library dungeon. It's vast, you know, within the lore. And the idea of having this place where you need to go to do research or something, or you need to go down into it. And then you also say, well, this is where the Bhaalspawn was raised - you know, it's very, very attractive."

<p>
I'm a fan of enormous, sinister archives myself. I'm pretty sure I own enough books to fill a dungeon of at least three levels, though one would be stocked exclusively with crumbling GSCE poetry anthologies. So why isn't Candlekeep in Baldur's Gate 3? 
</p>
<p>
"The biggest problem was that geographically, it's on the way to Baldur's Gate," Adam continued. "So it's like, are we going to stop on the way there? Are we going to go in and then come back out again, how are we going to position it like that? The game went through a lot of different variations - one of them had you go into Baldur's Gate, and then come back out again. And then pacing-wise, it was a problem, because you have the escalation of Act 2 and the climax there. And then we're like, OK, do we, what do we want to do now? And actually, what we wanted to do was get to the city." 
</p>
<p>
Some additional context for our interview: at the time, I was in the process of learning about Gamer Network's acquisition. As a consequence, I was a bit shellshocked and wobbling all over the shop with my lines of inquiry. Fortunately, Adam had come to our chat with his very own Baldur's Gate party consisting of Larian CEO Swen Vincke, who chimed in companion-dialogue style with a follow-up question. (To be clear for the benefit of any higher-ups reading, I kept my mouth shut about the acquisition during our conversation, which is a missed opportunity - given <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-do-we-stop-the-next-round-of-games-industry-mass-layoffs">his past comments about games industry layoffs</a>, I'd have been interested to get Vincke's take on the current state of gaming media). 
</p>
<p>
"Do you remember all the stuff, all the crazy shit that you put in there?" Vincke asked Adam. "Yeah, yeah, there was a lot of crazy shit," said Adam. "There was the seer of the Far Realms. Yeah, I remember it all. Yeah."
</p>
<p>
"Because you were being very vague," Vincke pressed, journalistically. To which Adam responded: "Well, remember what I said about recycling your darlings."
</p>
<p>
("Recycling your darlings" is the redemptive Smith version of the popular creative mantra "Kill your darlings", aka ideas you love but which are fundamentally impractical and absorbing too much time and attention. During his Digital Dragons presentation, Adam illustrated this with an image of a massive pile of corpses. I can't remember if this was before or after he screened the illithid romance scene, which it turns out isn't even real sex in the eyes of Youtube. Sorry, illithidshippers.)
</p>
<p>
Thanks to Vincke's intervention, our musings on Candlekeep were able to continue. "The thing is, if you read the lore on Candlekeep, and actually, Wizards released a book called Candlekeep Mysteries, while we were in development - we got an early copy of that," Adam went on. "And it's like, any world that's full of knowledge is full of forbidden knowledge, and that's very interesting to me instantly. So there's a place in the Forgotten Realms, or the D&amp;D universe, I should say, called the Far Realms. And some of the lore says that's where the mindflayers began - it's the cosmic horror place, you know.
</p>
<p>
"So I had this whole idea that you'd have this seer, who's sitting at the bottom of Candlekeep, who is basically staring into the Far Realms, you know, and has gone completely insane, and you have to go down there and find out what he's seen. I still think it would have been very cool. It's just the pacing for me." 
</p>
<p>
"It's a game in its own right," suggested Vincke, journalistically.
</p>
<p>
"Probably, yeah," Adam continued. "But once you've got to the that key point in Act 2, we could have had a much more dense game after that, but I think that we would have exhausted people. And you know, there's a point where it becomes like, well, is this content for the sake of content? I hate the word 'content', but you know - is it actually adding to the story and the journey I'm on, where I am in my adventure? You can have too many climaxes. They're exhausting as well. I'm not talking about sex again." 
</p>
<p>
Larian have now washed their hands of D&amp;D. They're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-dont-know-what-their-next-game-is-yet-but-it-wont-be-baldurs-gate-4-or-baldurs-gate-3-dlc">not making Baldur's Gate 4</a>, nor are they plotting any further major additions to Baldur's Gate 3. This seems a tragedy - it's hard to imagine anybody devising a better D&amp;D adaptation in the near-future, but it's equally hard to complain when you think about how much BG3 gives you, without (for my money, anyway) overstuffing the pudding. As Alice B <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-review">wrote in our review</a>, "in BG3, there's no baggy excess, but there's also nothing wasted, whether that be space for a joke in a description of some boots, or the chance to give one entirely optional boss his own song about kicking your ass on the soundtrack - which many players won't even hear!" 
</p>
<p>
Still, if Larian <em>do</em> return to D&amp;D at some stage, I can well imagine them cracking the lid on Candlekeep and perhaps, unearthing that maddened seer from the bottom of the labyrinth. "It's where the Baldur's Gate story began," Adam concluded. "So it's always going to be in your head, you know?"
</p>

<p data-characters="313" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Chapter 5 Season 3 of <em>Fortnite</em> will be starting later today, and Epic Games has already confirmed <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fortnite-is-teasing-a-fallout-crossover/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new crossovers with Bethesda’s <em>Fallout</em> series</a> and Marvel’s X-Men. However, another crossover skin has leaked ahead of a formal announcement, and it’s honestly the most exciting one: <em>Lethal Company</em>.</p> <p data-characters="647" data-current-count="647" data-injectable="true">While not officially confirmed, frequent and reliable <em>Fortnite</em> leakers <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1793902842681638976" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HYPEX</a> and <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1793903005546520666" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a> on Twitter shared a render of a skin based on the playable employee characters from <em>Lethal Company</em> earlier today. They also posted a short in-game clip of the skin in the <em>Fortnite</em> Locker, which shows that there’ll be <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1793916464262738162" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a <em>Lethal Company</em> inspired emote</a> as well; one based on the little dance you use to communicate with other players. It’s not yet clear if these cosmetics will be available at launch for the new season, or if they’ll be added a little further down the line. They’re certainly not part of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-fortnite-wrecked-season-3-battle-pass-cosmetics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the season’s battle pass</a>.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="480" data-current-count="780" data-injectable="true"><em>Lethal Company</em> was easily one of the biggest surprises of 2023. This indie co-op survival horror game almost came out of nowhere in October, but managed to dominate Steam, becoming <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/lethal-company-is-now-the-top-selling-game-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the top-selling game on the platform</a> the following month and eventually accruing <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/co-op-horror-game-lethal-company-hits-over-100k-concurrent-players-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 100,000 concurrent players</a>. We even named it <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destructoids-award-for-best-indie-game-of-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the best indie game of 2023</a>, beating out the likes of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-el-paso-elsewhere/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">El Paso, Elsewhere</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-world-of-horror/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World of Horror</a></em>, and it’s not even a complete game; it’s still in early access.</p>
 <p data-characters="660" data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true">So, it’s not as if it needs the validation; its success speaks for itself. But given <em>Fortnite</em> has primarily stuck to major IPs and famous celebrities for its crossovers, <em>Lethal Company</em> getting its own cosmetics in the battle royale feels like a big deal. Aside from <em>Among Us</em> (which similarly exploded in popularity and became a viral sensation), I can’t think of any other one-off indie games to make a <em>Fortnite</em> appearance. Admittedly, though, <em>Lethal Company</em> probably would’ve been overlooked if it wasn’t massively popular to begin with, so this shouldn’t be taken as a sign that Epic Games will put any indie game into <em>Fortnite</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="753" data-current-count="753" data-injectable="false">However, this is the first time in a long while that one of these crossovers has been a genuine surprise. <em>Fortnite</em>‘s had so many of them that, at this point, every other crossover has felt predictable. Of course there’d be <em>Fallout</em> skins, especially after the success of the TV show. Of course there’d be a Magneto skin in the wake of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/x-men-97s-astonishing-ending-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>X-Men ’97</em>‘s season finale</a>. Even that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/leaker-claims-fortnite-could-get-major-kingdom-hearts-crossover/">rumoured <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> crossover</a> wouldn’t be that surprising. Could any of us have predicted a <em>Lethal Company</em> skin though? It almost makes me wonder if any other breakout indie successes might be considered for <em>Fortnite</em> collaborations. <em>Hollow Knight</em>? <em>Hades</em>? <em>Vampire Survivors</em>? Honestly, when it comes to <em>Fortnite</em>, it feels nothing is off-limits.</p>

			<p>Avalanche Studio's founder Christofer Sundberg has taken to X to express his discontent about recent quotes from Mad Max director George Miller.</p>
<p>Yesterday, PC Gamer published an article about Miller and the director wanting Hideo Kojima to make a proper Mad Max game. In addition, the director revealed that he wasn't that happy with 2015's Mad Max game from developer Avalanche. "We've been asked many many times to do one", Miller said. "It wasn't as good as I wanted it to be, it wasn't in our hands, we gave all our material to a company to do it… but I'm one of those people that I'd rather not do something unless you can do it at the highest level, or at least try to make it at the highest level."</p>
<p>After the publication of this article, Sundberg was quick to respond on X, saying that Miller's words show "complete arrogance". "This is complete nonsense and just shows complete arrogance", the Avalanche founder wrote on X. "They did everything they could to make this a complete linear game after having signed up with a developer of open-world games. I'm sure Hideo Kojima would make an awesome Mad Max game, but it would be a completely different experience."</p>
<p>He <a href="https://x.com/CHSundberg/status/1793612777648689221" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continued</a>, "After the first year of development they realized that they had forced us to make a linear experience rather than the open world game we pitched. We threw away a year of work and got to hear that "players wants autonomy in this day and age". Well, no shit..."</p>
<p>Sundberg is referring to publisher Warner Bros., which, apparently, insisted that Mad Max was released alongside Kojima's Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. In addition, Sundberg revealed that the team had "awesome DLC" sitting to be released, but following bad sales of the game, these DLCs were canceled.</p>
<p>He said, "As we were forced to release Mad Max on the same day as MGS, they blamed us for the bad sales and cancelled a bunch of awesome DLC that was just sitting there waiting to be released."</p>
<p>In all honesty, the 2015 Mad Max game is a highly underrated title that deserves praise. For those interested, it can be picked up pretty cheap on PC and consoles right now. Here's what we wrote about the 2015 title in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mad-max-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch review</a> back then:</p>
<p><em>It’s still a game I really, truly enjoy. The open world may not be the most interesting, the characters may not be all that memorable, and the quests might not exactly be inspired, but this is a very competent game made by an obviously talented team of developers (Avalanche Studios; you know them for Just Cause) and they honestly blew my expectations for a Mad Max game out of the water. My gripes ultimately feel minor, because the game as a whole is very satisfying and fun to play, save for a few of those more menial challenges.</em></p>

        <p>The Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill would also enable sideloading third-party apps on mobile platforms</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Bill has been passed by UK Parliament, which could force platform holders such as Apple and Google to allow the Epic Games Store on its devices.</p>
<p>The DMCC Bill was put through on Thursday following the announcement of a general election set for July 4.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/uk-passes-bill-which-could-force-apple-to-allow-fortnite-and-an-epic-games-store-app-on-ios/">VGC</a>, parts of the DMCC Bill contain sections established in the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/apple-google-under-pressure-as-eu-approves-digital-markets-act">EU's Digital Markets Act</a> passed in November 2022, which would force platform holders to allow users to sideload third-party apps and software onto devices. This also opens up the possibility of alternative marketplaces on these platforms.</p>
<p>Back in January, Apple announced changes that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/apple-to-allow-alternative-app-stores-in-europe">would allow alternative app stores and payments on iOS</a> in compliance with the DMA.</p>
<p>By March, Apple, Google and Meta were already<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/eu-commission-investigates-google-meta-and-apple-for-possible-digital-markets-act-violations"> under investigation by the EU for potential violations of the DMA</a>.</p>
<p>Epic Games is in the process of developing a mobile version of its storefront for Apple's App Store, as reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-secures-ios-developer-account-europe-mobile-store-and-fortnite-launch-this-year?utm_source=feed&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=feed">Eurogamer</a>, which will launch on iOS sometime this year and will be operated by Epic Games Sweden.</p>

<p data-characters="219" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">A new <em>Fortnite</em> season means brand-new cosmetics, with the Season 3: Wrecked Battle Pass bringing 14 pages of skins, pickaxes, back bling, emotes, and more. Take a look at everything you can unlock in <em>Fortnite</em> Season 3. </p> <p data-characters="216" data-current-count="216" data-injectable="false">As always, Epic Games has been hard at work putting together the Battle Pass, which this season sees Fortnite turn into a Mad Max-esque wasteland, with crazy vehicles that can be modified into true killing machines. </p> <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="495" data-injectable="true">Many of these season’s skins definitely wouldn’t look out of place on Fury Road, and of course, there’s the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fortnites-new-fallout-content-is-more-salt-in-the-wound-for-fallout-76-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">T-60 Power Armor from <em>Fallout</em></a><em> </em>in there too to help you survive on the new island. You can look at the full Battle Pass, with every Tier included, below. </p>

Just play matches and grind Quests to earn XP, and you’ll be able to get your hands on it. </p> <p data-characters="199" data-current-count="491" data-injectable="false">It’s also cool to see classic <em>Fortnite</em> skins get a Wastelands-themed update for this season, with Rust and Brite Bomber both getting gritty new looks to match the desolation of the new island. </p>
