            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/schedule-1-game-early-access-steam<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Politically, I am very much in favor of decriminalizing weed, but on a personal level, I absolutely can’t stand it. I feel bad about this–who hates weed?!--but after years of trying not to feel like the world’s biggest dork, I’ve learned to just quietly slip away when people are using it. Given this, recent early access drug-dealing game <em>Schedule 1</em> should in no way be my thing, but somehow I’ve been playing the hell out of it.&nbsp;</p><p>I hadn’t heard of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164500/Schedule_I/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Schedule 1</em></a> until Aftermath pal Javy Gwaltney <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jgwalt.bsky.social/post/3llkbykvm3c2r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned it on Bluesky</a> over the weekend, but it rocketed to Steam’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/topselling/US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">top seller</a> slot as of this writing and has reportedly been <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/simoncarless_valve-has-just-given-solo-indie-megahit-schedule-activity-7310837300601442305-AvHb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wildly successful</a> for its solo developer. It’s a simple-looking, cartoonish game where you play as a small-time drug dealer who flees your desert town for a modestly-sized city, where you have to rebuild your supply chain and customer base from scratch, steadily crafting a bigger and bigger empire while evading cops and rival dealers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Schedule I Release Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dUxiQ1qN0rg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Lest this sound like <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> or similar flashy, high-octane games, <em>Schedule 1</em> is scratching my <a href="https://aftermath.site/long-dark-survival" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survival game</a> itch far more than any desire for shootouts and action. A day in my game is full of wonderfully tedious chores: skateboard over to the hardware store to buy some more soil and baggies, head across town to pick up some different weed seeds from a dead drop, trek all the way back to my shitty apartment above a Chinese restaurant with my haul. Growing weed requires pouring soil, planting seeds, and watering them, all with the need to slice the tops off bags and pop the lids off containers and make sure to throw all that stuff away in the trash when you’re done. Weed needs to be harvested and then packaged by hand, in a wonderfully physical assembly line of placing nuggets in bags and sealing them up. The game is on a day/night cycle that often feels way too short for all the things you need to get done, though time stops at 4am until you go to sleep, in effect pausing the clock to let you catch up on things.&nbsp;</p><p>At first, you deliver your goods by yourself: accepting orders on your phone, arranging a meeting time, and even haggling on price, amount, or strain. Buyers have connections to others; by strengthening your relationships with customers and handing out free samples to new ones, you slowly build a customer base that can connect you to new suppliers. It can also connect you to dealers, who can sell drugs for you–once you manually deliver the product, decide which specific customers they can sell to, and then remember to come back to top them up and collect your money. Later, you can hire workers to do some of your chores and buy machines that can automate the process, all of which will require more space and money as you work your way toward building a grand operation.</p><p>In the early hours I’ve played solo, <em>Schedule 1</em> is a decidedly <em>unsexy</em> game. (It also has co-op, though I haven’t checked that out yet.) Games like this often want to be about becoming untouchably powerful, but my most memorable experiences so far have been times I’ve had to escape the cops like any small-time hood. While the trailer suggests car chases and shootouts, I’ve mostly faced challenges by fleeing. Cops patrol the streets and institute a nightly curfew, which I get around by sneaking through alleys and clambering through ditches. In the game’s intro area, the cops wanted to frisk me; thinking fast, I ran behind a dumpster and smoked all my weed so they wouldn’t find it, only to learn you can hide it on your person in a clever little mini-game. In another instance, the cops busted me when I brilliantly made a drug deal right in front of them; I fled into a taco shop and hid under a booth until they stopped looking. There are cars and guns to buy, but I kind of like the idea of seeing how small I can keep things.</p><p>This desire extends to the kinds of drugs the game lets you make, too. So far, I’ve mixed weed with mouthwash and painkillers to make new strains; on the horizon is the ability to make harder drugs like meth and cocaine, but I feel uncomfortable with that idea. I’m curious to see if the game will let me avoid it; I might not <em>like</em> weed, but at least it generally isn’t hurting anyone. I like the idea of playing the game like a regular person, just trying to get by and survive the (<a href="https://aftermath.site/starting-a-website-has-taught-me-too-much-about-myself" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relatable</a>) challenges of scaling a business, rather than some kingpin introducing dangerous drugs into my new community.</p><p><em>Schedule 1</em> is obviously a game about drugs, but I appreciate how low-key it is about them so far. Characters have bloodshot stoner eyes, but I haven’t encountered any over-the-top drugs jokes or other stuff I’d find too off-putting. I feel like I could be <a href="https://aftermath.site/wanderstop-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">running almost any kind of business</a> and a lot of the game would play the same, minus all the running from the cops. I’m surprised to find myself liking it so much, and I think that’s down to all its mundane moving parts and unexpectedly soothing chores. (I love the idea of being a drug dealer who spends a chunk of his day picking up street litter; you can exchange your trash for money, which is a great way to help finance your operations.) The early access <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/schedule-1-updates-roadmap-with-map-expansion-fishing-cartel-interactions-3170476/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap</a> sounds full of cool stuff to look forward to, including more side activities that will hopefully keep me from losing all my money in the game’s casino in my rare downtime.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-severance-season-two-review"><h3>Severance Season Two Stuck The Landing</h3></a><p>With big tech trying to automate everything, Severance just keeps feeling more and more relevant</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/best-split-keyboards-diy-qmk-zmk-corne"><h3>Split Keyboards Are Superior And The Reason I’m The Writer I Am Today</h3></a><p>Split keyboards are the best, but no company offered one that satisfied me completely.

		<p>Frogwares has announced that it is releasing The Sinking City Remastered, with owners of the original release for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S getting this as a free upgrade. The Sinking City Remastered sees the original game being ported to Unreal Engine 5, joining The Sinking City 2 on that platform. While a trailer or gameplay footage is not yet available, Frogwares has released screenshots of The Sinking City Remastered.</p>

		
		

<p>In other The Sinking City 2 news, Frogwares has opened up submissions for people to have their voices in the game, becoming part of a choir that praises the Eldritch god Yog-Sothoth. To enter, people just need to submit a voice recording saying the word “Yes”, in whatever style they wish. A form will need to be filled out along with an upload of the submission, and that can all be done <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://tally.so/r/wQOPMY&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1743346118601063&amp;usg=AOvVaw13x8tRr9K5rXe2MkOnnojn">at this link</a>. Frogwares will then choose 100 submissions at random to be in the game, and of of those 100 will get The Sinking City 2 Collector’s Edition.</p>


<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/06/27/the-sinking-city-review/">The Sinking City Review</a></h2>
<p>In our The Sinking City review, Steve said,<em> “The Sinking City promises a nightmarish journey through a Lovecraftian townscape filled with monsters and threatening cults, but too often falls into a loop of forced combat and resource hunting. The investigative parts are excellent, and this is probably the best Lovecrat adaptation since Call of Cthulu: Dark Corners of the Earth, but it still never really lives up to its potential. Close, but no Shoggoth.”</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/doom-the-dark-ages-preview-%E2%80%93-doom-unlike-any-other.1149795/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-preview/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Few people predicted the triumphant return of DOOM in 2016. Bethesda was unwilling to have games reviewed before launch. The overwhelming feeling was that the game wouldn't be as good as they had hoped from DOOM, with the prior multiplayer beta underwhelming players. Needless to say, DOOM was great, DOOM Eternal, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-eternal-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">which I reviewed</a>, was also great, and now we have DOOM: The Dark Ages.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Or, at least, we will have DOOM: The Dark Ages. I recently got hands-on experience with the first level of the game and the first portion of the second. Then, parts of two later levels, before an even later - open - level, for a chunk of time. Essentially, ID Software and Bethesda wanted me and others at the event in Frankfurt to have a feel for what the game will offer and its variety.</p>
<p>Now, I'm working on memory here, but something that I wasn't a massive fan of in DOOM Eternal, in retrospect, was that it had gone quite platform-heavy in some areas. Not enough that I expected an Italian plumber to show up, but maybe a Gecko dressed like a spy. Somebody at ID Software must have agreed because this has been toned back significantly, though the verticality isn't lost from what I have seen here.</p>
<p>No, the first level I could play feels like DOOM as we know it. The maps are large; you have several secrets to find if you choose to, and little bits of exploration may also net you extra health and armour. This is in between moving from one arena, where you kill hordes of enemies, to the corridors in between until you reach the next arena. So far, so DOOM. It's what you would expect, too, and my initial impression is that it brings the tight combat from DOOM Eternal to the tighter design of DOOM 2016.</p>

<p>That will be until you explore some of the newer things in DOOM: The Dark Ages. So, to put it quite simply, I could play parts of, not all, two different levels. You are essentially riding a DOOM Guy Gundam in the first of these two. The second, you get to fly a dragon with mecha wings and guns. Now, DOOMdam, as I will now call it, feels similar enough to other levels. It's just that you're now a big machine. You get to punch the hell out of Titans, sometimes shoot them, and there is a sense of scale due to the surrounding combat. I don't know how impactful it will feel over time, but it offered something different while still feeling like the DOOM we know.</p>
<p>The dragon, however, I'm not entirely as sold on. Now, when I get more time with it, I could be blown out of the water - it needs to be remembered that I played part of a level. The initial rush of zooming out of a cave system on the back of a dragon is pretty impressive. Particularly so, when you see the level of devastation happening, you will be there, fighting off giant hell-ships, and the sense of scale is awe-inspiring, even at first glance.</p>
<p>This isn't a case of more artificial corridors moving from ship to ship. You will fly around, and there are extra things to defeat and paths to find before you weaken a ship's defences enough to land on it and deal the finishing blow. Of course, the last part is done on foot, and you go around areas bigger than just the ship as it has crashed into the city below. All of that was good. I wasn't enthralled by the combat on the dragon itself, if only because, once locked on, the controls felt a little too rigid. It's an area I am looking forward to exploring more.</p>

<p>Understandably, ID Software knew DOOM: The Dark Ages would shine in a later area they had us play, giving us an hour to do what we wanted. This massive battlefield was far more open than what you generally get in a DOOM title. Some trappings remained, in that you have arenas to encounter and loads of secrets to find via some exploration, but it never felt constrained by the usual corridors you come to expect. While still somewhat driven, it offered a bit of an open feel, where you could maybe find yourself at odds in one area, decide to tackle somewhere else and rearm before coming back.</p>
<p>Combine this more open approach with the excellent fast-paced combat from DOOM Eternal, where you will be finishing off enemies to have extra life and ammo fall out of their bodies, combos and well-timed attacks being rewarded with more to keep you going, and you have a recipe for greatness. It's even better to use new weapons, like the shield saw, in an enjoyable combination of attacks that makes you feel like the DOOM Slayer in overdrive.</p>
<p>I am also intrigued by the narrative of DOOM: The Dark Ages. This is an entirely single-player-focused title, and I am all on board with that. I have zero interest in multiplayer; anybody who knows me knows that my time on this planet has been one of ensuring humans keep as far away from my fun as possible. This focus on single-player also means that resources haven't been diverted, and there's no need to start balancing guns, melee weapons, or any other nonsense about how they work around other people. No, this is about the DOOM Slayer, his time before DOOM, and the medieval-ish world he came from.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages will be released on May 13th, 2025, if you buy the premium edition, or on May 15th if you don't. Needless to say, after the resounding success of both DOOM 2016 and DOOM Eternal, and what was a very fun time I had with the game in Frankfurt, I'm looking forward to DOOM: The Dark Ages.</p>

It’s an incredible game for one. It was also the last entry on PS1, and the last before the series moved to a full 3D look and voice acting on the PS2. Most importantly, it was the last produced by creator Hironobu Sakaguchi before he left Square, and harkens back to the franchise’s more traditional, medieval roots. Also it features an adorable black mage named Vivi. </p><p>In the past, <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> producer Naoki Yoshida has been coy about the rumors. “Of course, I do know there are requests for<em> Final Fantasy IX</em> to be made, but when you think about <em>Final Fantasy IX</em>, it’s a game with huge volume,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/yoshi-p-thinks-a-final-fantasy-9-remake-would-take-more-than-one-game&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yoshi-p-thinks-a-final-fantasy-9-remake-would-take-more-than-one-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he said last fall</a></span>, appearing to pour cold water on the rumors. “When you think about all of that volume, I wonder if it’s possible to remake that as a single title.

<p>A report by <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a><a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/une-mysterieuse-edition-physique-dun-jeu-de-naughty-dog-est-en-cours-de-preparation-60078" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> on Dealabs</a> states that Naughty Dog is working on “a new special edition of a game in The Last of Us franchise”; however, which game it will be about is unknown. The report also tells us the price, which will be set at EUR 119.99 and USD 109.99, and this mystery edition will be available for purchase in Europe and North America.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It seems that the mystery special edition of The Last of Us franchise will receive a physical release on the PS5. Moreover, the announcement could arrive very soon, as pre-orders are expected to begin within the next two months. Many players are placing their bets on a bundle that includes the remastered versions of The Last of Us Part 1 and The Last of Us Part 2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Last of Us HBO series will receive a second season on April 13, 2025. The new season will have seven episodes, with one dropping each week. The rumoured pre-order announcement date for this mystery special edition coincides with the end date for season 2 of the HBO series, which could mean something. However, players should take this information with a grain of salt.</p>

              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>The slogan “Stand and Fight” has been plastered all over Doom: The Dark Ages marketing: a catchphrase that feels at odds with the modern Doom series. Doom 2016 was applauded for its fast gameplay and Doom: Eternal took that one step further with the Meat Hook that let you whip around the battlefield at breakneck speeds. The movement--for many--is what makes Doom, Doom. So to see Doom: The Dark Ages’ encourage players to hold their ground and fight seemed antithetical to that finely tuned formula. At least, that’s what I thought. After three hours of hands-on time with id Software’s next shooter, it seems like Doom: The Dark Ages has found a hypnotic balance between its iconic fast-paced gameplay and the blow-for-blow combat that Dark Ages is bringing to the mix.</p><p dir="ltr">Doom: The Dark Ages is a prequel to Doom 2016. The forces of hell are invading a realm heavily inspired by the medieval era, and the Doom Slayer is summoned to do what he does best: Rip and tear through demons. Although this may sound like standard fare for a Doom game, The Dark Ages appears to be taking its story a bit more seriously. It’s still a campy, somewhat self-aware, bloodsoaked romp through demon guts, but the team wanted to use the fantasy setting to its full potential. According to game director Hugo Martin, “When you think of fantasy, and Lord of the Rings, you think huge… There’s a grandness, an epicness to fantasy that people expect.” Despite the shift to fantasy, some of Doom: The Dark Ages’ biggest narrative inspirations for its story were action films like Roadhouse, Die Hard, and First Blood, when it comes to keeping the story engaging throughout its runtime.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467012-screenshots_round_2_5logo.png" data-ref-id="1300-4467012" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467012-screenshots_round_2_5logo.png" data-ref-id="1300-4467012"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467012-screenshots_round_2_5logo.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">While I loved Doom 2016’s minimal approach to storytelling, I’m curious to see what id Software does with Dark Age’s setting. The arenas, enemies, characters, and weapons have all received a medieval makeover that fits the setting and series perfectly. Gothic castles loom over battlefields, enemies use a mix of medieval weaponry and sci-fi firearms, characters are donned in plated armor, and macabre weapons like the Pulverizer grind up skulls and fire out deadly bone shards. It’s a match made in heaven, or rather, hell. That said, Doom: Eternal’s greater emphasis on story felt superfluous. There were some clever callbacks to previous games and fun moments, but when it comes to Doom, all I want to do is shoot, shred, and eviscerate demons. Thankfully, The Dark Ages has plenty of that.</p><p dir="ltr">As with previous Doom games, the weapons are the star of the show. There are some returning firearms like the iconic Super Shotgun, but The Dark Ages brings a slew of new guns that fit neatly into the gothic setting. The aforementioned Pulverizer fires out a horizontal spread of skull bits that can shred multiple demons at close range, the Impaler fires out rune-adorned rail spikes that deal high damage at long range, and--my personal favorite--the Chainshot launches a retracting cannonball that pulverizes demons at close range. Of course, each weapon comes with a handful of upgrades and modifications that can alter their characteristics. Doom’s weapons have always been larger than life, but The Dark Ages setting has allowed id Software to really push the boundaries of what a weapon in Doom can be. “[They’re] brutal. […] The Rail Spike, the Skull Crusher. They’re all supposed to be like little torture devices you’re holding,” Martin told me.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467013-screenshots_round_2_4logo.png" data-ref-id="1300-4467013" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467013-screenshots_round_2_4logo.png" data-ref-id="1300-4467013"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467013-screenshots_round_2_4logo.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Doom: The Dark Ages biggest shake-up to the gameplay is the Shield Saw. During combat, you can block and parry attacks with it, bash enemies, and throw it around the battlefield. It’s most useful purpose--at least for my playstyle--was the dash. By holding your up shield, you can lock onto an enemy and rush them down in one swift motion. While it doesn’t offer the same verticality as the Meat Hook, it’s far more controlled. Your inertia and momentum aren’t working against you when you rush down an enemy. Instead, you speed across the battlefield and deliver a satisfying shield bash to whatever poor demon the Doom Slayer sets his sights on.</p><p dir="ltr">While I didn’t use the Shield Saw’s block all that much, the parry is paramount. When an enemy or projectile glows green, a well-timed block will stun the demon or send the projectile right back. It’s a fairly straightforward mechanic that fits in surprisingly well with Doom’s gameplay loop. You can’t parry every move so you’re still spending most of your time running and gunning, but when I did see that green glow, I found myself subconsciously repositioning in hopes of exploiting it. It may seem like a simple addition, but the parry does what any good parry system does: It adds more risks for more rewards. I would regularly put myself in harm's way to rush down enemies and projectiles as they started to glow green just to hit the parry.</p><p dir="ltr">The Shield Saw feels like a natural extension to the Doom Slayer’s kit, but it isn’t just for bludgeoning unfortunate demons. A lot of Doom: The Dark Ages’ puzzles and platforming segments are built around the Shield Saw. Like Kratos’s axe in God of War (2018), the shield can be used to activate switches, knock down weak walls, and launch the Doom Slayer up to hard to reach areas. While the puzzles in the Doom games rarely offer more than a brief change of pace, the Shield Saw brings just enough to the table to keep the moments interesting.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467014-screenshots_round_2_3logo.png" data-ref-id="1300-4467014" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467014-screenshots_round_2_3logo.png" data-ref-id="1300-4467014"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467014-screenshots_round_2_3logo.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Shield Saw goes hand-in-hand with Doom: The Dark Ages’ new melee weapons. The chainsaw from Doom 2016 and Eternal has been replaced by a handful of blunt weapons and new mechanics. These weapons require a “charge” in order to use them, and--at least in the beginning--can hold up to three charges. You can find pickups on the battlefield or you can parry an attack to charge your weapon. Unlike the chainsaw, the further along in the preview I got, the rarer these pickups were. As a result, I mostly relied on parries to refill my melee charges. This loop fits seamlessly into the “stand and fight” mantra because when you’re facing down a Tyrant, the most efficient way to kill it is to get in its face, parry its attacks, and follow up with a powerful melee attack. Of course, you can still melee enemies without a charge, but it’s fairly ineffective against anything other than the imps and fodder demons.</p><p dir="ltr">Doom: The Dark Ages brings a lot of fresh ideas to its combat loop, and in order to let players experiment with all these new weapons, mechanics, and strategies, id Software has created some of its largest arenas to date. The final level I played in my preview, titled Siege, took place on a wide-open battlefield that consisted of multiple objectives that could be completed in any order. This approach to level design is nothing unique, but it’s a first for the modern Doom games. While I still think I prefer the more linear level design when it comes to Doom, this section was a nice change of pace and gave me ample opportunities to test out some of the new mechanics with some unique encounters. One of these optional scenarios had me eliminate a VIP demon. However, in order to damage the special demon, I needed to lower its morale by killing dozens of other demons. I died a handful times, but with each new attempt I was able to try out different approaches in a more free-form and open-ended way than we saw in Doom 2016 or Eternal.</p><p dir="ltr">These large, open-ended battlefields complement the “epicness” Martin mentioned, but another component of The Dark Ages’ grand scale are the Dragon and Atlan mech missions. While neither of the segments I played had the mechanical depth of Doom’s grounded combat, they did offer a different perspective on The Dark Ages' world. I soared over a sprawling city as an aerial assault took place, occasionally dismounting my dragon to decommission Hell Carrier dropships from the inside. In the Atlan mech, I was going toe-to-toe with some of Doom’s most formidable demons that are typically saved for boss fights.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467015-screenshots_round_2_2logo.png" data-ref-id="1300-4467015" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467015-screenshots_round_2_2logo.png" data-ref-id="1300-4467015"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4467015-screenshots_round_2_2logo.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The aerial and mech combat are built around well-timed dodges. Like on foot, enemy attacks that glow green are your tell. Dodging a green attack slows down time and lets you strike back with a deadly attack of your own. The Atlan feels great to pilot. Each step satisfyingly crushes fodder demons and levels buildings. Meanwhile, its weighty punches and hooks can shatter demon bones and pop their skulls into a mess of blood and gore. Unfortunately, as of now, aerial combat seems to be the weakest link. Speeding through tunnels and over cities feels great, but the second you lock onto an enemy, all that speed comes to an abrupt halt as you awkwardly maneuver around the space directly in front of the locked-on enemy holding down the attack button. Martin made it clear that the team was still fine-tuning the aerial combat and will continue to up until launch. Hopefully a little extra polish is all the dragon combat needs.</p><p dir="ltr">According to executive producer and game director Marty Stratton, “With each game we’ve done more. We get better at what we’re doing. The stories we’re telling have gotten bigger, and [Doom: The Dark Ages] feels like the realization of the last 10 years and the last two games.” After wrapping up my demo, it feels like The Dark Ages might be the most comprehensive Doom game to date. Id Software is bringing a lot of new mechanics and ideas to the series, while maintaining its hypnotic flow state. It’s hard to say if they’ll be able to keep that momentum as new ideas and mechanics are introduced, but it’s made an excellent first impression. Doom: The Dark Ages comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox, and PC on May 13, 2025.</p>

                <p>Actor Jason Momoa stars in the upcoming A Minecraft Movie, which is based on the hugely popular video game. But Momoa himself doesn't allow his son to play video games, or even have a phone.</p><p>"We don't have a TV. My son doesn't have phone. He's 16 and doesn't have a phone," when asked if his children play video games. "We're different, dude. Because when he's 18 he's gonna have a phone and it'll be out of the house and he can explore the world after that."</p><p>Why no phones or video games? "Because I just want them to use their creativity in a different way. So, we do other things. These [phones] are new to the world. Everyone was doing just fine [before phones]. We watch movies together, and that's beautiful."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/DEADLINE/status/1906509819684512095" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">‘A Minecraft Movie’ star Jason Momoa on why he doesn’t let his kids play video games or have phones: “We’re different dude.

He said, "My mother, when I was growing up, wouldn't let me play video games. She was like, 'Get outside, climb a tree, go skateboard.' I wasn't allowed to have video games."</p><p>Momoa's A Minecraft Movie co-star, Jack Black, is quite a different case.

But Boyter told Momoa that his lack of experience with the game is exactly why he wanted Momoa to be in the movie. "Because you're not supposed to know shit about it," Momoa said he recalled Boyter telling him.</p><p>A Minecraft Movie releases in theaters on April 4. It's directed by Napoleon Dynamite's Jared Hess and is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-a-minecraft-movie-could-compare-to-other-video-game-films-at-the-box-office/1100-6530115/" data-ref-id="1100-6530115">expected to make around $60 million in the US for its opening weekend. </a></p>

            <p>If you cast your minds back to last year, you may recall <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2024s-best-april-fools-day-jokes-includes-sonic-cyberpunk-elden-ring">Pocketpair releasing a trailer for a dating sim spin-off called "Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~"</a>. This was all part of some good ol' fashioned April Fools Day fun… or was it?</p>
<p>Earlier today, the developer released another trailer for Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~, and I have to say, it seems to be the real deal, complete with a sales page and all.</p>
<figure>

<p>"You, the protagonist, enrol as a transfer student in the prestigious Palagos Private Academy," reads the official blurb on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3620480/Palworld_More_Than_Just_Pals/">game's Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>"You will meet unique friends (pals) and enjoy school life through friendship and romance. It's up to you whether you stay friends with the pals, develop romantic relationships with them, or even dismember and eat them."</p>
<p>I reached out to Pocketpair community manager John "Bucky" Buckley, and he assured me that if I covered today's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> trailer I would not get egg on my face. So, here I am covering it.</p>
<p>Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~ doesn't have a release date as yet, although Bucky told me it won't be tomorrow.</p>
<p>So, will you be snuggling up to Pal♡world! ~More Than Just Pals~ on its release?</p>

</p><p>Elsewhere in the news, Bucky previously revealed the Palworld team would have happily seen its monster-catching survival game on the OG Switch, but due to how "beefy" Palworld is, it wasn't able to find a home on Nintendo's console.</p>
<p>This may change for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a>, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-being-sued-by-nintendo-says-switch-2-port-still-possible">providing the next generation of Nintendo's consoles has the ability to handle the chonky game</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A previously announced RoboCop VR title has been kiboshed after it transpired that the game wasn't officially licensed before its reveal.</p>
<p>RoboCop: Streets of Anarchy, as it was known, was a VR game based on the sci-fi film which <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/robocop-streets-of-anarchy-vr-quest-3-pc/">first made the rounds earlier this month</a>, when it appeared on developer Coffee Moth Games' website.</p>
<p>At this time, the game was said to be being created in partnership with Amazon-MGM and would promise an "original narrative and complex storylines interwoven with bombastic action".</p>

<p>However, fast forward a couple of weeks, and those promises are going to have to be left unfulfilled, as it turns out RoboCop: Streets of Anarchy wasn't actually officially licensed before its reveal.</p>
<p>An Amazon MGM representative told <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/robocop-streets-of-anarchy-not-officially-licenced/">UploadVR</a> the company never actually entered into any agreement with Coffee Moth Games. "Furthermore, Amazon MGM advised that RoboCop isn't officially licensed with that studio, and the official website page for Streets of Anarchy has since been removed," UploadVR continued.</p>
<p>The publication had previously been in contact with Coffee Moth Games, and a representative from the studio revealed they're actually an outsourcing company with no direct relationship to Amazon MGM. However, "the company responsible for contracting the rights from Amazon MGM contacted us for the game's development," the representative said.</p> <div>

As <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sinking-city-2">The Sinking City 2</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sinking-city-2-gets-first-gameplay-trailer-smashes-crowdfunding-goal-in-less-than-a-day">hugely successful crowdfunding campaign</a> nears its conclusion, Ukrainian developer Frogwares has announced a fresh bit of business for its Lovecraft-inspired open-world detective series: the original game is being remastered in Unreal Engine 5.
</p>
<p>
Frogwares' first <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sinking-city">The Sinking City</a> instalment released in 2019, telling the story of private investigator Charles Reed as he travelled to the flooded city of Oakmont, Massachusetts, in search of a way to quell his hellish visions. As you might expect, cosmic horrors ensued.
</p>
<p>
Six years on and Frogwares' newly announced The Sinking City remaster will take the Unreal Engine 4 original and shift it to Unreal Engine 5, promising an "upgraded visual experience alongside some requested quality-of-life features". It will, for instance, be fully relit in the new engine, with locations gaining "additional levels of detail and objects". There's also a new Photo Mode, 4K textures, improved reflections, and support for DLSS, FSR and TSR upscaling.

Additionally, all owners of the original can upgrade to the new version for free. Comparions shots between the 2019 original and upcoming remaster can be found below.

And that's not all; fans are being invited to lend their vocal talents to the remaster by <a href="https://tally.so/r/wQOPMY">submitting a voice recording saying "yes"</a> in whatever manner they choose. 100 randomly selected entries will be transformed into a chanting choir - one with a particular fondness for Yog-Sothoth - and will see their names featured in the credits.

<p>
As for The Sinking City 2, it's <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2?ref=checkout_rewards_page">crowdfunding campaign</a> is set to draw to a close this Friday, 4th April. At the time of writing, it's sailed past its original £83K pledge target, raising over £347K. Frogwares has said the survival horror sequel will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sinking-city-2-will-pivot-to-a-horror-focus">shift away from the investigation focus of its predecessor</a>, with combat and exploration said to be the core mechanics this time around.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-dating-sim-might-be-an-april-fools-joke.1149750/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-dating-sim-announced-again<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair has seemingly announced a dating sim spinoff by the name of&nbsp;<em>More than Just Pals</em>, but there's reason to believe it might not be a serious prospect.</p>

<p>The game was revealed via <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1906687045130653704" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on X earlier today, in which Pocketpair calls the game "a <i>Palworld&nbsp;</i>school romance VN (visual novel)" and invites players to wishlist it via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3620480/Palworld_More_Than_Just_Pals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">brand new Steam page</a>.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time&nbsp;<em>More than Just Pals&nbsp;</em>has appeared, though. The first announcement for the game came <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/april-fools-day-2024-gaming-roundup" rel="nofollow">on April Fools' Day last year</a>, at which point Pocketpair said it would launch on the same day the following year (i.e. tomorrow).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-dating-sim-lovander.jpg?itok=a_-BkLAL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-dating-sim-lovander.jpg?itok=pVaYh1Zt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I don't think I want to do that, Lovander.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, the fact that the game was already announced as part of Pocketpair's April Fools' japery last year doesn't necessarily mean it isn't real this time around, but I think it's fair to take the project with a very large pinch of salt, at any rate.</p>

<p>Then again, back then, I wrote that Pocketpair had willed the project into genuine existence by virtue of creating it as a joke, and that may well be what's happened. If it is, well, we might be beyond help this time around.</p>

<p>Assuming&nbsp;<em>Palworld: More than Just Pals&nbsp;</em>is real, you'll be attending the Palagos Private Academy, where you'll meet a number of romanceable Pals. You can "stay friends with the Pals, develop romantic relationships with them, or even dismember and eat them".</p>

<p>It rather looks like&nbsp;<em>More than Just Pals&nbsp;</em>is taking a more&nbsp;<em>Hatoful Boyfriend</em>-style approach to dating sims rather than the conventional path; this feels rather like a parody effort to me.</p>




<p>Pocketpair also says it's giving away a Lovander body pillow to celebrate the new announcement of&nbsp;<em>Palworld: More than Just Pals</em>. If you want to enter the competition (again, assuming it's real), <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1906688298925633793" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">you can do so on X</a>.</p>

<p>Call of duty has released a brand-new trailer for Warzone, showing off the return of the original map ‘Verdansk’.</p>



<p>The near three-minute trailer shows off the return of the original map, weapons, vehicles and more in spectacular Call of Duty fashion, with the re-confirmation that the map will return with 150 players.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? 🥹

No escape from the fight now — Drop into the map that started it all in Call of Duty: Warzone on April 3 </span><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VerdanskReturns" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#VerdanskReturns</a><span> 🪂 </span></p></article></div>



<p>According to sources, Verdansk comes at a crucial point for Call of Duty Warzone, with Activision hoping that the map will see a resurgence in players similar to how the original Fortnite map worked for Epic Games.</p>



<p>One source said that Verdansk could be “do or die” for the free-to-play Battle Royale, whereas another said it likely means Warzone support will dwindle down if its play numbers don’t increase.</p>



<p>Verdansk is set to return to Warzone not as “original” as some might have expected though. This time, the Battle Royale map will return with some movement adjustments, including keeping in omnimovement. The developers did outline that player movement speed has bee reduced though, to try and stay somewhat in line with how the game originally felt. </p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the return of Verdansk in Call of Duty Warzone? Let us know in the comments or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/888/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

Death provides no escape, as his jailors will keep reviving him until he serves every last second. But one way out does exist: win on Cable Galactica’s hottest game show, “The Last Ticket.”</p><p>Starting off with just melee attacks, brutalize waves of foes with kicks and punches, eventually earning ranged weapons like simple pistols up to assault rifles and futuristic firearms that can pack a punch from a distance. Roll to dodge attacks, or use carefully-timed blocks to deflect enemy attacks, just don’t run out of energy.</p><p>The Last Ticket’s grotesque host Volkov may be a monster, but he likes entertainment, so Morgan has access to cybernetic implants that increase the strength of his melee attacks, enable literally bone-crushing combos, and enable the usage of giant sledgehammers. What’s a cybernetic upgrade without the ability to unleash special powers like rocket-propelled dash punches and electric shockwaves?</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Reviving Morgan after each run will prove to be Volkov’s gravest mistake, as the currency earned each run can go toward permanent unlocks, giving Morgan more and more advantages as he seeks freedom, no matter what it may cost him along the way.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="KIBORG - Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yk-nwn4YLYA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

enhancement stuff that is coming in," Dumont said. "I can't just make a list. There's quite a bit of it. So the team is always working to improve the game, and hopefully, people will be able to see the difference when they're playing Shadows in the upcoming months."</p><p>Currently, Assassin's Creed Shadows offers the standard selection of easy, medium, and hard difficulty options, as well as several gameplay modifiers to further fine-tune the experience to be more forgiving or more punishing.</p><p>Interestingly, the game that Shadows is often compared to, Sucker Punch's Ghost of Tsushima, put a spin on an extreme difficulty mode not long after that game was released in 2020. Lethal Mode made Ghost of Tsushima feel more dangerous overall, as both players and enemies could deliver lethal damage with a single attack.</p><p>Alongside smaller parry windows and enemy aggression being dramatically increased, that made the open-world samurai game more interesting than simply turning enemies into sponges that could absorb an absurd amount of damage; perhaps Ubisoft could adopt a similar approach with Shadows if it chooses to introduce a new difficulty mode.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-recruits-2-million-players-to-the-brotherhood-in-its-first-weekend/1100-6530301/">Assassin's Creed Shadows has been off to a strong start so far</a>--although not quite <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-isnt-doing-as-well-as-valhalla-but-thats-okay/1100-6530333/">as strong as Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a> for a variety of reasons. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-makes-major-deal-that-will-focus-on-three-game-franchises/1100-6530434/">Ubisoft also announced a major change to its organization</a> last week, as it revealed that it had created a new "dedicated subsidiary" focused on Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six.

                <p>One of the biggest unanswered questions in all of gaming for 2025 is when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA VI</a> will be released. Take-Two and developer Rockstar Games have yet to announce a date, and that could be part of the plan.</p><p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick told Bloomberg TV's Wall St. Week that while some of its competitors may announce release dates or windows years into the future, that's not what Take-Two will usually do. When asked directly why Take-Two is being so secretive about GTA 6's release date, Zelnick said the publisher likes to hold back marketing materials until "relatively" close to launch.</p><p>"The anticipation for [GTA 6] may be the greatest anticipation I've ever seen for an entertainment property, and I've been around the block a few times. And I've been in every entertainment business there is," he said. "We want to maintain the anticipation and the excitement. We have competitors who will describe their release schedule for years in advance. We've found the better thing to do is to provide marketing materials relatively close to the release window in order to create that excitement, and balance the excitement with unmet expectation. We don't always get it right. But that's what we're trying to do."</p><p>In terms of marketing materials, so far, Rockstar Games has released just one trailer for GTA 6--and it arrived all the way back in December 2023. Rockstar Games has not released any additional trailers or screenshots, or discussed the game at all since then.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0M53-LKlECk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0M53-LKlECk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Zelnick also discussed why it's taken more than a decade for Rockstar Games to release GTA 6 following GTA 5's launch in 2013. Zelnick said whereas some of its competitors launch new entries in major franchises on a semi-regular basis, Take-Two's teams "set an intention" of letting certain franchises rest, in part to create hype. While it's true Rockstar has not released a numbered GTA sequel since 2013, the franchise has hardly rested, as Rockstar launched the game on new platforms and continued to expand the series with ongoing updates to GTA Online.</p><p>Take-Two's sports games are annualized, but for non-sports games, Zelnick said, "We think you need to create enormous anticipation." Also, Zelnick said it simply "takes a long time" to make a big game like GTA 6. "Rockstar Games seeks perfection in what they do. Perfection is a pretty high bar. It takes a long time," he said.</p><p>Also during the interview, Zelnick said part of the reason why Take-Two's franchises have been successful over the years, including the GTA series, is because Take-Two is able to recruit and retain top talent. Zelnick said he has no creative talent himself but has "some ability to figure out who's really talented" and then hire them. He said Take-Two's management teams largely let individual developers work on their projects with autonomy. "We're not bugging them any more than necessary," he said.</p><p>Zelnick went on to say that Take-Two's teams are granted "essentially unlimited financial resources to create perfection." What's more, Take-Two has a revenue-sharing plan, so when a game succeeds, some of the proceeds are passed on to developers in the form of bonuses. All of these factors contribute to helping Take-Two retain top talent, Zelnick said.</p><p>GTA 6 is officially set for release sometime in Fall 2025 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-exec-talks-approach-to-pc-releases-but-doesnt-confirm-anything/1100-6529346/" data-ref-id="1100-6529346">PC release potentially to follow later on</a>. Take-Two and Rockstar Games not assigning the game a release date is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-not-being-revealed-yet-could-be-disastrous-for-some-analyst-says/1100-6530312/" data-ref-id="1100-6530312">causing turmoil for developers who are seeking to schedule their own games to avoid it.</a></p><p>Another major Take-Two game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/" data-ref-id="1100-6529507">Borderlands 4</a> from developer Gearbox, is launching on September 23. Given the expectation that Take-Two would likely want to give that game some room to breathe, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-might-be-coming-into-focus/1100-6529480/" data-ref-id="1100-6529480">some are expecting GTA 6 to potentially follow in October or November.</a></p>

            <p>
If you handed me a deck of revolting Tarot cards and told me to heal a bunch of sickly, deranged medieval peasants, I would probably attempt to sew the cards together into bandages. Perhaps I would offer the nicer ones to children instead of lollipops, to distract them while I apply the leeches (lollipops <em>did</em> exist in the Middle Ages, I'm shocked to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lollipop#History">discover</a>, but mostly in noble circles). Bloodletter has grander ambitions. 
</p>
<p>
In this whispery, crazy-eyed deckbuilder, you'll play Tarot-style cards to purge foul spirits who are seeking to possess and kill your neighbours. "Evil entities have crept into the hearts of the common folk, who teeter upon the brink of madness and death," the developers explain. "Only thy bathhouse stands as a bastion against the creeping corruption." It sounds like a mixture of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic">Pathologic</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-book">Black Book</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pentiment">Pentiment</a>. Here be'est the trailer.

In Bloodletter you play a "barber-surgeon". As stipulated, you operate out of a bathhouse, making you a barber-surgeon...pool attendant? A barber-surgeon-masseuse? And that's before we get to "bloodletter", which very much sounds like it should be a distinct vocation. I write all this in almost total ignorance of how medieval society defined and distinguished caring roles. 
</p>
<p>
In any case, everything you do is handled via the medium of cards. There are over 80, with gloriously manky art, plus six especially powerful blessing and curse cards. You will use them to safeguard ten villagers "with their own talents, oddities, and eerie animations" from four "dreadful entities". One of the demons lives in a statue and invades people's dreams. I'm trying to work out which Tarot cards I'd prescribe for that. Perhaps the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nine_of_Swords">Nine of Swords</a> followed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_(tarot_card)">Strength</a>?
</p>
<p>
I think this could be either a miasmatic delight, or an exercise in gradual disappointment as you realise that there are more familiar card game mechanics and synergies lurking beneath the grotty woodcut illustrations. It'll be a while before we know for sure - the game launches in 2026. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3493400/BLOODLETTER/">Read more on Steam.</a> If you need to get your ghastly cardgame fix sooner, maybe try <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/roots-devours-demo-harbours-the-seeds-of-a-brilliant-horror-card-rpga">the demo for Roots Devour</a>.

Apparently some of these companies have traveled to Blizzard’s headquarters in Irvine, California, to make their pitches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">NCSoft, which is behind the Lineage and Guild Wars MMOs, is said to have pitched a StarCraft RPG of some kind (an MMORPG?). Nexon, maker of The First Descendant, has pitched a “unique” use of the StarCraft IP. Netmarble (Solo Leveling: Arise, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad) is hoping to make a StarCraft mobile game. And Krafton, the company behind battle royale PUBG and The Sims competitor inZOI, wants to make a StarCraft game “based on its own development capabilities.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, video game companies pitch other video game companies all the time when it comes to securing publishing rights and development contracts. And it may be the case that nothing mentioned here goes anywhere. But StarCraft fans will certainly take note of Blizzard’s reported interest in doing… something to expand the much-loved sci-fi universe, given how long it’s been since the last game in the franchise came out. Activision Blizzard declined to comment when contacted by IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth remembering that in September, it emerged that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reportedly-working-on-a-starcraft-shooter-with-ex-far-cry-chief-dan-hay-at-the-helm"><u>Blizzard was making a third attempt at developing a StarCraft shooter</u></a>, with former Far Cry executive producer Dan Hay, who joined Blizzard in 2022, leading the charge.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The news came from Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier while speaking to IGN’s Podcast Unlocked, below, about his recent book, Play Nice: The Rise, Fall, and Future of Blizzard Entertainment. Hay’s StarCraft shooter is mentioned in the book, and IGN’s Ryan McCaffrey asked Schreier if it’s likely to actually come out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“If it’s not canceled!” Schreier replied. “This is Blizzard after all. Their history with StarCraft shooters is not good.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yes, that is a project that as far as I know is in development, or at least as of the time that I wrote this book was in development.

It's been three months. Has the team been happy with the response?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jonathan Rogers:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. I was honestly not expecting that we would beat a PoE 1 launch in terms of concurrency, because obviously this was early access. It was paid instead of being free at this point. So the fact that we exceeded and went even much higher than the largest PoE 1 launch we've ever done was obviously incredible. The scary thing, of course though, isn't you've got that many players. There's lots of considerations you have to make about supporting them and we've obviously done this before, but it's still a lot of work obviously when you've got that many players and having to make sure that you're dealing with all the various problems that they have.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>And after sprinting to the finish line for a number of years to get to the early access state you guys are at, how has the team been holding up as you support what's essentially a live-service game where the sprint is not likely to end anytime soon? Have you guys been able to catch your breath at all?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jonathan Rogers:</strong> Yeah, a hundred percent. For a start, we had Christmas break. We gave everyone an extra week for that as well beyond what they would normally have. We made sure that everything was okay there. We also were really trying to make sure that there was no more overtime, making sure that everything goes back to 40 hours a week, that everything's sort of normal again. And so, that's really meant that we're kind of, I think, the studio is sort of back in a sustainable pace again, which is really good. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The thing that I would say that our company is good at doing is coming up with new content very efficiently and creating new things very well. So even though it's not the crazy crunch that we were having before, I still think we're able to create content really fast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I mean, PoE 2 has a lot of stuff going on in it and that's even including this [expansion] and it's been three months, and that's even including the fact we had Christmas in the middle. So honestly, the main thing is just getting back on that thing that we actually do well as a company, which is the live-support, like having a game being live. I think that's our specialty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so it's actually nice to be back in a position where we're doing that again rather than having this kind of endless project that continues on forever, which honestly makes me more uncomfortable, because people can get out of the practice of shipping, which I think sometimes can be a problem.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Path of Exile 2: Dawn of the Hunt Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It seems like Dawn of the Hunt is going to focus a lot on revising the end game experience. Can you share what the top takeaways were that your team received in terms of community feedback based on the initial release and how you guys are addressing them with this update?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jonathan Rogers:</strong> Yeah, so I guess the main things that we had were, for a start: you've got content. The content wasn't lasting. It wasn't lasting to the hundreds of hours the players wanted to be able to last. And the reason for that, really, is that we didn't have enough what we would call “overlapping axis of randomness." And what I mean by that is that you've got mechanics that need to be able to spawn in regular maps, they need to be able to interact together ideally.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So in this expansion we're adding over 40 encounters, if you will, in terms of strong boxes and different types of wisps and bosses running around — stuff like that. But the idea is to get more than 40 interesting combat situations out of that by allowing more of that content to be able to be introduced to each other. So you still see situations that are new even as you play hundreds and hundreds of hours.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So for example, you'll get a type of wisp, that certain type of boss, and then it's like, 'okay, well now this boss has got some ability.' It changes how the fight plays out. What if you had a corrupted essence at the same time, and what if you had this and what if you had that? All of these things overlap together to produce a combinatorial explosion of possible outcomes that make the game much more interesting. And on PoE 1, we definitely had that in its end game with all the stuff we've added, but PoE 2 didn't quite have enough of that stuff. Everything was somewhat compartmentalized for the most part. So it's like, well, once you've played it all one time, it's like, well, then now you've done that thing and it's not as interesting to play it the second time and over and over again. So basically we just need more of that type of stuff. And so that's where the focus has been.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But another thing as well has just been for the existing mechanics, there's been a lot of tweaks. And the thing we have to be careful of when we're doing that stuff is players will say, for example, they'll say, 'oh, you need to drop more maps because I'm not sustaining maps.' And then we're like, 'okay, well I'm not having any trouble sustaining maps. What's going on here?' And then you find out, well, okay, the reason why this is happening is because they're dying too much and much more than we expected. When you actually look at that stuff and then when they die, they obviously don't get the drops for the rest of the map. So we're like, okay, well how can we alleviate that problem? Maybe that's the issue. And then we started thinking about what should the death penalty be. And that's how we get into changing the rez mechanics of maps. And so it's things like that, where you hear one thing, you have to try and come up with a different solution to try and improve things a lot.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The players need to get good, that's what I'm hearing.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jonathan Rogers:</strong> Well, no, I mean, we are just making it so that if the players aren't good, they're not nearly as screwed as they were if they were. And this is the thing: it's actually, a lot of the time, it is an exercise in minimizing the differences between the best players and the worst players as far as making sure that they both have good experiences, and it's like you still need to make it so that there are big differences, but you don't want it to be that a player who's not good is just getting completely screwed in their ability to continue to keep playing the end game. And so that's why we have to, we've made special rules, we've changed the drop mechanics for maps very significantly as well. There's just lots of things like that that kind of go on that are not worth mentioning as far as content goes in a livestream, but certainly will matter a lot to the play experience for players who are actually playing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>One thing I run into a lot, because my beat at IGN is a lot of online games and live-service games, is not just the division between highly skilled and low skilled players, but players who have a ton of time and want to live in this game and players who are time-taxed. And often there's a FOMO gap of like, 'well, I could make my game have a ton of content, but then this group is going to be feeling like they're just going to miss out and maybe fall off of the game because now there's too much content for them to ever possibly keep up with.' How does the team think about that?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jonathan Rogers:</strong> Well, I mean, ultimately, I think that more content is better than less when it comes to this kind of stuff. Even though you may run into that situation, the people who are going to be the people who play the most are also going to be the people who are most on your side and talking about your game and generating the buzz. So I think it is very important to make sure we're appealing to those people and other people who have less time. I mean, they're still going to come along for the ride and they're still going to have a great time, and so long as we're still adding enough content, they're going to enjoy it even if they don't get to experience literally everything. I think that's okay. And there's also this sort of funny thing where on some level you need aspirational content to exist in the game content that is hard for most people to get to in order for there to be something to strive for next time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you didn't make it to the Pinnacles this time, well, then maybe you'll play next time when we've added more stuff throughout the rest of the game that improves your experience. But then the second time you play, you'll have a better time and Path of Exile is actually a game that kind of almost has a meta experience grind of each time you play the game you get better as a player, which means you get further into it and further towards the goal. So that, I think, is part of the reason why Path of Exile has such appeal. PoE 1 still is growing. I mean, maybe I can't unequivocally say that now, but at least until Path Of Exile 2 came out PoE 1 was still setting concurrency records so many years after it came out. And I think that is really a lot of the reason for that.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/30/layeredkeyart-highres2-1743294683567.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Huntress, holding her favored weapon.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Speaking of aspirational content, you mentioned during yesterday's briefing that you were disappointed by how easily players were able to knock down the big end game boss at launch. Can you talk about how Dawn of the Hunt plans to scale back the pace at which players can creep up their power, assuming that's something you guys are shooting for?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jonathan Rogers:</strong> So I wouldn't say that we are shooting for that in the sense that we want, overall, for that to happen. What I will say is that there were certain combinations of mechanics that we didn't expect to be as crazy as they were and those were found faster than people found the content, if you know what I mean. So it sort of meant that all of that — the secrets of build creation had already kind of been unlocked by the time people did that. So yeah, I mean, look, we are doing a huge balance pass. Everything will change. Your expectations of what is good and what is not good will just be readjusted very significantly by this. And the hope is that, as we continue to iterate, that we'll just keep on improving. We will saw off anything that jumps up too far, we'll push up anything that's too far at the bottom, and we'll get to the point of having that be a lot better.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And the reason for that, really, is because if something is easy to get to a broken state, which is... what I mean by that is like, 'oh, you just combine these support gems and then suddenly you've got an amazing build and items don't even matter.' If you have a situation like that, then people will all just do that. Whereas if it's like, 'okay, sure you can kill the Pinnacle Boss in 14 seconds, but first of all, you need a unique from this and you need a unique from that.' And it's like a whole thing, right? If it's economically expensive in-game to be able to do something to become really powerful, then that's fine because you want people to get to the point of killing the Pinnacle Boss in 14 seconds. You just don't want that to be the case the first time you fight the Pinnacle Boss. So that's effectively, ideally, what we're doing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so as I said: I don't look at that as slowing the game down exactly. It's just sawing off the things that are causing players to all flock to one particular broken thing and ultimately making the game not have that feeling of progression of power that you want to have. You want to really have that exponential growth all the way from beginning to end and not have any sort of like, 'oh, suddenly I'm just broken now,' that happens at some point.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Ultimately, I think that more content is better than less.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Let's talk about the Huntress. What are the main ways that the Huntress differs from the other character classes that are already available in Path of Exile 2, and how does this character justify me going through another play or two of the campaign?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jonathan Rogers:</strong> When we are looking at new characters one of the main questions is what weapon type does it use and how is that weapon type going to make the game feel different? So in this case we've got spears. Obviously you don't have to use spears with the Huntress, you can use it on any class, but assuming you're using the stereotype weapon of the Huntress that’s spears, and the thing is, 'well, what makes this weapon type different than others?' And the answer to that is spears are the only weapon that you can use both at melee distance and also throw them at ranged distance. So that's kind of the thing that we're thinking, 'okay, what can we do to make the gameplay be constantly that: you’re at melee range, you're at projectile range — what's the type of gameplay we can do to cause that to happen?' That will be what will make the class feel different.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No other weapon does that. So effectively what it meant was we're like, okay, for every melee combo, we want there to be a ranged skill you have to do before that to unlock it. And for every ranged combo, we want there to be a melee thing you have to do before to unlock that combo. And then we also need to add a lot of tools for getting from one state to the other. And then, what that sort of led to was a class that's incredibly agile, which is very good because it is the primary dex melee character, and it just feels like you're moving around the battlefield a ton, you're jumping in and out. It's just a very kinetic feeling that you get moving forwards and backwards like that, which I think feels very different than the other classes. So to me, that's the reason that you would want to try it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other thing as well that I thought was quite interesting is that we managed to really get the parry of countering gameplay. We finally found a formula for that to work well in PoE, which was incredibly challenging. And honestly, I was very skeptical we would even be able to achieve it just due to the pace of the monsters attacking you. But we have actually got something that does work in our game context really well. And so that's a fun one for me as well.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/30/lich-1743294683568.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Witch's latest Ascendancy class: the Lich.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Tell me about beast taming. How does that mechanic work? Or is the idea that we're killing them and then summoning them from the afterlife necromancer style, or...</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jonathan Rogers:</strong> When you get the Tame Beast skill, you effectively use it on a monster and you get some number of seconds, I think it might be five seconds or something like that, to kill the monster while it's got that tame thing on it. And then if you do that, then effectively it gets trapped. Its spirit gets trapped and then sucked into your character, and then you can summon it as a companion. And the big thing with beast taming is that you get all the mods on the rare that you found. And that means it's not necessarily just about finding the best type of beast, it's also finding a beast that has the best mods that you can use with as well, since all of those monster mods can do that. So that should be quite a fun hunt to find the best beast for your build. So I'm hoping players will have fun with that one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>That's awesome. How long do they remain by your side?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jonathan Rogers:</strong> Once you've got them, it's like a Poké Ball, right? That's your beast now. If it dies, it'll resummon. That's your beast. You can only have one at a time though for companions. So basically, you'll find a better beast and then presumably you'll want to be using that one instead later on. But yeah, that's just your beast forever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>That's awesome. And are there limitations on what counts as a beast? I assume it has to be an animal.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jonathan Rogers:</strong> Basically yes, someone at some point has decided this is a beast and this is not. I'm sure there'll be some arguments from players about whether something counts as a beast or not, but ultimately it just comes down to that.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You are recommending that players start a new league with this update. Is this something that we can expect from all of the updates where the best experience is starting from scratch?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jonathan Rogers:</strong> Absolutely. And, I mean, that's just our formula really, because our way of looking at things is that we're not a game that you just play forever and ever. We are a game where you come for a season, you play the game for a month or maybe two months, and you get through the content, you get to the point where you feel like your character is finished in some sense, and then you stop and you go play something else. But we'll always be back for another season later on. And as I said, it's a big part of why I believe that our game has so much longevity, is the repeated playthroughs and so on. So it's definitely a different model than what a lot of games in the past have had, but also a model that we've seen a lot of other developers realizing that is actually more sustainable for the industry overall. So something that I like to see.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>And is that something you think players would also be expected to do once the game reaches its 1.0 full release?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jonathan Rogers:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. 100%.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You mentioned yesterday one of the changes in the end game is the new primary objective in the Atlas end game map of trying to stop corruption, which unlocks the ability to choose between doing corrupted or cleansed versions of maps while exploring the overworld. Can you explain what the pros and cons are of why you might want to do corrupted versus cleansed? Is it flavor or enemies? Are the rewards different?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jonathan Rogers:</strong> Effectively the main two things are, the enemies are different: there are different bosses and then those different bosses have different rewards. And there's also things like, so for example, the cleansed maps are the only place that you're going to get the fracturing orbs, which is a new crafting mechanic that we've got. Effectively just making sure that each type of content has different rewards, and then we do like it so that when you have different strategies and what you're doing on your Atlas, depending on what type of content that you need, it's like, if you need this, then you're going to do that. If you need this, you're going to do that. So it's giving the players that sort of idea of them choosing what they're doing, but then ideally also being at a different point in a character's lifetime, they may need to do one versus the other, and so they're going to change their strategy at some point as well. But yeah, it's ultimately like, 'well, what rewards am I getting out of it at the end?' is a different element you have to be worrying about though, whenever we're designing new content.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/30/allclasses-1743295015044.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Path of Exile 2's updated roster of playable characters.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You're also adding over a hundred unique items. Can you tell me about the one you are most excited about personally, and bonus points if it's something that you fear might need to nerf?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jonathan Rogers:</strong> So one of the ones that might be broken is there's a shield that allows you to parry projectiles. We did show it in the video. It effectively means if you've got that unique that you no longer have to be close to monsters anymore. So it kind of deactivates the melee requirement of the Huntress a little bit. You can now parry and do all the combos from range. So we'll see how it goes because the empowered versions of all the spear throws are pretty good. And so we'll see how that goes. And also just in terms of defensiveness, that might be a little bit too off the hook, but we'll see. I'm hoping it'll be okay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I guess it kind of has its own nerf because you have to be able to get the timing right to do the parries.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jonathan Rogers:</strong> This is actually not the case, because in most games you do have to get the timing right to do that. But in our game it's actually kind of the opposite of that. While you're holding down the parry button, you're parrying everything and then it's what you do after the parry. Because what it does is when you parry something, it puts a counter on the enemy that you can then take advantage of with another skill. So it's kind of backwards from how most games do it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've tried parrying mechanics before, actually. It's been one of those things that we struggled to get right. And the reason why it was so hard is because our game moves so quickly and because there's lots of monsters around you all the time, you didn't really have a chance to follow up attacks very easily.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But with the way we've done parries here, it means that you can much more easily and reasonably do that. Now, the reason why it still incentivizes good timing is because it does interrupt. Parry will immediately interrupt anything instantly. And anytime you're waiting for a monster to hit you is wasted time you could be DPSing, so there’s still incentive to get the timing right. Doing the timing before was just so hard with the combat pace we had that it just wasn't working. So yeah, I'm really proud of how that worked out. But honestly, it wasn't even my idea. I actually was not a believer. I didn't think it could work and Mark [Roberts] was the one who actually managed to solve that problem. So once we did that, it really improved the class. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Whenever someone says something like that, it's usually because they're not enjoying going through the campaign, right? Well, okay, let's make you enjoy the campaign more. That should be the solution.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>During the Q&amp;A yesterday, you pushed back on certain ideas, like the ability to skip replaying the campaign and a new character. How does the team think about that extremely difficult balancing act of responding to what players want while also having your own point of view and your creative team sort of holding their ground on decisions that they really believe in?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jonathan Rogers:</strong> It's very hard, but the thing that I always try to do is make sure that whenever I'm hearing community feedback that I'm not just thinking, 'okay, oh they're wrong' or something like that. It's very easy to get into a mindset where you've developed this 'us versus them' mentality like that. And then when that happens, you start to get into this sort of negative cycle of, 'oh, I guess we'll just do it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So the thing that I think is really important is you always have the spirit of discovery about, 'well why are they saying this? I know that they think that it's because of this, but why is it actually?' And if you reinterpret things in that lens, if you, first of all, you believe that if someone's saying they've got a problem, they really do have a problem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But then the second thing being that, 'well, why is that problem actually happening? Can we solve it? What would it look like to solve it?' Then you will eventually find some solution. Now the thing is that sometimes you can't think of one. Sometimes it is really hard. In those cases you just have to say, 'okay, well we are just not going to change this until we can come with something.' I will never make a change I don't believe in because I think that's ultimately going to make the game worse overall. And that's super important that you never do that. But at the same time, sometimes you just won't be able to come up with something. But I am a believer that there always is something, there will be a way to solve the community's problem eventually.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so, for example, with the particular campaign thing there: whenever someone says something like that, it's usually because they're not enjoying going through the campaign, right? Well, okay, let's make you enjoy the campaign more. That should be the solution. If you are not enjoying something, I'll make you enjoy it by adding content to it, by improving it. That's the way I would view that. But when you're in a community, it's very easy to say, 'okay, well X is bothering me, therefore remove thing X.' You know what I mean? It's just very easy to look at it that way, because they don't have to be worried about the downsides. It's not their job to be worried about that. Their job is just to complain about the thing they don't like, and my job is to be the one worrying about the downside.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Path of Exile 2 Dawn of the Hunt launches April 4, 2025.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Travis Northup is a writer for IGN.

            <p>Many millions of us have looked for a Porter in the storm, with Hideo Kojim today announcing that the number of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> players has now exceeded a not too shabby at all 20 million.</p>
<p>"Thank you very much. Sams from all over the world are still delivering. You are connecting the world," <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1906654046783676810">Kojima wrote on social media</a> with a nice little graphic showing Sam looking towards another Sam.</p>

<p>This latest figure is for players across all available platforms, and includes those who have taken Death Stranding for a whirl as part of a subscription service such as PlayStation Plus.</p>
<p>As noted by industry analyst <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX">Daniel Ahmad</a>, Death Stranding had sold less than 5m copies prior to its release on the likes of PC, PS+, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and Mac.</p>
<p>"Making the game more accessible has led to 20m+ players experiencing the IP prior to the launch of its sequel that will require players to own a PS5 to play at launch," Ahmad wrote on X.</p>

<p>As for that sequel, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, to give it its full name, is set for release on 26th June, and includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-out-in-june-fake-snake-revealed">a new character that looks remarkably like Metal Gear Solid's Snake</a>. This was revealed during the game's SXSW 2025 showcase earlier in March.</p>
<p>Towards the end of last year, Kojima Productions shared several new snippets of footage for Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-footage-sees-creepy-puppet-dollman-steal-the-show-in-unexpected-dance-number">including a look at the upcoming game's very realistic photo mode and Sam Bridges' stop motion puppet companion, Dollman</a>.</p>
<p>As you would expect from a Kojima game, it all looks suitably bizarre. Are you looking forward to rendezvousing with Sam once more this summer?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/death-stranding-passes-20m-players-worldwide-ahead-of-sequel-launch.1149672/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-20m-players<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hideo Kojima has announced that his most recent game&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>has passed another big player milestone ahead of the release of the hotly-anticipated sequel later this year.</p>

<p>Speaking on social media platform <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2jd64ychnmuu4x6eghptdvco/post/3llo4343bk222" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, Kojima Productions revealed that&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>has passed 20 million players around the world, thanking "everyone who built bridges, paved roads, and delivered cargo" for the "incredible milestone".</p>

<p>It's worth noting that Kojima Productions is referring not just to sales of the game, but to the player count as a whole. That figure therefore likely includes players who have experienced the game on PlayStation Plus and Xbox Game Pass; it's currently available on the former on both PS4 and PS5.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-stranding-20m-players-box.jpg?itok=PtkmihIz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-stranding-20m-players-box.jpg?itok=zi3L6yvs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>has passed 20 million players worldwide.</figcaption></figure><p>The new player milestone for <i>Death Stranding&nbsp;</i>comes as Kojima and his studio prepare to release the game's sequel,&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">set for a June launch on PlayStation 5</a>.</p>

<p>It looks like the game will be exclusive to Sony's console for the foreseeable future, but given that Kojima <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-xbox-release-kojima-ip" rel="nofollow">now owns the IP rights</a> to&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em>, I really wouldn't be surprised to see the game get a multiplatform release at some point.</p>

<p>Of course, there's also the&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>movie, which will be a co-production between <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-movie-a24" rel="nofollow">Kojima's studio and movie house A24</a>, to look forward to. We still don't know who will be starring in that or when we can expect to see it, however.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em>, it's Hideo Kojima's first major project after <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/report-hideo-kojima-leaves-konami-forms-new-studio" rel="nofollow">leaving Konami back in 2015</a>. He's best known for the&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>series, although he's also worked on other games like&nbsp;<em>Policenauts&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Zone of the Enders</em>.</p>




<p><em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>tells the post-apocalyptic story of Sam Porter Bridges, a courier who must deliver packages in a world devastated by a mysterious cataclysm. Of course, if you know Kojima's work, you'll know that's hardly doing the game justice.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850570/DEATH_STRANDING_DIRECTORS_CUT/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/death-stranding/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/death-stranding-directors-cut/9nqgn8tgnt8p" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. The sequel, <i>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</i>, is <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">launching for PlayStation 5</a> on June 26th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/638535/physical-digital-video-games-nintendo-xbox-ps5-disc-cart<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>One of Sony’s best-ever PlayStation ads is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWSIFh8ICaA">a 21-second video</a> titled, “Official PlayStation Used Game Instructional Video.” It’s a “step-by-step” guide about how to lend your PS4 games to your friends. It has one step: one person hands another person a game box.</p><p>The ad succinctly clowns on Microsoft’s original and convoluted game sharing policy for the Xbox One, which let users ditch discs in exchange for daily DRM checks. The idea was so hated that Microsoft <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jun/19/xbox-one-drm-second-hand-restrictions-abandoned">walked it back</a> just over a week after the release of Sony’s ad and months before the console came out. The lesson was simple — don’t mess with people’s discs.</p><p>But more than a decade later, it’s not hard to imagine a future where Sony’s own ad doesn’t apply anymore. </p><p>Physical game sales in 2024 were less than half what they were as recently as 2021, and the market has been in decline since 2008, Circana analyst Mat Piscatella tells <em>The Verge</em>. “There has been a long trend of declining sales in physical games,” Piscatella says. “And now there’s declining distribution with retailers pulling back space, with companies making fewer physical games overall, and with the entire shift towards digital distribution.”</p><p>The writing has been on the wall since 2020, when Microsoft and Sony introduced their (at the time) next-generation Xbox and PlayStation consoles with versions that didn’t have a place to put your discs. Ultimately, they were responding to the emerging trend of people buying fewer physical games for consoles. Can you even remember the last time you bought a physical game for PC?</p><p>The primary reason for the shift to digital is because of connectivity: about 99 percent of consoles are connected to the internet, Piscatella says. (Players weren’t quite as online <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/insights/2015/game-consoles-in-2015-one-stop-shop-for-games-and-entertainment/">a decade ago</a>.) And once people got used to digital, “more and more often people would choose convenience over the practical positives of physical.”</p><p>Just look at this graph from Piscatella showing plummeting physical sales. The outlook is grim.</p><p>Microsoft hasn’t been particularly secretive about its interest in a heavily digital future. The latest Xbox generation launched with the all-digital Series S, and it added an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/9/24174793/microsoft-xbox-series-x-white-digital-edition">all-digital Series X option</a> last year. Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296420/microsoft-this-is-an-xbox-marketing-campaign-xbox-everywhere">“This is an Xbox” campaign</a> positions basically every device with a screen as a potential console. The company’s Xbox Game Pass subscription is essentially a rental service for digital titles. And physical editions of <em>Avowed</em>, one of Microsoft’s biggest Xbox games of the year, only have <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-avowed-xbox-pc-premium-edition">a code for the game</a> in the box.</p><p>Of course, Microsoft is best known as a software company, so perhaps it’s not too surprising that it might want to bank its video game future entirely on digital games. And while I still think it will be a shame if the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/7/24264129/halo-unreal-engine-5-halo-studios-announcement">next <em>Halo</em></a> isn’t available on a disc, it doesn’t seem unreasonable to expect that Xbox could drop discs entirely by the end of the decade.</p><p>Sony will probably take a little bit longer to make the all-digital jump. The company is certainly signaling it wants to move in that direction, perhaps most strongly by shipping the premium $699 PS5 Pro <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24241265/sony-ps5-pro-game-console-disc-drive-end">without a disc drive</a>. But it continues to sell drives separately for the Pro and for the slim PS5. And the company would simply face pushback on a different scale than Microsoft: there are far more PS4s and PS5s out there than Xboxes, and that means a lot more people who have bought a lot more physical games who may want ways to play them for the foreseeable future. </p><p>Piscatella also points out that some major mass-market games like <em>EA Sports College Football</em> and <em>Call of Duty</em> have a “pretty big physical presence” that console makers may not want to jeopardize.</p><p>Nintendo is where we see the argument for physical games — though maybe not <em>discs</em> — sticking around. The just-announced Switch 2 has a cartridge slot and is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/16/24343666/nintendo-switch-2-cartridge-backwards-compatibility">backward-compatible with Switch 1 games</a>. The console’s first generation lasted from 2017 until sometime this year, so if the Switch 2’s lifecycle also lasts eight years, physical media will be relevant for Nintendo well into the 2030s.</p><p>The company may have reason to stick with cartridges for even longer. Piscatella says that Nintendo platforms are still “heavier physical” than other platforms because its audience, especially families, expects the format; it’s a lot easier for kids in a family to share a game when they can just pass the cart to each other, as Sony adeptly showed in its ad. That advantage won’t last forever, though. Just last week, Nintendo announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637307/nintendo-switch-virtual-game-card-lending-system">a “virtual game card” lending system</a> that lets family members share digital games.</p><div><p>“Consumers on PlayStation and Xbox are speaking with their dollars”</p></div><p>It’s yet another sign that physical media is waning, even in its strongholds. “At this point, the consumers on PlayStation and Xbox are speaking with their dollars that digital-first is a fine way to go,” Piscatella says.</p><p>Nintendo, PlayStation, and Xbox did not respond to requests for comment on their future plans for physical media.</p><p>While physical media sales are on the decline, New York University games professor Joost van Dreunen points out that the sales of physical video game accessories have been “skyrocketing.” The PC <em>games </em>market may be mostly digital on Steam, but sales of things like custom controllers, screens, chairs, and headphones are a “huge category,” he says.</p><p>He believes that accessories and what he calls “the personalization of the physical experience of games and interactivity” will grow, which we can see manifested all the way to theme parks. (van Dreunen points out that Nintendo is particularly good at this: think <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/16/8050027/nintendo-amiibo-sales-charts">Amiibo</a>, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock">Alarmo clock</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan">theme parks</a> filled with Nintendo goodies.)</p><p>Both van Dreunen and Piscatella ultimately made the comparison of video games to vinyl records, which is “kind of like on the extreme niche, but doing ok,” Piscatella says. There’s a key difference between vinyl and video games, of course — with a vinyl record, you can play it on a turntable, but a physical cart of <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> can only slot into a Nintendo Switch. It’s more about the enthusiast crowd focusing on physical media.</p><p>Maybe that will be enough to keep physical formats around into the future. But the next time Sony makes a guide on how to share PlayStation games, I doubt it will be a crisp 21 seconds.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>An alleged cryptocurrency scam that models itself on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> will be launching on Steam this week, despite Valve's promises that they do not allow NFT or blockchain games to exist on the platform. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paradise-xrpl">Paradise</a> has been advertised as an action game set in a sunny city which will allow players to drive cars, shoot enemies, and earn money. But its in-game currency is based on blockchain technology, and some reports allege it is a scam based in Russia which does not allow its crypto investors to withdraw funds. When asked why the game is allowed on the platform, Valve have repeatedly neglected to comment.</p>

<p>Paradise will be releasing into early access on April 2, say developers Ultra Games. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_c9D63YNm4">recent trailer</a> shows a player inspecting guns, walking through a garage full of cars, and navigating a world split up with loading screens made with AI-generated art designed to look like the loading screens of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> series. Previous trailers boast that you can speak to any NPC using AI technology. </p>
<p>"Play with your friends, engage in shootouts, race cars, complete daily missions, and reach the apex of life," reads a blurb. "Earn money and buy what you want, from real estate to fancy clothes." The creators have boasted that the game is in Steam's top 200 most wishlisted games. It's possible many of those Steam users aren't aware of the game's grubby features and history of misleading marketing.</p>
<p>Paradise uses a currency called the $PAR token which is based on blockchain technology, and can be invested in via a third-party app. Some investors in this cryptocoin claim they became unable to withdraw funds, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-copycat-paradise-is-an-alleged-crypto-scam-yet-continues-to-gain-steam-wishlists">we reported in January</a>. The developers have also falsely claimed to be working with streamers such as Ninja and Pokimane, and included unlicensed use of a Lamborghini and other cars in previous trailers. </p>

<p>Together with a lot of AI slop and very heavy use of Unreal Marketplace assets, the game had enough red flags that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9CQBMzLjCA">multiple YouTubers investigated the company</a> behind it, with one discovering that the Hong Kong address listed by the company was fake and eventually discovering that it is actually based somewhere in Tbilisi, Georgia - a city with <a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/project/scam-empire/diamonds-dior-and-dubai-vacations-the-luxurious-lives-of-georgias-call-center-scammers">a troubled history when it comes to blockchain scammers</a>. </p>
<p>"Versions of the game for Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation Store will not include cryptocurrency, ensuring there are no restrictions for users on these platforms," say the developers in a <a href="https://paradisevs.com/company_statement2">defensive rebuttal</a> on their website. Unfortunately, no one can verify the developer's claims until the game is released. But even if a means to buy the currency is not present in the final release, it wouldn't restrict the game from redirecting players to the third-party cryptocurrency app necessary for players to earn and spend the game's $PAR token in-game. An act which, in itself, could be harmful to users, even if Valve’s terms of service don’t specifically forbid this. Since the game can still serve as a Trojan horse for hooking people into an alleged crypto scam.</p>
<p>On top of this, the document which insists cryptocurrency will not be in the game is full of other misleading statements, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CA4RvTrS-nE">pointed out by video creator Jetro</a>, one of the YouTubers who previously investigated the game. The developers claim their use of a minimap from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> is allowed, for example, because "The GTA 5 map is based on the real layout of Los Angeles, which is not intellectual property". To avoid doubt: the GTA 5 map is not a 1:1 reproduction of Los Angeles, and Rockstar own the rights to that map. </p>
<p>Steam <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-is-banning-games-with-nfts-and-cryptocurrency">banned all games that feature NFT and cryptocurrency</a> in 2021. The Paradise developers have edited the game's Steam page a number of times since it first appeared, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3281420/history/?changeid=U:56561021">removing trailers that mention cryptocurrency</a>, for example. It's unclear if Valve have been in contact with the developers or not. I have asked Valve for comment on this game multiple times and have not received a response. </p>
<p>The game is also launching <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/paradise-xrpl-9e47b6">on the Epic Store</a>, but only after it was removed once and reuploaded as "Paradise XRPL" , with a store page that clearly states it is an NFT game, along with <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/paradise-xrpl-faq-9f3b93">an FAQ on its crypto gubbins</a> which insists that it is good for the game. "The introduction of a crypto token in PARADISE XRPL enhances the product by enabling streamlined transactions for in-game purchases, facilitating trade between players, and granting access to exclusive content." I have also asked Epic Games for comment and will let you know if we learn more. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Adam Sandler is easily one of the biggest comedy stars ever in Hollywood. Though he’s run afoul of critics for years, Sandler has enjoyed a loyal following due to his everyman persona that thumbs the nose of well-dressed muckity mucks. His recent cameo at the 2025 Oscars says it all: He’s a superstar who revels in the comfort of zip-up hoodies and basketball shorts over designer tuxes. And we wouldn’t have him any other way.</p><p>This July, the unexpected sequel <em>Happy Gilmore 2</em> will hit the links on Netflix, where Sandler has called home for the better part of the last decade. In commemoration of Sandler’s return to the world that boosted him to the upper echelons of movie stardom, we’ll be running down through all of Adam Sandler’s major movies to rank the worst to best. Get your Scuba Steve goggles on and dive in. </p></div></div><div><p>Just because a movie calls itself “ridiculous” doesn’t excuse it from being abominable. One of Adam Sandler’s first major forays into streaming-release movies was the Western spoof <em>The Ridiculous 6</em>, a movie mired in controversy – a disputed number of Native actors walked off the set over its offensive humor – only to have the dubious recognition of earning 0% on Rotten Tomatoes. Are critics being uptight? Just once, maybe trust them on this.</p></div><div><p>Adam Sandler could have sunk after his film debut in 1989, the seafaring dud <em>Going Overboard</em>. Predating his run on <em>Saturday Night Live</em>, Sandler’s first movie is his first as a leading man, and sees him play a cocktail waiter on a cruise ship who harbors lofty dreams of becoming the ship’s resident comedian. Budget production value doesn’t weigh down <em>Going Overboard</em> so much as Sandler’s painfully obvious inexperience sinks it. </p></div><div><p>Behold an Adam Sandler comedy that hasn’t just spoiled like milk, but is straight up radioactive. Sandler stars in <em>You Don’t Mess with the Zohan</em> as a top-rate soldier for the Israel Defense Force who abandons his post to pursue his dreams of becoming a hair stylist in America, where he falls for a Palestinian salon owner (played by Emmanuelle Chirqui). There’s no point in getting worked up over an almost 20-year-old comedy that’s dumber than rocks where the most memorable gag has Sandler smack a guy with a fake foot. But truly, what the hell was anyone thinking? </p></div><div><p>An empty calorie sequel to a comedy few liked in the first place, <em>Grown Ups 2 </em>lives to serve anyone who finds middle aged men in low-stakes crises to be the peak of modern entertainment. David Spade, Chris Rock, and Kevin James reunite with Adam Sandler for a rudderless second round that sees the grown men square off with a neighboring college fraternity. Why bother with Sandler waddling around in oversized basketball shorts when the infinitely better <em>Neighbors </em>with Seth Rogen and Zac Efron exists?</p></div><div><p>Somehow, Al Pacino saw fit to put in effort in <em>Jack and Jill</em> while Adam Sandler floats around on autopilot. Sandler does double duty playing both an ad executive and his intrusive twin sister who overstays her welcome during the holidays. There’s no other way to say it:<em> Jack and Jill</em> is bad. Really bad. But Pacino proves he’s one of the greatest actors of our time by making a meal out of his supporting role, where he plays himself caught up doing a lame Dunkin Donuts campaign. Sandler must have made him an offer he couldn’t refuse. </p></div><div><p>A star-studded religious satire that makes a convincing argument for atheism,<em> Little Nicky</em> stars Adam Sandler as the “kindest” son of Satan (Harvey Keitel) who is sent to Earth to keep his brothers from wreaking havoc on a biblical scale. Nothing in <em>Little Nicky</em>, not even a giggling Reese Witherspoon in angel wings, can redeem the movie’s damned soul. A lethally annoying performance by Sandler is arguably the movie’s deadliest sin.</p></div><div><p>A movie adaptation of a divorced man’s Funko Pop collection, <em>Pixels </em>is a headache-inducing tentpole that doesn’t mine Generation X nostalgia so much as weaponizes it in a test of human endurance. Adam Sandler plays one of several grown-up arcade champions from Reagan’s America who are called by the President of the United States (Kevin James) to save the world from an alien invasion who’ve taken the form of classic video game monsters. Sandler in a “real-life” version of <em>Space Invaders</em> <strong>should</strong> be fun. But <em>Pixels </em>is so bad in its unfunny excess you might feel compelled to firebomb your local retro bar arcade in an act of vengeance.</p></div><div><p><em>That’s My Boy </em>begins with statutory rape and ends in incest. Even for Adam Sandler, <em>That’s My Boy</em> is far too filthy and unfunny to put up with. It’s also maddening, given how it squanders a dynamite pairing of Sandler and Andy Samberg. <em>That’s My Boy</em> sees Adam Sandler play the deadbeat dad to his estranged son (Samberg) – born of a highly-publicized teacher-student affair – who crashes his son’s wedding to stage a lucrative TV reunion. It might look like another run-of-the-mill Sandler joint, but its over-extended reach for shock humor make it a distasteful wolf in sheep’s clothing.</p></div><div><p>You have to give The Sandman credit: He’s treated his lucrative Netflix deal for the blank check it is, taking the tech giant’s money to kick it in Puerto Rico. Sandler co-stars in <em>The Do-Over </em>with David Spade, who plays a hapless man in a loveless marriage who gets the chance to start life anew after running into his old classmate (Sandler) at a high school reunion. The bullets start flying when they find out the dead men whose identities they’ve stolen were caught up in shady stuff. A deflating action-comedy, <em>The Do-Over</em> is ironically-titled; Do-over? Don’t even bother.</p></div><div><p><em>Grown Ups</em> is a better movie than its sequel, but that’s like saying a colonoscopy is better than rectal cleaning. In the first of the two films, Sandler and his other seasoned Hollywood comics spend 90 minutes making poo jokes in a pathetic comedy that deals with the difficulties of aging with dignity. Sandler unites with Chris Rock, Kevin James, David Spade, and Rob Schneider as childhood buddies who meet up years later with their families in an attempt to recapture their youthful vigor. <em>Grown Ups</em> is like watching a 40-something year old at the bar telling obnoxious jokes – and it’s just as unfun as it sounds.</p></div><div><p>After years of churning out lewd and crude product, Adam Sandler took a surprising turn with 2014's<em> The Cobbler</em>, a little piece of magical realism. Sandler is in a whole different gear, playing a humble shoe repairman with the power to become his own customers. Despite welcome sincerity and Sandler demonstrating more dramatic heft than normal – though Sandler gets assist from <em>other</em> actors playing his metamorphing shoemaker – <em>The Cobbler</em> is too riddled with scuffmarks in spite of its own good intentions.</p></div><div><p>Because a questionable amount of people watched <em>Murder Mystery </em>in 2019, Netflix punished its own customers with a direct sequel, <em>Murder Mystery 2 </em>in 2023. Following up on its predecessor, Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston return as the Spitzes, who are now struggling to keep their private detective agency afloat. Their latest case: finding the Maharajah, who has just been kidnapped at his own wedding. Anniston and Sandler are clearly having fun, it’s just a bummer how no one else is.</p></div><div><p>It’s strange to realize how Adam Sandler came to prominence in the waning years of the buddy action movie boom, yet never made any meaningful strides in the genre. Among the only few buddy movies Sandler ever made was 1996's <em>Bulletproof</em>, where Sandler stars as a two-bit criminal who reunites with an estranged friend (Damon Wayans) who is actually an undercover cop. Few people remember Bulletproof and for good reason: It’s boring. Uninspired and plodding, Sandler and Wayans’ lethargic chemistry – or lack thereof – leaves <em>Bulletproof </em>anything but.</p></div><div><p>Overstimulating to the point of inducing anaphylactic shock, <em>Hotel Transylvania 3</em> slightly flips the script from the 2012 original. This time, Adam Sandler’s Dracula takes his monstrous family and friends on a crusie liner vacation, where he falls for Kathryn Hahn’s Ericka, later to be revealed as the great granddaughter of his nemesis Abraham Van Helsing. Even the movie’s target audience of kids might find <em>Hotel Transylvania</em> <em>3</em> extra, and even harmless fun can leave them winded.</p></div><div><p>A whodunnit as plain as its title, <em>Murder Mystery</em> lacks the swagger and sex appeal inherent to the genre – and that’s kind of the point. Adam Sandler and Jennifer Anniston reunite from <em>Just Go With It</em> to play an ordinary married couple who, after being invited to come aboard a billionaire’s yacht party, must now prove their innocence after their affluent host (Terence Stamp) is murdered. Though Anniston and Sandler get moderate mileage out of their fish-out-of-water roles, <em>Murder Mystery </em>is glossy plastic, yet another streaming thing to be watched passively on your phone. </p></div><div><p><em>Sandy Wexler</em> flirts with brilliance in how it drops Adam Sandler in ‘90s Hollywood to play a talent agent remembered for his eccentricities. But what could have been a self-reflective meditation on Sandler’s own unlikely success as a movie star is instead an unambitious, overly-sentimental rom-com where Sandler falls in love with Jennifer Hudson, a singer whom Sandler’s Sandy discovers at an amusement park. About the only memorable thing about <em>Sandy Wexler</em> is Sandler’s execution of the role. And even then, his oversized glasses, seal-like applauses, and pastel jackets are hardly a new shade. </p></div><div><p>After committing the artistic violation that was <em>Grown Ups 2</em>, Chris Rock and Adam Sandler tried to make amends in 2018 with the more sober Netflix comedy <em>The Week Of</em>. The two play the fathers of an engaged couple who work to put aside their differences during the most important and increasingly calamitous week of their childrens’ lives. <em>The Week Of</em> is light on Sandler’s signature gross-outs, but it’s not enough to keep it afloat either. </p></div><div><p>Back when gay marriage was a hot-button issue, Adam Sandler and Kevin James starred in the abundantly offensive, yet surprisingly sincere <em>I Now Pronounce You Chuck &amp; Larry</em>. Sandler and James co-star as best friends and New York City firefighters who get legally married to receive benefits; when the government starts getting suspicious, the buds begin masquerading as lovebirds. Originating from a script by Alexander Payne before Sandler got involved, <em>I Now Pronounce You Chuck &amp; Larry</em> comes across as an unexpected call for social equality, albeit a careless one, from a most unexpected place: the heart. </p></div><div><p>If every major comedy star in Hollywood has to have a cartoon franchise, then Adam Sandler’s money maker is the Hotel Transylvania series. The first of them, released in 2012 and directed by animation auteur Genndy Tartakovsky, introduces Sandler as Count Dracula, who in addition to being the famous vampire also runs a hotel getaway for monsters. Sandler doesn’t seem to really <em>try</em> to be Dracula. Instead, he’s content to come off like he’s in a Halloween costume than actually portraying an eldritch creature of the night. But this, and all the other Hotel Transylania movies, are innocent fluff that ultimately serve to distract rugrats for the afternoon.</p></div><div><p>Adam Sandler returns as Dracula in <em>Hotel Transylvania 2</em>, with the comic star afforded marginally more room to play around as a doting grandfather than the more conventional protective father he was in the predecessor. Still, <em>Hotel Transylvania 2</em> simply keeps the ball rolling, existing as little more than a paycheck for everyone involved. But Sandler has done far worse than voice a funny Dracula, and <em>Hotel Transylvania 2</em> is as sweet as a handful of Halloween candy.</p></div><div><p>In 2014, Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore nearly matched Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan to deliver a third in a trio of perfect romantic comedies. Sadly, their efforts fell way short with the flavorless <em>Blended</em>. Sandler and Barrymore co-star as single parents whose disastrous blind date is followed up by a coincidental shared family vacation in South Africa. There’s some sweetness in all its schmaltz, but <em>Blended </em>is nowhere near to the level of what Sandler/Barrymore have delivered before. </p></div><div><p>Adam Sandler in a squeaky-clean Disney movie sounds like magic on paper, but<em> Bedtime Stories </em>is nothing revelatory for the normally crude superstar. Sandler stars as a hotel maintenance man whose bedtime stories to his niece and nephew impausibly become true in reality. But while Sandler starts weaving tall tales of heroism and riches, the oblivious kids offer up some wacky twists of their own. By virtue of its Disney overlords, <em>Bedtime Stories</em> is sanitized Sandler romp the whole family can enjoy, but it’s not anyone’s idea of a dream come true.</p></div><div><p>It’s something of a master stroke on Adam Sandler’s part that he convinces everyone that Jennifer Anniston is the “other” woman in his 2011 rom-com <em>Just Go With It</em>. The Sandman stars as a womanizing plastic surgeon who compels his office manager (Anniston) to parade around as his divorcing wife after he meets someone he believes is his true love (Brooklyn Decker). But naturally, what Sandler is looking for may have been in front of him all this time. <em>Just Go With It </em>doesn’t tread new ground, and you can guess every turn it takes, but it’s a carefree ride.</p></div><div><p>A lesser remake to an already middling 1936 Frank Capra movie, <em>Mr. Deeds</em> sees Adam Sandler as a small-town pizzeria owner who inherits a massive $40 billion fortune, only to find priceless love from a tabloid TV journalist (played by Winona Ryder). Tamer than most Sandler fare but not as memorable either,<em> Mr. Deeds</em> gets most of its worth from Sandler inhabiting a uniquely wholesome, gee-shucks energy that’s in stark contrast to his other screaming buffoons.</p></div><div><p>If you were the right age to catch <em>The Waterboy</em> on cable, chances are bits like “Water sucks, Gatorade is better” are ingrained somewhere in your memory. Otherwise, <em>The Waterboy</em> is typical Adam Sandler slop, a raunchy underdog comedy that obscures its good nature in juvenile idiocy. Sandler stars as a bullied 32-year-old manchild whose new job providing water for a losing Louisiana college football team unlocks the violent superstar within him. Endlessly quotable but not much else,<em> The Waterboy</em> quenches anyone’s thirst for something stupid. </p></div><div><p>As Adam Sandler once sang himself: Christmas is one day, but Hanukkah is eight crazy nights. In this unusual R-rated animated musical, Adam Sandler lends his voice and likeness to become Davey Stone, a 30-something alcoholic who is given one last shot to turn his life around or else spend ten years in prison. Despite clever apperancess and catchy tunes, <em>Eight Crazy Nights </em>doesn’t totally seize on its potential to be a true holiday classic. But if claymation Santas and reindeer feel played out, you can light a candle with a mischievous 2D Sandler. </p></div><div><p>Adam Sandler is known for playing out-of-shape schlubs and <em>very </em>average joes, but for once, he was an all-star MVP in <em>The Longest Yard</em>. A remake of the hard-hitting Burt Reynolds movie from 1974, <em>The Longest Yard</em> follows Sandler as Paul Crewe, a disgraced NFL star who forms a team of inmates to play against their abusive guards. (Burt Reynolds also co-stars in the remake, this time playing the team’s coach.) While this ‘05 remake goes for more laughs than its grittier predecessor, it’s still a down-and-dirty football flick teeming with testosterone.</p></div><div><p>When Adam Sandler failed to get an Oscar for his work in the acclaimed <em>Uncut Gems</em>, he threatened to make a movie that was quote, “so bad on purpose” as an act of revenge. When Sandler went home with no trophies, that’s when <em>Hubie Halloween</em> hit Netflix. But as a surprise, this pumpkin spiced romp is anything but tricks. Sandler plays innocent, Halloween-obsessed deli worker Hubie Dubois who takes it upon himself to save his hometown of Salem, Massachusetts when a kidnapper threatens to ruin the spookiest night of the year. It’s a bizarre follow-up to <em>Uncut Gems</em>, sure, but this sugary sweet Halloween flick is a good time for everyone, even those too young to remember when Sandler wasn’t a Netflix fixture.</p></div><div><p>Before the Bill Lawrence show <em>Shrinking</em> saw Jason Segel play a therapist who invites a patient to live with him, there was the comparatively more reckless <em>Anger Management</em>. A timid businessman (Adam Sandler) has one bad experience on an airplane that leads to court-mandated therapy with a specialist (Jack Nicholson), whose unorthodox treatments escalate to extreme degrees. Though Nicholson pushes Sandler’s buttons, it just might be the thing he needs to finally stand up for himself. <em>Anger Management</em> is no comedy classic, but Nicholson proves he’s a hall of fame-worthy meme machine, eclipsing a surprisingly subdued Sandler. </p></div><div><p>Chad Kultgen’s novel about suburban families wallowing in self-made prisons of sex, boredom, and technology is also a sedated, if sleepy dramedy by <em>Juno</em> and <em>Up in the Air</em> director Jason Reitman. Adam Sandler is one of several familiar faces in the movie; he plays Don Truby, the dissatisfied husband to Helen (Rosemarie DeWitt) and de facto main character of Kultgen’s book. While <em>Men, Women &amp; Children</em> underwhelms like an extramarital fling at a Marriott, its defiance of what a “sex movie starring Adam Sandler” should be might pique interest. </p></div><div><p>During a brief spell when Adam Sandler and pal Rob Schneider were the default stars of lowbrow, high-concept comedies, Sandler took folks by surprise with his emotionally affecting <em>Click</em>. Sandler takes charge as a workaholic family man who is given a magical remote that gives him control over time. But as he fast forwards through the “boring” parts of life, he comes to realize what he’s missing out. Though the movie’s premise is built on a corny Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond gag, <em>Click</em> is disarmingly powerful in its overly familiar but no less resonant message of taking time to pause and bask in the wonderful life you already lead. </p></div><div><p>With stone cold classics like <em>Terms of Endearment</em>, <em>Broadcast News</em>, and <em>As Good as It Gets</em> under his belt, director James L. Brooks disappointed many with his 2004 romantic dramedy <em>Spanglish</em>. But in hindsight, it’s now one of the better turnouts for star Adam Sandler, playing a Los Angeles chef who hires a Spanish-speaking Mexican immigrant (Paz Vega) as a live-in housekeeper. As cultural differences and language barriers create tension, their crowded house becomes a home through shared understanding. <em>Spanglish</em> was not the first mature film to star Sandler – Paul Thomas Anderson’s <em>Punch-Drunk Love</em> was released just two years prior – but its appeal to actual grownups proved Sandler had, and has, more to offer. </p></div><div><p>Clunky inclusion of 9/11 aside, Adam Sandler is in exceptionally rare form as troubled Charlie, a lonely man mourning the loss of his family. After running into an old college roommate (Don Cheadle), who is split between his family and his career, the two rekindle their friendship, finding in each other what they need to carry on and move ahead. With a mop of frumpled hair and oversized earphones as a security blanket, Sandler impresses in one of his most vulnerable roles to date. You should also see him play the heck out of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/feature-the-colossus-and-the-comedian-246286&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/feature-the-colossus-and-the-comedian-246286"><em>Shadow of the Colossus</em></a></span>. </p></div><div><p>In a different time, <em>Spaceman</em> would be a different movie. If it were twenty years ago, Adam Sandler floating around in a spacesuit and befriending a talking spider who gives him advice about his marriage would be a recipe for something nonsensical. (As if it isn’t already.) But in the streaming era, <em>Spaceman</em> is played straight, maintaining its dignity as an existential sci-fi drama that interrogates the pangs of loneliness. Not all of <em>Spaceman</em> feels like it has footing on solid ground, but its somber tone compliments a committed Sandler who appears in uncharacteristically tortured hues. </p></div><div><p>Vomiting walruses and ethically troubling behavior by everyone are not enough to sink the buoyant <em>50 First Dates</em>. Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore reunite from <em>The Wedding Singer</em> to play a romantic match made in Hawaiian paradise whose only problem is Barrymore’s condition of short-term memory loss. Though Sandler relishes in the comfort of his usually bawdy humor, <em>50 First Dates</em> has a heart of gold that is easy to fall for. If you’re the sentimental type, the ending will sweep you off your feet. </p></div><div><p>Not long after <em>Happy Gilmore</em> made him a household name, Adam Sandler offered a glimpse at his coming maturity with a movie explicitly about his unwillingness to grow up and take responsibility. In <em>Big Daddy</em>, Sandler’s leading loaf Sonny illegally adopts his roommate’s kid (Cole and Dylan Sprouse in their first major role) in a desperate play to win back his ex-girlfriend. But raising a child is both rewarding and far more than Sonny bargained for, his fight to maintain custody culminating in a disarmingly sweet climax at a courthouse. Poke holes at the plot all you want – it can’t stop <em>Big Daddy</em> from being one of Sandler’s better movies, equally crass and charming in all the best ways.</p></div><div><p>Audiences went into <em>Funny People</em> expecting one thing, only to come out the other end with something totally different. Helmed by Judd Apatow during his hot streak, Adam Sandler plays a terminally ill comedian and movie star who befriends an up-and-comer (Rogen) and hires him as an assistant. Despite its title and marquee stars, <em>Funny People</em> isn’t a laugh-a-minute riot (which certainly many thought it would be). Instead, it’s an anxious dramedy about mortality and artistic expression. Sandler is a particular standout, practically playing himself but in a way that opens him like a bleeding wound.</p></div><div><p>When <em>Billy Madison</em> hit theaters, critics dismissed it as low-rent comedy for the MTV-pilled. But audiences rallied around it, cementing it as a classic that created a star out of Adam Sandler, who plays the dimwitted, spoiled son of a CEO who must repeat his entire schooling to win control of his father’s company. This has effectively been the story of Sandler’s whole career: His is the face of critically unpopular comedies that earn repeat viewings and loyalty from “normal” people. Whether or not <em>Billy Madison</em> is actually good – it’s pretty good, really!– its true importance lies in setting up Sandler’s ball before he spiked it one year later. </p></div><div><p>Only The Sandman in a Bruins jersey could turn the ninth hole into a house party. Adam Sandler’s star-making <em>Happy Gilmore</em> sees the actor as a would-be hockey phenom whose vicious slap shot makes him a natural for golf, but his presence in the sport draws the ire of buttoned-up pros. <em>Happy Gilmore</em> is an instance of material and talent synthesising in a way that feels like fate as Sandler’s abrasive dude persona make him the perfect underdog antihero over manicured turf. Between Carl Weathers as his mentor and Bob Barker as his sworn enemy, Sandler’s undisputed classic brought new meaning to fore-play. </p></div><div><p>If Adam Sandler has one perfect romantic comedy, it’s easily <em>The Wedding Singer</em>. With microphone gripped in his fist, Sandler flip-flops between charismatic cat and pathetic crooner in this delightful ‘80s nostalgia period piece, in which Sandler’s mulleted romantic lead is a heartbroken wedding (and later, bar mitzvah) singer who is left at the altar. That’s when Drew Barrymore shows up as a client, inspiring Sandler to steal her away from her unfaithful fiance before her big day. A Mousse’d up Sandler is a pure charmer, even when he’s ruining some other poor bride’s festivities with his depressing soliloquies. </p></div><div><p>It’s a family affair for the Sandlers in <em>You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah</em>, a late-stage Sandler joint that is implausibly one of his best-ever In this electric coming-of-age comedy for Netflix, Adam Sandler plays a supporting role as Danny Friedman, patriarch of the Friedmans whose youngest daughter Stacy (Sunny Sandler) is gearing up for her monumental day. Naturally, the movie’s main focus is on the comically petty drama between its youthful characters. But Papa Sandler is just being a good dad in letting his kids relish the spotlight.</p></div><div><p>Though he plays a fast food-gorging NBA scout, Adam Sandler is locked in as Stanley Sugerman, whose future in professional basketball rests on an unproven dark horse from the streets of Spain, Bo Cruz (Juancho Hernangómez, who in real life played for teams like the Denver Nuggets, Boston Celtics, and Toronto Raptors). Tapping into the same well of risk-it-all agents of chaos that made his role in <em>Uncut Gems</em> acclaimed, Sandler puts on a measured performance that reveals how much you can still win even from the bench.</p></div><div><p>Noah Baumbach’s smart, punchy family drama <em>The Meyerowitz Stories </em>chronicles the lives of adult siblings who suffer under the shadow of their moderately successful artist father (Dustin Hoffman). Adam Sandler is the eldest and the resident loose cannon, Danny Meyerowitz, whose labored gait and nervous energy puts him in contrast with his waifish hippie sister (Emma Thompson) and self-made financier Matthew (Ben Stiller). Sandler is in fine shape in Baumbach’s picture, his workwear wardrobe emphasizing his rough edges. </p></div><div><p>When it seemed like Adam Sandler was a one-note performer, director Paul Thomas Anderson proved otherwise with his acclaimed surrealist picture <em>Punch-Drunk Love</em>. Sandler takes charge as socially inept, often shy business owner Barry Egan, who is eternally drowned out by the overbearing presence of his many sisters. Barry’s life changes when he falls for one of his sister’s coworkers (Emily Watson) and becomes the victim to an extorting phone sex operator. For the first time in his career, Sandler drops the loud voices and manbaby screaming and reveals an infinitely more thoughtful and careful side to his artistry, anchoring a film that revels in the expanse of one’s loneliness.</p></div><div><p>The term “white-knuckle thriller” was made for movies like <em>Uncut Gems</em>. After years of flailing around in mediocre studio comedies, Adam Sandler went to the dark side in his role as Howard Ratner, a Diamond District player whose toxic gambling addiction escalates into violence. The Safdie Brothers give Sandler carte blanche to run wild as a bespectacled agent of chaos, whose ring-studded fingers and obnoxious gold Rolexes can’t shield him from others’ aggressions. Whether or not <em>Uncut Gems</em> is actually Adam Sandler’s best movie, it’s without question one of his best performances, forcing us to acknowledge that Hollywood’s biggest clown is in his own ways a king.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Additionally, the introduction of the new Focus Mode mechanic and the implementation of seamless movement between settlements and ecosystems have provided an even more immersive gaming experience, while the fusion of numerous new elements with <em>Monster Hunter</em>‘s appeal has generated significant excitement, all of which led to the company first-month sales record of over 10 million units sold.
