              <p><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s story missions <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-campaign-canceled-blizzard-1851345720">never arrived</a>, but the original had a few <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-pve-canceled-campaign-null-sector-2000641177">cooperative missions</a> that further explored the hero shooter’s world and heroes. One of these was called </span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatchs-new-pve-event-is-its-best-yet-1825183663">Retribution</a>,</span></i><span> and it starred Reaper, Cassidy, Genji, and Moira as members of Blackwatch, Overwatch’s covert operatives arm. At the beginning of the mission, Reaper kills a man named Antonio Bartalotti, a criminal and member of the chaos-seeding Talon organization. This assassination sets up the mission players fight through, as well as the eventual downfall of the Overwatch organization, but as we learned today, over seven years later, it was also a canon event for </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s next hero, Vendetta.</span></p>  <p><span>Blizzard has released a new animated trailer titled La Lupa which shows Vendetta, a new, sword-wielding hero, fighting a massive Omnic in Colosseo to the tune of hundreds of less-than-adoring fans. In her voiceover, she’s talking to her Papa who taught her how to outsmart her opponents, whether that be in Chess or in a coliseum. Then the trailer reveals that her father was none other than Antonio. So now, after all those years, Vendetta has…a vendetta against the members of Blackwatch. That organization is defunct, though, so I guess she’s taking out all her frustrations on robots in the coliseum.</span></p> <p><span>We don’t see any gameplay of Vendetta in action, but she does seem to be one of the rare melee heroes in </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s roster. She’s built like a tank, so she might fall into that role, but we’ll know for sure soon since Blizzard is holding a trial run for the character from November 6 to December 1. Vendetta will officially join the roster in Season 20 on December 9.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hypixel Studios is back, and they have brought an old friend along with it. On Monday, founder Simon Collins-Laflamme announced that they had reacquired the rights to sandbox game Hytale from Riot Games.</p>



<p>The news comes roughly five months since it was announced that the game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-shuts-down-hypixel-studios-cancels-hytale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being shut down</a>.</p>







<p>“We are thrilled to announce that we have acquired Hytale from Riot Games,” Collins-Laflamme said. “While it didn’t make sense for them to continue developing it in its existing form, they ultimately wanted what’s best for players, and that’s for us to eventually play a revised version of the game. We are grateful to Riot Games for making this possible.”</p>



<p>Collins-Laflamme said that the studio has hired “more than 30 developers who know this game inside and out, with additional returns in the coming days.”</p>



<p>He says that the team is going to go back to the original version of what Hytale was supposed to be. It was added that the studio is fully independent and committed to funding Hytale “for the next 10 years”.</p>







<p>As far as what’s next, an Early Access release and pricing will be announced “in the coming days”. It’ll be available first on Windows with a Mac and Linux release possible and other platforms later on. Regarding content, the Early Access version of Hytale will include a Creative Mode, Exploration Mode, and Modding capabilities. What won’t be available are minigames and an Adventure Mode. Both of those will come later on.</p>

Kennedy will appear in the game, by branding a particular image as "fake news."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom continues to promote the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> as a new entry in the series starring fresh protagonist Grace Ashcroft, though has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-s-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-as-fan-speculation-swirls-around-whether-hes-still-secretly-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem">never explicitly stated that she is the sole playable character</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, when IGN sat down with Capcom at Gamescom 2025 in August, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-resident-evil-requiem-interview-why-the-games-monster-got-supersized-why-its-probably-not-lisa-trevor-and-a-tease-for-areas-beyond-raccoon-city-just-dont-talk-about-leon">we were told that its staff members would not discuss any internet rumors of certain other characters appearing</a>. But now, in an interview with <a href="https://stevivor.com/features/interviews/resident-evil-requiem-interview-leon-is-fake-news-no-demo-and-how-outbreak-fits-in" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stevivor</a>, producer Masato Kumazawa has at least acknowleged the ongoing speculation — and confirmed one particular image is a fan creation. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil fans have recently been debating the veracity of an image shared widely on social media that features an older Leon with an eyepatch. Many had suggested the picture was likely AI-generated, and now, addressing this image specifically, Kumazawa has described it as "fake news."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Apart from any official information that Capcom has released, the rest is more [fan] detective work," Kumazawa said. "So I would suggest to please not take everything at face value. Considering that now is the time when AI [can be used to make] videos and photos, we don't know what's right or what's wrong. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Players are free to believe what they would like to believe," he continued, "what I'd like to tell is that, please, unless it's officially released from Capcom, we can't give you any confirmation."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Looking at this again, I think this leaked image of RE9 Leon is fake. The pupil in his eye is missing. The eyepatch is blurred and out of place. The hair strands is painted on. 🤔 <a href="https://t.co/KT43m1NOU2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/KT43m1NOU2</a></p>— Paintixir (VGen) (@Paintixir) <a href="https://twitter.com/Paintixir/status/1969201826542067884?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Another recent source of discussion among Resident Evil fans is the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-deluxe-edition-includes-lady-dimitrescu-costume-for-grace-preorders-get-apocalypse-costume">labelling of DLC costumes for Grace Ashcroft found within the game's deluxe edition</a>. This pricier package advertises the fact it contains five additional costumes total, though only a couple for Grace have so far been showcased. As well as that, each in-game item is labelled with the "Grace's Costume:" prefix, something fans have excitedly suggested means that more costumes for other characters (Leon) are being held back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There has been a photo lately of Leon with an eyepatch, and just basically saying there's a DLC or a new costume for Leon," Kumazawa stated, "but just to make sure, these are all fake news."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once again, however, Capcom appears to have stopped short of saying Leon isn't in the game — and at this point, if he wasn't, you'd think its developers would want to set the record straight in order to start managing expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 27, 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S — whether it includes Leon or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

<p dir="ltr">They also feature persistent lobbies from match to match that, when combined with Quick Play, results in what Treyarch states are "unique interactions that we are monitoring to improve over time."</p><p dir="ltr">The decision to not include SBMM has been a major discussion point for Black Ops 7, after years of calls for it to be removed by some vocal players, not only in Call of Duty but in other shooters as well. Ubisoft's short-lived <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/as-call-of-duty-continues-attracting-skill-based-matchmaking-complaints-xdefiant-goes-in-a-different-direction/1100-6523492/" data-ref-id="1100-6523492">XDefiant looked to capitalize on its lack of SBMM</a>. Call of Duty's main rival this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-matchmaking-does-not-prioritize-skill/1100-6533896/" data-ref-id="1100-6533896">Battlefield 6, does use SBMM to some extent</a>, but also factors in a player's location, ping, and server availability when putting together a match.</p><p dir="ltr">While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/some-black-ops-7-multiplayer-playlists-will-have-sbmm-but-most-wont/1100-6536138/" data-ref-id="1100-6536138">most modes and playlists in Black Ops 7 multiplayer don't use SBMM</a>, there are a few that do. Those include a rotating Moshpit playlist and the game's ranked mode.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 received its latest patch on November 16, which fixed exploits in the Ashes of the Damned Zombies map, issues related to custom loadouts when using Spanish as the in-game language, and a bug that saw selected game modes in the Quick Play filter sometimes become inverted.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Black Ops 7 news, Activision confirmed in a statement that its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-developers-used-ai-tools-but-creative-process-is-led-by-humans-activision-says/1100-6536232/" data-ref-id="1100-6536232">developers do use AI tools</a>, but that "our creative process continues to be led by the talented individuals in our studios" amidst players accusing Black Ops 7 of using AI to generate artwork for Calling Cards. The game's Steam page also discloses that AI was used to develop some in-game assets.</p><p dir="ltr">In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review/1900-6418441/" data-ref-id="1900-6418441">Black Ops 7 review</a>, reviewer S.E. Doster called the game's multiplayer package "a fresh experience that avoids any dreaded fatigue," while its co-op campaign "is not one of Treyarch's strongest campaigns" despite some strong emotional character moments that tie back to Black Ops 2.</p>

                <p>Last month Xbox president Sarah Bond confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-reconfirms-next-gen-xbox-hardware-is-in-development/1100-6535554/" data-ref-id="1100-6535554">Microsoft is developing a next-gen Xbox console</a>. Bond has reiterated that statement several times as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-reconfirms-next-gen-xbox-hardware-is-in-development/1100-6535554/" data-ref-id="1100-6535554">Microsoft faces rumors</a> that it's getting out of the hardware business. Now, Bond is once again hyping up the next incarnation of Xbox by calling it "a powerful experience."</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P0bOAWNVR4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fortune</a>, Bond said, "Hardware is absolutely core to everything that we do at Xbox, because we know that our most valuable players, the people who love Xbox, love the hardware experience. That's why we’re working on our next-generation hardware. It's going to be a powerful experience, and one that also enables people to take their library with them."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P0bOAWNVR4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3P0bOAWNVR4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Bond shared her belief that players want the freedom to choose to play their games on Xbox, PC, or the cloud, and that the next Xbox will give them the option to do so. She <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-will-be-high-end-with-a-curated-experience-xbox-president-says/1100-6535604/" data-ref-id="1100-6535604">made similar comments</a> while promoting the ROG Xbox Ally in October.</p><p>Although it's been expected that PlayStation 6 and the next Xbox will debut in 2027, a video game analyst has suggested that the recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-569323">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> delay <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps6-and-next-xbox-may-not-release-until-2028-due-to-gta-6-delay-expert-says/1100-6536134/" data-ref-id="1100-6536134">could push both consoles to a 2028 debut</a>.

There has also been a strong response to the ROG Xbox Ally, which has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/asus-to-ramp-up-rog-xbox-ally-production-after-initial-sales-exceed-expectations/1100-6536270/" data-ref-id="1100-6536270">led Asus to increase production</a> for the handheld system.</p><p>Microsoft will host a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-showcase-coming-up-this-week/1100-6536277/" data-ref-id="1100-6536277">Xbox Partner Preview</a> on November 20, but it's not expected to have any news related to the next-gen Xbox console.</p>

<figure data-uuid="cb5b5a86655b2"><a title="Zelda Movie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cb5b5a86655b2/zelda-movie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has officially lifted the lid on the live-action looks for Zelda and Link in the upcoming Zelda movie with a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/official-zelda-movie-photos-give-us-our-best-look-yet-at-link-and-zelda">trio of official photos</a> (compared to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/rumour-zelda-movie-production-set-footage-has-supposedly-leaked-online">leaked 'on-set' footage</a> that appeared online days before).</p>
<p>We've got our first look at Benjamin Evan Ainsworth's Link and Bo Bragason's Princess Zelda in their full Hylian garb, and while it's far from a detailed look at either, there's no denying that some video game inspo has gone into the design choices — who would have thought it!</p>
<p>Kicking things off with the Hero of Hyrule himself, and we're not the only ones getting some serious <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/legend_of_zelda_twilight_princess">Twilight Princess</a> vibes from his look, are we? The dark green tunic is a series staple — with some exceptions, obvs — but that cream undershirt paired with the leather fingerless gloves and cross-body strap has a strong whiff of the shape-shifting grittiness we first saw back in 2006.</p>
<p>We can't make out any chainmail from this first look, mind you, <em>and</em> the signature hat is missing, so we'll throw in a <em>little</em> mention for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a> Champion's Tunic while we're here. Sure, it's green instead of blue, but the detailing around the collar gives a certain Switch-y flare to the whole thing.</p>

<p>Zelda's live-action reimagining isn't quite as clean-cut in its game inspirations as Link's, but the blue dress is straight out of the BOTW/<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">TOTK</a> lookbook. It's missing some of the elements that really made those designs <em>pop</em> — the white and gold detailing, the chunkiness of the belt, <em>the cape</em> (in TOTK's case) — but the colour palette certainly presents a more modern look for the princess than the classic pink ballgowns of old.</p>

<p>Of course, a feature-length runtime means that there will likely be plenty of room for different looks besides those we've seen in today's snaps, but we're pretty impressed with this initial glance — even if we do wish that Zelda's get-up was a <em>little</em> more detailed.</p>
<p>The big question is, what do you make of these live-action looks? You can let us know in the following polls, but then take to the comments to share what you like, and what you'd change.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prologue-go-wayback">Prologue: Go Wayback</a> is due out in early access later this week, and ahead of that developer PlayerUnknown Productions laid out a little roadmap of updates you can expect in the coming… months? They didn't specify, which isn't necessarily a bad thing - I think setting expectations of when certain features may arrive encourages a more demanding audience - but they did give a good overview of what's to come.
</p>
<p>
Starting things off is a list of plans for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game's world and environment, which primarily focus on adding "realism, scale, and cohesion to the world." Namely, that includes things like paths and trails that are clearer in how you're meant to navigate them, alongside river systems with "source, tributaries, rapids, and deltas, bringing new movement and life to the world." Eat your heart out, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcS1HIci4hQ">Any Austin</a>. 
</p>
<p>
And there's also plans for more varied settlements, alongside water that freezes and thaws depending on the weather and season. That one sounds quite neat! I feel like the effects of weather is a thing that many games still don't get quite right yet, hopefully something systems driven like this can have a good crack at it.
</p>
<p>
On the gameplay side of things, there's plans to expand on the game's building system, to add in new ingredients and recipes, make it so that you might need batteries or to repair a power system, and to make it so that clothing can degrade over time, but be fixed too.
</p><p>
More miscellaneously, the <a href="https://playerunknownproductions.net/news/prologue-go-wayback-early-access-roadmap">roadmap</a> also outlines its intention to add in full controller support, Steam Deck support, an in-game camera mode, and for the streamer out there, Twitch integration that allows viewers to mess with spawns and other bits. More ambitiously (and I question whether this will be the game's downfall), the game will also let you build your own worlds, rules, maps, and experiences to share with others. Not everything needs to have user-generated bits, but Prologue: Go Wayback will have them whether it needs them or not.
</p>
<p>
You'll be able to pick up Prologue: Go Wayback when it enters early access November 20th.

              <p><span>The CEO of the studio behind </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251"><i><span>Helldivers 2</span></i></a><span>, the wildly successful third-person shooter that recently came to Xbox, weighed in on the video game industry’s increasing use of AI and how he believes it “actually makes gaming better.”</span></p> <p><span>As reported by </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-boss-argues-arc-raiders-ai-use-actually-makes-gaming-better-and-that-people-jump-to-extreme-takes-about-the-tech-surely-theres-a-middle-ground-here/"><i><span>GamesRadar</span></i></a><span>, Arrowhead Game Studios CEO Shams Jorjani was on an episode of </span><a href="https://youtu.be/AyVTlQR__ZU?si=JJHjmoQPGIj-Fb5v&amp;t=1561"><span>The Game Business Show</span></a><span> when the conversation shifted to the use of AI in game development. The host, Christopher Dring, brought up the “industry moment” around </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span>, the recently released extraction shooter that’s been a breakout hit for developer Embark Studios, and the center of a conversation around using AI in game development.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>For Jorjani, opinions on the controversial topic are too black and white. “Maybe, could it be, that reality is somewhere in the middle? Could it be?” he asked. He believes that, rather than developers using AI to “remove the stuff we don’t want to do,” people jump to “let’s never actually use AI, all AI is bad AI.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“We don’t put any AI in the games,” Jorjani says. “But if it can allow me to do my receipts faster, that’s more </span><i><span>Helldivers</span></i><span> for everyone.”</span></p> <p><span>It was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-gen-ai-nexon-eurogamer-voices-2000643436"><span>recently revealed that Embark hired voice actors for </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i></a><span>, then used AI to flesh out in-game voice lines rather than having “someone come in every time we create a new line for the game,” according to an </span><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/generative-ai-use"><span>interview with </span><i><span>PCGamesN</span></i></a><span>. This sparked a heated debate about the use of AI in game development and even negatively </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review"><span>affected </span><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i><span>’s review of the game</span></a><span> (which awarded it two out of five stars).&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“I find that people jump to extreme takes,” Jorjani says of the response to </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span>’ AI use. “I think it’s a very interesting use case that actually makes gaming better.”</span></p> <h2><b>The AI game development controversy continues</b></h2> <p><span>But as Dring brings up during the interview, Square Enix recently revealed it wants to eventually have 70 percent of its quality assurance work done by AI. QA work often serves as an entry-level role in game development, and this could be a huge hit to the industry’s workforce, which is one of the main points of contention people have with implementing AI.</span></p>

 <p><span>Junghun Lee, the CEO of Nexton Co. Ltd (which published </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span>), said in a </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-sparks-debate-over-ai-voice-acting-in-games/1100-6536146/"><span>November 12 interview</span></a><span> with </span><a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/10/159294.html"><span>Japanese gaming site </span><i><span>Gamespark</span></i></a> <span>that “</span><span>it’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI.” But with the video game industry plagued with layoffs and studio closures, what does that mean for the future of its workforce?</span></p>

 <p><span>The ideological split is only widening. Brendan Green, the creator of the wildly successful battle royale </span><i><span>PUBG</span></i><span>, told </span><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i><span> he was “really heartened to see the community revolt against AI stuff.” </span><i><span>PUBG</span></i><span> is published by South Korean company Krafton, which </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-south-korean-publisher-krafton-announced-its-transforming-into-an-ai-first-company-its-now-offering-employees-voluntary-resignation"><span>recently announced a massive “AI-first” mandate</span></a><span> for the entire company while also announcing the option for employees to voluntarily resign if they felt they were not in line with its “direction of change.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Elsewhere, </span><i><span>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </span></i><span>publisher Activision </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ai-art-activision-statement-blops7-steam-ps5-2000644397"><span>recently came under fire for using AI-generated content</span></a><span> for some of its artwork. “Like so many around the world, we use a variety of digital tools, including AI tools, to empower and support our teams to create the best gaming experiences possible for our players. Our creative process continues to be led by the talented individuals in our studios,” Activision told</span><i><span> Kotaku</span></i><span> on November 14.</span></p> <p><span>AI in game development seems to be here to stay, but just how it will be utilized going forward, and how developers, voice actors, and players will feel about it, remains to be seen.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Less than a decade after the original animated <em>Moana</em> hit theaters, Disney has released the first real trailer for its upcoming live-action remake, and folks, it doesn’t look great.</p> <p>On November 17, Disney released the first official teaser trailer for its live-action remake of <em>Moana</em>. Starring Catherine Lagaʻaia as the titular Moana and Dwayne Johnson reprising his role as demigod Maui, the remake appears to be a nearly shot-for-shot recreation of the original 2016 animated movie. Here’s the trailer:</p>  <p>I know this isn’t an original complaint, but it continues to be wild how many of <a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-lion-king-the-little-mermaid-cinderella-1851767126">these live-action Disney remakes</a> barely look like live-action films at all. <em>Moana</em> might not be completely CG like the “live-action” <em>Lion King</em> remake, but boy howdy does a lot of this movie look like an Unreal Engine fan-game based on the original movie and not a film starring real people in real places. And when we do see real people, they almost look out of place.</p>

 <p>One scene in particular, involving Maui jumping off a cliff, looks so artificial and crappy that if you showed that to me without any context and said it was created by some AI tool, I’d probably believe you. And while some shots, like the one involving a whale and some boats, look better, I’m still not convinced this won’t be a mess. And making the chicken fully CG is boring and strange. Give me a real chicken, damn it!</p> <p>It was around this time last year that <a href="https://kotaku.com/snow-white-seven-dwarfs-trailer-cgi-ugly-bad-disney-1851712570">Disney fully revealed the <em>Snow White</em> remake and its horrific-looking dwarves.</a> That movie ended up being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_films#:~:text=nb%201%5D-,22,%5B22%5D,-23">a very expensive flop</a> for the Mickey Mouse company, <a href="https://kotaku.com/tangled-remake-canceled-paused-snow-white-disney-flop-1851774677">reportedly leading to at least one live-action film being shelved</a>. However, this year’s <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> remake was <a href="https://kotaku.com/lilo-stitch-remake-live-action-box-office-record-mi8-1851782470?_gl=1*8vfk2q*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTA5NDQ3NTYkbzE1MCRnMSR0MTc1MDk1NTM2NiRqMTQkbDAkaDA.">a massive hit</a> for Disney, so I don’t expect the company to stop plundering its treasure trove of famous animated movies and <a href="https://kotaku.com/lilo-and-stitch-2-sequel-announced-teaser-disney-626-1851785144">turning them into live-action slop anytime soon</a>.&nbsp;We’ll see how well this new version of <em>Moana</em> does at the box office when it arrives in theaters on July 10, 2026.</p>

<p>The 'Game of the Year' category is pretty predictable, all things considered, but it's nevertheless nice to see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> get some recognition. That said, there's some stiff competition this year, and we think it's probably likely that <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, which gained a record-breaking 12 nominations, will probably take home the award.</p>
<p>Otherwise, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> gets a nod in the 'Best Sports / Racing Game' and 'Best Family Game' categories, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a>, which has been torn apart for its lacklustre online gameplay, still managed to bag a nomination for 'Best Fighting Game'.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytfMx2XNyAq4E" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4vozkgu&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-have-been-revealed-clair-obscur-stuns-with-12-nominations.1356055/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Ahead of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-will-stream-on-amazon-prime-video-for-first-time/">the show on December 11, 2025,</a> Geoff Keighley and The Game Awards team revealed the full list of nominees for the 2025 Game Awards, including the games up for the show's most significant award, Game of the Year (though <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/tgas-game-of-the-year-2025-nominees-have-leaked.1355809/">the nominees for Game of the Year did unfortunately leak ahead of the reveal</a>). </p>



<p>Some years, the nomination count is tight between the few games favourited to win the big Game of the Year prize, with only one or two nominations differentiating them from their closest competition. This is not one of those years, as Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is the runaway leader with 12 nominations total across each of the categories.</p>



<p>It's worth noting that three of those nominations are all for performances by actors in the game, though even removing those three, they're still above the next closest titles, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach and Ghost of Yotei, which are both tied with seven nominations each.</p>



<p>The next closest game is Hades 2, which earned six nominations, followed by Hollow Knight Silksong with five, Split Fiction with four, and despite making it into the Game of the Year nominees, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 only walked away with three nominations (including GOTY).</p>



<p>It's not the only GOTY nominee with a low nomination count, though, as Donkey Kong Bananza eeked its way into the nominees for GOTY, but only received one other nomination for Best Family Game.</p>



<p>As far as recent releases making the list, two interesting points stand out. One is that Marvel's Deadpool VR was nominated for Best VR/AR Game, though it's not officially out until tomorrow, November 18, 2025. The other is Dispatch, which made its way into the Best Debut Indie list after having just released the final episode of its eight-episode arc on November 12. </p>



<p>Voting is now officially open for The Game Awards 2025, and <a href="https://thegameawards.com/">you can go to the official website to cast your vote</a>. Here's the full list of nominees for the 2025 Game Awards:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Call of Duty</em> players are seeing SBMM ghosts in<em> Black Ops 7</em>. Capcom reassures investors about <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>‘s day-one performance on PC. And Stalker 2 is getting a big upgrades on the eve of its one-year anniversary and arrival on PlayStation 5. Welcome to the latest edition of <del>Morning</del> Afternoon Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. The Game Awards 2025 nominees <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">have dropped</a> and <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is leading the way, including in the Best Indie Game category. It deserves a ton of accolades but <a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-game-awards-iga-igf-gdc-clair-obscur-expedition-33-2000644070">probably not that one</a>.</p> <h2>The next Xbox will take players’ game libraries beyond the console</h2> <p>That’s what Xbox president Sarah Bond indicated in a new interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P0bOAWNVR4">with <em>Fortune</em></a>. Here’s what she said:</p> <blockquote><p><span>We are working on our next-generation hardware. It’s going to be a powerful experience, and one that also enables people to take their library with them, and that’s what’s really important here as well, is that we know that while people want to play their library absolutely on the console, they also want to be able to play it on PC or stream it around the cloud.</span> <span>And so the Xbox experience starts with the console but then gives something to people that they can experience across all screens if they choose to, bringing their library, their community, their identity, and the store with them everywhere they go.</span></p></blockquote> <p>Does that mean the next Xbox will be a handheld? Will this portability come from a unified account across console and PC? Or is Microsoft relying on cloud computing and AI to make this all into a seamless experience? Whatever the solution, it will need to bring generations of backwards-compatible Xbox games along with it. Is this a big bet on Microsoft’s gaming future, or the last gasp as it pivots away from consumer tech more broadly?</p>

 <p>Bond <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-podcast-consoles-handheld-hardware-next-gen-1851261822">previously promised</a> the next-gen Xbox would be the biggest technological leap for its consoles yet.</p>  <h2>Capcom promises <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> won’t be as busted as <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> on PC</h2> <p>The question came up during the company’s <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1990370536753447333">latest investor briefing</a>, and the company&nbsp;explained why <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>‘ ongoing PC troubles shouldn’t be a problem for its next big blockbuster. “<em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> differs from <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> in terms of gameplay, system architecture, and network features,” the company <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/2nd/explanation_2025_2nd_02.pdf">said</a>. “At present, we do not anticipate similar risks. We are developing the game to provide a smooth gaming experience across a wide range of PC specifications.”</p>

 <h2>It took zero days for <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> players to start complaining about SBMM again</h2> <p>Treyarch has tried to confirm, for what feels <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-blops-7-sbmm-muiltiplayer-matchmaking-2000633695">like the dozenth time</a>, how matchmaking works in the latest entry. “Quick Play uses the same Open Matchmaking, where skill is minimally considered,” the studio announced over the weekend. That’s led fans to focus on what exactly “minimally considered” means. Some feel the matchmaking isn’t as “open” as it felt during the beta. Others argue that’s because the beta was free and now the skill floor for launch, where people actually paid for the game, is higher. SBMM trutherism lives on.</p>

 <h2><em>City: Skylines 2</em> gets new developer with console port still MIA</h2> <p>“After more than a decade of successful collaboration across numerous titles that we’re both immensely proud of, Paradox Interactive and Colossal Order have mutually decided to pursue independent paths,” the publisher <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/an-update-on-cities-skylines-ii.1873154/">announced</a> on Monday. “The decision was made thoughtfully and in the interest of both teams – ensuring the strongest possible future for the <em>Cities: Skylines</em> franchise.”</p>

 <p>Colossal Order will handle a few more updates before the franchise is fully moved over to internal Paradox team Iceflake Studios. The shift comes after a terrible launch period for the sequel and has left fans wondering what the city builder’s future will be, from new expansions to the <a href="https://kotaku.com/cities-skylines-2-bloodlines-2-prison-architect-2-delay-1851668058">long-delayed arrival</a> of the console port. The game still sits at a rating of mixed on Steam.</p>

The result should be fewer dumb moments and more clever, emergent storytelling. Factions should also feel more lifelike.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re planning to start a podcast, improve your livestreams, or just want to sound decent on Zoom calls, you need a high-quality microphone in your setup. Most high-end options on the market often sit above $100, but thanks to early Black Friday deals, that’s not the case today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5639/">You can currently grab the Logitech for Creators Blue Yeti USB microphone for just $85 on Amazon.</a> That’s after a nice $55 discount on its retail price of $140. This offer applies to the silver model, but the pink and blue versions are also discounted, going for $100 and $105, respectively.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5639/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Custom Patterns for Different Recording Needs</h2>
<p>This mic delivers Blue’s signature broadcast-quality sound with a custom three-capsule array. It delivers clear, powerful, yet balanced sound for gaming, streaming podcasts, and even your calls. You can choose between four preset patterns (cardioid, omni, bidirectional, and stereo) to record exactly the way you need for any setup. Filming a heart-to-heart for your YouTube family? Go with cardioid for focused audio. Hosting an interview? The bidirectional pattern should do the job well!</p>
<p>The mic also comes with onboard controls that let you quickly adjust the volume, pick a pattern, mute, and more right there from the microphone itself. This is especially great for when you need to take a quick break between recordings and don’t want to bother with complicated software settings. Just hit a button and you’re all set. To further fine-tune your recordings, you can use the Blue VO!CE program for editing them. This platform lets you add vocal effects, modulation, and sound samples, but you will need to install the Logitech G Hub to access it.</p>



<p>Setting everything up and getting started is simple. The plug-and-play setup means you can just hook it up to your PC or laptop via USB and start recording right away. Best of all, the desktop stand itself is adjustable, so you can always find the right angle to record without needing any extra accessories.</p>
<p>All-in-all, if you’ve been looking for a way to improve the sound quality of your recordings, this microphone can be a great addition to your setup. It’s not just easy to use, but also offers impressive sound and plenty of customization options without making things unnecessarily complicated. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5639/">Thanks to early Black Friday deals, you can grab it without paying the full $140 price.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Arrowhead Games Studio’s CEO recently commented on a possible Switch 2 port for Helldivers 2, stating ‘We’ll see’. </p>



<p>It is no secret that Helldivers 2’s port to Xbox has <span>significantly helped the game, with the developers revealing that the new platform has&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-xbox-port-helped-increase-ps5-and-pc-sales/" target="_blank">increased</a></span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-xbox-port-helped-increase-ps5-and-pc-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> sales and engagement</a> for the PC and PS5 versions of the game. So that sets a precedent for Helldivers 2 to be released on another platform, but the developers haven’t officially confirmed anything yet. </p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-on-switch-2-could-be-a-possibility">Helldivers 2 on Switch 2 Could be a Possibility?  </h2>



<p>The comments on Helldivers 2 coming to Switch 2 came through the latest episode of the Game Business Show on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyVTlQR__ZU&amp;t=558s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> (via <a href="https://gamerant.com/helldivers-2-switch-2-port-ceo-response/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Rant</a>), where Christopher Dring interviewed Shams Jorjani, Arrowhead CEO. During this interview, Dring jokingly spoke about waiting for a ‘Switch 2 version’ for the game, to which Jorjan responded, stating, “We’ll see, we’ll see. That’s again, above my pay grade by a couple of tiers.”</p>

</p></figure>



<p>We already know that the Xbox port worked wonders for the game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-sold-more-on-xbox-than-playstation-in-the-first-six-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling more on the new platform</a> than PlayStation in the first six days. However, will Helldivers 2 be able to find a similar kind of success on Switch 2, that is not yet known. At the same time, the developers are currently hard at work to optimise the game, working not only to address several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-devs-comment-on-installation-size-and-load-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">performance issues</a> but also to decrease the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-devs-comment-on-installation-size-and-load-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">install size and improve load times</a>. </p>

<p>The nominees for The Game Awards 2025 have been announced. For more than a decade, the show, hosted by Geoff Keighley, celebrates the year’s best games and highlights the future of the industry. With 2025 being as great a year for game releases, there were already some tight competition. Now, we know just what stood out for outlets and the judges.</p>







<p>All of the categories were voted on by a panel of judges from various outlets. The winners are mostly chosen by that group, but fans can vote for their favorites on the site as well. However, the biggest category that’s fully fan-voted is Player’s Voice. Nominations for the category will be announced at a later date. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-winner-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Last year</a>, Astro Bot won Game of the Year, with Metaphor: ReFantazio and Balatro winning several awards as well.</p>



<p>You can check out the full list of 2025’s nominees below, courtesy of&nbsp;<a href="https://thegameawards.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Awards</a>.

And while some one-off, full-price titles were continuing to be successful, these had become "a few notable exceptions" to the wider trend, it continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The remarks come amid a continued period of uncertainty for Ubisoft, which has suffered layoffs and a sizable corporate restructure in the past year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>For well over a decade now, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/73010/Cities_in_Motion/"><em>Cities</em> franchise</a> has done its best to pick up the urban simulation ball that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/03/simcity-one-week-later-time-doesnt-heal-all-wounds/">EA’s <em>SimCity</em> famously dropped</a>. Going forward, though, that ball will be handed off from longtime developer Colossal Order to Finnish studio <a href="https://www.iceflake.com/">Iceflake</a> (a subsidiary of <em>Cities</em> publisher Paradox Interactive).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/an-update-on-cities-skylines-ii.1873154/">surprise announcement Monday morning</a> on Paradox’s official forums says that <em>Cities</em>‘ developer and publisher “mutually decided to pursue independent paths” without going into many details as to why. “The decision was made thoughtfully and in the interest of both teams—ensuring the strongest possible future for the <em>Cities: Skylines</em> franchise,” the announcement says.</p>
<p>“Both companies are excited for what the future holds while remaining deeply appreciative of our shared history and grateful to the <em>Cities</em>’ community,” the statement continues. Colossal Order “will work on new projects and explore new creative opportunities,” Paradox wrote in <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/studio-shift-frequently-asked-questions.1873693/">an accompanying FAQ</a>.</p>
<h2>A new mayor in town</h2>
<p>New&nbsp;<em>Cities</em>&nbsp;developer Iceflake was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/media/press-releases/press-release/paradox-interactive-acquires-finland-based-iceflake-studios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by Paradox in 2020</a>, shortly after the release of its post-apocalyptic survival/strategy game&nbsp;<em>Surviving the Aftermath</em>.&nbsp;That game has maintained <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/684450">a small but seemingly dedicated following on Steam</a>, thanks in part to updates and DLC that seem to be Iceflake’s main focus in the last few years.</p>
<p>Paradox writes that Iceflake is currently “hard at work getting into the nuts and bolts of <em>Cities: Skylines II</em>” and will be responsible for future free updates, expansions, and content packs for that game from the start of 2026 onward. Iceflake will also be working on the long-awaited console ports of <em>Skylines II</em>, which were originally planned to launch alongside the PC version in 2023.</p>

<section><p>The classic role-playing series has enjoyed massive popularity in Japan, but it’s time for Western gamers to finally experience this wonderful series.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Although Dragon Quest is one of the most popular game series in the East, it has never quite caught on in the West. Released under the banner of Square Enix, the series was often overshadowed by sister series Final Fantasy. While this never stopped any mainline entry from being released in the West (except for X, which is an MMO), I can’t help but feel that Dragon Quest never got the due it deserved. Its pedigree and influence is rooted in some of the earliest examples of role-playing games, and each game in the series utilizes that inspiration to craft a wonderful experience with mass appeal and its own ingenuity.. With all that said--and the recent release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake/" data-ref-id="5000-632913">Dragon Quest I &amp; II - HD-2D Remake</a>--it’s time for you to finally play Dragon Quest.</p><p>The case for playing Dragon Quest begins with the start of the RPG genre as a whole. When Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord released in 1981, it helped define what would later become known as the dungeon-crawler, a type of role-playing experience that asked players to form a party of various heroes with gear and venture into an unknown space to fight monsters and seek treasures. Wizardry streamlined the dice rolling and stat math of Dungeon &amp; Dragons and condensed it into video game form, allowing players to venture into the same peril of their tabletop on their glowing screens for the first time ever.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake – Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Ultima followed soon after, and took this new, streamlined version of tabletop role-playing games and added an explorable open world to the mix. What was once relegated to hexagonal graph paper and imagination was now fully playable in the digital realm of entertainment. Wizardry and Ultima were some of the first examples of what gamers everywhere would come to know as RPGs.</p><p>Wizardry and Ultima inspired Enix developer Yuji Horii to develop his own RPG for the Nintendo Famicom. Using an overworld map layout inspired by Ultima and the stat-based-command combat system of Wizardry, he set out to create his own version that would appeal to Japanese audiences.The resulting game, Dragon Quest, released in 1986.</p><p>With Dragon Quest, Japanese audiences were introduced to a setting inspired by swords and sorcery yet unique in its visual identity. A large part of this is due to Horii recruiting famed Dragon Ball artist and creator Akira Toriyama for the enemy and character designs, giving the game a unique fairy-tale feel as opposed to its Western contemporaries' darker aesthetic.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4602773-4501972-dq1_battle_pc.png" data-ref-id="1300-4602773" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4602773-4501972-dq1_battle_pc.png" data-ref-id="1300-4602773"></a><figcaption>A battle in Dragon Quest HD-2D Remake. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4602773-4501972-dq1_battle_pc.png"></figure><p>Dragon Quest (first released in the US as Dragon Warrior) follows a descendant from the legendary hero of Erdrick as they’re summoned to save the world from the evil Dragonlord, who seeks ultimate power. In the game, players traverse a diverse overworld as the lone hero, fighting monsters to gain the power needed to defeat the Dragonlord as they wander. The battle system plays out from a first-person perspective, and sees players select commands before watching them play out on screen, eventually leading to the end result of battle. This combat system would go on to serve not only as the foundation for the rest of the series, but as inspiration for many of the RPGs that would follow.</p><p>Not long after its release, Dragon Quest exploded in popularity in Japan, leading to speculation that Square Enix was not allowed to release an entry in the series on a weekday because of the amount of people who would inevitably call out sick or ditch school to play the newest installment.</p><p>Part of this popularity stemmed from the simple fact that each entry in the Dragon Quest series is consistent in ways that a series like Final Fantasy isn’t. Up until recently, the series has always had involvement from creator Yuji Horii, character designer Akira Toriyama, and composer Koichi Sugiyama. So whereas a series like Final Fantasy may change developers and subsequently falter or be less appealing aesthetic- or gameplay-wise from entry to entry, Dragon Quest maintains a distinct identity and high level of quality from entry to entry.</p><p>Dragon Quest also lends itself to episodic play, with narratives that often take place over a large span of time. Take, for example, Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age, where our heroes are put on a quest but don’t quite face world-threatening events until the narrative is closer to the finale. This allows the game to take its time introducing every character and backstory, but also allows players to take their time and experience all the stories and vignettes the world has to offer.</p><p>The series has also had an influence on other wildly popular series. For example, Dragon Quest is actually both the in-game and real-life reason that the Yakuza/Like A Dragon series has shifted to a turn-based RPG. Though often misattributed to Persona, protagonist Ichiban Kasuga makes it clear that Horii's iconic series is the driving influence as he states that, because Dragon Quest is his favorite video game of all time, he pictures every combat encounter as turn-based in his mind.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4602774-4249741-likeadragon_infinitewealth1_8_20246_50_49pm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602774" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4602774-4249741-likeadragon_infinitewealth1_8_20246_50_49pm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602774"></a><figcaption>A look at Yakuza: Like A Dragon's turn-based combat.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4602774-4249741-likeadragon_infinitewealth1_8_20246_50_49pm.jpg"></figure><p>Part of the reason I believe Dragon Quest hasn’t quite taken off in the West is because, for the longest time, the series was relegated to handheld and mobile devices. Whereas Final Fantasy always received big-budget console entries following the Square and Enix merger, Dragon Quest IV through VI got Nintendo DS North American debuts, Dragon Quest IX was a Nintendo DS exclusive, and Dragon Quest X skipped North America entirely. For the longest time, Dragon Quest VIII was the only mainline console entry post-merger.</p><p>But times have changed, and we live in a world where players might be seeking those classic RPG experiences. Fortunately, Square seems to be attempting to make it right. This past year, Dragon Quest III (arguably the most beloved entry in the series) received a full remake in the gorgeous 2D-HD style similar to Octopath Traveler. Last month, remakes of Dragon Quest and Dragon Quest II in the same style were released to critical acclaim. A brand-new installment, Dragon Quest XII, is currently in development, with Yuji Horii once again overseeing the project. Perhaps most exciting though is a full remake of Dragon Quest VII releasing soon with the “Reimagined” subtitle.</p><p>The seventh installment is notorious for being perhaps one of the longest RPGs of all time, but also features arguably the best story in the entire series. VII originally came out for the original PlayStation and had a remake on 3DS, but has never been rereleased otherwise. Reimagined looks to remain faithful to the original gameplay experience with much needed quality-of-life improvements, but also brings to life Toriyama’s beloved art style in ways that have not been done before, featuring in-game character models that are based on high-resolution scans of physical dolls made of the main cast of characters. It's a touch of love and care that the series doesn’t often get.</p><p>While other RPGs remain popular, there’s something endearing about the Dragon Quest series as a whole. Whether it’s the classic sword-and-sorcery aesthetics, the charming music and art style, or the more relaxed level of play, the series has found a way to endure. In a world where RPGs aim to be more complex and modern, there's a void in gaming that’s filled by the Dragon Quest games. It’s time you finally gave the series a chance and experienced the legend of one of gaming’s best role-playing games.</p>

                <p>Indie MMORPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ashes-of-creation/" data-ref-id="5000-702799">Ashes of Creation</a>, first announced in 2016, is finally coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4124950/Ashes_of_Creation/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. While the game once it fully launches won't have an upfront box cost, developer Intrepid Studios announced it will begin selling access to the game's alpha and beta tests for $50.</p><p dir="ltr">That's actually a discount, as alpha access currently costs $100 on the official Ashes of Creation <a href="https://ashesofcreation.com/shop" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">website</a>. Come December 11, however, that price will go down to $50 to coincide with the game's arrival on Steam.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGSoApuHbO0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/iGSoApuHbO0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Intrepid makes clear it doesn't have a specific end date for early access, but that following alpha testing, the game will move into two beta periods before releasing in full. Following early access, Ashes of Creation will require a monthly subscription to play.</p><p dir="ltr">Being in alpha, those who do pay $50 to test Ashes of Creation will experience "frequent updates and realm wipes, unstable builds, incomplete content, and ongoing balance adjustments," according to the game's Steam early-access FAQ.</p><p dir="ltr">"Early-access participants should approach this phase as a testing experience, not a finished product," Intrepid states.</p><p dir="ltr">Purchasing the early-access version of Ashes of Creation does come with a few other additions, including a cosmetic cloak and one month of game time for when the game does officially release. Intrepid is aiming for Ashes of Creation to be a "sandbox" MMORPG where the world will evolve and change alongside players, who will be able to build, defend, or destroy player-governed cities. In addition to large-scale PvP battles, Ashes of Creation will also feature dungeons and raids, as well as eight classes and nine races to choose from.</p><p dir="ltr">"Early-access players are not just testers--they're pioneers of Verra, helping us refine mechanics, uncover bugs, and shape the world's political, economic, and social dynamics," Intrepid states. "Every test helps us get closer to delivering an MMORPG where the world truly reacts to its players."</p><p dir="ltr">Ashes of Creation ran a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1791529601/ashes-of-creation-new-mmorpg-by-intrepid-studios" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kickstarter campaign</a> in 2017, where it raised over $3.2 million. Closed alpha testing began in 2021 for those who were willing to <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2021/05/01/ashes-of-creation-opens-500-alpha-one-package-on-may-5-shows-off-raid-boss-in-new-video/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pay $500</a> for the privilege. That same year, Intrepid announced Ashes of Creation would move from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5.</p><p dir="ltr">It's been a rough year for MMOs so far. NetEase just canceled two MMOs--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40k-mmo-canceled-by-marvel-rivals-publisher/1100-6536090/" data-ref-id="1100-6536090">one set in the Warhammer universe</a> and another called project Ghost led by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netease-shutters-mmo-studio-led-by-former-wow-veteran-after-two-years/1100-6535899/" data-ref-id="1100-6535899">former World of Warcraft veteran Greg Street</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Recent layoffs at Amazon have led to the end of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-world-aeternum-is-ending-new-content-after-season-10/1100-6535786/" data-ref-id="1100-6535786">active development on its MMO New World</a>, which once had more than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-world-passes-900000-concurrent-players-on-steam/1100-6496765/" data-ref-id="1100-6496765">900,000 concurrent players on Steam</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Last month, Not Knowing Software and Microprose confirmed that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/30/cleared-hot-has-got-an-early-access-release-date-for-november/">Cleared Hot</a> was going to be released on November 20th into early access. Today, the development team has released Cleared Hot’s early access roadmap, allowing players to see what content to expect and how updates will be delivered. No dates have been given aside from the release of Chapter 1 through Early Access, as the team will use community feedback to work on improvements before releasing additional content.</p>



<p>Cleared Hot Chapter 1 will give players access to the Texas biome and eight playable helicopters. This will be followed by Chapter 1b, adding side missions, another helicopter, improved controls, and helicopter skins. Chapter 2 is called Into the Jungle which will add the jungle biome, new enemies, and more customisation options for helicopters. This will be followed by Chapter 3, called The Final Chapter, which will see levels in the Arctic and urban areas. The release of Chapter 3 will also add Steam Trading cards and achievements. After that Cleared Hot will get its full 1.0 launch.</p>
<p>Cleared Hot will launch at a price of $14.99, with a 10% launch discount, but the price will rise as more content is added to the game. If you do not know about Cleared Hot, think of it as a new take on classics like Desert Strike and Jungle Strike.</p>

            <p>Sure, you could tease around the edges of generative AI videogame development, spitting out an Anno 117 loading screen here, belching out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a> NPC voice barks there, or you could just go the whole hog and hook your characters straight up to an LLM. What could possibly go wrong?</p>
<p>In related news, as reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/wuxia-mmo-where-winds-meet-is-full-of-ai-chatbot-npcs-and-people-are-doing-all-the-standard-obscene-stuff-to-them-i-made-him-think-that-my-character-was-pregnant-with-his-child/">cheery RPS fanzine PC Gamer</a>, players of Everstone Studios wuxia-themed RPG Where Winds Meet have got NPCs to provide them with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/comments/1oy22k0/you_can_chat_with_npcs_and_they_respond_as_an_ai/">cooking advice for potatoes and ketchup</a>, plan a travel itinerary for a trip to Beijing, and they've even <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/comments/1oxqhuz/anybody_else_mentally_break_the_zhao_dali_ai_just/">convinced one guard that they're pregnant with his baby</a>.</p>
<p>It turns out that when you interact with NPCs in the game, rather than be presented with set options of what to say to the characters, you instead have a chat box in which you're free to type whatever you please. Those lines then are sent off as a prompt to an LLM and then you receive a response somewhat tailored to fit the personality of the character which you're speaking to.</p>
<p>For instance, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/comments/1oy22k0/you_can_chat_with_npcs_and_they_respond_as_an_ai/">in one interaction shared on Reddit</a>, a player asks "What can I cook at home? I only have ketchup and potatoes". The NPC then replies, "(thinks for a moment, then suggests) You could make fried potatoes and use ketchup as a sauce. It's simple but can be quite tasty." When the player asks if ketchup was available during the Song dynasty, the NPC replies "No, ketchup wasn't available [...]. Tomatoes weren't known in China back then."</p><p>The interactions can lead to tangible outcomes, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/comments/1oyd1gw/been_waiting_for_games_to_use_ai_like_this_lol/">NPCs you anger kicking off fights</a> or increasing your reputation. Though, even then players are finding you don't need to act in good faith, instead simply implying positive actions can be recognised as such. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/comments/1oxoe11/comment/noz3ssv/">As one Reddit user points out</a>, if you see a hungry family, telling them "I'll give you food" results in a reputation gain, without needing to actually give them the item.</p>
<p>The players posting to Reddit seem to be happy with the use of AI, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/comments/1oz16tk/comment/npatqla/">one saying</a>, "THIS is how AI should be used in video games. Not to replace artists OR PROGRAMMERS but to have GOOD NPCS." Apparently replacing writers is just fine. As Nic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-a-future-where-you-and-this-bucket-that-fits-over-your-head-decide-what-a-game-meant-to-say-not-the-useless-idiots-that-made-it">says</a>, "The promised land of never having to experience a game the way it was intended again" is nearly here.</p>
<p>So as not to miss the naffness of this system, while some players are getting roughly in character responses about ketchup and flight plans, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WhereWindsMeet/comments/1oymfma/teaching_liu_buzhu_some_modern_world_problems/">others are just being presented with rote information about the Godot game engine</a>. This isn't some exciting new frontier for NPC dialogue, it's just the same generic text that pours out of LLMs, it's just appearing in an unusual environment.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is that, unlike Arc Raiders and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 7, which at least have disclosures on their Steam pages, stating that generative AI was used in the games' development, there is nothing on Where Winds Meet's page revealing this egregious example.</p>
<p>AI tools are clearly not going away and will only become increasingly prevalent, but in Where Winds Meet, we have an example of the immediacy with which generative AI shits the bed when it comes into contact with players.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday weekend and Cyber Monday that follows historically have proven to be a good time of the year to make some tech upgrades to you home, whether that is a larger TV for the living room, a laptop to replace you’re old one that’s gotten slow, or perhaps something new for your kitchen countertop to take your meal prep up a notch. We’re still a couple weeks away from the biggest savings event of the year, but that hasn’t stopped some retailers and brands from cutting their prices early. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5638/">Amazon happens to have the Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Plus on sale for a good 44% off.</a> It normally goes for $180, but this steep discount ends up taking off $80, bringing the price you pay to an even $100 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5638/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>That for the single camera. Amazon also has bundles of the Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Plus in packs of two, three, and four. The two-pack has come down by 38%, which saves it’s standard price down to $200 — so still ends up being $100 per camera. The three-pack and four-pack discounts, however, aren’t seeing a proportionally large enough discount to be worth it. Amazon has the three-pack for 11% off, which only brings it to $480 (or $160 per camera), and the four-pack going for 12% off, which brings it down to $630 (a little under $160 per camera).</p>
<p>So right now, if you intend to grab more than one the Ring Floodlight Cams, your best bet is adding a combination of multiple single or two-packs to your cart. Ignore the three-pack and four-pack entirely.</p>



<h2>Motion-activated LED Floodlights</h2>
<p>The Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Plus is a 1080p HD security camera designed for homes and businesses alike. They utilized motion-activated LED floodlights which can illuminate dark areas at night. This has multiple benefits. It allows the camera to capture better footage when it detects something present (working in unison with built-in Color Night Vision) and the lights just going on might be enough of a deterrent for any trespassers to turnaround. And if it’s just you coming home, it allows you to see your walkway up to your front door more easily in the dark without needing to pull out your phone’s flashlight.</p>
<p>You can check out a live view of what your camera sees right on your phone, tablet, or PC all from within the Ring app. It even can connect to Alexa so you can control security features using your voice, receive instant alerts, or pull up the video on your Echo Show.</p>

<p>Capcom has revealed that they expect Resident Evil Requiem to exceed the sales RE Village was able to bring in. </p>



<p>A lot of new Resident Evil Requiem details have come out recently, thanks to developer interviews. We have been informed that the game started development ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/capcom-says-resident-evil-requiem-development-started-way-before-village/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">way before</a>‘ RE Village, and also why they <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-reveals-why-multiplayer-was-ditched/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ditched the multiplayer aspect</a>. Now, a Q&amp;A from Capcom’s latest earnings report discusses the sales expectations for Resident Evil Requiem. </p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-s-announcement-led-to-increased-sales-of-previous-titles">Resident Evil Requiem’s Announcement Led to Increased Sales of Previous Titles</h2>



<p>Capcom was asked during a recent <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/2nd/explanation_2025_2nd_02.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Q&amp;A</a> about their expectations for Resident Evil Requiem. For the former, they spoke about the title receiving “high praise at various game shows”. The devs added that with Resident Evil Requiem, they “aim to exceed the initial sales performance of the previous title, Resident Evil Village.” The developers also spoke about Requiem’s announcement leading to increased sales of previous instalments, “surpassing” their initial expectations.</p>



<p>During the same conference call, the developers were also asked whether Requeim will suffer from the same technical issues as Monster Hunter Wilds. The developers answered, stating both games differ “in terms of gameplay, system architecture, and network features.” At this time, the developers “do not anticipate similar risks” and are “developing the game to provide a smooth gaming experience across a wide range of PC specifications.”</p>



<p>In other news, the producer of Resident Evil Requiem recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-producer-makes-interesting-comment-on-leon-kennedy-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">addressed rumours about Leon Kennedy</a>. Also, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-survival-unit-release-date-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release date for RE Survival Unit</a> has been announced. Do you think Resident Evil Requiem will exceed the sales performance of RE Village?
