<p>Why is that? Yabuki said that term is "just a little bit too ambiguously defined" for Nintendo to want to embrace it for Mario Kart World. Yabuki said Mario Kart World takes place in a "vast interconnected world," but "you still do need some traditional elements."</p><p>It may not be an open-world title by Nintendo's definition, but Mario Kart World is unlike any past game in the series due to the interconnected courses that allow players to drive from one race to the next. As for the free roam mode, players can freely explore the map by themselves or with friends. There are also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-free-roam-mode-features-missions-hidden-collectibles-and-more/1100-6530931/" data-ref-id="1100-6530931">P Switch missions and collectibles to find across the map.</a></p><p>In other news, Nintendo has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-cow-is-a-bigger-hit-than-nintendo-imagined-may-not-be-a-cannibal/1100-6532020/" data-ref-id="1100-6532020">discussed the response to the fan-favorite Cow</a>, and we have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-long-it-takes-to-drive-across-mario-kart-world-huge-map/1100-6532033/" data-ref-id="1100-6532033">found out how long it takes to drive across the entire map.</a> And if you're into lil weird guys, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/love-weird-lil-guys-mario-kart-world-is-the-game-for-you/1100-6532028/" data-ref-id="1100-6532028">Mario Kart World might be the game for you.</a></p><p>Mario Kart Word releases on June 5 as a<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401"> launch title</a> for the Switch 2.

So don’t take this as scientific proof tha<em>t Mario Kart World</em> is in fact bigger than <em>Forza Horizon 5 or GTA 5.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, to me this just implies that, yes, the open world in Nintendo’s upcoming kart racer is big. It’s not a tiny little open world that you’ll explore in a few minutes, but something that, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/603046/mario-kart-world-impressions-gameplay-hands-on&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/603046/mario-kart-world-impressions-gameplay-hands-on" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to a preview from <em>Polygon</em></a></span>, is filled with hundreds of collectibles, missions, and side activities. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-open-world-isnt-what-you-think-it-is&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-open-world-isnt-what-you-think-it-is" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Though, according to <em>IGN, </em>the open-world mode</a></span> in the game doesn’t feel nearly as exciting or content-packed as that of <em>Horizon 5</em>. This is still a Nintendo-developed <em>Mario Kart</em> game and not some highly detailed simulation of a real world filled with multiple progression bars and seasons, like <em>Forza </em>or <em>The Crew</em>. Still, I’m very excited to get lost for hours exploring <em>Mario Kart World</em> when it arrives for Switch 2 on June 5. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">There will likely be some variation in driving times depending on the character and kart being used, as well as other factors. According to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/mario-kart-world-switch-2-nintendo-kosuke-yabuki-1235350685/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rolling Stone</a>, the default difficulty for which Mario Kart World was designed around is 150cc, so it's likely Game File and Digital Trends' timed drives were done at that speed. Like in normal races, players can also pick up coins that increase their speed while driving in Free Roam, which would decrease how long it takes to drive across the map.</p><p dir="ltr">As Nintendo's first $80 game of the modern era, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/did-nintendo-justify-mario-kart-worlds-80-price/1100-6530956/" data-ref-id="1100-6530956">Mario Kart World has a lot of work to do to justify its price</a>. Unlike previous Mario Kart games, players in Mario Kart World can take to the game's new Free Roam mode and travel across a massive map filled with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/mario-kart-world-tracks-courses/2900-6594/" data-ref-id="2900-6594">race courses</a>, side missions, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/mario-kart-world-items/2900-6483/" data-ref-id="2900-6483">items</a>, and secrets to discover, all spread out across different biomes ranging from desert sands to snowy mountains.</p><p dir="ltr">All of Mario Kart's usual staples are included as well, however, including Grand Prix races across all of the game's courses and fan-favorite battle modes. It also includes the new Knockout Tour mode, where players continue to race from course to course, with the bottom handful of players continually eliminated from the race over time. The game originally started development as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-started-as-a-switch-game-but-switch-2-let-nintendo-realize-its-vision/1100-6531720/" data-ref-id="1100-6531720">Switch 1 game, but moving it to Switch 2 allowed Nintendo to realize its vision</a> for the ambitious follow-up to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.</p><p dir="ltr">Mario Kart World is one of the most-anticipated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/" data-ref-id="2900-6128">Nintendo Switch 2 games</a>, as well as Nintendo's biggest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive/2900-6628/" data-ref-id="2900-6628">Switch 2-exclusive</a> launch title. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-restock-launch-week-buying-guide-major-retailers-walmart-target-best-buy/1100-6531967/" data-ref-id="1100-6531967">Nintendo Switch 2 goes on sale June 5, with some retailers getting restocked</a> on inventory ahead of launch.</p>

The agreement is being kicked-off with a single-player action-adventure title set somewhere in D&amp;D's expansive universe.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“Stig and the team at Giant Skull are exactly the type of exceptionally talented creators we want to work with, and I’m so happy to be reuniting with him on this new project,” president of WOTC and digital gaming at Hasbro John Hight said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hight </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/world-of-warcraft-gm-john-hight-joins-hasbro-as-president-of-wizards-of-the-coast">left Blizzard</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> after a 12-year tenure as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Warcraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> general manager and SVP to take on the job at Hasbro in July 2024.

Many in the sizable fan following behind Baldur's Gate 3 had voiced concerns about the future of the game and its characters once Larian Studios stepped away from the property and any future additions.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/gog-lays-out-the-business-case-for-robust-game-preservation" target="_self" data-discover="true">GOG lays out the business case for robust game preservation</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="WOTC continues to place Baldur’s Gate 3 front and center without Larian">WOTC continues to place Baldur’s Gate 3 front and center without Larian</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The next slate of Dungeons &amp; Dragons games could have some sizable shoes to fill if WOTC hopes to see success similar to that of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur's Gate 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/03/the-witcher-4-gameplay-tech-demo-looks-impressive/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>During the State of Unreal conference today, CD Projekt RED showed a tech demo of The Witcher 4, and one of the most impressive things about is that this tech demo is running on a base PS5 at 60fps with raytracing. With this being a demo and the The Witcher 4 still in early development, this does not necessarily mean the final product will hit those same benchmarks.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Witcher 4 - UE 5.6 Tech Demo | State of Unreal 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FJtF3wzPSrY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The demo shows us a first look at Ciri in action as well as the region of Kovir, mentioned in previous games and in the books, but this is the first time players will be able to explore the region. We are also introduced to Ciri’s horse, Kelpie, her pure black horse who seems to have a bit more personality than Geralt’s Roach. The new Unreal Engine 5.6 update adds some new things to the experience too, including nanite foliage and character motion matching so horse riding, for example, comes across as much more lifelike.</p>
<p>The world of The Witcher 4 is much more responsive to Ciri’s actions as well. In one part she bumps into someone carrying a box of apples. The person drops some apples, a child and some pigs notice, and run up to gather the fallen apples. The clip goes on to show larger crowds gathered in a market square to watch a performance, all fitting into the game without sacrificing the 60 fps.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/the-witcher-4-revealed-with-ciri-as-the-protagonist/">The Witcher 4</a> was revealed in December with confirmation that Ciri would take the role of the lead protagonist. All we know is that this is the start of a new era for The Witcher series and it is set in Kovir. We do not have any details yet as to what has taken Ciri to Kovir or which characters will be returning in this sequel. A release date has not been confirmed either.</p>

            <p>
How do you follow up a game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/umurangi-generation">Umurangi Generation</a>? Maybe move from photography to videography, or go full shooter (which developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/origame-digital">Origame Digital</a> do <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/umurangi-generation-dev-teases-new-horror-game-inspired-by-metal-gear-and-silent-hill">appear to be making too</a>, that one's just not had a full reveal yet). Perhaps instead of either of those things, you'll make a game about penguins, which, yeah, no more beating around the bush, that's exactly what they've done. Introducing: Penguin Colony, a narrative <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure</a> game based on H.P. Lovecraft's At the Mountains of Madness.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3695930/Penguin_Colony/">Steam page</a> explains that this is a "radically different perspective" from the original piece of literature, in part because you play as a penguin who hears the "echoes of our narrator describing his plight." It's looking like it's somewhat level-based too, letting you waddle, slide, and swim around, discovering what happened "at your own pace." A pretty chill sounding time for a game with such heavy source material!
</p>
<p>
Oh, and the narrator isn't having a great time, his brain experiencing time out of order after being called by "the old ones," leaving you, a simple penguin, the only one that can help him. Good stuff.
</p>
<p>
There even seems to be a suitable amount of gaminess to it too, as you can unlock different penguins for replays. They all have different abilities and challenges too, one of them being a baby penguin so you can fit in smaller gaps, but you can't swim.
</p>
<p>
Look, Umurangi Generation is up there as one of my games of the decade, so I'll be here day one whenever it does drop. Over on the Umurangi Generation Discord server, lead developer Veselok said that a trailer and demo will be turning up in the coming months, so my advice is to wishlist the game on Steam if you're interested in checking it out.

In other Heroes of the Storm news (there isn't much!), <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-adds-more-free-to-play-freebies-for-subscribers/1100-6530387/" data-ref-id="1100-6530387">Xbox Game Pass subscribers are now getting more perks in free-to-play games</a> via Game Pass, including access to 30 free heroes in Blizzard's MOBA by linking their <a href="http://battle.net/" rel="nofollow ">Battle.net</a> and Xbox accounts.</p>

		<p>Never Ends, a brand new tactical RPG, has been announced by developer Hypersect with the game set to be released for PC via Steam, and PlayStation consoles later this year. The game has developers with some major experience under their belts, including designer Masayoshi Nishimura who has worked on Octopath Traveler and Triangle Strategy, director Ryan Juckett who was the lead sandbox level designer for Destiny, and muscian Doseone who has worked on Enter The Gungeon.</p>
<p><iframe title="Never's End | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OkBd9ygZg8E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Our collective influences from tactical RPGs like&nbsp;Final Fantasy Tactics&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tactics Ogre&nbsp;came together to spark a grander idea,”</em> said Ryan Juckett, founder of Hypersect. <em>“Never’s End&nbsp;fleshes out turn-based tactics combat with reactive systems empowering players to co-author the story and make it their own, which is a feeling we loved in&nbsp;Divinity: Original Sin 2&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Together with Nishimura-san, Doseone, and&nbsp;you, we’re excited to finally get to show you all just how memorable this forgotten world can be.”</em></p>
<p>The story of Never Ends puts players in the role of an immortal warrior who is defending the last human settlement, as the rest of the world has succumbed to a force known as the Never. Players will be able to wield elements like fire and water, and put together a team of warriors to fight enemies in tactical turn based battles. As progress is made, players can restore the world of Never Ends by reviving locations, towns, businesses, and trade routes. Doing so will give access to new party members who can help in the fight.</p>

<p>A release date is yet to be confirmed for Never Ends.</p>

He knows, because he's cleared every boss in Nightreign already, by himself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/elden-ring-nightreign-director-interview-if-he-can-solo-every-boss-so-can-you/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNET</a> in a recent interview, Ishizaki was asked whether he has beaten every boss, including the final one, himself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Yes. I can hopefully give you reassurance to know that I have beaten all of the game's bosses," said Ishizaki. "I've seen everything it has to offer, both in multiplayer and as a solo player. So I want you and players to know that this is very possible, and I want you to have the confidence to give it a try yourself."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CNET followed to clarify that Ishizaki was saying he had soloed every boss in the game. "Yes," Ishizaki confirmed. "And without relics."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While that's a pretty dang impressive accomplishment in and of itself, I do like the notion that Ishizaki's clears are also meant to be encouraging for other players. If he can do it, essentially, then you might be able to as well. I don't know about the "without relics" part, though. You can give yourself a little bit of leeway on that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There have been other players who have been clearing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBS751sS2Ao" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">both individual bosses</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/one-elden-right-nightreign-player-got-their-solo-nightlord-clears-in-before-the-nerf-heres-how">the full roster of Nightlords</a> solo as well. Still, the solo experience of Nightreign has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-review">been under scrutiny</a>, and not just for its difficulty, but also for how some mechanics (like revival) feel more oriented around teamplay than solo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's clear FromSoftware is both hearing and addressing those concerns, too. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-1011-nerfs-solo-mode-difficulty-fixes-bugs-and-makes-more-balance-changes">most recent patch, 1.01.1, arrived days after Elden Ring Nightreign's launch</a> and took aim directly at the solo mode, increasing the runes gained by lone players and adding one free automatic revival for night bosses.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even if the difficulty is getting tuned down, though, Ishizaki's clears can still be inspiring for those struggling against the Nightlords in their own runs. When the rains pick up and the storm closes in, you can know someone else has already done it, and so can you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Essential_Tips_and_Tricks"><u>Nightreign tips and tricks</u></a> to help you take down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightlord_Boss_Guides"><u>all the eight Nightlord Bosses</u></a>, and if you’re wondering how to unlock the two locked <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Nightfarers_-_List_of_Character_Classes"><u>Nightfarer Classes</u></a>, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Revenant"><u>How to Unlock the Revenant</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Unlock_the_Duchess"><u>How to Unlock the Duchess</u></a>, plus <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Change_Characters"><u>How to Change Characters</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Following a big update for the new season, many angry players spotted ads for bundles and battle passes in never-before-seen places, like inside the loadout menu. Activision now says this was all just a big whoopsie and has removed the ads. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195371" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Long-Lost Halo Demo Comes To Life" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="109" data-playlist="195371,196909,195840" data-current="195371"><div><p>Long-Lost Halo Demo Comes To Life</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20829.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1928155987409514677&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1928155987409514677" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On May 29,<em> Call of Duty</em> news and rumors outlet <em>CharlieIntel </em>reported</a></span> that players were encountering more ads in <em>Black Ops 6 </em>and <em>Warzone</em> following <em>Call of Duty</em>’s big season 4 update. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-new-in-game-ads-really-want-you-to-buy-its-battle-pass-and-bundles/1100-6531948/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-new-in-game-ads-really-want-you-to-buy-its-battle-pass-and-bundles/1100-6531948/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The annoying and obtrusive ads</a></span> were popping up in the loadout and the class creation menus, as well as in the events section of each game’s menus. The loadout menu in <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> and <em>Warzone </em>is likely the place in which players spend the most time when not actually shooting people in-game. And to suddenly see cosmetic and season pass ads shoved in here angered many. It seems the backlash was so intense that Activision stepped in to remove them all.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1929672257217204291&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/CODUpdates/status/1929672257217204291" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On June 2, the official <em>Call of Duty “</em>updates” account</a></span> run by Activision tweeted out a short message addressing the annoying ads, explaining that they were added to the games “in error.”  </p><p>“A UI feature test that surfaced select store content in the Loadout menus was published in the Season 04 update in error. This feature has now been removed from the live game,” said Activision.</p><p>Of course, many players didn’t buy this explanation, with some suggesting that Activision quietly added it in to see what the reaction would be, and when players went nuclear, backed off. Even if you take Activision’s word that it was mistakenly added, the fact that it was even testing the idea of adding more advertisements into more parts of<em> Call of Duty</em> means it was clearly being considered. And that’s concerning.</p><p>This is a franchise with some of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-wars-menus-suck-1846458782&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-wars-menus-suck-1846458782">worst, most ad-riddled and ugly menus in all of modern video games</a></span>. To shove even <em>more </em>ads into the few areas of <em>CoD</em> that are still useful and useable is gross, especially when you remember that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tweaktown.com/news/105098/call-of-duty-franchise-revenues-exceed-35-billion/index.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/105098/call-of-duty-franchise-revenues-exceed-35-billion/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Activision still charges $60+ for new<em> Call of Duty </em>games and sells an endless list of in-game cosmetics every day</a></span>. Did the company really need to test out more ways to squeeze in ads? I don’t think so, and based on how players reacted, I’m sure Activision will be careful about adding more advertisements in the near future. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s upcoming expansion, The Edge of Fate, launches at an uncertain time in the long lifespan of Destiny 2. It follows the high-octane culmination of Destiny's first era, The Final Shape, and a series of transitional episodes that attempted to tie up some loose narrative threads. You'd be forgiven if you fell off of Destiny 2 after The Final Shape--after all, <em>final</em> is right there in the name. Developer Bungie seems to be trying to walk a tightrope with this new expansion: ideally, The Edge of Fate will be enough to bring back lapsed players, but it also needs to give Destiny 2 a shot in the arm that will keep avid superfans engaged for the foreseeable future.</p><p dir="ltr">I recently had the opportunity to dig into The Edge of Fate at a preview event hosted by Bungie, and after around eight hours of gameplay, I can confidently say that the expansion's big changes bring new life to the game. Its campaign takes some big swings with its environmental puzzles and new methods of traversal, and it overhauls Destiny 2's core gameplay to make it significantly more streamlined and comprehensible. It remains to be seen if that's enough to revitalize Destiny 2 with the numbers it once had or reinforce the game's status as a live-service powerhouse, but it <em>is</em> enough to make me want to play more.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate | Cinematic Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The Edge of Fate is headlined by a story campaign that takes players to Kepler, a new location located at the far edge of the solar system. Following the conclusion of the story of the battle between the Traveler and the Witness in The Final Shape, The Edge of Fate shifts narrative focus to The Nine, shadowy supernatural beings that predate the Traveler's arrival in the solar system. Instead of powers linked to Light and Darkness, which defined all of Destiny's previous expansions, The Edge of Fate introduces powers related to dark matter--which, in Destiny's universe, is a usable resource that permeates Kepler. The narrative that unfolds features new civilizations, enemies, and a bearded and hipster-glasses-wearing human with an enigmatic backstory and uncertain motives named Lodi.</p><p dir="ltr">I spent my time exploring Kepler and engaging with the early part of the expansion's story, and while I found some of the narrative hooks intriguing, I was most impressed with Kepler's world design. The remote planetoid is distinct from Destiny 2's other locations: The dark matter appears as yellow-orange fungal growths that cover many of the surfaces, serving as organic ornamentation for red canyons and purple-green tunnels. The place is not <em>completely </em>alien, though--human architecture, vehicles, and objects are strewn throughout the world, bringing an eerie sense of familiarity to an otherwise foreign place. One of the most impactful scenes in the expansion comes right at the beginning of the opening mission, when you gaze out from a vista at a skybox dominated by a colossal aircraft carrier.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505397-screenshot2025-06-03at6.18.20%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505397" data-ratio="0.41700680272109" data-width="2940" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505397-screenshot2025-06-03at6.18.20%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505397"></a><figcaption>Recognizable human objects are strewn throughout Kepler, contrasting with alien landscapes. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505397-screenshot2025-06-03at6.18.20%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The dark matter diffused throughout Kepler powers the new abilities that you acquire throughout the campaign. In contrast to how Destiny's subclasses and associated skills have traditionally focused on combat, Kepler's "destination abilities" (meaning they are only usable while on Kepler) are geared toward navigating environments and finding secrets. While platforming and light puzzle-solving have always appeared in Destiny campaigns, The Edge of Fate leans more into environmental puzzles than previous expansions, drawing directly on Bungie's past experience with Dungeons and Raids. As such, the new abilities all provide ways of moving through or manipulating levels.</p><p dir="ltr">The first ability you receive is called Matterspark, and it transforms your character into a compact, glowing ball of energy. While you can damage enemies using sparks of energy jettisoned off of your new spherical form, the main purpose of Matterspark is to allow you to travel through tunnels, air ducts, and tight spaces, and to charge up locations throughout the world that open doors or chests. Another ability, called Matterform, similarly provides new means of traversal, allowing you to manipulate particular parts of the environment--such as sheets of metal or loose walls--into temporary bridges and ladders. Many missions that I played also heavily used the Relocator Cannon, an item you pick up at certain points that lets you create portals to move through otherwise inaccessible barriers.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505398-screenshot2025-06-03at6.20.34%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505398" data-ratio="0.56459330143541" data-width="2926" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505398-screenshot2025-06-03at6.20.34%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505398"></a><figcaption>You'll use Matterspark to traverse narrow spaces, but not all tunnels are marked by fungal growths like this one.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505398-screenshot2025-06-03at6.20.34%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">These abilities are key to Bungie's goal of making The Edge of Fate play more like a metroidvania than a linear, first-person shooter. The developer has, in fact, invoked this genre multiple times in its discussions about the expansion; game director Tyson Green told me in an interview that the team was directly inspired by Metroid and Hollow Knight when designing the new campaign. In my time with the game, I found that these new abilities provided a welcome injection of new mechanics into the otherwise quite familiar Destiny 2 gameplay. Finding secrets and figuring out how to traverse through new areas is enjoyable, and the promise of being able to return to old areas to use upgraded abilities to unlock previously unattainable chests adds a fun reason to retread earlier paths and fully explore this new planet.</p><p dir="ltr">As is frequently the case with environmental puzzles in shooters, though, the line between enjoyably challenging and deeply frustrating is a thin one. There were several instances throughout my time on Kepler where I struggled to find the specific nooks and crannies that I needed to move my Matterspark ball into; some of these moments of fruitless searching literally doubled the length of what was otherwise a compact mission. I was playing an early build and Bungie is aware of some of the particularly opaque moments of Matterspark traversal, so these may be improved by launch. I am cautiously optimistic that the abilities will be a welcome change of pace, but Bungie is definitely taking risks in order to shake up Destiny's formula.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505399-screenshot2025-05-30at2.31.53%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505399" data-ratio="0.56122448979592" data-width="2940" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505399-screenshot2025-05-30at2.31.53%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505399"></a><figcaption>The Exotic sniper rifle New Land Beyond returns from Destiny 1 in all of its iron-sights glory.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505399-screenshot2025-05-30at2.31.53%E2%80%AFpm.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">In tandem with the new campaign that unfolds on Kepler, Bungie is also implementing significant revisions to the core Destiny 2 experience. While the changes are numerous, two of the most obvious and impactful are an overhaul of the game's UI--called the Portal--and the addition of a shooting range.</p><p dir="ltr">These may sound like marginal updates, but in a game as complex as Destiny 2, they make a huge difference. The Portal represents a fundamental break from Destiny's past, as Bungie is deprioritizing the familiar destinations map and implementing a streamlined menu-based system for selecting and customizing activities. The developer is attempting to throw out Destiny's fairly obfuscated rewards system and the multi-layered map that has often hidden activities away in far corners. It is supplanting them with a system that is meant to give immediate information about what activities are available, how difficult those activities are, what rewards you can expect upon completing them, and any highlighted events or modifiers they might include.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the best examples of how the Portal aims to make Destiny 2 more digestible for all types of players is how it organizes activities on the basis of the way you want to play. As a person who plays almost exclusively solo, I have long been frustrated by the way that Destiny 2 hides or discourages activities that are good for playing alone. The Portal improves this by having "Solo Ops" as one of its four core categories of activities. In addition to curating a set of missions that are highly compatible for short play sessions, the interface also made it clear that I would not be punished with lesser rewards or slower progression for choosing to go solo. Other categories include Fireteam Ops, for Strikes and missions that are built for the classic three-person Destiny experience; Pinnacle Ops, for particularly challenging missions that reward the best loot; and Crucible Ops, for PvP gameplay.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505402-portal.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505402" data-ratio="0.561875" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505402-portal.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505402"></a><figcaption>The Portal makes rewards and tasks much more streamlined.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505402-portal.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Portal's other transformative change is the inclusion of a much more extensive set of modifiers and options that you can use to customize a mission's difficulty to your liking. This is a <em>huge </em>change over Destiny's past, where missions generally have only a few difficulty settings and little granular control over the gameplay experience. Now, you can choose from dozens of different buffs and de-buffs, evocative of the way that finding Halo's collectible Skulls unlocked a series of options to tune particular elements of the game. These all affect scoring multipliers, which themselves affect how many rewards you are able to earn in a mission. In addition to allowing high-level players to create extreme challenges, it also lets you, for example, tune things to make a mission easier to complete in less time.</p><p dir="ltr">I found the Portal genuinely transformative to the Destiny 2 gameplay loop. While I have always generally liked the use of the destination map, the improvements to visibility and customizability that the Portal implements will make the game more enjoyable and replayable for many different types of players. I even ended up replaying quick missions multiple times during my preview, just because I was invested in seeing how different combinations of modifiers would affect my performance, enemy difficulty, and the rewards I got. It was exciting to try to push my limits, and that excitement was driven by the fact that I got to choose exactly how I was going to get challenged.</p><p dir="ltr">The other big change to the core Destiny 2 gameplay, the addition of a shooting range, is designed to benefit both beginner and expert players. Destiny 2's gear and stats system is extraordinarily complex, combining both intrinsic weapon and armor perks, user-selected mods, and upgrade mechanics. This has resulted in high-level play increasingly oriented around build-crafting, or the creation of combinations of gear and mods that are most suited to particular tasks. However, this process is more involved than, say, creating a loadout in Call of Duty. It can be extremely difficult to figure out exactly how armor and weapon perks interact, or how marginal increases in character stats impact one's performance. I have played Destiny 2 for hundreds of hours and I am still a relative beginner at build-crafting, as I have found comparing combinations of gear to generally be too difficult and time-consuming.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505403-screenshot2025-05-30at2.31.08%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505403" data-ratio="0.41700680272109" data-width="2940" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505403-screenshot2025-05-30at2.31.08%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505403"></a><figcaption>Lodi, a human, just appeared one day on Kepler. What's he up to?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505403-screenshot2025-05-30at2.31.08%E2%80%AFpm.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The shooting range is Bungie's attempt to encourage players to engage more deeply with builds. Located in a corner of the Tower, the shooting range lets players safely experiment with different weapons, gear, and mods to figure out exactly how they want to approach certain encounters or mission types. There are many buttons to hit to change the shooting range's setup (you literally shoot buttons to switch settings), including what enemy types are included, whether a champion spawns, and whether the enemies should engage in combat with you. There is even a big scoreboard that tells you exactly how much damage per second you have put on a target.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a stat nerd's dream, but it is also a profoundly useful way of learning Destiny's more involved mechanics. Even in the short time I spent at the range, I found myself quickly picking up on gear complexities that I hadn't been willing to engage with in the past. I was able to carefully investigate how the perks on the new Exotic weapons worked, and I figured out how to match certain mods to significantly increase my combat effectiveness.</p><p dir="ltr">There are dozens more additions and tweaks that Bungie is implementing with The Edge of Fate--including a simplification of the armor and power systems--that I generally found to make my gameplay experience more enjoyable. However, it is still unclear if Bungie has done enough to bring back the lapsed Destiny players who have fallen off at some point over the game's long history, or to entice new players who have never touched the game before. Destiny is a daunting game in many ways, and despite The Edge of Fate attempting to initiate a new, more welcoming phase, there is a lot of narrative and mechanical intricacy that has accumulated over the years. Bungie has to find a way to simultaneously signal that it's a good time to (re)join the Destiny community, while also giving its committed players both continuity and new treasures to chase.</p><p dir="ltr">In the absence of a truly clean break in the form of a new sequel, I don't think this challenge is getting any easier–and I'm not sure Kepler, the Portal, and the Shooting Range will fully solve it. Despite all that, I am optimistic about the swings that Bungie is taking with the expansion, especially those that overhaul the core game. You're likely to find me spending too much time fiddling with weapon mods at the shooting range when The Edge of Fate launches on July 19.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">I love weird little guys. It's a truism about me that crosses games, genres, and mediums. It's the reason why, even if I didn't realize it at the time, Toad has been my main Mario Kart racer since I was sitting cross-legged on the carpet of my living room mere inches from the glow of Mario Kart 64. And it's one reason why Mario Kart World has me so excited: It's a veritable treasure trove of weird lil guys.</p><p dir="ltr">By now we all know about Cow, the breakout star from the Switch 2 reveal presentation. Everyone loved the outside-the-box approach of plucking a background creature from one stage of Mario Kart and including her as a racer. And to hear Nintendo tell it, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-a-silly-sketch-led-to-cow-becoming-a-pivotal-character-in-mario-kart-world/1100-6531712/">Cow was the eureka moment</a> of their whole approach to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-mario-kart-9-racer/2900-6141/">racers in Mario Kart World</a>. Once you've thrown Cow into the mix, nothing is off-limits.</p><p dir="ltr">I enjoy the novelty of Cow, but I've never gravitated toward heavy racers. Mario Kart has always felt best to me when I'm behind the wheel of someone light and zippy with a tight turn radius. So I can <em>respect</em> Cow even if I don't expect to actually race as Cow very often. But the philosophy behind Cow has enabled a smorgasbord of other, equally unconventional racers, and I spent a recent extended hands-on session trying all that I could find. I may have even found a new main. (Sorry Toad.)</p><p dir="ltr">Let's start with Penguin, another unassuming background character. Penguins are just adorable in general, and this one has a checkered history with Mario in particular. I played as Penguin hoping to get the opportunity to knock Mario off a ledge this time, so I could cackle with righteous fury as I did. <em>Now</em> who's getting thrown off a cliff, plumber? But alas, the stars did not align, and I was never close to Mario to perform such a stunt. Something to anticipate in the final game, I suppose.</p><p dir="ltr">But Penguin was far from the only oddball racer. I tried Chargin Chuck--putting aside my reservations about heavy racers, I enjoyed his grunting meathead persona behind the wheel. I played as Swoop, the little purple bat enemy you forgot about from Super Mario World. I played as Monty Mole, an adorably portly little fellow who looks like he should be having afternoon tea with a badger in a storybook. The list goes on and on.</p><p dir="ltr">But my favorite of all was Para-Biddybud. The little ladybug-like creature looks like a Poke Ball grew eyes and wings. He's lightweight, making him a great match for my preferred racing style. And he's just so gosh darned cute.</p><p dir="ltr">Each of the racers has a little personality animation they display when you hit the weapon button without a weapon equipped. Para-Biddybud turns toward the camera and smiles with his eyes--he <em>smizes</em>--and makes a little trilling squeak. All of the racers I could find also had some themed kart they could equip, and Para-Biddybud rides in style in a little rounded kart that has the same ladybug pattern as his body. After only 15 minutes, I got viscerally angry when other racers would hurt my dear sweet Biddybud. He's just a wee fella! What is wrong with you?!</p><p dir="ltr">The one drawback of this expanded roster is that not everyone gets a series of costume changes. The core Mario cast does, which means mostly humanoid-type characters or established racers like King Boo. There are no costumes, as far as I can tell, for Cow or Swoop or Para-Biddybud. That also means that lunch bags don't change you to a random costume; they just give you a speed boost.</p><p dir="ltr">But hey, they have to save something for the DLC, right?</p>

Some tapes were in VHS format, but most were recorded in Digital Betacam, a format used for video production in the late ‛90s and early 2000s. It meant overall quality and framerate were higher than standard formats, but the equipment and knowledge needed to handle them was harder to come by.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/avowed-game-director-joins-netflix-games-developer-night-school-studio" target="_self" data-discover="true">Avowed game director joins Netflix Games developer Night School Studio</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Once everyone switched over to HD video, they got rid of their Digital Beta equipment," </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="http://Salvador said a video explainer">said Salvador in a video explainer</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

            <p>The Chief Legal Officer and Chief Financial Officer at MindsEye developer Build a Rocket Boy have left the company, a week before the game's release.</p>
<p>Writing on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/riley-graebner-0464378_after-three-and-a-half-years-my-time-at-barb-activity-7335325435200761858-TbDN/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADDOgdoB1gzNggnuaGLIXM_FUprl3u0285o">LinkedIn</a>, former CLO Riley Graebner said he was "proud" of what the team has accomplished during his time there, stating that during his tenure the company had "doubled" in size, to "over 450 employees". Graebner did not give a reason for this departure.</p>
<p>In addition, Build a Rocket Boy's <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-bland-b7410313/?originalSubdomain=uk">CFO Paul Bland</a> has also left the company after two years.</p>

<p>Over on the MindsEye Discord, many have expressed concern that two key members of the Build a Rocket Boy team are leaving so close to the game's release. As a reminder, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-new-thriller-from-former-gta-producer-and-hitman-publisher-gets-release-date">MindsEye is launching on 10th June, across PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC</a>.</p>
<p>"It could be a sign of very troubling internal affairs, or [they] don't want to deal with potential legal issues if MindsEye comes out broken," one member has speculated.</p>
<p>"Trying to keep an open mind, but that's sus indeed..," another wrote. "People don't bail right before they think they're releasing a hit usually. If you were the CFO at Rockstar a week out from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA6</a> launch, would you resign?"</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Build a Rocket Boy for further comment on Graebner and Bland's departures.</p>

<p>Word of Graebner and Bland's departures from Build a Rocket Boy come days after the studio's co-CEO Mark Gerhard suggested the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">negative reaction to MindsEye so far had been paid for in a "concerted effort" against the studio ahead of its release</a>.</p>
<p>In an exchange on the MindsEye Discord server, Gerhard was asked if he believes "all the people who reacted negatively were financed by someone", to which he replied: "100 percent."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Earlier this year, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair announced their intent to get into games publishing using some of that Scrooge McDuck-size swimming pool of money they've acquired over the past year. They already had a game signed up too, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-creators-are-paying-the-kenzera-devs-to-make-a-horror-game-about-the-entertainment-industry">from Tales of Kenzera: ZAU developer Surgent Studios</a>, and today said indie dev has offered a small tease of a reveal at their upcoming psychological <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game Dead Take.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For now the game is mostly wrapped in mystery, but it's apparently all about taking a look at the "darkest secrets" that lurk underneath the "glittering facade" that is the entertainment industry. You'll step into the role (pun intended) of an actor exploring a mansion to "piece together the story of how far a powerful executive will go to seal his legacy." There's object-based puzzles to solve, and you'll need to edit video clips you find to figure out what happened there. No full trailer just yet though.
</p>

<p>
In a statement Surgent Studios founder Abubakar Salim said that they're "being secretive" about the game "for a reason," continuing on to say that the "subject matter of this game is delicate, and it hits close to home. When it comes out, and it won't be long until it does, I want players to think, 'I can't believe they actually did this.'" 
</p>
<p>
For some context, before getting into game development, Slim was an actor, having appeared in Ridley Scott's Raised by Wolves and Napoleon, House of the Dragon, and on the video game front he was also <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-origins">Assassin's Creed Origins</a>' Bayek, as well as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tales-of-kenzera-zau">Tales of Kenzera's</a> titular Zau. One can only imagine the stories any actor working on such big names might have.
</p>
<p>
Release date wise it's supposedly launching this year, but for now you can wishlist the game on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3352690/Dead_Take/">Steam</a>.

Create rain and fog to hamper your enemies, or mighty winds to hurl them over cliffs. Freeze your foes or set them aflame. Reshape earth to gain the high ground, or melt it into deadly lava.

In today's demo, she's a big black horse, and the presenters took pains to note that "since you're going to explore the world on horseback, riding needs to be seamless, natural, and just fun" and that "controlling her [will feel] realistic and grounded" thanks to tools in Unreal. </p><p>The developers also detailed Unreal tech that allows for "realistic movement and muscles stretching under Kelpie's skin without compromising the performance there," zooming in on Kelpie running unadorned to show... a bunch of horse, and also a cutaway to an anatomical drawing of... a bunch of the inside of a horse.</p><figure></figure><p>That's some real "<a href="https://aftermath.site/you-are-error-horses-red-dead-redemption-2-horse-testicles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">horse testicles changing with the weather</a>" hours, but the idea of a better-controlling horse is nice if you, unlike me, aren't trauma-bonded to how Geralt's horse Roach famously steered like a boat. </p><p>I have to admit I have reservations about playing as Ciri--not for the reasons that are surely ripping through the worst parts of the internet right now, but because I did her real dirty in my <em>Witcher 3 </em>playthrough, playing Geralt as the <a href="https://kotaku.com/i-accidentally-got-the-worst-ending-in-the-witcher-3-1793040692" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worst possible dad</a> despite being fully confident that I was doing everything right. It's a shame my Witcher-loving colleagues like Luke have never let me live down, and for years after I wrote about it on Kotaku I would get emails from readers either admitting to their own failures or excoriating me for mine, compounding my own struggles with the matter. As I wrote at the time:</p><blockquote><p>Even though it was just a video game, I had a bit of a moral crisis. I couldn’t get over how spectacularly badly I’d done while thinking I was doing such a good job. I used to be a prison chaplain for goodness’ sake—surely I should be good at feelings, even virtual ones? I started recalling all the real-life interactions where I think I’m putting other people’s needs ahead of my own, mining them for hidden failures. Who else in my life could I be ignorant of hurting?</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>So<em> The Witcher 4</em>, which I am excited about because it's more Witcher, is also exciting to me as a chance to try to do better by Ciri. But it's also a new chance to do <em>terribly</em> by Ciri all over again. And now she has her own special horse in the mix, one with lore and a fandom. One without Geralt's gruffness and, potentially, Roach's recalcitrance to justify their love-hate relationship.   </p><p>Will Kelpie end up on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/witcher/comments/em4v3e/whats_up_with_the_memes_about_roach_standing_on_a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roofs</a>? Will I steer her into trees and off cliffs and hop off her and wander miles away and then get mad when she doesn't instantly appear when I whistle even though it's my fault for wandering so far away in the first place? How will Ciri talk to her? How will I do right by this horse, and by extension Ciri?</p><p>It's already too much pressure. I haven't made it through any of The Witcher books beyond the first, so if there's some horrible <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vE8mFDabqD0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The NeverEnding Story</a></em>-style twist coming, please do not tell me about it until after it happens and I blame myself for it. I am going to do my best to not lose this horse. I am not going to call her "Roach" by accident. I am not going to be mad at her for things that are my fault. I am going to redeem myself in her eyes, and by extension in the eyes of all the people in my life because I will read too much into my video game life choices. This is a good plan that has no downsides. Let's go.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dropkickd-etterboxd-wrestling"><h3>Finally, A Letterboxd For Wrestling</h3></a><p>Dropkickd puts criticism and community back in the hands of fans at whatever point of their wrestling journey

                <p>Ahead of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Switch 2's launch this week</a>, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang reflected on the first Switch console in a new video. As Huang explained, Nintendo had an ambitious goal to create a gaming device that was "powerful enough" to run first-party games at home and still be small enough to be used while on the go.</p><p>"We've worked with Nintendo for more than a decade, drawn together by a shared belief that technology should serve creativity, and that joy is worth engineering for," Huang said in a Nintendo Creator's Voice video, while also reflecting on late Nintendo president Satoru Iwata's vision for the system.</p><p>"I still remember the day Iwata shared his dream with us. He wanted to create something no one had seen before: a console powerful enough for big cinematic games, but small enough to take anywhere. It sounded impossible, but that vision became the original Nintendo Switch. We lost Iwata before the launch, but his clarity, his purpose, it still inspires our work every day."</p><p>According to Huang, the Nvidia Tegra X1 chip for the Switch took over "500 engineer years" to develop, and the company had to "reinvent everything" for the Switch 2. Huang added that it achieved three major breakthroughs on the Switch 2: full-hardware ray tracing, dedicated AI processors, and "ultra low power" through optimized semiconductor process technology for high performance. The Nvidia CEO claims that this has led to the most advanced graphics ever seen in a portable device.</p><p>The Switch 2 represents a major step forward for Nintendo in terms of graphics, as the hybrid console is capable of rendering games at up to 4K resolution and 60fps when docked. This means that some good-looking games will be coming to the console, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-is-best-way-to-experience-the-game-on-the-go-says-dev/1100-6531204/" data-ref-id="1100-6531204">like Cyberpunk 2077</a>. CD Projekt Red recently revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/getting-cyberpunk-2077-to-run-on-switch-2-wasnt-as-challenging-as-cd-projekt-red-thought/1100-6531992/">bringing the game to Switch 2 wasn't actually as much of a challenge</a> as anticipated, as modern technologies like Nvidia's DLSS helped make the port easier.</p><p>While other graphically impressive third-party games like Elden Ring and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-confirms-entire-final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogy-will-come-to-nintendo-switch-2/1100-6531363/" data-ref-id="1100-6531363">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> are headed to Switch 2, several first-party Nintendo titles will also be upgraded on the system. These include paid-for upgrades in titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom-every-switch-2-upgrade/2900-6612/" data-ref-id="2900-6612">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom</a>, while smaller <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-switch-2-footage-shows-the-game-looking-much-smoother-in-action/1100-6531995/" data-ref-id="1100-6531995">free updates for games like Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</a> will also be available.</p>
