        <p>Will become new executive chair of the board.</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Lars Wingefors, the Embracer Group CEO who oversaw thousands of job cuts and a significant number of studio closures following a turbulent few years for the company, has announced he's stepping down from his role. Wingefors is not, however, parting ways with Embracer, and will instead become its executive chair of the board.
</p>
<p>
"While the road has not always been straight, I am incredibly proud of the achievements made possible by our talented teams, which have created some incredible experiences for gamers,"  Wingefors said in a <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/lars-wingefors-proposed-to-be-elected-as-executive-chair-of-the-board-of-embracer-phil-rogers-appointed-new-ceo/">statement announcing his change of role</a>. "This new phase allows me to focus on strategic initiatives, M&amp;A, and capital allocation, ensuring Embracer's continued growth and success. I am more convinced than ever that the best is still ahead of us."
</p>
<p>
With Wingefors' focus shifting elsewhere, Phil Rogers will step into the vacated CEO role from 1st August. Rogers is currently deputy CEO of Embracer and CEO of Crystal Dynamics – Eidos.
</p>
<p>
Wingefors' time as CEO has been turbulent to say the least. He oversaw a rapid period of expansion at Embracer, with the company embarking on a massive acquisition spree, snapping up the likes of Gearbox, Saber Interactive, Crystal Dynamics, and more - including the €2.75bn purchase of board game publisher Asmodee - over a number of years. However, the unsustainability of that expansion became clear after a $2bn deal with the Saudi government-funded Savvy Games Group <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-shares-plummet-after-proposed-2bn-partnership-collapses">collapsed dramatically in 2023</a>.
</p>
<p>
Following the deal's collapse, Wingefors <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-owner-embracer-announces-comprehensive-restructuring-program-to-close-studios-cut-jobs">announced</a> a "comprehensive restructuring program" that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-human-cost-of-embracers-restructuring-programme">ultimately resulted in thousands of employees losing their jobs</a>, while a substantial number of studios were either divested or outright closed. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saints-row-studio-volition-has-been-closed-down-effective-immediately">Saints Row developer Volition shut its doors in August 2023</a>, for instance, while the revived Free Radical Design, which was working on a new TimeSplitters project, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/timesplitters-studio-free-radical-design-closed-today-staff-say">closed just a few months later</a>. Soon after, Gearbox was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-acquires-borderlands-studio-gearbox-from-embracer-for-460m">sold to Take-Two Interactive</a>, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embattled-publisher-embracer-sells-off-saber-assets-withdraws-from-russia">Saber Interactive went its own separate way</a>. Further layoffs, at the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-groups-eidos-montreal-studio-lays-off-up-to-75-employees">Eidos-Montréal</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-developer-crystal-dynamics-announces-layoffs">Crystal Dynamics</a>, have been announced since then.
</p>
<p>
Wingefors <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-boss-admits-long-list-of-things-hed-have-done-differently-as-embattled-company-splits-into-three">later admitted</a> there was a "long list" of things he'd have done differently, but that it was "easy to look back in hindsight".

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/herdling">Herdling</a> is an odd little game. How do you begin to sell the idea that a (presumably emotional) herding simulator might be quite interesting? Yes, people love their farming sims as a band aid form of escapism, but a lot of those games are in the first instance much more about farming and not farm animals, nor the way you interact with said animals. Herdling is all about that, as the whole goal is to guide a group of strange horned beasties up a mountain.
</p>

<p>
The demo, which just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3047750/Herdling/">launched this weekend on Steam</a> after a recent trailer at the Future Games Show, certainly left me a lot to think about. In the first instance, I feel that it's a game that could quite easily fit into the PS3 era of indie games quite specifically - think something along the lines of Journey, or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/limbo">Limbo</a>, games where you're just kind of heading forward because that's the thing you're doing. What you make of it along the way is therefore up to you. What do I make of the little bit I've played of Herdling?

<p>
Well, for starters, it's a little bit janky. To start with, anyway, guiding the actually quite sweet Calicorns is a bit awkward, at least up until the breadth of the game's controls are properly explained to you. After spending a short stint in a city, Herdling quite literally opens up into massive, sweeping fields, giving you a much freer reign to roam with your newfound herd. Just simply making a turn offers a challenge due to its slowness, but I got the hang of it quite quickly.
</p>
<p>
You have to be thoughtful in doing so, though. There are dangers to be met with that can hurt your Calicorns (and I believe in kill them, if the game's immortality setting means what I think it does), so you can't just wave them around willy nilly. The slow moving nature of the beasts then means you have to keep yourself on your toes to avoid any morbid fates. To add on to the weight of being responsible for their lives, you can name each Calicorn too. You are the one guiding them, so you must get to know them, and look after them.
</p>
<p>
I admit there is the possibility that Herdling could end up falling into the trope of overly emotional indie game. Still, I find the idea of having such a leadership role over animals that don't quite have as much autonomy and safety as its world might allow to be an interesting one, so consider this a demo that has successfully caught my intrigue. There's no exact release date just yet, but it is expected to release this summer.

Now there is only war."</p><p>The game features four factions taking on one another in a brutal war for dominance over the planet's resources: Astra Militarum, Space Marines, Orks, and Necrons.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/684957/splitgate-2-hat-apology<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There’s a line in showbiz that goes, “There’s no such thing as bad publicity.” Ian Proulx, CEO of <em>Splitgate 2</em> developer 1047 Games, has recently learned the hard way that’s not entirely true. </p><p>Last week, during the Summer Game Fest keynote livestream, Proulx came out to promote his game wearing a black hat that read “Make FPS Great Again” — an obvious reference to Donald Trump’s Make America Great Again slogan. The <em>Splitgate 2</em> community, journalists, and regular gamers seized on the hat (and not, you know, the game), immediately calling the statement gross and tone deaf. As questions from the <em>Splitgate 2</em> community poured in, Proulx <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/1931162849977442371">doubled down on social media</a>, saying that he would not apologize and that the hat wasn’t a political statement and should be taken at face value. </p><p>Today, however, he’s singing a different tune. He posted on X with the simple caption, “No excuses, I’m sorry,” accompanied by a nearly three-minute video explaining the decision to wear the hat and the intention behind it. </p><p>“We needed something to grab attention, and the honest truth is, we tried to think of something, and this is what we came up with,” Proulx said.</p><p>He acknowledged that he was aware the hat would be controversial. His apology was not for the hat itself, but the discussion surrounding the hat within the <em>Splitgate 2 </em>community. Proulx claimed he did not want the division he himself sowed. “The reason I’m sorry is because of what this has done to the community,” he said.</p><p>He continued: “We knew there would be some level of controversy, but we really saw this as a meme that was kind of stating our truth.” As Proulx was making his statement, a few miles away in Los Angeles’ fashion district, where the Summer Game Fest Play Days campus resides, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was conducting raids snatching up people just going about their lives, raids that led to clashes between people protecting their neighbors and defenders of a cruel regime. </p><div><p>When I reported on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/682033/everybody-hated-that">the Trump-evoking slogan and the backlash to it</a>, some commenters responded that “it’s just a hat.” </p></div><p>But it is not just a hat. Aping a political statement that has been used to enact state violence isn’t “a meme,” it is a continuation of that violence. I think of the people in attendance at the show and those who work at the YouTube Theater who are immigrants or have immigrant family members. I think of the worker at the City Market Social House, the venue where SGF holds its Play Days event, who told me about the protocol they have in case ICE shows up: how people can hide in a room in the basement and hand out cards so they don’t have to speak to ICE and potentially implicate themselves.</p><p>Proulx’s statement, no matter its form, isn’t just in bad taste. It is a stark reminder to those people that their lives and families are at risk. And saying “I’m sorry, it was just a meme” isn’t enough. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>While that kind of item-based back-and-forth isn't new to Mario Kart, it feels like it has been taken to a new extreme by <em>World</em>'s more crowded race track. If you're in the middle of the pack, every tranche of item boxes you pass can lead, in short order, to a flurry of near-unavoidable projectiles and item-enhanced opponents cluttering your immediate space. That's especially true in online races, where human opponents tend to be much more ruthless with their item use than even the hardest computer-controlled opponents.</p>
<figure>

            <p>
              That blue "Kaboom!" can send you from first to 17th in a hurry.

      </figure>

<p>The change ultimately rewards defensive driving, where you do your best to avoid other racers and utilize protective items until you have a chance to rocket into the relative safety of the top few positions. Sometimes, though, there's simply no avoiding a maddening series of bad breaks that can literally send you from first place to 19th in an instant.</p>

<h2>It’s not the destination, it’s the journey</h2>
<p>Once you've adjusted to the more crowded field of racers, you'll then have to get used to the odd structure of <em>Mario Kart World</em>'s main racing modes. Rather than racing multiple laps around the game's well-designed tracks, you'll spend the bulk of your race time in most racing modes trekking between those tracks across the great expanses of <em>Mario Kart World</em>'s, uh, world.</p>

<p>These inter-course interludes offer a decent variety to the structure, which will see you traveling through desert wastelands, down traffic-clogged highways, along the surface of tiered waterfalls, across frozen tundra, and more. What's unavoidably similar about most of them, though, is their unbearable straightness. Players used to the undulating, crisscrossing curves of a standard Mario Kart course will marvel at just how rarely they have to powerslide around turns while shuttling between those courses in <em>World</em>.</p>
<p>These long straightaways aren't boring, per se. The designers have done their best to dress them up with plenty of obstacles (of the stationary, vehicular, and livestock varieties), as well as jumps, dash pads, and frequent item boxes to make sure you're still paying attention. But it can still be a jarring transition to go from two or three minutes across one of these mostly straight interregnums into the usual twisty wildness of the game's more familiar pre-designed courses.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">One of the 2025 Xbox Showcase's most shocking reveals was Invincible VS, a new three-on-three tag fighter from Skybound and a new startup studio called Quarter Up Games. Don't let the "new startup" descriptor fool you, however; this is a team steeped in fighting game experience, as it was responsible for bringing back a cult classic to a legion of appreciative fans over a decade ago.</p><p dir="ltr">This time, Quarter Up and Skybound are set on breathing new life not into just a franchise, but a concept--Invincible VS invokes the highly-praised Marvel vs. Capcom style of 2D fighting games that use a tag-team system to swap between multiple characters, which is a tall task to try replicating. Based on our hands-on gameplay during a recent visit to Skybound in Los Angeles, it seems that Quarter Up is well on its way to answering the call.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Invincible VS | Official Reveal Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr">A Killer origin story</h2><p dir="ltr">In 2013, developer Double Helix brought Rare's Killer Instinct series back to the masses on Xbox One. The 2013 installment's gritty, impactful fighting system made it an instant fan favorite, but soon after it launched, the studio was snapped up by Amazon Games. Many of KI 2013's key developers went on to other projects, but Mike Willette--KI 2013 producer and the voice behind the iconic "c-c-c-combo breaker!" sound effect in the reboot--wasn't done with fighting games yet. He wanted to get the band back together.</p><p dir="ltr">"We felt like we had unfinished business," Willette told GameSpot on a recent Zoom call. "I still had that itch, so after working [as lead of the world design team] on New World [at Amazon], I reached out to a whole bunch of the oldheads and said, 'Look, I'm thinking about starting a studio. Would you guys be interested?' Immediately, a bunch of them were in. 'Yeah dude, I had so much fun. We love the people, we love the community. If you can make it happen, Mike, we'll show up.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Not long after, Willette found himself in the offices of Skybound, creators of the dark and gritty Invincible superhero franchise. "Skybound asks me, 'Mike, what game would you want to build here?' and I immediately said, 'I want to build an Invincible fighting game, and I'll build a tag fighting game,'" Willette recalled. "I was a huge fan of the show and the comics, and there's just so much rich material there. It's violent. It's brutal. It has the stakes of what happens with superheroes. I just connected with them on such a level that I said, 'This is it, this is what I want to do.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Making a three-on-three tag fighter was a no-brainer for the team, as Invincible's pantheon of superheroes, according to Willette, lends itself perfectly to that style of fighting game. Tag battle fighting games are hype. They're incredible," Willette said. "The amount of creativity, the combo systems, the different archetypes that let you build your own team, instead of just using a single character... There hadn't been a real big game since Dragon Ball FighterZ, either, so we carried over from our days in KI, plus all the learnings from the past 10 years, and that's the genesis of Quarter Up."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510856-tagcombat_markeve_vs_thula.png" data-ref-id="1300-4510856" data-ratio="0.56238603803074" data-width="3839" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510856-tagcombat_markeve_vs_thula.png" data-ref-id="1300-4510856"></a><figcaption>Invincible VS</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510856-tagcombat_markeve_vs_thula.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510857-cinematiccombat_markbp.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510858-combat_thulabp.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510859-tagcombat_markeve_vs_bp.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510860-taunt_mark.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510861-ult_bulletproof.png" data-ref-id="1300-4510857,1300-4510858,1300-4510859,1300-4510860,1300-4510861" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4510857-cinematiccombat_markbp.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4510858-combat_thulabp.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4510859-tagcombat_markeve_vs_bp.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4510860-taunt_mark.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4510861-ult_bulletproof.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510857-cinematiccombat_markbp.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510858-combat_thulabp.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510859-tagcombat_markeve_vs_bp.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510860-taunt_mark.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4510861-ult_bulletproof.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr"><span>Becoming Invincible</span></h2><p dir="ltr">Invincible VS employs a simplified version of Marvel vs. Capcom 3's four-button control scheme for attacks: There are four attack buttons--light, medium, heavy, and special--and each has multiple special attacks that are used depending on which direction you move the left thumbstick, a la Super Smash Bros. Tapping the light attack multiple times also offers an auto-combo that will chain into a super move, should the aggressor have the meter to use it.</p><p dir="ltr">Thankfully, the team has balanced that simplified control scheme with a system that offers plenty of depth and advanced tactics to discover. Those worried about players mashing the combo button over and over again, for example, can take solace in the return of one of Killer Instinct's defining features: the combo meter, which will force a player to drop a combo if they use the same move too often.</p><p dir="ltr">Core fighting mechanics resemble those from other fighting games: Heroic Boost adds extra power or hits to special attacks similar to EX moves in Street Fighter, super meters allow for more powerful moves as you charge them up by attacking and blocking, and so on. Some are adapted in new and interesting ways, however: "snapback"--moves that force an opponent to swap characters--can also blast an opponent into an entirely different stage in Invincible VS. In doing so, the character getting knocked into a new stage will lose access to their assist characters for a brief moment--because, from a storytelling perspective, those characters have to "catch up," while the offensive team is ready to go.</p><p dir="ltr">Incorporating the Invincible franchise into this format, meanwhile, has been incredibly easy for Willette and his team--easier than his previous projects, in fact.</p><p dir="ltr">"Compared to Killer Instinct's historical files, I have a lot more access with this property," Willette explained. "The problem when we worked on KI was that all of the previous developers were gone; we did have [Xbox partner creative director] Ken Lobb, and I could always go to Ken, but here I can go right to the well, and it's a <em>deep</em> well."</p><p dir="ltr">This comes through in the pre-fight character intros, where every character pairing in the game will have unique dialogue with every other character--even if they've never interacted in official Invincible media.</p><p dir="ltr">"We've got access to decades worth of comic references, access to the show team," Willette said, "and we're always spitballing ideas back and forth with each other. It's very cool to work here."</p><h2 dir="ltr">Battle scars</h2><p dir="ltr">That authenticity also bears a more grisly side through Invincible VS' blood-and-gore factor, a trait not normally associated with tag fighters like this. The most obvious implementation of this is in Overkills, where certain special and super moves will decapitate, dismember, or even detonate an opponent's body into pieces if used as the final hit.</p><p dir="ltr">Willette says this level of violence was necessary to convey what Invincible has always been about, but there is a limit.</p><p dir="ltr">"Our goal is to be brutal, but not hyper-grotesque for shock value," he explained. "We want to show the sheer brutality of these superheroes fighting, like the ground getting torn up or costumes getting ripped and splattered with blood. If you did a killing blow, it's really important for us, especially to be authentic to the [intellectual property]."</p><p dir="ltr">Willette also reveals that the team has put a unique spin on the battle damage concept through "offensive" and "defensive" versions of it. If one character has a big lead over another, the leading character will still have blood spots on their costumes or fists caked in red--it's just the <em>other</em> character's blood rather than their own.</p><p dir="ltr">"We are really conscious of how these things would affect both fighters," Willette said. "If a character is at low health, for another example, their idle animation will be different to show how tired they are. They're saying, 'All right, I'm messed up, but I'll keep going.' We really wanted to have those as part of the storytelling of the fight action."</p><p dir="ltr">The team at Quarter Up Games wants Invincible VS to appeal to as many players as possible, and it hopes to achieve it through one simple approach: Make each player feel like an absolute badass.</p><p dir="ltr">"When you pick up that game pad for the first time and you can just mash and you feel awesome, that's great. That means you're going to stick around longer," Willette said. "If you've never played a fighting game before, I'd love for this to be your first fighting game. And if lapsed, we'd love for you to come back for this because we love fighting games. We want to make you fans.</p><p dir="ltr">"This is a love letter from us saying, 'Yeah, we love Invincible, we love fighting games and we want you to come play.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Invincible VS is set for launch in 2026 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-lost-save-game-pass<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For a minute there, Game Pass was one of the best deals in video games. Aside from easy access to the Xbox catalogue, you’d regularly be served games that you would either never try or tell yourself you would when there was a sale. <a href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-is-good-overture-annoucement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Lies of P</em></a><em> </em>was one of those games for me. Though I have since <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled Game Pass</a> because of Microsoft’s ongoing support of the genocide in Gaza, I wish I had done the sensible thing and bought the game on Steam to begin with, or at&nbsp; least archived my save, because not doing so screwed up my save<em>.</em></p><p><em>Lies of P: Overture </em>is a DLC expansion that was shadow-dropped last week. I have not beaten <em>Overture, </em>but my impressions based on what I’ve played is that Neowiz still has the juice. The DLC is brutal, they give P a shotgun arm, and the monsters are thoroughly disgusting. So far I’m happy.</p><figure><figcaption>Lads, we're back. Credit: NEOWIZ</figcaption></figure><p>But because I had previously played <em>Lies of P </em>on Game Pass, I realized when I got code for <em>Overture</em> that I had to fish out my old save file. I think I had assumed before canceling that I had bought the game on Steam during a sale but no, I hadn’t. Turns out my save file is tied to Microsoft’s service forever. What’s worse, <em>Lies of P </em>is no longer on Game Pass. So if I just wanted to get my save file using a trial of Game Pass, cancelling it, and transferring the save to Steam, I would need to buy the game first. Even beyond the ethics of supporting Microsoft, I’m not going to buy a game on their store voluntarily.&nbsp;</p><p>But wait, sometimes the save file is still on your computer! There’s <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3042416648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thorough guides</a> on how to convert a Game Pass save file to a Steam one, and I <em>had</em> installed it to play it not too long ago. Maybe it was still kicking around on my hard drive.</p><p>Though Game Pass is fine as a service, it is also a Microsoft product, meaning the way it installs on your PC is generally a nightmare. Unlike Steam, which just puts stuff in Program Files like an adult, you have to make sure “hidden items” are visible, go into your AppData folder and navigate to an obtusely-named folder in Packages. Even in ideal circumstances this would be annoying, but when I followed every available guide I was able to find the remnants of <em>Lies of P </em>on my hard drive, but not the one specific folder that would have contained my save. Either something had changed since the guide was written, something happened with my computer, or Windows had deleted the save off my drive.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Hope you're ready to do this stuff. Credit: Valve/Monkey</figcaption></figure><p>I am <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LiesOfP/comments/1l5iwlr/can_i_get_my_save_back_from_gamepass_pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">apparently not alone here</a>. I did find at least one other person who had been in the exact same situation on r/liesofp. I contemplated speed running through the entire game, since I have done that multiple times. I got to the end of the first chapter before I realized that I don’t have time to do that. This left one solution: download another person’s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/liesofp/mods/94" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meticulously curated save file </a>from NexusMods.</p><figure><figcaption>Hope you're ready to do this stuff. Credit: Valve</figcaption></figure><p>The save file worked wonderfully and contained every available weapon and potential item in the game. This is basically everything I could ask for, and I should state the person who uploaded that save is a saint. But doing that does feel a little wrong. This wasn’t <em>my Pinocchio</em>, and though I can respec him, it felt like living in another person’s skin. What’s more, this file is on its third playthrough, and every added layer of New Game Plus makes the game harder, so even though I am well positioned gear-wise for the DLC, everything in it hits like an 18-wheeler. Apparently, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LiesOfP/comments/1l6d9ki/i_need_ng1_save_file/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at least one other person is in this situation as well</a>.</p><p>At the end of the day this whole mess could have been avoided. Archiving is ultimately my responsibility, and I’m going to <a href="https://github.com/mtkennerly/ludusavi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">start running it on a schedule</a>. I knew the DLC was coming up, and I wish I had had the foresight to just back up my saves or buy the game on Steam to begin with. Because if you play a game on a service where you don’t own the game, can you even say that your experiences are yours?</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-demo"><h3>Baby Steps Makes Me Feel Bad That I Stopped Meditating</h3></a><p>When did I become the least patient person in the world</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/geoff-keighleys-yellow-sneakers"><h3>You Can Always Count On Sneakers</h3></a><p>The one thing you can count on Summer Game Fest for</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We don't really get to write about Playdate, that bespoke games console with a built in crank, here on RPS very much because it is very much not a computer (though former EIC Katharine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playdate-review">did review it back when it launched</a>). Well, not in the way we need it to be for our purposes. But I have an excuse to do so today! Over the weekend at the PC Gaming Show, a trailer for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/panic">Panic</a>-published, faux-streaming service <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blippo">Blippo+</a> was shown off, one that captured my attention quite quickly.
</p>

<p>
You see, Blippo+ is technically already available as part of Playdate Season 2, releasing 1-bit dithered versions of fictitious TV episodes one week at a time, just like in the good old days. The version of Blippo+ shown over the weekend however, is a full-scale FMV game that recreates the feeling of channel surfing through off-cable TV, filled with budget productions featuring all sorts of shows like the news, sitcoms, and the weather.

It's all made with actual vintage analog broadcasting equipment, which is right up my alley. I'll let you in on an odd pet peeve of mine: I hate it when films and TV just slap on a fake VHS filter or something of that sort and call it a day. You can always tell it's filmed on a modern camera, and it bothers me to no end, so I really appreciate the effort put into Blippo+.
</p>
<p>
There's some kind of "time-hopping" mechanic that lets you go back and forth between weeks worth of television, slowly uncovering the strange lore of this world that's like ours, but… different. It's been an eon (translation: actually only about 5 years or so) since I last did any channel hopping of any kind, time travel or not, so I'm quite curious to dive into this one.
</p>
<p>
It's also being written by Claire L. Evans and directed by Jona Bechtolt, as in the duo that make-up the musical act YACHT. Not a creative team I would have expected, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/last-flag-announcement-summer-game-fest/">but Imagine Dragons are making that not Team Fortress 2 shooter Last Flag</a> that got revealed at Geoff's Two Hours of Video Games Show, so, anything's possible I guess.
</p>
<p>
Blippo+ doesn't have an exact release date just yet, but it is expected to launch sometime this coming fall/ autumn, and you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3323850/Blippo/">here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-director-refuses-to-apologize-for-make-fps-great-again-hat-then-apologizes-anyway<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Splitgate 2, 1047 Games’ “Halo with portals”, launched just last week, marked by a celebratory announcement of a battle royale mode at Summer Game Fest. But while this should have been a triumphant moment for the studio and the community, the launch has instead been marked by not one, not two, but three different controversies that have led to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2918300/Splitgate_2/#app_reviews_hash" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>mixed Steam reviews</u></a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Splitgate/comments/1l5jk86/everyone_after_summer_game_fest_cringe_ceo_moment/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>disappointed fans</u></a>, and a game community divided between those who support the studio’s actions and those who have been put off from playing Splitgate 2 at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First, at the game’s big battle royale reveal at Summer Game Fest, Proulx wore a hat that read, “Make FPS Great Again” onstage, which drew criticism for its reference to U.S. President Donald Trump’s signature “Make America Great Again” hats, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/01/27/689191278/the-symbol-of-the-maga-hat" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>which come with significant political baggage</u></a>. Then, Proulx called out Call of Duty in his speech onstage, saying he’s “tired of playing the same Call of Duty every year,” which drew ire from developers and fans of Call of Duty. And then on top of that, as the game launched, fans immediately called out a $145 microtransaction bundle on the game’s store that seemed to fly in the face of everything 1047 Games claimed it stood for.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I spoke to game director Ian Proulx in the wake of all this, and found him surprisingly sanguine for a company leader currently in the spotlight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, I am surprised, to be honest, to dive right into it, we didn't expect this to be nearly as controversial as it was and we didn't intend for it to be,” he said. “In terms of the numbers, there have been good numbers, there's been a lot of negativity, but also positivity to match that people love the game. We just crossed the two and a half million player threshold, we tripled our player count. So there's good and bad, I think time will tell mixed emotions for sure, but overall feeling good.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obviously, I had to start by asking him about the hat. What was that all about?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'll start by saying, we talked a lot about this, we did not intend for this to be any sort of political statement,” Proulx replied. “I mean, I think we meant for it to be taken at face value, which is, we're not happy with the state of FPS games. I myself, as a gamer, my friends and I, we talk about how bored we are. We thought this was... It's something that's been meme'd to death. Even <a href="https://www.threads.com/@hideo_kojima/post/DHQjgfWSP8h/photo-posted-by-hideo-kojima-hideo_kojima" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>three months ago, Hideo Kojima had a hat that said, ‘Make TV great again.</u></a>’ [Author's note: While this photo was reposted in March on Threads, the <a href="https://x.com/NicolasWR/status/939367950003269632" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">photo itself appears to be from 2017</a>.] And his hat was red and there was no controversy there, so we talked about it, and we thought, okay, maybe some people will take it the wrong way, but it's been meme'd to death. It kind of says what we feel, which is we want to just make an awesome game and we're not happy with the state of FPS.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I don't regret what I said to be candid...my intent is I'm speaking my truth and my intent is to make a great game for everybody.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I pointed out to Proulx that the MAGA hat and its message have become associated for many with feelings of discomfort and even fear due to current political events. I also <a href="https://apnews.com/live/immigration-protests-los-angeles-6-10-2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>noted the protests going on just a few miles away from Summer Game Fest</u></a>, where Los Angelenos were taking to the streets to defend their immigrant neighbors from ongoing raids by ICE under President Trump’s orders, and where the National Guard is being deployed <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/10/nx-s1-5428579/protests-against-ice-have-continued-in-la-into-the-week-heres-what-to-know" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>despite protests remaining largely peaceful</u></a>. What does Proulx say to Splitgate fans and community members who felt genuinely emotionally distraught seeing the hat, in light of all that?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think the best I can say is we're not trying to send any sort of political message and we're moving on from this,” he replied. “Our intent is, we just want to make a great game, we want to listen to the fans, we've always been all about the community. And that's not just community in terms of listening to feedback to make the game better, but it's also in terms of making a community that people want to be a part of where the devs are engaging with the players, it's a positive community and so that's our ambition. Obviously, right now, it doesn't feel that way but we're getting back to our focus and that's what our focus is. So we're putting this behind us, we're moving forward, we're just going to keep listening to the community and making a great game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I pushed one more time on this topic, noting that <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/1931162849977442371?t=jway7_wXhk9W9VauRWSkrA&amp;s=19" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>in a tweet Proulx said he was “not here to apologize”</u></a>, and here he seemed to be deliberately avoiding apologizing as well. He confirmed that was the case.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don't regret what I said to be candid. I think that I stand by it and my intent is I'm speaking my truth and my intent is to make a great game for everybody.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My interview with Proulx, where he committed to not apologizing, took place on Sunday. Today, however, Proulx posted another video… apologizing.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The truth is I am sorry. And the reason I am sorry is because of what this has done to the community.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“I want to apologize. And genuinely, you don’t have to believe me. But the truth is I am sorry. And the reason I am sorry is because of what this has done to the community. The most important thing to me right now is I want to have an amazing community… I hate seeing division. And that’s what I’m seeing now, on both sides. There’s division in the community, and for that I am truly sorry. And again, I’ll reiterate, I do stand by the intent of this, which is, the intent truly is, take it at face value. We do want to improve this genre. We do feel that the genre is in a bad state. And we want to make FPS games as amazing as possible. But I also understand that it’s not just about intent, it’s about impact, and the platform that we have had has had a negative impact, and for that I’m truly sorry.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">No excuses, I'm sorry. <a href="https://t.co/4dgOxrSXUJ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/4dgOxrSXUJ</a></p>— Splitgate 2 (@Splitgate) <a href="https://twitter.com/Splitgate/status/1932502832281694366?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Back to our interview, we moved on to the second part of the controversy: Proulx’s comments on the shooter genre and specifically his mention of the Call of Duty franchise. During his speech onstage at the event, Proulx said, "I grew up playing Halo. And I'm tired of playing the same Call of Duty every year, and I wish we could have Titanfall 3." In response, he’s received criticism from Splitgate fans, Call of Duty fans, and developers both for using his platform at the show to disparage other video games, as well as for calling out Call of Duty when Splitgate 2 contains many of the same features, including the free-to-play battle royale mode Proulx revealed onstage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On this front, Proulx admits his studio went too far in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Splitgate/comments/1l5ykvq/the_splitgate_page_just_flamed_a_cod_dev_lmao/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>response on Twitter</u></a> to a Call of Duty developer who criticized his remarks. The developer tweeted, “‘make fps great again’ and its splitgate”, prompting the official Splitgate account to quote tweet it with, “Which Call of Duty does your team make again? I can’t tell them apart.” Both tweets have since been deleted, and Proulx said he was not the person behind that particular remark.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yeah, so I will say there was a tweet that we put out that we have since deleted, and I will apologize for that one. I mean, everything is on me of course as the CEO, that was not my post. My posts are me, right? They're videos of me, I try to be really just honest and off-script and just talk to the fans directly, but there's no excuse for that one and we did take it down.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless, Proulx stood by what he said onstage. He said he doesn’t have a specific beef with Call of Duty, but misses the “good old days” of the game. I asked him what that means, and he said he misses the “newness and the innovation”, citing Call of Duty 4. “And then Modern Warfare 2 taking it to the next level, whether it was the campaign, the multiplayer, all the skins to grind for, the lack of skill-based matchmaking where you just felt like it was very organic. And it feels like there's sort of a lack of innovation now that they're putting out quality and polish, but they're not necessarily pushing the bar forward.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Splitgate 2 Game Awards Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, there’s the microtransactions. Splitgate 2 is free-to-play with microtransactions, and when it launched on June 6, players immediately began expressing their displeasure over one particular microtransaction: a $145 bundle, discounted to $80 for launch. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-slashes-145-cosmetic-bundle-price-following-fan-backlash" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>1047 Games cut the price dramatically down to $40 almost immediately</u></a>, along with the prices of a number of other items.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, in a video published just before our interview took place, Proulx apologized for the pricing situation, saying he only learned about the bundle pricing shortly after he got offstage at Summer Game Fest. He attested that 1047 Games’ former head of monetization, who “happened to come from Call of Duty”, had been “very aggressive on the pricing,” and that prices had been even higher before. After his departure from the company, Proulx claimed 1047 leadership did a reevaluation of the pricing and lowered most prices, but “things slipped through the cracks.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Why we went from $80 to $40. <a href="https://t.co/8VC7Ku1qHQ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/8VC7Ku1qHQ</a></p>— Splitgate 2 (@Splitgate) <a href="https://twitter.com/Splitgate/status/1931851534511329731?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 8, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">I asked him how he, as head of the company, was unaware of the pricing of bundles for the game he was launching. Proulx reiterated that he took responsibility for what happened, saying he had been “very focused on getting through the beta.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We got through beta, we had other fires to attend to so I was focused on servers and just trying to get us through that. I was not thinking at all about monetization because I was just like, we're not going to make any money, it doesn't even matter if people can't play the game. And so that was where my head was at for the last two weeks was like, we got to just make sure this game is great, fix the servers, keep the lights on, fix the issues. Okay, we've made it barely, now we've got to go launch this game. And then it was a kind of, what the fuck moment, like how did we not catch this?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I pointed to Proulx’s comment in the video that the person he alleges is responsible had previously worked on Call of Duty, which seemed to fit with accusations that he was taking shots at the game. Proulx replied that it was “a funny coincidence, but a hundred percent the truth.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We talked a bit more about what happened, with Proulx reiterating that 1047 Games never intends to do anything like that expensive bundle ever again, and that they’re refunding players who already purchased it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Whether you like my original statement or not, that is what I am trying to accomplish here, and I don't need to talk about the statement anymore,” he says. “What I'm trying to accomplish here is I want to build a brand, and a community, and a product that people want to support where we are listening, that's the best way to do it. That's not how it's done anymore, and that is how I want to do it. You tell us your feedback, we're going to take that to heart, we're going to iterate, and we're going to actually take action quickly. We're not going to sit around and wait for the proper PR statement. That's why a lot of times when we talk to the players, I don't have a script, I just turn my phone on and we just find out what comes out of my mouth and that's what we go with.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To wrap it up, I asked Proulx if he’s learned anything from this trifecta of incidents. He’s made it clear 1047 Games doesn’t intend to offer expensive bundles in the future, but what about the Call of Duty comments and the Make FPS Great Again hat? Will this incident inform how he presents himself in the future?</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I've just kind of learned just the impact that little things like this can have on people.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yes,” Proulx said. “So I'd say the biggest lesson, just kind of realizing the platform that we have, it's got a lot more weight than we realized and also just the seriousness of everything in this day and age. We intended to put out a meme, we intended to put out something that summarized how we feel, truly, but also it was a joke. It's a joke that's been done to death and has literally been done by Hideo Kojima, and we thought, well, this is a good data point for how a similar reaction will occur. We also specifically chose to do a black hat instead of a red one, not that that, I don't know if that makes a difference. So I think I've just kind of learned just the impact that little things like this can have on people and so we're trying to be very thoughtful about it going forward. And we're trying to get back to focusing, there's all this stuff in the air I just want to move on, I want to make a fun game. That's what we're going to do.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite all the criticism, Proulx doesn’t feel that any of the issues over the last week have impacted Splitgate 2 as a game. “I think there's so many games that have done well over time that have had controversies, whatever it is. I think it did get us a lot of attention, whether good or bad and now it's on us as developers to improve and actually act on feedback. And so if we do that, I think we're going to succeed. And if we don't, I don't think any of this would've mattered.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-acquires-zombicide-ip-from-board-game-publisher-cmon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Asmodee is buying the <em>Zombicide</em> IP. The <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-rebrands-for-30th-anniversary-with-inspired-by-players-label" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recently rebranded</a> tabletop publisher has initiated a new series of strategic acquisitions of prominent board game IPs and studios. Its first most recent purchase is of the co-op zombie game series owned by CMON.</p>



<p>According to a report from <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/06/10/asmodee-buys-zombicide-ip-from-struggling-cmon-as-first-move-in-new-acquisition-spree/" rel="nofollow">Board Game Wire</a>, Asmodee has purchased the <em>Zombicide</em> IP from CMON for an undisclosed amount of money. This sale is, in part, connected to CMON's ongoing financial struggles. These troubles are substantive enough, the company is&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-reduces-staff-and-pauses-board-game-development-amid-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">scaling back production</a>&nbsp;due to the proposed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/adjusted-us-trade-tariffs-to-china-still-poses-problems-to-board-game-industry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">US trade tariffs</a>.</p>

<p>Asmodee CEO Thomas Koegler said, “We are proud the iconic Zombicide IP further strengthens our tabletop games portfolio and allows us to reinforce our presence in key geographies. I can’t wait for the team to get to work at what’s coming next for this fantastic IP.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>&nbsp;Zombicide</em> is one of the earliest success stories of tabletop Kickstarter campaigns. The first campaign was held in 2012 with the simple premise of you and your friends fighting through the zombie apocalypse. It was such a simple, cathartic premise, it spawned dozens of expansions and spin-offs.</p>

<p>Notable entries in the <em>Zombicide</em> franchise include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/zombicide-dceased-brings-anti-life-to-table" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>DCeased</em></a>, where Superman and friends must fend off Anti-Life zombies, a crossover with the Winchester brothers with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-games-announces-supernatural-zombicide-packs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Zombicide: Supernatural</em></a>, a tabletop adaptation of the Zack Snyder film <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-announces-army-of-dead-board-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Army of the Dead</em></a>, and even a licensed spin-off featuring the art and mascot of heavy metal band, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/iron-maiden-goes-plastic-with-zombicide-crossover" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Iron Maiden</a>.</p>

<p>Regardless of its monetary value, the sale of Zombicide is illustrative of CMON's ongoing financial struggles. In roughly the same time frame, the company sold five other board game IPs:&nbsp;<em>Blood Rage</em>, <em>Rising Sun</em>, <em>Ankh: Gods of Egypt</em>, <em>Arcadia Quest</em>, and <em>Starcadia Quest</em>, to Tabletop Tycoon.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, CMON is still selling what remains of their stock of other board game franchises they own. These include <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-summons-new-cthulhu-death-may-die-to-kickstarter" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cthulhu: Death May Die</em></a>, <em>Rising Sun</em>, and <em>Marvel United.</em></p>

              <section>

                <p> There were more souls-likes than I could muster the interest in at Summer Game Fest 2025. I've never been one to enjoy the genre in most cases anyway, and seeing how many games were leaning into gameplay loops of dodge-roll showdowns with gigantic, spongey bosses had me checked out at times during the various showcases over the past week. But I played one game that borrows from the genre and didn't turn me away. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/end-of-abyss/" data-ref-id="5000-681505">End of Abyss</a> takes a few touchstones from games like Dark Souls, ties it in with a Little-Nightmares-in-space aesthetic, and brings it all together in a cleverly creepy twin-stick shooter.</p><p dir="ltr">End of Abyss comes from Section 9 Interactive, a new studio created in part by former Tarsier Studio developers, the team behind Little Nightmares and its sequel. The Little Nightmares influence can definitely be felt in End of Abyss. Though the enemy and world design are much different, trading the stuff of childhood night terrors for coldly blue-tinted isolation akin to a sci-fi horror story, there's something about it that feels familiar. Maybe it's the nameless, voiceless character being chased by fleshy monsters. Or maybe it's their brightly colored jacket--here a lime green as opposed to Little Nightmare's yellow raincoat.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eot8qV7CuTA" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/eot8qV7CuTA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Luckily, the protagonist in End of Abyss can defend themselves, unlike those in Tarsier's games. Using a pistol with unlimited ammo, or other found weapons like a shotgun I discovered in my play session, the game's twin-stick shooting felt well-implemented. It wasn't very sticky, which I liked, as it gave it an anxiety-inducing effect. Missing shots meant the enemies were able to close the distance and caused me to dodge them, either out of the room so I could create a bottleneck in a doorway, or just catch my breath. Some enemies grew long, giraffe-like necks, which they swung at me with sneakily far reach. Others came in packs of several small bugs that would jump on me, causing me to shake them off and book it, or try to knife them on their approach.</p><p dir="ltr">The souls-like inspirations can be felt in a few ways some players will be familiar with. For one, the map feels circular in that satisfying way From Software and its lineage utilize a lot. Exploring every space felt key, as it allowed me to find hidden caches of weapon or suit upgrade materials, but just as important, I could unlock passageways that helped me loop back around to earlier areas.</p><p dir="ltr">Because the enemies respawn when you save at a mysterious type of pod--not to be confused with a traditional bonfire--these shortcuts helped evade the same sequence of enemies each time I came back to the area to save or upgrade my character. There are no corpse runs, but the game will punish you for failing to save manually, so these shortcuts back to a safe haven will be vital for survival.</p><p dir="ltr">I got to take on a huge boss monster too, which, despite its sizeable health bar, didn't prove too tricky given my abundance of shotgun ammo I'd crafted by then, but I expect this was a kindness afforded to me in the demo only, and in the full game, I'd have to scramble a bit more. The boss battle felt soulsy too, where each hit devastated me, so I could only afford to mess up very few times. I'm hoping the game can strike a nice balance between being challenging yet not brutal, and co-creator Mattias Ottvall told me that's the team's vision as well.</p><p dir="ltr">From what I've played so far, the game's best attribute is its atmosphere. There is a chilling stillness to the world. Enemies often stand around, or even seem to lie in wait, until you approach them, sometimes sneak-attacking from behind a doorway or out of a shadow. This leaves you alone much of the time, unsure of what's around each corner. Your scanner device, which can locate secret caches or puzzle areas, echoes through the ghostly halls of the alien world. I suspect the game won't care to answer many questions about where and when the game takes place, and I'm perfectly happy to go along for that ride into the unknown.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not exactly a horror game, Ottvall told me, but the game has inched closer to that identity during development because its small team featured mostly artwork-focused developers. The mechanics of the game naturally shifted to adapt to the art-driven game. That was an interesting wrinkle for me to learn, as it suggests that the game may have looked quite different if the balance between gameplay designers and world designers was skewed the other way. Instead, we got the icy-blue End of Abyss you can see in the trailer above, which is definitely more up my alley than a demanding combat-first game the devs may have once been targeting.</p><p dir="ltr">As someone who loves Little Nightmares, enjoys twin-stick shooters, and doesn't care for souls-likes, I feel what I saw so far is enough of those first two elements to allow me not to get frustrated by its third element. End of Abyss seems to be the start of an intriguing new studio. It's coming to Epic Games Store, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-is-out-now-brings-free-access-to-the-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft has announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-6-siege-x-launches-in-june-bringing-the-biggest-evolution-in-the-games-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rainbow Six Siege X</a> is now available on all platforms (PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and Amazon Luna). The sizable update improves graphics and adds new content, but also brings free access to the game, allowing newcomers to join with a selection of operators and play Unranked, Quick Match, and Dual Front modes without paying. Certain features like Ranked playlists, Siege Cup, additional operators, and cosmetics require payment to unlock.</p>
<p>Two of the available options are the Elite Edition, which grants access to all game modes, including Ranked playlists and Siege Cup, and 16 additional operators for $19.99, and the Ultimate Edition, which also unlocks all game modes, the Ranked playlists and the Siege Cup, but adds immediate access to 52 Operators and the Disruptor Pack for a price of $39.99.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rainbow Six Siege X: Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BI9fgQY0d5I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In Rainbow Six Siege X, players will experience the brand-new permanent 6v6 mode, Dual Front. For the first time, Dual Front mixes Attackers and Defenders to seize enemy sectors while defending their own. During matches, players can respawn, change their selected operator, and complete time-limited Neutral Sector assignments. Siege X also introduces significant upgrades and overhauls to the graphics, gameplay, and audio.</p>
<p>At launch, five modernized 5v5 maps received upgrades to lighting, shadows, and resolution: Clubhouse, Chalet, Border, Bank, and Kafe. Three new 5v5 maps will be modernized each season thereafter.</p>
<p>The gameplay of Rainbow Six Siege X is deeper thanks to new destructible items, including gas pipes, metal detectors, and fire extinguishers. Players can interact with these items strategically to outplay their opponents. Rappel navigation and momentum movement have also been improved, providing more fluid controls. Players can now sprint horizontally along walls on rappel and maneuver around building corners.</p>
<p>The audio propagation and reverberation have been overhauled, making the game sound more realistic than before. This enables players to gather critical intelligence through audio cues, allowing them to pinpoint the location and type of rooms where enemy players are on the map. Lastly, Ubisoft Montréal has added a new onboarding experience that will help new players build their skills and confidence.</p>

                <p>Funcom's Dune: Awakening is finally out on PC, but you might be wondering if it's also headed to consoles. Now that the game has launched on PC, Funcom re-affirmed that Awakening is, indeed, headed to console platforms, but not until 2026.</p><p>There is no specific 2026 release date, however, nor is there a set of confirmed console platforms, but Xbox and PlayStation systems seem like a safe bet. Whether or not Switch 2 may be in the mix, too, is unknown.</p><p>Awakening blasted off on Steam to big results, as the $50 game is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">currently the No. 1 best-selling game</a> and is inside Steam's top 10 most-played games, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">clocking more than 135,000 concurrent players.</a></p><p>Funcom highlighted the fact that Awakening is available on PC as part of a "classic business model" where you "buy once and own it." This is the full 1.0 launch, not early access, and there are no subscription fees or microtransactions.</p><p>There is a $25 season pass that includes a range of content, including the sandworm, hiroptera, kulon, and Muad'Dib creatures, which are available now. The three other DLC packs in the season pass are coming later this year and in 2026.</p><p>Awakening is a multiplayer survival game set on the planet of Arrakis, based on the work of author Frank Herbert and most recently brought to life in the Dune films from Denis Villeneuve. Players can choose to align with Atreides or Harkonnen and then take part in missions that "influence the shared world."</p><p>As for the movie series, <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/denis-villeneuve-dune-3-plans-1236119697/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Villeneuve is coming back to make a third Dune movie.</a></p>

Until now, only the Arctis Nova 5 Wireless supported this feature, making the Nova 3 Wireless an alternative--and even more affordable--choice compared to the $130 Nova 5 line.</p><p dir="ltr">The Arctis Nova 3 Wireless is available in two models: the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0F94KTF6C?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nova 3P Wireless</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0F9548L67?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nova 3X Wireless</a>. The Nova 3P Wireless supports PlayStation, Switch, PC, and mobile devices, while the 3X is compatible with Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, PC, and mobile devices. The headsets can connect to up to two devices at the same time--one via the included 2.4Ghz wireless dongle and the other via Bluetooth. However, like the Arctis Nova 5, the Arctis Nova 3 Wireless does not support simultaneous playback from both devices. Instead, you can swap between the two connections on the fly. That said, by connecting to your mobile device via Bluetooth, you can modify the headset's selected EQ preset in the Arctis mobile app, even while listening to your console or PC over 2.4Ghz.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond slightly different platform compatibilities, the Nova 3X Wireless and Nova 3P Wireless are otherwise identical. They both sport the same lightweight design and flexible headbands as other Arctis Nova headsets, and feature detachable microphones, custom-tuned neodymium magnetic drivers, and up to 40 hours of battery life on a single charge. They also support fast-charging, which can recharge up to nine hours of battery after just 15 minutes. Both are available for $110.</p></div>                      </div><p>We haven't tested the Arctis Nova 3, but several other Arctis models landed on our list of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-wireless-gaming-headset/1100-6525389/" data-ref-id="1100-6525389">best gaming headsets</a>, including the premium <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B0D1S99TD7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Mobile-Headset/dp/B0CD99Q59P?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arctis Nova 7</a>, so we’re optimistic about the Nova 3's performance. There are plenty of other fantastic SteelSeries headsets to check out, including the budget-friendly wired Arctis Nova 1. Its audio quality and wired connection aren’t ideal for all situations, but it’s hard to beat its low price.</p><p>We've compiled a list of all the headsets in SteelSeries' Arctis Nova line below. Most of these headsets are available in a variety of models, and those with the “X” classification add Xbox support along with support for platforms like PS5, Switch, and PC. So if you’re worried about using your headset across multiple devices (or are specifically looking for Xbox support), these are the ones to get. Those with a "P", meanwhile, are built for PlayStation and lack Xbox support.</p><h2>All SteelSeries Arctis Headsets</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-System-Gaming-Headset/dp/B09ZWF9BCJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wired (PS5, PS4, Switch, PC)</a> -- $195 (<del>$280</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B09ZWCYQTX?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless (PS5, PS4, Switch, PC)</a> -- $301 (<del>$380</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B0D1S99TD7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro Wireless (Xbox, PS5, PS4, Switch, PC)</a> -- $300</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B0D1S99TD7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7P</a> -- $147 (<del>$200</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Headset/dp/B0B15QM5LL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7</a> -- $153 (<del>$200</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Mobile-Headset/dp/B0CD99Q59P?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X</a> -- $200</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B0D2YBQQ1P?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5</a> -- $108 (<del>$150</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B0D2YBKD62?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5P</a> -- $120 (<del>$150</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-System-Headset/dp/B0D2YC9GM9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 5X</a> -- $123 (<del>$150</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0F94KTF6C?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3P Wireless (PlayStation, Switch, PC)</a> -- $110</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Wireless-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0F9548L67?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3X Wireless (Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, PC)</a> -- $110</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-Platform-Gaming-Headset/dp/B09ZWMYHCT?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 3 (Wired)</a> -- $78 (<del>$100</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/SteelSeries-Arctis-Multi-System-Gaming-Headset/dp/B0B8Q4CR52?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteelSeries Arctis Nova 1 (Wired)</a> -- $50 (<del>$60</del>)</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-book-sale-buy-one-get-one-50-percent-off-fantasy-sci-fi-horror-novel-box-sets/1100-6527091/">Amazon B1G1 50% Off Book Sale - Popular New Novels, Box Sets, And All-Time Greats</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-nintendo-switch-2-controller-compatibility-how-to-guide-best-switch-2-controller-deals/1100-6532267/">8BitDo's Best Controllers Get Switch 2 Support - How To Set Them Up And Why It's A Big Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-5440-page-complete-history-of-middle-earth-box-set-is-only-106-at-amazon/1100-6526926/">The 5,440-Page Complete History Of Middle Earth Box Set Is Only $106 At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp;

		<p>Brother, I am exhausted. Apologies this is late. I'm writing this on the floor of LAX, crossing my fingers the slight delay on my flight does not become a big delay. (I think it'll be OK.) I'm glad I made time for half of Summer Game Fest, despite a family wedding overlapping, and you'll hear about what I played, saw, and, uh, <em>experienced</em> while in Los Angeles. It was, of course, ominous to get a push notification saying "Trump has sent in the National Guard to Los Angeles" when my flight was landing in Los Angeles. It only became more distressing when the protests themselves were being felt—and having consequences on—Summer Game Fest itself. And that's all without talking about how some dipshits shot me with a paintball gun while I walked home to my hotel. (It was very scary and my arm started bleeding but I'm alright.)</p><p>-pk, who will try to unwind on his flight with the new <em>Predator</em> film</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>The upcoming schedule for Remap</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Steam Next Fest</em> – Sad to be missing this, but I'll be downloading a whole bunch of demos to check out this week, I'm sure.

Like every fest before it, there are hundreds (probably thousands) of great games to check out free demos for, most of them indies, too. We’re doing our best to wade through these demos and check out games we’re excited for, ones to watch, and ones we had never heard of before playing during Steam Next Fest.</p><p>Below, we have a selection of the best Steam Next Fest demos we’ve played so far, and as the week rolls on, we’ll continue to update it with new games we want to surface to our readers. The current Steam Next Fest started yesterday, Monday, June 9, and will run through Monday, June 16, so keep this page bookmarked as we’ll be updating it daily with demos you need to check out.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-launches-on-august-8th-for-only-50-new-gameplay-trailer-released/">Mafia: The Old Country</a> is due to arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on August 8, 2025, and in the lead up to its launch, developer Hangar 13 is doing everything it can to showcase how improved this prequel entry to the series is since we last checked in with the Mafia franchise.</p>
<p>The latest of those efforts is a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwkvXUiG8do">developer diary video</a>, "<em>Art Meets Technology,</em>" which digs into how much better looking Mafia: The Old Country is compared to the rest of the series thanks to the new technologies available in Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>"<em>It allows us to tell that story in a way that we just wouldn't be able to, with other technologies,</em>" said art director Steve Noake. He continued, "<em>F</em><em>rom Metahuman, to Nanite, to Lumen. These are all different technologies which we are pushing to the max, to be honest. It's allowing us to grasp the intricacies of a performance, it's allowing us to automate some parts of the process, to be able to get to a point where we can really start to put our human thumbprints on some of these assets.</em>"</p>
<p><iframe title="Breaking Omertà: &quot;Art Meets Technology&quot; | Mafia: The Old Country" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gwkvXUiG8do?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Lead character artist Ivan Rylka added that there's a "<em>notable improvement</em>" in what's possible with Unreal Engine 5 versus what Hangar 13 was capable of doing prior to UE5, and confidently claimed "<em>I have no hesitation that this will be the best looking Mafia game in the franchise.</em>"</p>
<p>It's clear that Hangar 13 is putting in every effort to make Mafia: The Old Country look and feel as good as possible. It'll be interesting to see if it's more than just looks by the time it arrives this coming August.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/684438/ninja-gaiden-4-hands-on-xbox-showcase-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24350352/ninja-gaiden-4-xbox"><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></a> was one of several games that Xbox showed off in its games showcase over the weekend. And during its Summer Game Fest-adjacent in-person preview event, I got the chance to play it for myself. I’ve never played <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> before and was skeptical that the game’s generic dark aesthetic, which feels straight out of 2012, could capture my interest. But after a short hands-on demo and an interview with the game’s developers, I’m less wary and powerfully intrigued. </p><p>Despite the “4” in the title, <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> represents a soft reset for the franchise. You play as Yakumo, a ninja of the Raven Clan, who must save Tokyo from corruption. The game feels like a hack-and-slash beat ‘em up with extreme emphasis on the hacking and slashing. Yakumo uses a number of weapons and abilities at his disposal, including swords, throwing knives, and an ability that briefly transforms him into a demonic raven for an extra burst of power. </p><p>My time with the demo was short, consisting of Yakumo ninja-flipping through ruined city streets, fighting packs of cybernetic demons. In combat, you can string together attacks, producing visually impressive combos. One of the things that I most appreciated about the combat system was that it included one of my favorite moves in any action game — an air recovery ability. If you’re hit into the air, you can quickly tap a button to right yourself and get back into the fight rather than get knocked away. Whoever at Team Ninja / PlatinumGames is a <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> fan, I see you.</p><p>Also, along the way, I encountered a number of Yakumo’s allies (including one voiced by Brandon “<a href="https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Garrus_Vakarian">Garrus Vakarian</a>” Keener, whose voice I’d know anywhere) who introduced me to the world, giving me power-ups and combat advice.</p><p>This game is bloody, cartoonishly so. Once I’ve whittled down my enemies’ health, I can dismember them in a number of increasingly brutal ways. It was so over the top that it veered into absurd territory, and I found myself laughing out loud in an otherwise quiet demo room. I wondered if the tension between the hardcore seriousness of Yakumo and his friends versus the goofy violence was intentional, but according to the developers, the game is working as intended.</p><p>“<em>Ninja Gaiden</em> has always been known as a very violent game, but we didn’t want to just make it grotesque,” says Yuji Nakao, game producer and director at PlatinumGames, speaking through a translator. “Because if we did that, you’d get tired of it.”</p><p>Team Ninja partnered with PlatinumGames to develop the title, and the inclusion of the studio that made <em>Bayonetta</em> informs a bit of that tonal dissonance. <em>Bayonetta </em>is campy and fun, and I can see elements of that camp in <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>.</p><p>“When we were working with PlatinumGames,” says Masakazu Hirayama, the producer and director at Team Ninja. “We wanted to bring their unique style approach to the action genre and inject that into the series.”</p><p>Unless you count ports, remasters, or spinoffs, it’s been more than 12 years since the last original title in the <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> series. In that time, a new crop of gamers, who are probably more familiar with <em>Bayonetta</em>, have come up. Meanwhile, there’s still an older generation running around with memories of Ryu Hayabusa and <em>Ninja Gaiden Black</em>. The result of the partnership between PlatinumGames and Team Ninja is a game that has elements that’ll appeal to different generations of players.</p><p>“<em>Ninja Gaiden</em> is about having a very diverse tool set that allows you to feel like that ultimate super ninja,” says Hirayama. “And I think you’ll see that the new protagonist and his new tool set opens up a lot of new possibilities.”</p><p>The new game may not seem like the most exciting of titles if you’re not a long-time fan of the series. But my skepticism of the game was slashed away in the face of an over-the-top gorefest that seems to take itself seriously but is hiding a soft, goofy center that wound up being really fun to play. <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> comes out on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC on October 21st.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
