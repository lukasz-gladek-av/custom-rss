<figure><a title="Switch 2 - Nintendo Life" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d90314046bd7d/switch-2-nintendo-life.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's almost been a week since the arrival of the Switch 2. Now that more outlets have spent some time with Nintendo's new hybrid system, first impressions and reviews are beginning to roll in.</p>
<p>If you haven't already seen our own "review-in-progress" here on Nintendo Life, based on what we've experienced so far, we think Nintendo has done a decent job balancing the surprise and delight, while delivering a system that remains familiar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Switch 2 is a slick bit of kit, though, which instantly makes its predecessor feel slow and look very fuzzy. It makes your old games look and play better, and it's got enough quirks and quality of its own — <em>just</em> — to give it some personality while not upsetting the apple cart."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:182525 @ 1749521170 -->
<p>So, what are other outlets saying? For starters, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Eurogamer</a> loves the form factor and size of the Switch 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And it's a lovely thing in the hands - larger and, it feels, slightly sleeker than the Switch. And that beautiful glossy screen makes its older sibling look a bit pokey, just as the Switch once made me return to the Vita and say, really? It was that small? And with the border? Just as the Vita once made me go back to the PSP and say..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-review-best-things-list-hate-love-nintendo-1851783873/slides/5">Kotaku</a> also praised the "high-end" tech feel of the system and its controllers, and loves the giant panel on the new system, even if it is an LCD:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It’s not OLED, but it’s surprisingly crisp, clear, and vibrant for an LCD. It makes the original Switch feel washed out by comparison."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/nintendo/ive-spent-24-hours-with-the-nintendo-switch-2-for-review-heres-5-things-i-love-and-2-things-i-dont">Tom's Guide</a> after 24-hours with the Switch 2 agrees it's more of the same to some degree but a "little bit better":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The mantra of the Switch 2 seems to be taking a thing you love and making it just that little bit better, and that approach extends beyond the console itself and into its official accessories. The freshly upgraded Switch Pro Controller is fundamentally the same great pad that you could buy for Switch 1, but with a few subtle, yet impactful, tweaks."<a href="https://www.stuff.tv/review/nintendo-switch-2-review/"><br></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.stuff.tv/review/nintendo-switch-2-review/">Stuff</a> felt that not all the new features and innovations may appeal, but was glad to see most of the enhancements still pay off:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Not all the new bells and whistles will appeal – GameChat and GameShare are genuine innovations while the mouse function feels too novel and unergonomic – but most of the enhancements do go towards a much better and smoother hybrid gaming experience than before."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/my-switch-2-review-in-progress-its-good-but-dont-give-in-to-the-fomo-yet/">CNET</a> has enjoyed what the new hybrid system offers so far, while acknowleding the change in the video game landscape since the launch of the original Nintendo Switch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Nintendo is also in a strange place now. Where it used to compete alone with often unusual hardware, it's now competing against other products with similar goals. The Switch was so spot-on in its vision that it's spawned more handhelds now, and more are likely to come from Sony, Microsoft and others...Nintendo's whimsy and weirdness are its calling cards, and its exclusive games are its edge. The Switch 2 needs to lean hard into that"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>And <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review">IGN</a>'s "in-progress" review described this "sequel system" as the following upgrade:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"An iterative upgrade to an already excellent Nintendo console that modernizes many desperately out of date aspects, improves countless design elements in small but noticeable ways, and takes a swing on a genuinely impressive new control option (mouse control) that also doesn’t <em>quite</em> work as smoothly as hoped."</p>
</blockquote>

            <title><![CDATA[I’m Becoming Increasingly Obsessed With Fake Japanese Football Shirts [Update]]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/japan-jfa-football-shirt-kit-fake-replica</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i%E2%80%99m-becoming-increasingly-obsessed-with-fake-japanese-football-shirts-update.1214025/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/japan-jfa-football-shirt-kit-fake-replica<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some personal news: in my spare time, away from the keyboard, I collect football shirts. (You might also know them as "soccer jerseys".) I've been doing it since the 90s, and by now have what I think is a pretty nice collection! I've got shirts from England, Italy, France, Spain, The Netherlands, Australia, the works–but recently I've started seeing kits appear online that are unlike anything I've ever seen before.</p><p>As a collector who buys most of my shirts online, I've sadly had to become something of an expert in spotting fakes, especially when shopping on places like eBay, Facebook and Depop. And when I say expert I mean it; where fake football shirts used to be sold at shifty markets and looked <em>nothing </em>like the actual thing, in 2024 Chinese factories have become so good at replicating Nike and Adidas' shirts that in some cases you have to get <em>real </em>close to tell an official $150 shirt from a bootleg $20 one.</p><figure><figcaption>My favourite pick-up this season by FAR is Roma's 23-24 third shirt, which instead of featuring a sponsor (they didn't have one at the time) had SPQR (Senatus PopulusQue Romanus), essentially the forum sig of the Roman Empire, emblazoned across the front instead. </figcaption></figure><p>On one hand, this sucks. These shirts are counterfeits, and despite looking like the real thing don't feel or fit like the real thing, and often have nowhere near the durability of an official shirt either (<a href="https://theathletic.com/4905759/2023/09/28/castore-aston-villa-wet-kit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">though that's not always the case</a>). So if I'm out here trying to find bargains to add to my actual collection, it's tough! On the other hand, football shirts are being released at increasingly extortionate pricepoints, especially when you consider they're replaced every 12 (for club sides) or 24 (for international sides) months by new designs. So you can't blame people, especially parents, for opting for the cheaper fakes, regardless of their legality. If I wasn't a collector I'd probably get the $20 shirt too!</p><p>For as long as I've been researching them, the entire point of fake football shirts was that they were trying to look as close to the real thing as possible. But over the last few years I've seen a new trend emerge, where the factories releasing these kits have become slightly less interested in recreating official matchday apparel, and have started dabbling in more original designs. And nearly all that dabbling revolves around a single team: Japan.</p><p>I use the word "original" loosely, of course. Nearly everything I'm going to talk about here involves stealing multiple types of intellectual property, or lifting designs made by fans online without accreditation or compensation. But the fact remains that, if you were looking to buy a fake football shirt for, say, England or Italy, you'd be presented with a limited selection of counterfeits copying those teams’ actual kits. And if you went looking for a Japanese shirt, you'd be shown <em>dozens </em>of designs, most of them not even remotely <em>close </em>to what the Blue Samurai wear when they take the field.</p><figure><figcaption>Another recent highlight: this Hayley Raso shirt from the 2023 World Cup, which I managed to get match-printed to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjapHehdxWQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commemorate the longest penalty shootout in tournament history</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Why Japan and Japan only? I don't know! I have theories, though. People who design football shirts on the internet are weirdos (complimentary), and I imagine that there's a lot of anime and manga fandom overlap there (this isn't me being judgmental, you'll see what I mean when you start seeing some of these designs). And these shirts are made in China where, like many places in the West, Japanese fashion has a certain cache, especially among football fans; wearing a Japanese football shirt is just <em>cooler </em>than wearing a Chinese one, especially since the former are really good right now, and<a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/china-football-captain-zhang-linpeng-quits-after-2-2-draw-with-singapore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the latter are absolute dogshit</a>.</p><p>Whatever the reason, the sheer scale of designs and options being produced right now blows my mind. I'm fascinated. Every time I check in on one of these shady sites there are new Japan jerseys in stock, all of them completely fictional, to the point where I wonder how much of the lucrative bootleg shirt industry is now being devoted to kits that aren't even proper bootlegs anymore.</p><p>Loads of them are trashy, some of them are so generic they border on racism, but among them are also some very cool designs that I wouldn't blame anyone for buying and wearing just because they looked so good. I've even seen some of these in the flesh, in Australia, so there's definitely a market for these outside of China!</p><p>Before I start showing off some of the best and worst examples of what I'm talking about, here are what Adidas' actual, official men's shirts look like (these are about to be replaced in the next month or two with new designs):</p><figure></figure><p>Note the "templates" used--which means stuff like the cut and collar, items which are shared with other Adidas kits around the world--because some of these bootleg shirts will use them, in the interests of maintaining some semblance of authenticity, while others just will not give a fuck and toss an Adidas and JFA logo on any old shirt.</p><p>Like these. I am going to lead with the worst, because we need to eat our vegetables before we get to dessert. These shirts represent a vision of Japan as seen through the lens of 1980's action movies and European kids who import Mitsubishis and cover them with decals using Kanji that doesn't even spell anything:</p><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><p>The next ones are also bad, but for a different reason. They're not as lazily offensive as the examples above, but they're still incredibly cheesy. These ones are Japan as told by the box art for an aftermarket graphics card, or the screensaver of a guy who makes a lot of videos about how to get obscure PC gaming mods working:</p><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><p>Now let's move onto a different type of terrible. I think these all stink visually, but if you're someone who is into <em>Dragon Ball, Crayon Shin-Chan, Saint Saya </em>or <em>Doraemon, </em>while <em>also </em>being into Japanese football, then boy do I have the shirts for you:</p><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><p>I should note before we move on that the idea of combining the Japanese men's national team with anime/manga isn't new, which perhaps explains why there's a streak of popular culture tribute running through so many of these fakes. Adidas and the JFA have done a few official Captain Tsubasa collabs before, most notably in the leadup to the last few World Cups, featuring stuff like merchandise runs and<a href="https://www.footyheadlines.com/2018/04/class-special-edition-adidas-japan-captain-tsubasa-kit.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> even official kits that replaced Adidas' font with a special Captain Tsubasa numbering</a>.</p><p>Anyway, now we move onto the third and final category of bizarre fakes: the ones I do not hate, and have indeed either seen in the flesh or been told by someone that they'd bought one and loved it:</p><figure><figcaption>I don't know the source material here, but the way the comic is patterned across the shirt is really effective, and the Famicom-ass colour scheme is also a winner.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>This one might be my favourite? The <em>Great Wave off Kanagawa</em> riff is maybe a bit corny, but the colouring is glorious, and I <em>love </em>the reimagined JFA (Japanese Football Association) badge. If the pattern was a bit more subtle--maybe reduced to more of a background feature than an all-over print--and you told me this was a limited edition third kit or training shirt I would 100% believe you. </figcaption></figure><p>Thank you for joining me on this tour of the depths of my wheelhouse! Don't bother asking where I got these images from; most of these kinda sites are only open for a few months before the authorities catch wind and shut them down, when whoever is running them  promptly starts up a whole new site selling the exact same stuff all over again. But if you ever see any of them turn up on resale sites--and I saw the "Tokyo" shirt just last week on Depop!--you at least now know where they come from, and what the deal is.</p><p><strong>UPDATE June 6, 2025</strong>: Since first publishing this piece in March 2024 I've been keeping an eye on this trend, and felt the need to update you all on the fact that it has showed absolutely no signs of slowing down whatsoever. For one, I'm now seeing these kind of batshit designs spread to other sides, like the Brazilian national team:</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>But I've also seen the Japanese kits elevated to a whole other level, doubling down on popular culture references like Naruto, One Piece and...the Nissan Skyline:</p><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>What I really wanted to show, you though, was this masterpiece. Why it's this game and not others I don't know, but it's a question I don't think we need to ask. We just need to enjoy the fact that somewhere on God's Earth this exists, complete with image watermarks:</p><figure></figure><p>And just for good measure here's the back of the same shirt, where the party continues uninterrupted:</p><figure></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-demo"><h3>Baby Steps Makes Me Feel Bad That I Stopped Meditating</h3></a><p>When did I become the least patient person in the world</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/felt-that-boxing"><h3>Nope, No, No Thank You</h3></a><p>I love this idea, please keep it away from me</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">The second entry in Obsidian's first-person sci-fi RPG series, The Outer Worlds 2, launches on <strong>PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on October 29</strong>, and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=The+Outer+Worlds+2+Premium+Edition+Includes+5-Day+Early+Access&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-06-09+13%3A56%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-09+15%3A20%3A43&amp;fnarticle_id=6532295&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2FkObE0x&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-outer-worlds-2-premium-edition-includes-5-day-early-access%2F1100-6532295%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorders are available now</a>. The long-awaited sequel will take players back to The Outer Worlds' vision of the far future, introducing new locations to explore, factions to join, and companions to recruit, while bringing back the satirical humor and striking retro-futurist art style of the original game. While it's exciting we're getting a new large-scale RPG from Obsidian--especially since the studio's most recent game, Avowed, just launched earlier this year--The Outer Worlds 2 is also notable as the next major Microsoft-published game to be getting a PS5 release, and the first Xbox first-party game to cost $80. We've seen several Switch 2 games hit that price point, but now Xbox and PS5 games like The Outer Worlds 2 are slowly adopting the $80 price tag for select new releases, too.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, for many Xbox and PC players, that price point is less of a concern since it will also be available on Game Pass on launch day.<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TFP7JFH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> One month of Game Pass Ultimate costs $20/month</a>, making it <em>technically</em> the most affordable way to play The Outer Worlds 2. However, you'll only have access to the game as long as you're subscribed. If you want to own The Outer Worlds 2--either digitally or physically--you'll have to pick up either the $80 standard edition or the $100 Premium Edition that includes a season pass, bonus DLC, and even early access to the full game. Both versions also include other extras for preordering ahead of time.</p><p dir="ltr">If you prefer physical games, you can preorder boxed copies of <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=The+Outer+Worlds+2+Premium+Edition+Includes+5-Day+Early+Access&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-06-09+13%3A56%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-09+15%3A20%3A43&amp;fnarticle_id=6532295&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2FrabrQd&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-outer-worlds-2-premium-edition-includes-5-day-early-access%2F1100-6532295%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the standard</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=The+Outer+Worlds+2+Premium+Edition+Includes+5-Day+Early+Access&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-06-09+13%3A56%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-09+15%3A20%3A43&amp;fnarticle_id=6532295&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2Fje20rb&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fthe-outer-worlds-2-premium-edition-includes-5-day-early-access%2F1100-6532295%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Premium Editions</a> for PS5 at Best Buy.

                <p>If you tried syncing an 8BitDo controller to the Nintendo Switch 2 on launch day, you were probably disappointed when the console refused to recognize it. I know I was. But my disappointment didn't last long, as 8BitDo reached out the following day to let me know that firmware updates targeting Switch 2 support were available for select controllers in its lineup. After updating all of the supported controllers, I can confirm that all of the models that have received updates so far work well both wirelessly and with a wired connection. The list includes several of 8BitDo's best controllers, including its recently released flagship <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DRCVGJJW,B0DRCRDGP4,B0F2H6VKP8,B0F194QFT2&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ultimate 2 Bluetooth</a></strong>, which is a formidable alternative to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-preorder-restock-target-best-buy-walmart-gamestop/1100-6530558/" data-ref-id="1100-6530558">Nintendo's new Switch 2 Pro Controller</a>.

The 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Bluetooth Controller uses the newer Ultimate Software V2 for PC and Mac.</p><p>The Ultimate Bluetooth and Ultimate 2 Bluetooth also support 2.4GHz Wireless on Switch 2, but you need to update the dongle located in the storage compartment on the bottom of the charging dock. If you only update the controller, the Switch 2 will only recognize it when paired in Bluetooth mode. The Ultimate Bluetooth comes with a USB-A dongle that can be connected to the Switch 2's dock. The Ultimate Bluetooth 2 has a USB-C dongle that can connect to the port on the top USB-C port on the console itself; this lets you sync wirelessly via 2.4GHz in tabletop or docked modes. If you want to keep the top USB-C port free, you can connect the dongle to the dock with the help of a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Female-Adapter-Charger-Airpods-Samsung/dp/B079LYHNSR?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">USB-C to USB-A adapter</a>.</p><p>8BitDo also has a Firmware Updater tool for Windows and macOS that can be used to update the Ultimate Bluetooth and Pro 2 Controllers as well as the other models on the list above that don't have Ultimate Software support. Once installed, plug the controller into your computer with the USB-C to USB-A cable that comes with your controller, boot the app, and follow the on-screen prompts.</p><p><strong>Tip:</strong> For 2.4GHz and wired connections with all 8BitDo products in this roundup, you need to toggle one setting on your console. Navigate to System Settings, scroll down to Controllers &amp; Accessories, and enable Nintendo Switch Pro Controller Wired Communication.</p><h2>8BitDo Controllers on Nintendo Switch 2</h2><p>Let's take a closer look at all of the 8BitDo accessories that currently work on Nintendo Switch 2. 8BitDo told GameSpot that it is working on adding Switch 2 support for additional products its lineup, so we will update this roundup as more controllers receive firmware updates.</p><div title="[Various] 8BitDo Controllers for Switch 2" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3670" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Various] 8BitDo Controllers for Switch 2" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DRCVGJJW,B0DRCRDGP4,B0F2H6VKP8,B0F194QFT2&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DRCVGJJW,B0DRCRDGP4,B0F2H6VKP8,B0F194QFT2&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DRCVGJJW,B0DRCRDGP4,B0F2H6VKP8,B0F194QFT2&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">8BitDo Ultimate 2 Bluetooth Controller</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DRCVGJJW,B0DRCRDGP4,B0F2H6VKP8,B0F194QFT2&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DRCVGJJW,B0DRCRDGP4,B0F2H6VKP8,B0F194QFT2&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0DRCVGJJW,B0DRCRDGP4,B0F2H6VKP8,B0F194QFT2&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">$63 (was $70)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>Nintendo Switch 2 / Switch: Bluetooth, 2.4GHz Wireless (USB-C receiver), Wired (USB-C)</li><li>PC: 2.4GHz Wireless + USB-C wired</li><li>TMR electromagnetic analog sticks</li><li>Hall Effect triggers with adjustable stop point</li><li>2 remappable back triggers</li><li>2 extra remappable shoulder buttons</li><li>Tactile bumpers</li><li>RGB lighting rings</li><li>1,000Hz polling rate for 2.4GHz and wired</li><li>6-axis motion controls (Switch 2 + Switch only)</li><li>Rumble (Switch 2 + Switch only)</li><li>Turbo button</li><li>Up to 25 hours of battery life</li><li>Available in white and black</li><li>Includes matching USB-C charging dock</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Bluetooth Controller is better than many controllers from major brands that cost two or three times as much. Even if you already own its superb predecessor, the Ultimate Bluetooth, the Ultimate 2 is a worthwhile upgrade. It can sync wirelessly to Nintendo Switch 2 via the included 2.4GHz USB-C dongle or Bluetooth.</p><p dir="ltr">You can use the USB-C to USB-A charging cable for a wired connection, but you'll probably only need to do this if you run out of battery life. The Ultimate 2 features a 1,000Hz polling rate for both 2.4GHz and wired connections, so performance is indistinguishable between the two. I also haven't noticed a difference in Bluetooth reliability and latency between the Ultimate 2 and Switch 2 Pro Controller.</p><p dir="ltr">Along with two remappable back buttons, you'll find two additional shoulder bumpers, giving you a total of four extra customizable inputs to work with. You can save up to three custom profiles and cycle between them on the fly. There's also a turbo button that registers a button press and hold as continuous tapping.</p><p dir="ltr">8BitDo has used Hall Effect sticks in its flagship controllers for a while, but the upgraded TMR electromagnetic sensors on the Ultimate 2 are even better. The sticks are remarkably smooth and precise, and the new RGB rings around each stick are a nice bonus. The upgraded D-pad retains the retro Nintendo aesthetic found on most 8BitDo controllers, but it has a softer feel and smoother action than its predecessor.</p><p dir="ltr">The tactile shoulder bumpers and Hall Effect triggers are impressive, and the latter now has a locking switch that turns them into instant triggers with quick stopping points. Although you lose out on NFC support for Amiibo and HD Rumble, this model does feature adjustable rumble motors and 6-axis motion controls.</p><p dir="ltr">With 8BitDo's Ultimate Software V2 on PC and Mac, you can remap inputs, save profiles, and adjust various stick, trigger, rumble, and motion controller settings. Here's the list of core features:</p><p><strong>Customize with 8BitDo Ultimate Software V2 (on PC/Mac)</strong></p><ul><li>Remap inputs</li><li>Set up three custom profiles</li><li>Set up dead zones</li><li>Adjust motion control sensitivity</li><li>Adjust stick sensitivity</li><li>Adjust trigger sensitivity</li><li>Adjust rumble intensity</li><li>Adjust lighting effects</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The Ultimate 2 also comes with a matching charging stand, making it easy to refuel between sessions. You can get roughly 25 hours of battery life over Bluetooth and 20 hours with 2.4GHz Wireless.

You won't find the Ultimate C at major retailers, because it was discontinued after the 2C was introduced.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B09M8CVMYF,B0B9FZCXSV,B09MZ1WQRT&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B09M8CVMYF,B0B9FZCXSV,B09MZ1WQRT&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B09M8CVMYF,B0B9FZCXSV,B09MZ1WQRT&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">8BitDo USB Adapter 2</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B09M8CVMYF,B0B9FZCXSV,B09MZ1WQRT&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/stores\/page\/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B09M8CVMYF,B0B9FZCXSV,B09MZ1WQRT&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B09M8CVMYF,B0B9FZCXSV,B09MZ1WQRT&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20">$19 (was $20)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The 8BitDo USB Adapter 2 and the original model can replace the need to buy more controllers.

At the moment, you can get the Ultimate 2 Bluetooth for only $63 in white or black.</p><p>While I've enjoyed my time with the Switch 2 Pro Controller so far, the Ultimate 2 Bluetooth has more customization options. From an ergonomics perspective, both controllers are excellent, though 8BitDo's back buttons are a bit larger and offer more tactile feedback. It's also worth keeping in mind that the new Pro Controller's sticks--which feel much better than the original's--use ALPS tech, so they are still susceptible to analog stick drift. The Ultimate 2 Bluetooth's TMR electromagnetic sensors are generally regarded as a step above Hall Effect sticks, which are commonly referred to as "anti-drift sticks."</p><p>I've only spent a few hours with both controllers on Switch 2, but I have used the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 for months on other platforms. 8BitDo's controllers aren't officially licensed by Nintendo, but the Switch 2's launch day was the first time I've ever experienced a connection issue with a Nintendo console. It's unclear why 8BitDo's controllers weren't compatible out of the gate--I was able to get other unofficial controllers working without an update--but the issue was fixed just one day after launch. Given the fact it happened at all suggests that perhaps a future Switch 2 firmware update could lead to new problems--though, as mentioned, this never happened with unofficial controllers on original Switch hardware, so I don't think there's much cause for concern here.</p><p>The Switch 2 Pro Controller has the benefit of integrated support for button mapping, including a quick menu to remap the back buttons. The Ultimate 2 Bluetooth relies on its desktop app for PC or Mac. But while this may be viewed as inconvenience, the ability to store three custom profiles on the controller more than makes up for this.</p><p>I will continue to use both controllers for the time being, but I suspect I will wind up using the Ultimate 2 Bluetooth as my main controller for Switch 2 before long.</p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-nintendo-switch-2-controller-compatibility-how-to-guide-best-switch-2-controller-deals/1100-6532267/">8BitDo's Best Controllers Get Switch 2 Support - How To Set Them Up And Why It's A Big Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-5440-page-complete-history-of-middle-earth-box-set-is-only-106-at-amazon/1100-6526926/">The 5,440-Page Complete History Of Middle Earth Box Set Is Only $106 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-microsd-express-card-deals-nintendo-switch-2-samsung-sandisk-amazon-walmart/1100-6530578/">Walmart Has 512GB Switch 2 MicroSD Express Card For $65</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-restock-launch-week-buying-guide-major-retailers-walmart-target-best-buy/1100-6531967/">Nintendo Switch 2 Restocks - Where To Buy The New Console</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-dualsense-edge-ps5-controller-is-on-sale-for-its-best-price-yet/1100-6531846/">DualSense Edge PS5 Controller Drops To Best-Ever Price For Days Of Play</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-console-best-deal-playstation-days-of-play-2025-sale/1100-6526406/">The PS5 Pro Has Received Its First Discount For Days Of Play 2025</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-4k-blu-ray-release-limited-edition-steelbook-preorder-amazon-walmart/1100-6531822/">The Last Of Us Season 2 Steelbook Edition 4K Blu-Ray Is Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-325-lord-of-the-rings-deluxe-illustrated-box-set-is-only-146-for-a-limited-time/1100-6525568/">Save $190 On Last Year's Lord Of The Rings Deluxe Illustrated Box Set</a></li>   </ul> </div>

Their tucking that white flag back into their pocket and pulling out a handheld competitor is an exciting prospect. I just wonder if it’s too little, too late.</p><p>I got to play with the device for a little bit, and yeah, if Microsoft can deliver, it will be one of the best handheld consoles on the market. But my mind did drift elsewhere when I held its heavy ass in my hands. Maybe it’s nostalgia playing tricks on me, but I can’t help but mourn how handheld gaming has morphed into an extension of the games and systems we play on our TVs and desktops.</p><p>None of this is inherently the Ally’s fault. Microsoft has benefited from watching the handheld console business thrive over the past decade. The Ally is hefty in your hands, rather than feeling like a toy as the original Switch did. </p><p>Admittedly, as a small man, it didn’t seem built for people of my size. My tiny hands had to reach to hit some of the buttons, and I could never quite figure out how best to hold the device to get the most leverage out of the whole controller. The weight of the thing didn’t help, as my wrists started to ache after just a few minutes of play. It’s a sturdy device, but it doesn’t feel like it’s built for everyone. I’m simply a little guy, but I imagine those problems might be even worse for folks with motor issues. I talked with some other people who have bigger hands, and they all said the Ally felt really good. So, while the console might have some really cool functionality and streamlining that makes it more appealing than the average handheld PC, it might not be the most inclusive machine, as it’s particularly uncomfortable for those of us who have trouble holding larger devices. </p><p>While your mileage may vary on holding it, one thing the Ally has over most other handheld gaming PCs is that Microsoft has streamlined its user experience to circumvent some of the hassles found with other devices. By linking your accounts across different launchers, the Ally lets you easily access your games across multiple services, such as pre-installed games, streaming through Game Pass, and others. Having everything in an easy-to-navigate HUD built for buttons and analog sticks makes the Ally one of the best choices to play PC and Xbox games on the go. Even if I can’t hold the device for extended periods, I can’t deny that Microsoft has built something that’s solved a lot of the problems people have with its competitors.</p><p>Shortly after my appointment, I held my Switch 2 and played a little bit of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, and I think that device is probably better suited for people who have trouble holding bulkier handhelds like the Ally. I would love to see a model down the line that lets you disconnect the heavy controllers from the big screen, similar to the Switch’s tabletop mode. I think until Microsoft puts out something like that, I’ll have to stick with other devices. </p><p>Beyond form factor, most of these handheld consoles do the same things, it’s just a matter of which one feels better in your hands. I think that was one of my bigger takeaways playing the Ally: It’s nice that all of the Big Three are sticking their toes in the handheld market, but now that Nintendo has merged its console and handheld divisions into one device with the Switch, it does feel like we lost the charm and design philosophies of old handhelds.</p><p>Now that the components that house console-level power are small enough to fit into a handheld, we’ve lost any real need for a divide between games made for those devices and games made for consoles. Even mobile devices are offering console-comparable experiences, and the days of developers creating games for less-powerful hardware, specifically meant to be played on a device that fits in your pocket, feel like a long-gone memory.</p><p>A lot of indie developers are still carrying the torch, and you’ll find games evocative of the Game Boy and DS eras called “retro throwbacks.” Some of the more niche games that you would have found on a Vita in 2014, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-steam-switch-reviews-1851781786&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-steam-switch-reviews-1851781786"><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em></a></span><em>, </em>end up on Steam and Switch, but the era of a dedicated handheld doing things that feel built for those devices is over. I always dreamt of being able to play console games in the back of my parents’ car as a kid. But I don’t think I realized what we might lose in achieving that dream.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Back in December, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/05/spacecraft-is-the-new-game-from-shiro-games/">SpaceCraft was revealed as the new game from Shiro Games</a>, developer of Wartales, Northgard, and Dune: Spice Wars. Now, Shiro Games has released a brand new developer video for the multiplayer space sim, which goes into looking at flying a ship through space and wandering around a space station which will serve as a hub and a base.</p>
<p><iframe title="SpaceCraft | Devblog | Gameplay Overview" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7K1AHjgfBMw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“SpaceCraft&nbsp;is an ambitious game for us, and one I’ve always dreamed of making,”</em> says lead designer and Shiro Games CEO Nicolas Carnasse. <em>“One of the things Shiro always strives to do is combine big design ideas in a way that just makes sense when players pick it up, and I think&nbsp;SpaceCraft&nbsp;is a perfect example of that philosophy.”</em></p>
<p>The developer diary for SpaceCraft kicks off with space flight, which players will be able to do with their own customisable ship. As you fly through the void, you will be able to look for new planets which you can touch down upon to search for resources that you and everyone needs to rebuild civilisation. As you find these resources, you can build facilities to mine them. From here you can create full industries that cover everything from mining to transporting the good. Players can work together to create organisations and trade routes to get the resources to where they need to go. On the space station, you can modify the ship with various modules depending on what you need, be it a mining ship or a weapons ship. Every module will impact the handling of the ship, so you will need to balance things properly. The space station will also have shared hubs where players can communicate and trade with each other.</p>

<p>In SpaceCraft, humanity has had to leave the Milky Way after a devastating defeat by the Tripods. The remnants travel through a portal that delivers them to an uncharted galaxy, where humanity must learn to rebuild and survive. SpaceCraft will launch later this year for PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/683635/retroid-pocket-dual-screen-add-on-nintendo-ds-touchscreen<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2006, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21441254/nintendo-ds-3ds-discontinued-eulogy">Nintendo DS was a wildly successful console</a>, but emulating its unique dual screen design on modern handhelds is a challenge. You can try to squeeze both screens onto a single touchscreen, attempt to completely <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/18/23923136/ayaneo-flip-ds-kb-handheld-gaming-pc-nintendo-emulation">recreate the DS’ unique hardware</a>, or do what Retroid is doing and release a temporary clamp-on, secondary screen that’s compatible with its handhelds and other third-party devices.</p><p>The Retroid Dual Screen Add-on is <a href="https://www.goretroid.com/en-ca/products/retroid-dual-screen-add-on">currently available through the company’s online store</a> in black, purple (inspired by the GameCube), and translucent white color options for $69, but are currently sold out. That includes a version designed for Retroid’s own Pocket handhelds including the RP Mini, RP Mini V2, RP4 Pro, and RP5, and the version for third-party handhelds. As long as a device isn’t taller than 115mm and supports DisplayPort over USB-C it should be compatible, but Retroid specifically points out the Steam Deck is not.</p><p>Featuring a 5.5-inch AMOLED screen with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels and dedicated brightness buttons on the side, the Dual Screen Add-on attaches to devices with an expanding clamp and can be positioned at three different angles using a “click-stop hinge.” However, the second screen can’t be folded flat against the handheld it’s attached to like with the DS.</p><p>The add-on features touchscreen functionality, which is supported through the DisplayPort protocol. If your handheld of choice is lacking touch capabilities, hanging the add-on off the bottom will let you play DS games that heavily relied on lower touchscreen interactions. But since Retroid’s Dual Screen Add-on is at its core just an external display for a handheld, what games you can play and how the screen will be utilized is left to the device’s operating system or the emulator you’re using.</p><p>The add-on weighs around 130 grams, thanks in part to it skipping a built-in battery. It’s powered directly by the device it’s connected to, but it does have its own USB-C port with pass-through charging capabilities so you can keep both the display and your handheld running without killing its battery.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Here are four you should change right from the jump to improve your overall experience with Nintendo’s new <em>Mario Kart World</em> machine. Just go into the settings menu inside the gear icon near the bottom right of the home screen to get started. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,196230" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h10123"><a id=""></a>Calibrate HDR and turn it off for games that don’t support it</h2><p>The Switch 2 offers upgraded visuals, including HDR (high dynamic range). It’s supposed to make the picture quality more vibrant with darker darks and lighter lights, but it can also make games look washed out if they don’t support it. Oddly, the Switch 2 turns HDR on by default for everything. Fortunately, you can toggle it to only turn on for games that support it.  You’ll also want to calibrate HDR for your TV display when the Switch 2 is docked. You can do that by using one of those dials where you keep going until the image is barely visible. </p><h2 id="h10124"><a id=""></a>Automatically turn charging off to improve battery life </h2><p>The Switch 2 contains a nice new option to have your battery life cap out around 90 percent when you’re charging it. This is to help extend the overall life of the battery, and it’s ability to retain a charge years down the road. Once again, it’s just another straightforward option you can toggle to from the settings menu, and you can always go back and fully charge up before a trip or another extended period of being away from an outlet. </p><h2 id="h10125"><a id=""></a>Turn off this one internet setting to boost download speeds over Wi-Fi</h2><p>Nitnendo’s new hardware supports the new internet protocol IPv6. Unfortunately, in practice, having that active as part of your Wi-Fi internet connection <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/507478-nintendo-switch-2/80995072&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/507478-nintendo-switch-2/80995072" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seems to slow speeds</a></span> down by not automatically connecting to faster wireless signals. The good news is that players seem to have been able to bypass the mystery issue by going to internet settings for their network and toggling the IPv6 slot off entirely. Anecdotally, that seems to allow players to connect to 5G networking speeds. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1l3vqkv/solution_wlan_does_not_connect_to_switch_2/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1l3vqkv/solution_wlan_does_not_connect_to_switch_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lots of players</a></span> are having issues with Wi-Fi speeds though, suggesting Nintendo might need to deploy a bigger fix in the coming weeks.  </p><h2 id="h10126"><a id=""></a>Check your Switch 2 controllers for updates</h2><p>Unlike some other consoles, the Switch 2 doesn’t appear to automatically push out new updates for accessories like the Joy-Con or new Pro controller. As a result, players need go into the settings menu and occasionally check if there’s anything new to download. You can a still play games with older-version hardware, but anything that’s not fully updated could be prone to bugs or performance flaws that wouldn’t otherwise pop up. </p><h2 id="h10127"><a id=""></a>Turn off manually unlocking the screen</h2><p>The first time your Switch 2 goes into sleep mode you’ll need to pump the A button several times before the console comes back on. Turning manual off will make it so you no longer have to press the A button three times to unlock the screen. That’s a nice thing to bypass considering the Switch 2 is the tiniest bit sluggish when waking up from sleep, taking a few seconds extra to notice controller inputs. Now, if only you could turn the locked screen off entirely. </p><p>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Mario Kart World - Full Gameplay Overview Nintendo Direct Presentation | Switch 2</p>
      </div>
<p>“The strangest thing about this game is that the dirtiness of the cow’s butts has been recreated with incredible realism,” wrote Japanese rice farmer Renta in a <a href="https://x.com/taihibansei/status/1930978365831565647" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a> on X. They went on to add that cow's butts are often covered with dirt, but that farmers battle to keep them clean by keeping the cows healthy and the floor spotless. </p><p>Mario Kart World's cow has been one of the highlights of Nintendo's flagship Nintendo Switch 2 racer. While the open world and track design have left some wanting more, seeing the cow's butt get dirtier over the course of a race has become a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/everyone-keeps-picking-cow-in-mario-kart-world-of-course/1100-6532182/" data-ref-id="1100-6532182">shared memory</a> across the web. It's not unusual to find full 24 player races filled with nothing but cows.</p><p>While Mario Kart 8 boasted a huge roster of characters, including everyone from Animal Crossing's villager to Baby Daisy, a character like cow has never been playable in a Mario Kart game before World. It's also not the only surprising cosmetic design choice we've seen in Mario Kart World. Toad can be find driving <a href="https://x.com/jordan_yogurt/status/1931782783346884734" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a police car</a> while roaming around in the free roam mode.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dune-awakening-review-in-progress.1213875/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-awakening-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If there’s one thing beyond doubt after more than 35 hours with Dune: Awakening, it’s that Funcom has done its homework in crafting the most authentic take on the Dune-iverse imaginable. As a longtime fan of Frank Herbert’s iconic sci-fi setting, that’s an incredible thing to experience more often than not, and my time on Arrakis has been filled with moments of genuine shock. It’s very clever how the harsh environments and empty space are repeatedly used as progression checks, turning what seem like they should be weaknesses into strengths. Other times, that stubborn adherence to established lore results in annoying or just plain boring irritations, like how you’re all but forced to adopt a nomadic lifestyle in a genre where putting down roots and building up your base is one of the fundamentals. There have also been plenty of technical issues and bugs in the days immediately following launch, plus combat hasn’t landed with me much so far (though I’m admittedly still early in crafting my combat build), but on balance my friends and I are having an absolutely awesome time nerding out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve ever played a survival game (and have seen a Dune movie) before, you’ll know most of what you need to feel at home among the giant sand worms: you gather materials from the world, build your own ugly-as-heck home, and upgrade your equipment to gain access to more dangerous areas with rarer materials. Like plenty of survival games, including Funcom’s own Conan Exiles or last year’s Once Human, all of this is happening on a server full of similarly sunburnt players in a perpetually online world, where cooperation and limited instances of PvP are both a distinct possibility, and which account for most of its best moments.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Where this game sets itself apart, though, is by just how much it adheres to its legendary setting, and that has a major impact on just about everything you do. For example, intelligent use is made of Arrakis’ harsh environment, which is weaponized against you quite literally every second you stay within its atmosphere. Standing directly in sunlight unprotected will bake you alive in a matter of seconds, sandstorms blow on a regular basis and will kill you if you aren’t able to get to shelter first, and most notably, there’s the issue of those pesky enormous man-eating worms which gobble you up if you dare tread upon their domain for too long. By leaning into the unforgiving world as much as it does, Awakening puts you in a constant battle against the planet itself. So instead of casually trotting around collecting resources at your leisure and settling your own little piece of the world, you’re frantically ducking behind rocks to avoid the sun’s harsh rays and drink what little water you have left, and playing a never-ending game of “the floor is lava” as you rush from one place to another with a shai-hulud hot on your heels.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Arrakis’ harsh environment is weaponized against you quite literally every second.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these hazards give you obstacles to overcome. For example, early on you’re unable to leave the tutorial area thanks to a massive gap of empty space where sun exposure or, more likely, a massive worm would certainly kill you if you attempt to go on foot, so you have to craft your first vehicle in order to safely cross it. Later on, you start to encounter places that are too hot or irradiated to explore without proper equipment. There are plenty of examples just like this, where the unique nature of the setting is turned into an interesting mechanic. Similarly, you’re constantly starved for water, which is used both as a crafting material and a resource to keep yourself alive, and usually Awakening is a better, more interesting survival game for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there are other times where this fanatical adherence to Dune conventions can be quite obnoxious, like how you’re encouraged (and in some cases required) to move your base of operations from place to place as you unlock access to higher-level regions. Pulling up stakes means you either have to abandon all you’ve built up to that point or tediously relocate as much of your equipment as you can, piece by piece. Then there’s stuff like the fact that guns are often useless, since many enemies make use of the all-important Holtzman shields that completely protect from ranged attacks. This creates a weird situation where you’re juggling back and forth between guns and melee weapons depending on which enemy is currently running towards you, oftentimes having to choose between addressing the swordsman barreling down on you or the guy a few feet behind him with a chaingun, which can create a really oppressive rhythm to combat. I honestly kinda respect how much Dune: Awakening sticks to its guns by making its guns ineffective to keep with Dune lore, even as it sometimes comes at the expense of me having a good time. Even when this stuff annoys the hell out of me, I can’t help but respect it.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Like almost every single one of its survival MMO peers, Dune: Awakening has pretty awful combat.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s just part of the reason that, like almost every single one of its peers, Dune: Awakening has pretty awful combat. I knew going into a survival MMO that would be the case, but it’s still a particularly bitter pill that never gets any easier to swallow. I’m still quite early in unlocking all the options for battle and seeing some of the more interesting weapons and builds available, but so far gunplay is sloppy, melee combat is repetitive and janky as heck, and I’ve mostly just been trying to get through it as quickly as possible. It’s such a low point in a game I’m otherwise enjoying.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dune: Awakening - January 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, the combat miss is more than made up for by the absolutely stellar survival mechanics, which are some of the most thoughtful and polished I’ve seen in a while. There’s a constant stream of new technologies to research, equipment to craft, and material to hunt for with almost no filler or grind along the way. Every time I’ve collected the right materials to craft the latest shiny thing I want, I’ve immediately had another enticing item to chase, and with unique schematics dropping left and right, I’m always making interesting decisions on whether to spend my rarest materials on a cool item with a special effect versus taking the more conservative route and just crafting common items to save those resources for a rainy day. (It's bound to rain on Arrakis one of these days.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s especially impressive that they accomplished this loop so well in a desert world where there are no other locations aside from hot sand, and almost no plants or wildlife available to harvest. A major hallmark of survival games is punching trees, and there are no trees on Arrakis – instead you’re making tools to pull water from morning dew collecting in the world at night and by pulling it from the air, which is just really smart and a welcome change of pace that embraces the weird and barren setting, even if it is still essentially the same thing.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite Survival Games</h3><p>If you're interested in building, exploring, and refilling your hunger meter before dying, here are TieGuyTravis' recommendations for the best survival games you should play!</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">When I played the beta for Dune: Awakening, I ran into tons of bugs and hoped the delay of its launch would improve things a bit. That certainly seems to be the case, as I’ve had a significantly more stable experience so far, but even as improved as it is, it’s still fairly troubled in the technical department. I’ve had disconnects, seen entire mountains disappear and reappear before my eyes, and even had a few hours where all sand worms just up and deleted themselves from existence, making everyone on the server swarm to the resources normally protected by their constant threat. It’s not been the smoothest launch by any stretch – but also far from the worst.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After more than 35 hours I still feel like I’m fairly early into my Dune: Awakening adventure, and still have new zones to visit, haven’t gotten very far into the main story, and have only had a few encounters with PvP. There’s a ton for me to do, so look for an update sometime this week as I work my way through to the endgame.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is the first Nintendo console to feature support for HDR, but it isn't without its quirks. Outside of having a display that doesn't feature all the hallmarks required for an accurate HDR experience, its HDR configuration menu initially seems lacking. That's a mistake, it seems, with Nintendo hiding a vital setting behind a confusing UI choice.</p><p>When configuring the Nintendo Switch 2 with an HDR-compliant display, you're initially greeted with a familiar screen that lets you adjust the maximum peak brightness level the console will output. Once you've finished setting that point, the Switch 2 transitions to what initially just seems like an image to demo the changes you've just made. That isn't the case, however, with the screen containing an "Adjust Brightness" slider that you can access by hitting Y, which is more important than you might think.</p>

<p>This brightness slider actually controls the paper white point of the image, which is used as a reference point for numerous other HDR settings behind the scenes. But leaving this at its default, you'll likely overexposing the entire HDR image, losing details in midtones and shadows as a result. It's frustrating that this slider doesn't have a corresponding nit value (with white points usually configured between 200-300 nits), but it's definitely a setting to adjust immediately if you've been finding the HDR presentation while docked lacking.</p><p>It's also not the only setting to take note of if you're looking to get the best out of the Nintendo Switch 2. As with other HDR-compatible consoles, you'll want to make sure that Dynamic Tone Mapping is either off or set to HGIG on your display, so that mapping is done by the console instead. Once done, you'll want to run through the HDR setup again just to ensure that your previous settings are still accurate. While there, make sure to set <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-auto-applies-hdr-to-everything-heres-how-to-change-it/1100-6532143/" data-ref-id="1100-6532143" data-mce-href="/articles/nintendo-switch-2-auto-applies-hdr-to-everything-heres-how-to-change-it/1100-6532143/">HDR to only turn on when playing supported games</a>, and not on at all times as is the default.</p>

		<p>Konami has announced that it will be hosting a stream on Thursday June 12th, called Konami Press Start, which will be air at 6:00 AM PT / 9:00 AM ET / 2:00 PM BST/ 3:00 PM CEST. Konami has confirmed that Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Silent Hill f will be present during the showcase, plus other announcements.</p>
<p><iframe title="KONAMI PRESS START 6.12.2025 ( KONAMI Game News )" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NXaDgU72gRI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Konami are being pretty specific with the timing, stating the stream will last 37 minutes. So, we have two games confirmed for the showcase but they probably won’t take up the entire runtime. It is likely there will be some update regarding eFootball, possibly around the Club World Cup, since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/10/fifa-and-konami-sign-partnership-deal/">FIFA and Konami signed a partnership deal</a> back in October. That still leaves a vast library of IPs that Konami can draw on. People will likely be hoping for mention of a new Castlevania, Metal Gear Solid Collection Vol.2, mention of more Yu-Gi-Oh, and Bomberman. Maybe we’ll see some very dormant IPs turn up too like Zone of the Enders or Bloody Roar. It is likely the company will show something completely new too.</p>
<p>We will know exactly what Konami has up its sleeve in just a few days time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/apple-consolidates-ios-gaming-features-in-new-games-app/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>At its Worldwide Developer Conference today, Apple unveiled a new iOS Games App that Apple Senior Director of Marketplace Platforms and Technologies Ann Thai promoted as "a new destination to help you get more out of your games."</p>
<p>The most relevant new social feature in the app comes in the "Play Together" tab, which provides a quick look at what your friends are playing on iOS. That tab will also integrate a new Challenges feature, which game developers can use to turn single-player games into score-based competitions between friends. These interpersonal Challenges come on top of the standard game leaderboards already common through iOS's Game Center, allowing for a new way to compete socially.</p>
<p>Other than that, the new Games app seems to consolidate several features that were previously split between <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/gaming-on-apple-platforms-is-set-for-some-big-changes-here-are-a-few/">Game Center</a> and the App Store. On the Home tab, the Games app will let you see games with new update, time-sensitive in-game events, and recommendations for new games to try. A Library tab will show every iOS game you've ever downloaded in a single place, while the Apple Arcade tab shows subscribers what's available to download. The Games app will work in both portrait and landscape mode and be navigable via controller.</p>

The Xbox showcase would have been the perfect time to show off something new for this game. Unfortunately Bethesda doesn't seem to care. Wouldn't surprise me if Bethesda has abandoned this game and are hoping the community will make content for them. This does not bode well for future Bethesda game studio projects.”</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Starfield Is Going Through An Identity Crisis</p>
      </div>
<p>The lack of an update for Starfield was particularly annoying for fans as other Bethesda titles were front and center during the Xbox Showcase. Both The Elder Scrolls Online and Fallout 76 received their share of attention with new content, seasonal updates, and even some new fishing features. Bethesda had previously promised an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-knows-fans-are-eager-for-starfield-updates-promises-exciting-year/1100-6529956/" data-ref-id="1100-6529956">"exciting" year</a> for Starfield.</p><p>Starfield most recently received an <a href="https://bethesda.net/ko/game/starfield/article/3eFYYUUqzOpOSv086XWMh9/starfield-update-notes-may" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update</a> last month in May, although it primarily focused on bug fixes and stability improvements. Players have created an extensive amount of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-starfield-mods/2900-6529/" data-ref-id="2900-6529">Starfield mods</a> that have become popular in the community.</p><p>Bethesda's space epic received mixed reviews when it launched in 2023. Many critics and fans recognized that it didn't provide the sense of awe that an adventure through space should provide. They hoped that later DLCs and player-made content would eventually provide the experience they were looking for, but that hope hasn't been realized.</p><p>"It struggles to deliver a cohesive and memorable RPG experience amid the seemingly boundless sea of stars," wrote Michael Higham in his <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/starfield-review-to-infinity-but-not-beyond/1900-6418110/" data-ref-id="1900-6418110">GameSpot Starfield review</a>. "For all its reverence for scientific philosophy, its stories and characters paint a rather tame and sterile vision for what our spacefaring future could look like."</p>

Time has sped by unfathomably quickly, and I wasn't sure whether a performance boost and an additional mobile app would be enough to let the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition get its hooks in me to quite the same extent as its predecessor did back in 2023.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I couldn't call myself a true Zelda fan if I didn't at least have a gander at this new package. I started a new save file (because that's an option now), blinked, and suddenly realised that five hours had passed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> might be one of the harder titles to get your tongue around, but falling back into this sublime sequel was as easy as pie. Those diving into the adventure for the first time can rest easy knowing that they're getting the game in its mightiest form; those who have already poured hundreds of hours into Link's latest can feel safe in the knowledge that a performance boost and mobile extras are well worth making the return journey, even if a little of the magic is lost along the way.</p>

<p>I'm sure that you already have a decent grasp of TOTK's story and features, so I won't waste any time on a recap here (and I recommend reading <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">our Switch 1 review</a> first if you've never played the game). Rest assured, the performance boost hasn't taken anything away from the game's scope. This Hyrule is still massive and full to the brim with quest-giving NPCs, attention-snatching points of interest, and, yes, <em>ya-haha</em>-ing Koroks.</p>
<p>The difference is that all of this feels a little more manageable now. I'll get to the game's stunning facelift in just a moment, but I'd like to briefly highlight Zelda Notes first.</p>
<p>This optional mobile add-on has levelled its fair share of criticism (even we Nintendo Life writers are split on it). The audio guidance voice is painfully grating and as repetitive as they come — on that we can all agree — while the very principle of an external guide dictating your every move isn't great for the immersion levels. For <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> and its tighter world, I, too, would be more hesitant about the Zelda Notes inclusion. But returning to my old save file on TOTK, and the *checks notes* <em>66% of the game</em> I still hadn't completed after wrapping up the story, it felt like a welcome bonus.</p>

<p>One of TOTK's greatest strengths is its near-endless sense of wonder — you'll never spend too much time on one objective before being distracted by 12 others — but, particularly in the late game, it can start to feel like a little <em>too much</em>. I, for example, adore the Addison side quests, where you have to assist a nervous little Hylian on his sign-balancing missions. I'd like to complete more of them, and the Zelda Notes addition can help me to do that.</p>
<p>In recent days, I've hopped on for a few minutes to tick off a couple of Koroks, beat a Shrine, or listen to the new fully-voiced Voice Memories from Zelda, Rauru, and Master Kohga — inessential bits of 'lore' but perfectly harmless. You <em>can</em> still play without the app, and let TOTK throw every distraction it can muster your way (and you totally should), but taken as an extra that will be used predominantly by people who have already seen the adventure to the end, its inclusion makes Hyrule that bit less intimidating.</p>
<p>But let's not get bogged down in bonuses. TOTK - NS2 Ed.'s greatest strength is still the base game, and good heavens, is that game an utter joy to play with this boosted performance.</p>
<figure><a title="The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156691/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>On Switch 1, this was a marvel. This is a game where you can combine any two objects to create something new, swim through mountains to quickly reach higher ground, and approach combat encounters in any way imaginable — mechs, meat shields, you name it. The Switch could do all of this without instantly bursting into flames (like I say, <em>a marvel!</em>), but it wasn't without its technical hiccups. Taking a stroll through the Korok Forest would still tank the frame rate, things would get crunchy when trying to manoeuvre a large build, etc.</p>
<p>Expectedly, all of this is a thing of the past this time around. From my experience, the game runs at a buttery smooth 60fps all the time. And I mean <em>all</em> the time. I've sprinted through the Korok Forest without so much as a stutter, dived from Sky Island to depths with no slowdown, and fast-travelled with the most minimal of load screens. No matter what I threw at it, the Switch 2 kept things steady.</p>
<p>And I cannot emphasise enough just how pretty everything looks when running without restraint. Be it in the wind flowing through Link's hair or the glowing energy of a cowering Zonai construct, playing with such buttery smoothness means you will not want to go back to the original in a hurry. Believe me, I tried.</p>
<figure><a title="The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156697/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The resolution boost has worked wonders for the world, too. Textures are much more defined, even from afar, and the improved draw distance makes it easier than ever to scout out a ground-level locale from a faraway Sky Island.</p>
<p>It's true that the 4K goodness (in docked mode) highlights a handful of visual blemishes that I don't remember catching my eye in the original — have those mountains always looked so... grainy? — but without a complete overhaul of the art, this was bound to happen. And let's be clear, I'm nitpicking <em>small</em> blemishes here. It looks stunning overall.</p>
<p>If there is one thing to keep in mind before diving back into Tears, it's that your playthrough is unlikely to be quite as magical as it was the first time around. The game is still packed with beauty but, outside of Zelda Notes, there's nothing <em>new</em> here. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a> will pack in bonus challenges on Switch 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Mario Party Jamboree</a> is getting new rulesets, but TOTK has been left as it is.</p>

<p>Sure, £7.99 / $10.99 is a small price to pay to see the visual and performance upgrade in action (even smaller to those with a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership, who get it for 'free'), but don't expect to come back and feel the magic in <em>quite</em> the same way as you might with an additional Master Mode or Side Quest.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>When all's said and done, Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition is a fantastic revamp of perhaps Nintendo's most sublime sequel. What was once a technical marvel on aged hardware now has a chance to truly shine, with visual and performance boosts undoubtedly making it the definitive way to play.</p>
<p>Nothing will ever match the feeling of playing it for the first time, of course, and some bonus content would have been welcome, but armed with Zelda Notes and the promise of buttery smooth upgrades, I'd challenge anyone to dip back in without losing <em>hours</em> to its unrivalled wonder.</p></section>

In a newly released trailer, we not only get to see Riri Williams’ latest suit, but we also see her unique take on an Iron Man favorite.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197582" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Black Ops 7, Invincible Vs &amp; More — Here Are The 5 Games That Stole Microsoft’s Show" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="156" data-playlist="197582,197580,197576" data-current="197582"><div><p>Black Ops 7, Invincible Vs &amp; More — Here Are The 5 Games That Stole Microsoft’s Show</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197582/197582_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197582/197582_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197582/197582_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23103.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The show’s first trailer laid out almost everything we needed to know about the upcoming season. We saw Williams (Dominique Thorne) proving her genius to Parker “The Hood” Robbins (Anthony Ramos) in a life-threatening test, we heard her coyly describe her time in Wakanda during <em>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</em> as “an internship abroad,” and we also got a look at some of the cool suits she’ll be piloting. This new trailer is shorter but reveals two major additions: a magic-infused suit and her own spin on Tony Stark’s J.A.R.V.I.S.</p><p>After hearing Williams say she needs to think outside the box, we see a crimson-colored explosion of the same magical sigils we’ve seen sorcerers like Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) wield. We later get a glimpse of someone actually drawing those symbols and of Williams inside a suit that gets ensconced in those sigils. We don’t know yet who introduces her to this magic, but I’m praying to the MCU gods that somehow Wanda makes a surprise return to give our new iron-clad hero a lesson in multiversal magic.</p><p>Another cool part of the trailer is Williams building her own version of J.A.R.V.I.S. in the likeness of her best friend, played by <em>This Is Us</em> actress Lyric Ross. Since Ross’s character is memorialized in a mural with Williams’s late father, it’s safe to assume she’s dead and that this is Williams’s way of keeping her memory alive, whether she did so consciously or subconsciously. In the comics, Ross’s character is named Natalie, and her AI counterpart is dubbed N.A.T.A.L.I.E. This, and the profound quote from Williams’s father about taking something apart to really know what it’s made of, provides <em>Ironheart</em> the emotional core that gives its fantastical action human stakes.</p><p><em>Ironheart</em> will have a three-episode world premiere on June 24 at 6 p.m. PT / 9 p.m. ET on Disney+.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s going for between $7.50 and $8 right now, with players keen to do big damage with this prickly customer.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9: Summon: Primal Odin</h2></div><div catalogid="72ecd48e-a0c2-479c-b57d-ebb4227d6d39" id="222475"><div id="222475" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic The Gathering Summon: Primal Odin</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Summons just had to be a big part of the Final Fantasy set, and they essentially arrive as Sagas. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The big focus with Primal Odin is step two, which can literally remove a player from the game, and is likely to be ridiculously lethal in just about any Commander pod.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s available for under $2, too!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8: The Darkness Crystal</h2></div><div catalogid="72ecd48e-a0c2-479c-b57d-ebb4227d6d39" id="222476"><div id="222476" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic The Gathering The Darkness Crystal</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This one will set you back around $5, and for good reason. Not only does it reduce the cost of Black spells, but it gives its owner life while creatures around them die.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The fact you can then bring any creature exiled with that second effect has me particularly tempted to buy it for a zombie deck I’ve been planning for months.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7: Cecil, Dark Knight</h2></div><div catalogid="72ecd48e-a0c2-479c-b57d-ebb4227d6d39" id="222477"><div id="222477" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic The Gathering Cecil, Dark Knight</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of a few two-sided cards, Cecil has Deathtouch but deals damage to his owner, eventually transforming to Redeemed Paladin, gaining lifelink and making other creatures indestructible until end of time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of that from a single black mana casting cost? That $2.99 might be a small price to pay.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6: Self-Destruct</h2></div><div catalogid="72ecd48e-a0c2-479c-b57d-ebb4227d6d39" id="222478"><div id="222478" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic The Gathering Self-Destruct</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re looking to really burn down an opponent’s creatures, or the opponent themselves, Self-Destruct can turn the tide of battle at Instant speed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As TCGPlayer points out, using it in conjunction with Screaming Nemesis makes it a perfect counter to lifelink-focused decks, and Self-Destruct is under 50 cents at the time of writing.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">5: Fire Magic</h2></div><div catalogid="72ecd48e-a0c2-479c-b57d-ebb4227d6d39" id="222479"><div id="222479" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic The Gathering Fire Magic</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Want a Vivi card but don’t want to pony up? We get, it, but while Fire Magic has the diminutive spellcaster in its artwork, it’s also a great card that makes use of the new Tiered mechanic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For under 50 cents, you can cast an increasing amount of damage to each creature, making this an ideal card to have in your back pocket as Commander players around you build their board states.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4: Starting Town</h2></div><div catalogid="72ecd48e-a0c2-479c-b57d-ebb4227d6d39" id="222480"><div id="222480" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic The Gathering Starting Town</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Get Starting Town out early and it can kickstart a board state in any format, particularly if you’ve got a deck with multiple colors, but it’ll cost you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starting Town is currently $14 for the normal version, or just under $17 for the foil one.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3: Tifa Lockhart</h2></div><div catalogid="72ecd48e-a0c2-479c-b57d-ebb4227d6d39" id="222481"><div id="222481" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic The Gathering Tifa Lockhart</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Not to be confused with the variant in the Final Fantasy 7 Commander Deck, this Tifa has a Landfall trigger that doubles her power alongside her existing Trample keyword.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As TCGPlayer points out, you can grow her attack power with something like Titanic Growth and then use Fabled Passage to double it again. She’ll set you back between $7 and $9.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2: Sazh’s Chocobo</h2></div><div catalogid="72ecd48e-a0c2-479c-b57d-ebb4227d6d39" id="222482"><div id="222482" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic The Gathering Sazh's Chocobo</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I got a couple of Sazh’s Chocobo in my packs, and while it’s adorable, it can grow quickly with a landfall trigger that’s similar to Tifa’s, above.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s under $2, too, so fill your boots.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1: Adventurer’s Inn</h2></div><div catalogid="72ecd48e-a0c2-479c-b57d-ebb4227d6d39" id="222483"><div id="222483" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Magic The Gathering Adventurer's Inn</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A land that gives life and doesn’t enter tapped? You love to see it. It’s also super cheap right now, at around 50 cents for the foil version or less than 30 cents for the non-foil.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy Magic: The Gathering - Final Fantasy Cards</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>These cards are set to</strong> <strong>release on June 13</strong>, but you can preorder them right now and it'll arrive this week.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scroll to the left to see quick buy links for each MTG: FF configuration.

</section></header><section>

<p>We were thrilled to see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> make an appearance at the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct back in April, and now Square Enix has drip-fed us a <em>little</em> more information about when we can expect to see it come our way.</p>
<p>At last night's Xbox Games Showcase, the studio revealed that the remake will be arriving on Switch 2 (and Xbox, obvs) at some point <strong>this Winter</strong>. It's far from a precise release date — heck, even a month would have been nice — but at least it's something.</p>
<p>For those who missed the initial announcement, Intergrade is billed as a "visually enhanced edition" of the ace 2020 title, which was itself a remake of the classic PS1 RPG. It's all a little confusing, but expect plenty of action, melodrama, glossy hair, and some of the biggest swords going.</p>
<p>This version also packs in the 'FF7R EPISODE INTERmission' storyline, which sees you play as ninja Yuffie Kisaragi on her mission to infiltrate Midgar's Shinra Electric Power Company.</p>
<p>All in all, we're rather excited to see what this one has to offer on Switch 2 this winter. Our friends over at <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/">Push Square</a> seemed pretty up on Intergrade when it first arrived on PS5 back in 2021, calling it "a game of ups and downs in terms of quality, but by the time the credits roll, its most memorable moments shine through — of which there are many" in their <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">review</a>.</p>

			<p>Ubisoft wasn't a part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/">Summer Game Fest</a> in the traditional way, with its own<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-will-not-host-its-annual-ubisoft-forward-event-this-year/"> Ubisoft Forward</a> presentation taking place at some point within the already jam-packed weekend, but it did appear in some SGF 2025 events with a couple of release date announcements and the reveal of a brand new game.</p>
<p>Starting with the release date reveal, we now know that Anno 117: Pax Romana will arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on <strong>November 13, 2025.&nbsp;</strong>The new release date trailer for Anno 117 showed off a bit more gameplay and plenty of glamor shots of the game, though if you want a dedicated gameplay deep-dive, you <a href="https://wccftech.com/anno-117-pax-romana-gets-first-gameplay-showcase/">can check out the previous trailer Ubisoft showed off.</a></p>
<p><iframe title="Anno 117: Pax Romana - Official Cinematic Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t6a37J87bew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Next up was The Rogue Prince of Persia, a 2D-platforming Prince of Persia game from Evil Empire that released in early access last year. Unfortunately, we didn't get an exact release date, but we did get a release window for the 1.0 update, which is due to arrive sometime in <strong>August 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how the game has evolved since its early access release, which was already a strong foundation. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-early-access-review-the-year-of-the-prince/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo regarded its early access launch highly, writing</a>, "<em>Even in its early state, The Rogue Prince of Persia masterfully blends the best of Prince of Persia and Dead Cells in a solid package offering a more involved narrative, excellent platforming, dynamic combat and a lot of death, as is tradition for a proper roguelite.</em>"</p>

<p>Lastly, Ubisoft revealed a new title it is publishing from developer Screen Juice, called Morbid Metal. It's a new hack-and-slash roguelite with semi-procedurally generated levels, set in what appears to be some kind of dystopian future. It's due to arrive on PC in early access on&nbsp;<strong>August 20, 2025,</strong> and will feature three playable characters at launch that'll each have their own unique playstyles.</p>
<p>There's also a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1866130/Morbid_Metal/">demo you can play on Steam right now</a>, if you're keen to check it out.</p>

<p>None of these were exactly the announcements players had expected from Ubisoft during the Summer Game Fest weekend. There was nothing about <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-seemingly-teasing-more-splinter-cell-remake-news-is-coming-soon/">Splinter Cell,</a> or any of the many <a href="https://wccftech.com/9-assassins-creed-games-are-reportedly-in-development/">Assassin's Creed</a> games currently in development. There wasn't even a last-ditch push for <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-6-siege-x-launches-in-june-bringing-the-biggest-evolution-in-the-games-history/">Rainbow Six Siege X</a>, the biggest change to Siege in the game's history, which launches tomorrow at the time of this writing. There was also no mention of what's next for <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-generation-far-cry/">Far Cry</a>, or the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake.</p>
<p>With 2025 officially lacking a Ubisoft Forward event, it's unlikely we'll hear about any of those titles and series the rest of the year, unless the company decides to drop news for its biggest franchises in a third-party show like Gamescom ONL or The Game Awards. The company is going through <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-focus-on-narrative-driven-live-service-mobile-games/">several major changes</a>, so it's not surprising that it doesn't have very much to showcase at the moment, but a muted 2025 does not bode well for the company after its extremely disappointing 2024.</p>
