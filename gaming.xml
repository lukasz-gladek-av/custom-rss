                <p dir="ltr">The next game from Stardew Valley creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone will boast a larger world than the one in his farming simulator. But you don't have to take our word for it; Barone himself made this specific comparison for Haunted Chocolatier.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1932705089283895458" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">On X</a>, Barone stated that: "The world of Haunted Chocolatier is larger than Stardew Valley." He would know, since in December, Barone noted he was creating Haunted Chocolatier similar to Stardew Valley. "I'm coding it (mostly from scratch) in C#, and I'm working solo in all areas," Barone said after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-reconfirms-next-task-is-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6528253/">reconfirming he resumed development on Haunted Chocolatier</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1932705089283895458" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The world of haunted chocolatier is larger than stardew valley</p>  — ConcernedApe (@ConcernedApe) <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1932705089283895458?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 11, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">It seems like Barone is slowly but surely opening up more about his next game. Last month, the developer discussed how he wanted to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-wants-to-focus-on-mystery-whimsy-in-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6531252/">focus on mystery and whimsy with Haunted Chocolatier</a>. Barone sounds like he wants players to "let go of your desire to engineer the perfect chocolate" and instead just follow their intuition.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-announces-new-game-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6497292/">Haunted Chocolatier was announced</a> in late 2021 and will see players taking over a chocolate factory. There is no release window for the RPG, with Barone saying earlier this year that he hopes it comes out in the next five years. That would take us through the rest of this decade. Afterward, Barone <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-might-eventually-make-a-stardew-valley-2/1100-6531402/">"might eventually make a Stardew Valley 2."</a></p>

			<p>The yet-to-be-announced PlayStation handheld will feature AI upscaling, and some of its specs will address the lower memory bandwidth compared to the base PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Speaking on the NeoGAF forums, well-known AMD leaker KeplerL2 revealed some additional information about the handheld that's been rumored to be in the works for a while, revealing that the AMD APU that will power the system will be the only one from the company to have <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/rog-xbox-ally-and-rog-xbox-ally-x-announced-coming-this-holiday-2025.1685066/page-5#post-270507134" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI upscaling</a> in the near future. The leaker also added that the handheld will come with <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-5-leak-reveals-new-%E2%80%98low-power%E2%80%99-mode-fueling-handheld-console-reports.1684992/#post-270498839">16 GB LPDDR5X RAM</a> despite launching in a few years, as LPDDR6 is still away, and that it will have <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-5-leak-reveals-new-%E2%80%98low-power%E2%80%99-mode-fueling-handheld-console-reports.1684992/#post-270498604" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1/3 of the base PlayStation 5 memory bandwidth</a>, although with more cache and improved memory compression. Clarifying the cache the system will feature, the leaker <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-5-leak-reveals-new-%E2%80%98low-power%E2%80%99-mode-fueling-handheld-console-reports.1684992/#post-270498917" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> it will come with 4MB of L2 cache and 16 MB of MALL cache, which the current generation systems don't have. Regarding the architecture of the PlayStation handheld, KeplerL2 reiterated that both the handheld and the PlayStation 6 will be based on a fork of the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-5-leak-reveals-new-%E2%80%98low-power%E2%80%99-mode-fueling-handheld-console-reports.1684992/#post-270498940" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gfx13 (RDNA5/UDNA) architecture.</a></p>
<p>While the PlayStation handheld has been rumored to be in the works for a while, Sony has provided no indication that such a system exists. Still, last week, it was revealed that the PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro will soon get a&nbsp;<span><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-low-energy-mode-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">low energy mode</a> that will reduce performance to save power, which is believed to be a performance profile for this yet-to-be-detected handheld, so it seems increasingly</span>&nbsp;likely that a handheld system is indeed in development.</p>
<p>While Sony has yet to confirm if the PlayStation handheld is indeed in the works, Microsoft made part of its plans for the handheld market clear during this year's Xbox Game Showcase with the announcement of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/">ROG Xbox Ally</a>, a handheld gaming PC coming in a clear Xbox flavor. The company was reportedly also working on a full-blown handheld system, but plans were reportedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-plans-reportedly-on-standby/">halted</a> to focus on improving the Windows 11 handheld gaming performance, which is lagging behind the performance offered by SteamOS.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom%E2%80%99s-lineup-at-summer-game-fest-was-a-mix-of-bold-and-boring.1215636/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/685296/capcom-summer-game-fest-resident-evil-requiem-pragmata<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Capcom had an interesting showing at Summer Game Fest with three titles that will carry the developer into 2026 and beyond: <em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>, <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, and <em>Pragmata</em>. I got hands-on previews with both <em>Requiem</em> and <em>Pragmata</em>, and a hands-off presentation for <em>Onimusha</em>. Across the three games, I saw a mix of fresh ideas with <em>Onimusha</em>, some stale ones with <em>Requiem</em>, and some weird but interesting choices with <em>Pragmata</em>. </p><p>Of the three games, <em>Pragmata</em> represented the biggest tension between what I liked about it and what I didn’t. In the game, you play as Hugh, an astronaut stranded on the moon who is aided by a small, child-like robot named Diana. To be frank, I’m utterly exhausted by the trope of a big, gruff dude protecting a small, innocent child. Enough! It’s 2025, we have plenty of dad games at home, Capcom, there has to be a more interesting way to do this.</p><p>That said, I was impressed by <em>Pragmata</em>’s combat. What I thought was a straightforward shooter was still mostly that but with a complexity that dramatically changes the calculus of how you fight. Enemies in <em>Pragmata</em> are shielded and take little damage from Hugh’s weapons. To fight effectively, you must use Diana’s hacking skills, represented via a minigame that’s basically a stripped-down version of <a href="https://youtu.be/u7UKP3QN4HA?si=V_ZBIUAMYbpEODfw">the hacking minigame from <em>Bioshock</em></a>. </p><p>What’s most interesting about this is that it all must be done mid-combat. Time doesn’t stop as you’re building a circuit to the end goal in order to stun your enemy. It meant I had to juggle hacking effectively with dodging enemy attacks in a way that felt fresh and exciting for what I thought would be a simple action shooter. I just wish they had applied that innovation to some of the game’s narrative elements.</p><p>For <em>Onimusha</em>, Capcom revived a long-dormant series in a big way, first with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/606269/you-know">a remaster of <em>Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny</em></a> and now with this <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24320142/onimusha-is-back-and-very-bloody">new entry</a>, the first in almost 20 years. During the hands-off presentation, all I could think was, “This is Capcom’s take on a soulslike.” Some of that is in the aesthetics. The world is dark, overrun by grotesque-looking demons who brutally cut down fleeing peasants before turning their swords on Musashi, the protagonist. In other ways, it’s the combat. Enemies have stagger bars you deplete through deflecting and parrying attacks. In boss fights, as you slowly wear down your enemy, you can choose which part of the boss to damage to produce a certain effect. I did not get to play <em>Onimusha</em> myself, but I’m intrigued to see if any more soulslike elements are embedded within the game.</p><p>Finally,<em> Requiem </em>stole the Summer Game Fest show as Geoff Keighley closed the keynote event with a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/681325/resident-evil-requiem-trailer-date">surprise reveal of the game</a> and its February 2026 release date, after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/682006/and-the-award-for-biggest-tease-of-the-night-goes-to">previously teasing that we wouldn’t see it for a while</a>. Later during Play Days, Summer Game Fest’s in-person media event, I was treated to a short gameplay presentation and demo that offered a brief glimpse into the harrowing experience of Grace Ashcroft as she tries to escape an abandoned hospital. </p><p>During the gameplay presentation, Capcom emphasized that Grace would have to rely on her wits to survive rather than any kind of training as a soldier or law enforcement like the Leons, Adas, or the Chrises of that T-virus infected world. I liked that approach and how it was reflected in both the presentation and the demo. Since Grace had no weapons to protect herself, I had to find clues in the environment that would help me survive. That meant paying attention to my surroundings and reading everything I could find, landing on the one tip that got me through my time with the demo.</p><p>On the other hand, my brief look at <em>Requiem</em> felt like Capcom was tapping into old routines instead of doing something truly innovative for the ninth mainline entry in the <em>Resident Evil</em> series. Yes, the big monster lady was scary, and that delicious tension was heightened by the fact that I had no guns to shoot my way out in case my wits failed me. But there are only so many times I can be chased through hallways by a slowly plodding monster before it gets to be old hat. I’ve seen that not just in other <em>Resident Evil </em>games but in horror games in general, and I’m bored by it.</p><p>I understand that I’ve only seen the tiniest sliver of what the full game represents, but I hope when <em>Requiem</em> comes out in February next year that I see more new ideas than old ones. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A group of prominent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> modders will be livestreaming the creation of a big mod over a single weekend later this month. It's part of a charity drive led by voice actor Wes Johnson, probably most famous for providing the dulcet tones of mad Daedric prince Sheogorath in Oblivion and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>.</p>
<p>The gang - led by Kinggath and the team behind the popular <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21872">Sim Settlements mod</a> - will be letting viewers decide the specifics of the mod via a stream this weekend, with the actual mod creation streams then taking place on Twitch across June 28th and 29th.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://x.com/simsettlements/status/1932626360859820127">The modathon</a> is part of this year's edition of Voiceapalooza, an annual charity drive in aid of the American <a href="https://www.alz.org/">Alzheimer's Association</a> that sees Johnson and community-run charity initiative <a href="https://falloutforhope.com/">Fallout For Hope</a> organise a bunch of streams to raise funds for the cause.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-4-mod-sheogorath-actor-charity-2024">Last year</a>, this time-limited modding element of it saw a similar group of modders create a Fallout 4 questline called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/84389">Shady Motives</a>, raising over $30,000 in the process. In addition to a story starring Johnson, who's also voiced the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a>'s Fawkes and Oblivion's Lucien Lachance, that mod included a player home, custom weapons and armour, and a fully-voiced companion.</p>
<p>So, basically a mini-DLC worth of stuff that was then uploaded to Nexus Mods and <a href="https://mods.bethesda.net/en/fallout4/mod-detail/4364063">Bethesda.net</a> once any kinks were ironed out for anyone on PC or Xbox to give a go. This year looks like it'll produce a fresh mod of a similar size and scope, with modders Kinggath, Elianora, Neeher, Jazzhands, Otellino, Sagittaurus, Niero, Erika Ember Studios, Veta Phoenix, and greenFoxel all set to stream themselves creating and working on different aspects of it.</p>
<p>Interesting to check out if you've ever been curious about how the modding sausage is made, or you can just keep an eye out for the mod going live once it's done. There's also a stream on Kinggath's Twitch that'll see watchers vote to decide the details of the mod that the group'll be building - that takes place this Saturday, June 14th, kicking off at </p>
<p>You can find all the timings for the different streams that make up this modathon in <a href="https://x.com/simsettlements/status/1932626360859820127">this Tweet</a>, and find all the streams that'll be going live on mod-making portion on June 28th <a href="https://simsettlements.com/charity/">here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-developers-reveal-theyve-been-laid-off-after-bioware-puts-full-focus-on-mass-effect"><u>other BioWare staff who worked on the game were laid off</u></a>. In the same month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-patch-notes-sure-make-it-sound-like-biowares-basically-done-with-the-game-now"><u>BioWare signalled it had released its final update for Dragon Age: The Veilguard</u></a>, with no further content announced or expected.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-bioware-finally-got-dragon-age-to-the-finish-line-after-a-tumultuous-decade">IGN has reported on The Veilguard’s development before</a>, detailing how it was rebooted from a single-player game into a live-service multiplayer game and back again. Now, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-11/inside-the-dragon-age-debacle-that-gutted-ea-s-bioware-studio" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier</a> has revealed new insights into the goings on at BioWare during the making of The Veilguard, revealing exactly why it ended up disappointing some fans with a lack of meaningful choice and consequence — key qualities BioWare’s best games are best-known for.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Schreier revealed that many of The Veilguard’s issues were a hangover from the pivot from multiplayer back to single-player RPG, including its tone, dialogue, and lack of tough choices for the player. One tidbit stands out: BioWare was spooked by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-forspoken-sales-were-lackluster-and-its-reception-challenging">the failure of Square Enix’s Forspoken</a>, worrying The Veilguard’s now out of fashion snarky tone would fuel a similar fate. So a “belated rewrite” of the game’s dialogue was ordered to “make it sound more serious.” This, in turn, resulted in tonal inconsistencies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There were also internal concerns about how The Veilguard was being marketed (“an initial trailer made the next Dragon Age seem more like Fortnite than a dark fantasy role-playing game, triggering concerns that EA didn’t know how to market the game”).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA declined to comment to Bloomberg on the piece.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot of The Veilguard’s failure is that a small team is working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-next-chapter">Mass Effect 5</a>, but there are concerns about BioWare’s future. Dragon Age appears dead following the failure of The Veilguard, which when counting Mass Effect: Andromeda and Anthem is BioWare’s third flop in a row. Could EA close it down?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bloomberg quoted TD Cowen analyst Doug Creutz as saying that while EA needs more than sports to be successful, “if they shuttered the doors [of BioWare] tomorrow I wouldn’t be totally surprised. It has been over a decade since they produced a hit.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-11/inside-the-dragon-age-debacle-that-gutted-ea-s-bioware-studio" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg's piece</a> for the full story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-impressions-preview-souls-orbs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last year, our own Chris Person asked a question that sent readers, listeners, and game designers of all stripes spiraling: “<a href="https://aftermath.site/games-used-to-have-more-orbs-what-happened-soul-orb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Games used to have more orbs. What happened?</a>” Chris concluded, ultimately, that gaming’s glorious, firefly-like orb swarm dissipated after being shooed away by the heavy hands of loot and other, more modern upgrade mechanics. Good news, however, for Orb Aficionados, who make up 99.9 percent of Aftermath’s readership: One of orb history’s all-time greats, <em>Onimusha</em>, is back, and it’s got the juice, by which I mean orbs.&nbsp;</p><p>During a hands-off presentation at Summer Game Fest’s Play Days event in Los Angeles, I got to see an early section from <em>Onimusha: Way Of The Sword </em>in action, and I’m pleased to report that this long-awaited series revival is looking solid. While Capcom isn’t quite giving us a <em>pure </em>survival-horror-inspired character-action game – there’s a <em>Souls</em>-inspired stamina meter, for example – the game’s look and vibe feel in line with the series’ legacy. So far, at least, <em>Way Of The Sword </em>does not strike me as a cheap excuse to dredge up a nostalgic name, but rather a reasonably reverent reinvention. Orbs are a big part of that.&nbsp;</p><p>There are three types of orbs, which are known as “souls” in the game’s parlance: blue, yellow, and red. These correspond to skills, health, and experience, respectively, which is not too far of a cry from how they functioned in earlier games. Most importantly, you can hold down a button to hoover them up – again like in previous games – which becomes a crucial part of your mid-and-post-combat rhythm. Also, it just <em>feels </em>satisfying. Modern action games, which often force you to run around manually picking up loot and resources, have nothing on the elegant simplicity of the Orb Vacuum.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Onimusha: Way of the Sword World Premiere Trailer | Summer Game Fest 2025" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f4ee6REzoGA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Most of the demo, which saw new main character Miyamoto Musashi slice and dice dudes and demons while untangling the mystery of a Japanese folklore-inspired temple stage that villagers were being hurled off, proceeded about as you’d expect. Combat was suitably flashy, with an omnidirectional guard and a parry-powered redirect ability setting the player up for powerful “Issen” attacks that absolutely wrecked enemies’ shit. These could also be chained together to take out multiple enemies at once by, for example, tricking one enemy into stabbing another. Casting your Issen net wide, our presenter said, results in “a ton” of orbs, and it’s good for crowd control to boot.</p><p>As Musashi doled out damage, orbs flowed like red, blue, and yellow wine. Occasionally, after temporarily sating his orb lust, Musashi would unleash a flashy, yellow-hued special attack during which he performed something akin to a dance, except with two knives. But that’s not orb (all). Musashi also wore a magical golden gauntlet with a blue orb in its center that could absorb masses of dark magic – orb-shaped as well – that granted him the ability to briefly gaze into the past. This, I imagine, will serve as one of the game’s primary storytelling devices.&nbsp;</p><p>However, only toward the end of the demo did things get truly interesting on the orb front. Once Musashi reached the aforementioned temple stage, he got ambushed by Sasaki Ganryu, a cackling, sadistic sword boy with an orb gauntlet of his own. During the ensuing boss fight, Ganryu sprouted a stamina meter, and when Musashi deflected attacks, it took a big hit. Eventually, this staggered Ganryu, allowing Musashi to execute a Break Issen, in which the player selects a specific portion of a boss’ body to attack, each with different effects.&nbsp;</p><p>First our presenter targeted Ganryu’s head, which resulted in “big, big damage.” After a little more skirmishing, Ganryu’s meter plummeted again, and this time our presenter went with a body shot, which sacrificed damage in favor of “a ton of souls,” allowing the player to “charge up our health bar and the attacks we’re using here, which helps spawn even more souls that help heal us over the fight.” The arm was also a target, and I’m not gonna lie: I don’t remember how many or which type of orb that Issen attack produced because Musashi broke the fuck out of Ganryu’s arm, and it was gnarly.</p><p>But basically, victory in boss fights is a byproduct of smart orb management.&nbsp;</p><p>“Depending on where you’re at – whether you’re just about to finish him or you need a bit more health – you can choose the way you want battle to flow,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Not long after dispatching Ganryu (who <em>will </em>return, our presenter was careful/excited to emphasize), Musashi came face to snout with another boss, a talisman-covered beast called Byakue. After bringing him down, we were told that it was of crucial importance that Musashi close the rift from which the monster emerged, to prevent more freaky dudes from coming out. The rift was orb shaped. Then the demo ended, and the audience went wild. For orbs, obviously.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/best-indie-games-summer-game-fest-2025"><h3>Seven Cool Video Games I Saw During (Well, After) Summer Game Fest</h3></a><p>From LEGO to bicycles to...whatever the Yakuza guys are doing next</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-lost-save-game-pass"><h3>My Lies Of P Save File Is Dead And I Am Full Of Regret</h3></a><p>I love Lies of P, but trying to play Lies of P: Overture became a cautionary tale about Game Pass and personal data archiving.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-demo"><h3>Baby Steps Makes Me Feel Bad That I Stopped Meditating</h3></a><p>When did I become the least patient person in the world</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Gaming legend Hideo Kojima was so sick in 2020 that he felt he "could never recover" or make games again, he said in an interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/hideo-kojima-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GQ</a>, in which he also discussed her current mental state and more.</p><p>"I felt like I might not ever be able to create a game again," he said of his illness.

<p>"I had all these ideas," he said. "So I wrote them down and passed them to my PA, as if it were my will. I kind of understood why people commit suicide. It was the end of the world."</p><p>Kojima also developed serious eye pain that prevented him from going outside or watching movies or TV. He opted to have eye surgery, and this ended up damaging the optic muscles that allows a person to focus. "The doctor kept saying that the brain would adjust. I was not convinced," Kojima said.</p><p>Following his illness, Kojima said he now feels "nervous" and "rushed."</p><p>"I still have a lot of things I want to do--that I need to do. I thought I could do anything if I was independent, but the reality is that I can't," he said. "I always think of other, more weird stuff to make. But if I do that, and it doesn't sell, my studio will go bankrupt. I know all the staff. I know the families of the staff. I have this burden on my shoulders."</p><p>Kojima's next release is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/death-stranding-2-story-theories-and-everything-we-know/1100-6516214/" data-ref-id="1100-6516214">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, which releases this month on PS5. He said in the GQ interview that the game would have launched in 2023 were it not for COVID.</p><p>He's also working on multiple other upcoming games, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/od/" data-ref-id="5000-612205">OD</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/physint/" data-ref-id="5000-617596">Physint</a>, while he's involved with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-wants-the-death-stranding-movie-to-be-a-new-dimension-of-what-a-game-adaptation-can-be/1100-6528061/" data-ref-id="1100-6528061">A24 Death Stranding movie as well.</a></p>

The Hitman series is all about embodying a man of mystery who uses his cunning along with an array of weapons and gadgets to complete missions, so seeing the devs at IO Interactive apply their slick, open-ended balance of action and stealth to James Bond seems like we're in store of an evolution of the Hitman structure on a grander scale.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During Summer Game Fest 2025, we had the opportunity to speak with IO Interactive Chief Technical Officer Ulas Karademir about the making of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>007 First Light</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. In addition to giving some details on the upgraded engine that IO Interactive made for their dive into Bond, the CTO explained why he returned to the company following his departure to lead the upgrade of IO Interactive's Glacier engine, and why their Bond game offers a greater degree of freedom than the Hitman series.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I left in 2014 [to work as the VP of engineering at Unity] during the development of Hitman 2016, but in the last year, I had come to the office to see what they were doing, and the first thing that Hakan B. Abrak—CEO of IO Interactive—showed me was the James Bond game," said Karademir. "He knew that I really wanted to work with this franchise, so he showed me the game, and then he asked me, "Do you want to come back?" and I was like, "Yeah, I think so." With everything we have planned [with the scope and increased agency], yeah, I think this is the right game for us."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/what-i-learned-during-a-marvellous-meeting-with-to-a-t-creator-keita-takahashi" target="_self" data-discover="true">What I learned during a marvelous meeting with To a T creator Keita Takahashi</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>007 First Light</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> focuses on the origin story of James Bond, who appears as a 26-year-old recruit from the Royal Navy into MI6. The pitch is heady: throughout his missions with the secret agency, he'll utilize a variety of gadgets, stealth tactics, weapon skills, and even social engineering to overcome the odds against him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>Via IOI</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While the most prolific Bond games have focused heavily on action-laden spectacle, and while the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>007 First Light</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> trailer certainly showcased shootouts and over-the-top sequences, the developers were firm in stating the game is about giving players options to engage in each mission. The core gameplay is very much in line with Hitman's immersive sim approach of exploring clockwork levels where players take advantage of NPC behavior to accomplish missions.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The developers told us the title leans even further into the agent fantasy than Hitman, all with the intent to highlight Bond as a multifaceted secret agent who can adapt to different situations.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/why-remedy-entertainment-built-fbc-firebreak-around-the-player-s-schedule-not-the-other-way-around" target="_self" data-discover="true">Why Remedy Entertainment built FBC Firebreak around the player's schedule, not the other way around</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There are a [lot] more options in this game compared to Hitman," Karademir said. "You can play the game with a stealth approach, or you can do social interactions with Bond trying to bluff his way out of situations, which creates situations with humor and interactions like that. Of course, you can go in guns blazing sometimes, but this game is about giving a lot of opportunities in the game when you play it. There are so many different approaches in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>007 First Light</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and it's way more than what we had in Hitman."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The discussion turned to the topic of the Glacier engine, IOI's proprietary technology that powers the recent Hitman: World of Assassination games. The upgrade to Glacier 2 for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>007 First Light</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was motivated by the increased scale of the game's levels and the greater degree of options that players would have in exploring the game.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;At IO Interactive, we spend a lot of time trying to figure out what is fun&quot;">"At IO Interactive, we spend a lot of time trying to figure out what is fun"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We have this understanding of the agent fantasy and the freedom of approach, which is what Hitman was all about," said Karademir. "At IO Interactive, we spend a lot of time trying to figure out what is fun. We tend to really obsess about gameplay, and once we figure it out, the production is quite easy. We know how to produce games, and we have been doing this for 25 years, but it always was that kind of iteration speed that we have with our engine when trying to figure out 'is this fun?' and [consider] what kind of a game we are building."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/in-skin-deep-cartoon-logic-helps-players-understand-complicated-gameplay" target="_self" data-discover="true">In Skin Deep, 'cartoon logic' helps players understand complicated gameplay</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>007 First Light</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> looks to be a more fleshed-out and sprawling adventure that goes further with non-kill options, the developer insists the Hitman DNA is still clear and present. This game just goes further.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Yeah, there is an inspiration from Hitman within our version of Bond—It is the same type of fantasy, right?" said the CTO. "But we also try to make it as unique as possible. Our designers spend a good amount of time figuring out what makes Bond unique, what kind of situations this character finds themself in, and how they can go about solving it. As the CTO, what I can tell you from the engine perspective is that just about anything in the game is made of entities, so it's like building blocks."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It is kind of a very flexible environment for designers to work and try different things with the amount of approaches you can have. They can create set pieces, they can handle character interactions, and that gives them a kind of creative freedom to build what they would like to achieve in the games. From a technical perspective, there is a lot of trying, a lot of iterating, but we still have the key learnings as we build our take on the Bond IP."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alessandro Fillari is a writer/editor who has covered the games, tech, and entertainment industries for more than 12 years.

			<p><span>No other game developer dared to reveal their newest game at Summer Game Fest by teasing players three times with an anniversary message, followed by a sale announcement for previous titles in the series, and then ending the two-hour showcase with an actual world premiere look at their latest survival horror game. While Resident Evil Requiem’s initial reveal may have been cheapened by all the teasing beforehand, <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-revealed-officially-called-resident-evil-requiem-arrives-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-february-2026/">the reveal</a> was worth it.</span></p>
<p><span>Following our&nbsp;</span><span>brief look</span>&nbsp;at <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-hands-off-sgf-2025-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a>, we were greeted behind closed doors with another look at the trailer, announced earlier in the week, along with the first sneak peek at gameplay for the upcoming Resident Evil Requiem.</p>
<p><span>While Resident Evil VII: Biohazard’s connections to the Resident Evil universe were muted early on and left players wondering how it was connected to the legacy of S.T.A.R.S. and the Umbrella Corporation, Requiem starts by introducing the player character as Grace Ashcroft, a young FBI investigator and daughter of the late Alyssa Ashcroft, one of the varied protagonists from the Resident Evil Outbreak series (and eagle-eyed fans might recognize the byline as one of the reporters of <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dulvey_Daily">The Dulvey Daily</a>, a newspaper for the local parish where the Baker family resides in Resident Evil VII Biohazard. Capcom aims for a “fresh, vulnerable perspective” on the Resident Evil series by introducing a character already haunted by a major family tragedy, yet not a fighter in the traditional sense, but rather a survivor.</span></p>
<p><span>The demo opened with Grace Ashcroft being suspended upside down on a hospital gurney with an IV in her right arm. The developers made a point to highlight Grace’s training in the FBI to try and stay cool under pressure through breathing techniques and self-talk to cool down. She then tries to tip the stretcher over to stop the blood from rushing down to her head, and uses the shards of a broken glass vial to cut her bindings free, all through an in-game cut scene before the gameplay transitions into a first-person perspective as Grace.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This section of Resident Evil Requiem takes place in an abandoned hospital, although it only appears to have been abandoned somewhat recently. There are still a bevvy of locked doors that mark a series’ long-running tradition, both ones with broken handles and others with elaborate door handles or stone carvings to indicate which key is needed. And it wouldn’t be a Resident Evil game without needing to replace fuses in a fuse box to turn on the lights or open an electronic shutter, so I’m proud to say that these puzzles are back once again. Grace isn’t one to have deep pockets on her, so she only has a modest eight-slot inventory to hold onto these key items, at least to start.</span></p>
<p><span>Grace Ashcroft doesn’t have the same combat training that Ethan Winters underwent between Resident Evil Biohazard and Village, so she instead will have to rely on more practical weapons, such as throwing empty bottles. A small UI tip showed both a power and radius for the bottle, so I would assume there would be a variety of these weapon types at her disposal. To navigate the darkened halls, Grace picked up a lighter with the same ornate emblems as one of the gates around the hospital, although we couldn’t make out what that symbol was.</span></p>
<p><span>Much of Resident Evil Requiem was spent in the dark shadows and ambiance of the abandoned hotel with no shambling zombies or dogs to contend with. After a brief jump scare when opening a door, Grace gets her first encounter with an infected human, one thankfully already dead for good. It’s here that an even larger monster is introduced, a massive hunch-backed, grotesque fiend with massive teeth that gobble up the corpse. Due to its hulking size on par with Lady Dimitrescu, its running speed isn’t that fast, and Grace can escape her with relative ease, at least for a brief moment, before the monster escapes into the ceiling above. After another surprise encounter and getting a sizable chunk of her shoulder bitten off, Grace had to heal up using a med injector she found earlier, a healing tool that was first introduced as part of Chris Redfield’s kit in the last two mainline titles.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>In a scene that will be all too familiar as players experience the horror for themselves, Grace is slain by this hulking monster as the screen fades away. The audience is reminded that this was merely the overture to their darkest symphony to date. Resident Evil Requiem's demo session ended with a quick continue back to moments before disaster and a cheeky peek at the options to turn on a third-person camera mode. Yes, while Capcom is leading with the first-person perspective of the past few titles, third-person gameplay will be available from the start, and you can even spin the camera around and see Grace’s face, unlike the enigmatic Ethan Winters for most of his adventures.</span></p>
<p><span>Resident Evil Requiem will be available on February 27th, 2026, across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/onimusha-way-of-sword-preview-miyamoto-musashi-mayhem<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just recently, I had the chance to review&nbsp;<em>Onimusha 2</em>'s new remaster, and less than an hour in I was sold on this franchise. Since my passion for&nbsp;the series is so new, I am greatly anticipating the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>.</p>

<p>Even better, we had a chance to see a hands-off gameplay demonstration of&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>&nbsp;at Summer Game Fest 2025. It's bold and action-packed. It's the series you know and love, redefined for the modern age.</p>



<h2>The Legendary Swordsman, Miyamoto Musashi</h2>

<p>Producer Koichi Shibata was playing the live demo for&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>. The setting appears to be largely in Kyoto. Our protagonist is one of Japan's most legendary historical figures: Miyamoto Musashi.</p>

<p>This is Musashi in his younger years, so he's more concerned with training with the blade, rather than the Oni Gauntlet attached to his arm.</p>

<p>Fans familiar with the series will recognize the Oni Gauntlet. It's the means by which our protagonist absorbs the souls of Genma, the enemies of the series.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This gauntlet appears to have a personality, so we see a bit of banter between Musashi and the feminine voice residing inside of it. This dynamic is intriguing, and Musashi seems like a silly fellow in this one.&nbsp;<em>Onimusha</em>&nbsp;is already a quirky series, so there's great potential in the storytelling.</p>

<p>In this demo, the players works their way through the grounds of a shrine or temple, called Kiyomizudera Shockingly, Genma are attacking people and Musashi is ready to dive into the action.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Return of the Issen</h2>

<p>Returning players will find many familiar elements from the series return in this installment. Musashi can hack and slash away with his sword as a basic attack. Enemies, of course, drop colored souls which are absorbed in the gauntlet.</p>

<p>He's able to parry, and in one instance of combat, we see&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>&nbsp;leverage its next-gen capabilities. Musashi parries a blow from a Genma and redirects the enemy into a flaming torch. The enemy takes extra damage, so environmental damage adds a bit more depth to the combat.</p>

<p>In another instance of combat, an archer draws its bow and aims at Musashi. It's inside a small building, so Musashi grabs the tatami mat, blocks the arrows, then throws the mat at the Genma. This makes the Genma vulnerable to your attack and stuns them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Perhaps the most iconic element of&nbsp;the series, the Issen counter, also makes a return. Attacking an enemy right as they are about to hit you allows for a cinematic attack that usually one-hit kills lesser enemies. The hands-on demo makes it look easy, but I imagine that's from many hours of practice.</p>

<p>We saw Musashi use an Issen on multiple enemies at once; essentially, you can chain together an Issen attack on foes in close proximity to one another. This allows for you to take out multiple foes in quick succession, like the badass that you are.</p>



<h2>Terrifyingly Good Graphics</h2>

<p>Flying Genma -- the annoying little buggers that they are -- make a return and absorb souls from fallen foes. The way Musashi attacks and defeats these enemies are especially cinematic.&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>&nbsp;is a seriously gorgeous game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Indeed, this might just be Capcom's best looking game yet. The forest surrounding the temple is gorgeous. Capcom uses light fog and lighting to create an astonishing view.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My favorite enemy we saw were these crow-like humanoids. They're swift and can evade attacks. There's this doppleganger-like effect where you try to hit them, but the real one comes just out of reach. It's a tricky fight for Musashi!</p>

<p>We carry on through the shrine grounds, this time coming across a dark mass. Musashi can absorb these masses and get a glimpse into the past. It seems like absorbing these might be a main objective of the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Absorbing the mass shows dark, shadowy figures on the shrine grounds. We reach a larger building in the shrine and see the Genma are throwing peasants over the edge of a railing, down a cliff.</p>

<p>This is actually inspired by real folklore of the area, something I was vaguely familiar with. But our trance is soon interrupted as Musashi's longtime rival, Ganryu Sasaki, appears. He has his own Oni Gauntlet and, apparently, fully embraces its power.</p>



<h2>Battle of the Oni</h2>

<p>An exhilarating sword fight ensues. This battle really seems to really capture the feeling of a duel, with the warriors trading blows, parrying and the like. We also noticed that Ganryu has a health and stamina gauge, giving me vague hints of&nbsp;<em>Sekiro</em>&nbsp;inspiration.</p>

<p>The battle is flashy. Ganryu's helmet breaks off from your fight. Depleting his stamina gauge also allows you to do a targeted strike; you can actually choose where on his body to attack. These are color-coded and give you orbs of a particular color.</p>

<p>So if you need health during a boss fight, targeting the corresponding color will give you orbs to heal. Stabbing Ganryu in the head or abdomen were choices here, adding a little strategic element to combat.</p>



<h2><em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>We also look at one final boss encounter after Ganryu. As if reality itself is shattering like glass, malice starts to ooze out of a fissure and out comes Byakue, a large, axe-wielding Genma boss.</p>

<p>This fight features more and more parries and clashes. The parrying of attacks really stands out hear, and there seem to be so many different animations. It's quite exciting to watch, so I can only imagine how fun it is to play.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>&nbsp;had an impressive showing, and is perhaps my favorite game of the show. It's a game that shows so much dedication to the craft and doesn't deviate from what&nbsp;made&nbsp;<em>Onimusha&nbsp;</em>such a coveted IP in the first place: some good ol' action-packed demon slaying.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/resident-evil-9-requiem-closed-door-presentation-shows-classic-re-puzzles-and<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the largest surprises of the Summer Game Fest Showcase was the announcement and debut of a <em>Resident Evil 9 Requiem</em> trailer. Shortly after the public trailer was released, we got a chance to visit the Capcom theater to see not only live Onimusha gameplay but also a segment of gameplay from <em>Resident Evil 9</em>.</p>

<p>The gameplay segment opened with Grace hanging upside down and strapped to a hospital gurney. This scene was&nbsp;<em>tense</em>. Lingering on Graces face, and the subject of her attention, while she didn't say anything there was a clear conveyance of everything that was going through Grace's mind as she planned her escape.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-demo-start.jpg?itok=oFgfXfsq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-demo-start.jpg?itok=r4bHeKtl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Grace waking up, strapped to a gurney upside down, and hooked up to an IV slowly taking her blood</figcaption></figure><p>This portion of the cutscene was so precise. By pulling on the line from the IV drip in her arm, she was able to tip over and break the glass that was collecting her blood. Using the line again, she gathered up shattered glass to cut her wrists loose. Another free hand and a quick topple of the gurney, and Grace was free.</p>

<p>At this point, the experience shifted into a first-person view. Turning around, Grace began to make her way through a series of corridors. They were filled with the stable <em>Resident Evil</em> fare, tight corners, a door with a sigil that needed a key of the matching design, and a 16-foot monstrous woman that stalked Grace through the halls.</p>

<p>For many in the room the introduction of this monster was quite the jumpscare. After opening a door, Grace had a dead body collapse onto her, inspecting it on the ground a large hand quietly reached out of the darkness and with no effort picked up the dead body before raising it to her mouth and biting the head clean off. Grace's non-reaction through this process is a mix of panic and awe (much like those watching) as she's just trying to take in the abomination in front of her.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-hallway.jpg?itok=dtT_Z7hg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-hallway.jpg?itok=y2iYz97p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This section of the demo shown was structured in equal parts puzzle, as Grace tried to escape this portion of the building she was in, while also doubling down on the idea of wanting to escape from the daunting and monstroust figure that was stalking her.</p>

<p>Within the same diverting hallways, with 3-5 rooms adjacent we got to see Grace find a locked door, return with a key, locate a fuse trapped behind a locked case, obtained a screw driver, unlocked the fuse, and then made her way to a gate that is in need of a fuse.</p>

<p>While there was a lot of movement to and from the different rooms within this portion of the building, each time Grace made it to a key objective, she would be faced with a small challenge, or she would only reach the location while trying to steer clear of the monstrous woman.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-monstrous-woman.jpg?itok=ApwAR4I7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-monstrous-woman.jpg?itok=MJj5u4bt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Resident Evil 9's Mr X?</figcaption></figure><p>We didn't get to see Grace do much to mitigate the oncoming threat, but for this segment of the gameplay, it seemed the idea of Grace's character was to not be the most competent when it comes to combat, but to be able to nimbly escape.</p>

<p>There were a number of cuts between footage while viewing this <em>Resident Evil 9</em> gameplay, the key information that was missing from the footage was things like the location of the key for the locked door, or when there was some repetitive backtracking.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-key-door.jpg?itok=BYlBC4oJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-key-door.jpg?itok=aPW7C7w2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A key was obtained, but it's location obscured</figcaption></figure><p>There were a few moments when it did seem that there were some selective cuts around some additional context. Grace entered a room filled with medical equipment and while she was standing still there were some additional squealching noises. They didn't seem like they were coming from here, but they also seemed too frequent and light, they weren't coming from the giant humanoid creature.</p>

<p>This section had unsettling moment, some of the darkest corridors I've seen in games, and a plethora of jump scares as your way would get blocked by the monster.</p>

<h2>Resident Evil Requiem has First Person Mode and Third Person Mode</h2>

<p>A very interesting aspect of the gameplay clip, and one that was heralded by applause in the small showing room, was that by entering the pause menu and going to options the gameplay was able to be shifted to third person mode.</p>

<p>Once in third person and running from the monstrous woman Grace found her way to the fuse box, placed it inside, and was able to escape as the demo came to a close. The last thing that remained on the screen was "This is merely the overture to our dark symphony".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-grace.jpg?itok=fTMXSXk2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-requiem-grace.jpg?itok=hFMZsGp6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Grace in the hallway with the locked door, just around the corner to the left is where the fusebox can be found</figcaption></figure><p>The gameplay made me think of early Ethan Winters style gameplay for <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1a560db9-346a-4407-98cb-00ff8b36ed59" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review-groovy" rel="nofollow"><em>Resident Evil 7</em></a>. There was a lot of need to avoid combat, knowing that whatever it was you weren't going to want to take the face on. Grace, with her experience in the FBI, definitely has a lot of knowledge and skill under her belt, but a Resident Evil outbreak is definitely out of her comfort zone.</p>

<p>While we didn't see too much of the menus or additional mechanics when approaching the door without the key we got to see an empty inventory screen that looked like the ones being used in recent <em>Resident Evil</em> titles, and the one time that Grace was hit by the enemy a pulse meter in orange appeared in the lower left.</p>

<p>It looks like the UI will be aiming to be a light as possible, only showing relevant elements when necessary.</p>

Don’t let them cross the gate, commander!</p><p>Play as Dio, a young commander inspired by the old heroes from Greek mythos like Achilles, Hector, and Perseus. He uses spears, swords and shields to slay thousands of monsters attacking the city of Ithaca. Dio has yet to discover his true power with a wide selection of gear to be used, godlike powers to be summoned and entire new armies to be drafted for battle. This is a war for the fate of mankind.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The monsters that will try to breach your defense are many and varied. You’ll need to think carefully about combat tactics and power balance, especially when dealing with legendary bosses.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Slay Monsters And Defend The Gate</strong><ul><li>The most important goal is to not let the enemy pass through the gate. Fight against the beasts and legendary tribes from Greek mythology. They will use all their might to break through your ranks and shatter the line of defense.</li><li>In battles, you must lead your army and think of the right strategies to face different enemies.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Get The Best Gear</strong><ul><li>The mundane weapons of the world are not enough to repel the attacks of the mighty monsters. Dio needs the weapons with deadly power, the artifacts blessed by the Gods themselves.</li><li>Besides strategically arranging the armies, you’ll need to upgrade them through battles to match the stronger and more unusual enemies. The classic skill tree upgrade system combined with the sets of war technique provide the required versatility. Changing them will open up tactical options and let your defenders vanquish the ever-changing monster waves.</li><li>Make your own build with a combination of skills and become a powerful adversary for your enemies.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Fight Your Foes</strong><ul><li>Your enemies are the beasts and legendary races from Greek mythology who conflicted with humans since the dawn of time and have long wanted to exterminate them. The legions of the dead started this war, gathered the army and attacked Ithaca in great numbers. The beasts and monsters from around the region took advantage of the opportunity to advance their forces.</li><li>Pay special attention to the bosses. They are creatures of legend that caused much suffering to mankind. Now, they will use their impetuous primordial strength to break through our defenses.</li><li>Stop them from destroying our homeland and killing our people at any cost.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Find Out The Truth</strong><ul><li>The Trojan War is over.</li><li>Odysseus, king of Ithaca, became a legend because of his trick with the Trojan horse. Having returned from Troy, Odysseus regained the throne of Ithaca, but peace did not last long…</li><li>An unexpected event led to Odysseus’s death at the hand of his illegitimate son. This incident revealed a critical secret and brought an endless horde of monsters to the gates of Ithaca.</li></ul></li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the launch trailer below.</p><h2><span>Consoles Launch Trailer/h2&gt;<p><iframe title="Legendary Hoplite - Consoles Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3SXRgeaTXDQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></span></h2></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>CCP Games announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ccp-games-announce-new-title-eve-frontier-same-universe-as-eve-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EVE Frontier</a>, its new space survival MMO, has now opened public access with 'Founder Access: New Era' following the previous Closed Alpha stage.</p>
<p>EVE Frontier is set in an enigmatic and hostile galaxy shaped by its players' activities. Players inhabit Riders: awakened clones flung into the Frontier without purpose or memory of the world around them. As they explore the darkness, they must construct shelters, form Tribes, and gather resources to increase their power and survive the ever-present danger of annihilation.</p>
<p>Founder Access: New Era also introduces a brand-new seasonal progression system for EVE Frontier called Cycles. The first cycle, Promised Lands, begins today. Players will earn Grace by completing in-game missions and activities and rise to the top of each Cycle Leaderboard alongside their Tribe. As the New Era progresses, new missions, objectives, and content will be introduced in subsequent Cycles.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bend-studio-layoffs-days-gone</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/days-gone-developer-bend-studio-lays-off-one-third-of-staff.1215543/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bend-studio-layoffs-days-gone<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Days Gone&nbsp;</em>developer Bend Studio has been hit by sweeping layoffs affecting around a third of the company's staff, parent company Sony has confirmed.</p>

<p>In a statement given to <a href="https://kotaku.com/days-gone-sony-bend-canceled-shooter-layoffs-1851784264" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kotaku</a>, Sony says the layoffs are part of "strategic changes to better position the studio for long-term success", a pretty standard corporate line. The company goes on to say that the "workforce reduction" was a decision that was "not made lightly", and that those being laid off made "meaningful contributions" to Bend Studio.</p>

<p>Sony did not, however, confirm the exact scope of the layoffs. That figure comes from Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, who said on social media platform <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lrbil2zvis2q" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>&nbsp;that "around 40 people", i.e. 30% of Bend Studio's staff, had been laid off.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bend-studio-layoffs-days-gone-gameplay.jpg?itok=-bKvUQga 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bend-studio-layoffs-days-gone-gameplay.jpg?itok=KZQIiDpL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Days Gone&nbsp;</em>developer Bend Studio has been hit by layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>These layoffs come after Sony canceled two of its in-development live-service projects <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-live-service-games-canceled" rel="nofollow">back in January</a>, one of which was in the works at Bend Studio. In the statement given to Kotaku, Sony said it made the decision not to proceed with Bend's game following "careful consideration".</p>

<p>According to Schreier, Bend Studio is currently working on a new project that it started following the live-service game's cancellation, and Sony says it remains "confident in [Bend Studio's] future and creative direction", so it sounds as though the studio is still working on a game of some sort.</p>

<p>Layoffs at Bend Studio come after a wider wave that has swept across the industry, affecting smaller studios like&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Laylee&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playtonic-layoffs-yooka-laylee" rel="nofollow">Playtonic</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Oxenfree&nbsp;</em>outfit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oxenfree-night-school-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Night School</a>, as well as larger companies like EA subsidiary <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-project-cancellations" rel="nofollow">Respawn</a> and tech giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-3-percent-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>.</p>

<p>Bend Studio's game is also not the only live-service project Sony has canceled in recent months. As well as the other game shut down at the same time as Bend's, live-service shooter&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">shut down mere days after its launch</a> last year.</p>

Its next live-service project is Bungie's&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed" rel="nofollow">due to launch in September</a>; as far as we know, that's still the case, despite lukewarm reception to previews and the recent revelation that an artist who previously worked on the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-marathon-art-stolen" rel="nofollow">stole artwork from an online artist</a>.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what kind of game Bend Studio is working on next, but there will be a lot of folks hoping it's a&nbsp;<em>Days Gone&nbsp;</em>sequel. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/video/685229/nintendo-switch-2-gamechat-c-button-mario-kart<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Nintendo introduced a new hardware button to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682661/nintendo-switch-2-early-hands-on-mario-kart-world">the Switch 2</a> specifically for chatting with your friends, and it’s undoubtedly my favorite feature on the console. Instead of using a smartphone app like the original Switch, Switch 2 users can open up a communications channel at any time with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">the “C” button</a> and chat with friends, whether they’re playing the same game or something else.</p><p>That idea sounds a little outdated with the popularity of Discord, but Nintendo makes the process seamless enough that I can imagine a lot of people will end up using it. Last Friday, a few of my colleagues and I hopped into a GameChat session together and played <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World</a></em> online — all of us communicating through the built-in microphone on our consoles and various USB webcams, with our likeness displayed on the bottom of the screen.</p><p>The noise reduction and compression processing on the Switch 2’s mic was surprisingly impressive: my audio was clear and easy to understand without any background noise, even when sitting 5-10 feet away from the console. The Switch 2’s face detection and background removal with its camera works well, too, and it was hilariously useful when a cutout of our faces showed up over our Mario Kart characters during a race. </p><div><p><figcaption><em>Jay and Sean speeding past me in </em>Mario Kart World <em>while on GameChat. </em></figcaption></p></div><p>GameChat’s screensharing feature, on the other hand, leaves much to be desired. The frame rate for each user’s gameplay feed is very low and compressed, making it choppy and hard to follow. Nintendo seems to be limiting the video feeds for a steadier and more consistent experience, but this didn’t actually prevent dropouts. My colleague Cameron’s video feed was interrupted multiple times, and he had to rejoin the session for his camera stream or gameplay to display again. I later came across this problem myself. Nintendo also limits the amount of users who can share video to four per session; eight more can join the chat but only stream their audio.</p><p>The feature is free right now, but only for a limited time. After March 31st, 2026, Switch 2 users will need to pay for a Nintendo Switch Online membership to use GameChat. Console gamers are used to paying for online play, but having to pay to use <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/684602/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review">a button on the controller</a> expands just how much of the console experience is locked behind a subscription. </p><p>Despite those limits, I can imagine a world where my best friend calls me on my Switch 2 to make dinner plans or to play a strategic round of Splatoon. This setup also becomes a perfect setup for a Twitch stream. The low-stakes, easy setup voice call is a delightful and useful addition to Nintendo’s updated console, and has the potential to be a central hub for a lot of new ways to play games like <em>Mario Kart</em>, <em>Animal Crossing</em>, and <em>Fortnite</em>.</p><p>Now, I just need to convince my manager to open up a GameChat for our weekly creative meeting. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

To kick things off, players <a href="https://shop.marvelsnap.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">can log into the Web Shop</a> and claim the following free items with the promo code <strong>WEBLAUNCH</strong>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IB6daEk16kI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IB6daEk16kI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><ul><li>1 x Premium Mystery Variant</li><li>1 x Premium Mystery Border</li><li>3 x high-value one-time purchase bundles</li><li>Daily Free Claim Boost: 200 Credits per day</li></ul><p>The freebies available here are pretty good, as these items normally cost quite a bit when using the in-game "Gold" currency. A Premium Mystery variant on its own costs 800 Gold, and that's a sum that typically takes around a month to earn in the game if you don't buy the monthly season pass. Also on the horizon is a weekly promotional event called Web Shop Wednesdays, and players will be able to claim a free Common Mystery Border for one of their cards. A $5 bundle will also be offered, and this includes a Common Mystery Border and 600 Gold.</p><p>Second Dinner has made several big changes to Marvel Snap since it first launched in 2022, with one of the biggest being a complete overhaul of how cards are acquired. Players can now earn Collector's Tokens that can be used to purchase cards, and regular play makes it easy enough to unlock at least one of the older cards every week. The newer cards require more grinding, but earning them is still much easier compared to the older system that was in place.</p><p>Marvel Snap's current season, Masters of the Arcane, also began earlier this month, and it focuses on several of Marvel's mystical characters like Merlin, Morgan Le Fay, and Nicholas Scratch.</p>

<p>"It should have been an OLED screen from the get-go"</p>

<figure><a title="Poll: Are You Happy With Switch 2's Screen? Because Some People Certainly Aren't 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dc28822f1aab7/poll-are-you-happy-with-switch-2s-screen-because-some-people-certainly-arent-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>One aspect of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Nintendo Switch 2</a> that has generated a <em>lot</em> of interest is its display. While Nintendo released an OLED model of the original Switch, which massively improved over the launch model's LCD screen, for Switch 2, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/the-switch-2s-screen-isnt-oled-but-it-will-support-1080p120fps-gameplay">it has opted to return to LCD technology</a>.</p>
<p>On the whole, it's fair to say that the decision has gone down fairly well; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/weve-seen-switch-2s-lcd-screen-in-the-flesh-and-it-really-doesnt-feel-like-a-downgrade">as we reported after our first hands-on sessions</a>, the panel used in the Switch 2 is <em>leagues</em> ahead of the one we got back in 2017, with superb brightness and bold colours.</p>
<p>However, due to the way LCD screens work, a little bit of blurriness is inevitable; OLED panels exhibit almost instant pixel response, which cuts down on blur (but, on the downside, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/psa-sensitive-to-pwm-flicker-youll-want-to-keep-the-switch-oleds-screen-nice-and-bright">generates a flicker which can actually give some people headaches</a>). In contrast, LCD screens have slower pixel response, and this can manifest itself as a blurred image when things move fast.</p>
<p>This issue has been flagged by more than one person since the console launched last week:</p>



<p>As noted by Cary Golomb, it is believed that Nintendo is utilising two different screen suppliers for Switch 2: Innolux and Sharp. According to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social/post/3lpleplmndc2h">Nintendo Patents Watch</a>, the quality gap between these two options isn't as large as many people would have you believe, but the fact that there are two versions has predictably led to some comparing this to the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-nintendo-screen-lottery-its-a-thing-and-it-sucks.57152/">'screen lottery'</a> which occurred when both the Nintendo DS and 3DS were released.</p>
<p>You can see how the Switch 2's LCD panel compares with the Switch OLED in the video below:</p>

<p>As we've already established, there will be some blur on the Switch 2's screen when compared to an OLED panel—that's beyond debate—but is it enough to cause serious complaints?</p>
<p>I'm personally pretty happy with the Switch 2's display, but I have noticed that it's a little blurry when things are moving at high speed. It obviously depends heavily on the game you're playing; I could barely notice it on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, but it was more obvious when playing Switch 1 games with 2D artwork (the overworld map in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/unicorn_overlord">Unicorn Overlord</a> is especially bad, to my eyes).</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dune: Awakening - 5 Things To Know</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">For context, Dune: Awakening is proving much more popular than Dune: Spice Wars, which is a strategy title. The latter topped out with 8,397 concurrent players on Valve's storefront, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1605220/charts/" rel="nofollow ">SteamDB</a>. As such, Dune: Awakening appears to be the biggest game ever for the Dune franchise--with four other games based on the sci-fi series coming out between 1992 and 2001.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking ahead, Funcom has confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-is-coming-to-console-funcom-confirms-as-pc-game-puts-up-huge-numbers/1100-6532326/">Dune: Awakening will arrive on home consoles in 2026</a>. That said, the studio hasn't stated exactly which systems will get the game, though PS5 and Xbox Series X|S would make the most sense. As for Switch 2, that seems more up in the air.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-multiplayer-guide-how-to-party-up-with-friends/1100-6532181/">Dune: Awakening guide for partying up with friends</a>.</p>
