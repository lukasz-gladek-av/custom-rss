            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24178010/jackbox-games-megapicker-party-packs-library<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="Xx0xMG">The Jackbox Party Packs are getting a much-needed quality of life improvement — a singular source from which all Jackboxes may flow. <a href="https://www.jackboxgames.com/blog/introducing-the-jackbox-megapicker">Today, Jackbox Games announced <em>The Jackbox Megapicker</em></a>, a free product for Steam that allows players to put their various Game Packs under one umbrella. The<em> Megapicker</em> will release in July.</p>
<p id="lW1J0n">As a regular Jackbox Games host, I can attest this has been sorely needed. There are a <em>lot</em> of minigames over the 10 Jackbox Party Packs — over 50, in fact, and while some of them are made redundant by sequels, there’s still a couple of games from every pack worth revisiting.</p>
<p id="NQoDKG">That variety is why Jackbox is such a party pleaser. <em>Guesspionages </em>is a clever little guessing game that’s novel and not too competitive, while <em>Survive the Internet</em> allows for my friends and I to assail each other with the worst possible takes imaginable. <em>Push the Button</em> is a chaotic experience with lots of yelling and blaming, while <em>Job Job</em> is a much more chill and goofy experience. There’s something for everyone.</p>
<p id="DLofBd">But when playing with friends, it immediately becomes awkward to have to shut the stream down, open up a new Party Pack, check and make sure Extended Timers is toggled on, and restart the stream. Admittedly it’s a pretty small gripe in the grand scheme of things, but it’s one that’s persisted for a decade, so the <em>Megapicker </em>is a nice thing to have. The developers will be hosting an AMA on Reddit closer to the launch, where they will share more information and answer fan questions. </p>

The former Xbox exclusive <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/02/21/sea-of-thieves-sets-sail-for-playstation-5-this-april">first arrived on the platform</a> on April 30.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/13/playstation-store-may-2024s-top-downloads/">PlayStation Blog post</a> reveals that Sea of Thieves was the best-selling PS5 title across the US/Canada and the EU, beating out top-performing games like Grand Theft Auto V, Madden NFL 24, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. That's quite the debut and shows that PlayStation owners have an appetite for the open-world co-op pirate game. It’s also worth noting that Grounded, another first-party Xbox exclusive that was brought to PlayStation in April, placed 11th on this list (for the US/Canada).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Here’s the full list of top 20 best-selling PS5 games in the US/Canada for May</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Sea of Thieves</li>
	<li>Madden NFL 24</li>
	<li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III</li>
	<li>Helldivers 2</li>
	<li>NBA 2K24</li>
	<li>MLB The Show 24</li>
	<li>Stellar Blade</li>
	<li>Fallout 4</li>
	<li>Who’s Your Daddy?!</li>
	<li>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege</li>
	<li>Grounded</li>
	<li>Another Crab’s Treasure</li>
	<li>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</li>
	<li>NHL 24</li>
	<li>Killer Klown’s From Outer Space: The Game</li>
	<li>Rise of the Ronin</li>
	<li>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/sora-explores-final-fantasy-15-city-in-kingdom-hearts-3-mod/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=sora-explores-final-fantasy-15-city-in-kingdom-hearts-3-mod<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="333" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Long after its 2019 release, the <em>Kingdom Hearts 3 </em>mod scene is still thriving, especially with the Steam launch this week. And thanks to one modder, Larxian, <em>Final Fantasy</em> may have a little more to explore in <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> as they’ve dropped Sora right into the <em>Final Fantasy 1</em>5 city, Insomnia, with their in-development mod. </p> <h2 id="h-sora-uses-his-flowmotion-abilities-all-over-insomnia" data-injectable="false">Sora uses his flowmotion abilities all over Insomnia</h2> <p data-characters="424" data-current-count="424" data-injectable="true">Insomnia is the crown city of <em>Final Fantasy 15, </em>in which Noctis lived throughout his childhood and he returns to later in life. In this mod, we can play as Sora swinging on the architecture of the city and zooming from place to place in an instant. It’s reminiscent of Noctis maneuvering his way around the skyscraper in the initial <a href="https://youtu.be/b6At_bb1PNU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Final Fantasy Versus XIII </em>reveal trailer</a>…just less gory, a little more Disney. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true">Larxian began to share details on social media about the mod project in <a href="https://youtu.be/I1_lpRcCBhU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">March 2023</a>. They have since added NPCs to the city and even included a Moogle Shop. The modder tracks their progress on X, and you can follow along by searching for #InsomniaMod. While there’s no ETA just yet, it looks like they’ve made plenty of headway in bringing Insomnia to life. </p>
 <h2 id="h-this-kingdom-hearts-3-mod-might-be-the-beginning-of-what-s-to-come" data-injectable="false">This Kingdom Hearts 3 mod might be the beginning of what’s to come</h2> <p data-characters="537" data-current-count="537" data-injectable="true">Ever since the <em>Kingdom Hearts 3 </em>secret movie, many fans have speculated on the parallels between the <em>Versus XIII </em>marketing and the secret movie. It’s all thanks to <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>director Tetsuya Nomura’s history as the director of the <em>Versus XIII</em> project before it transitioned to <em>Final Fantasy 15. </em>One of the last shots of the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kingdom-hearts-3-pc-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Hearts 3</a> Re: Mind</em> secret movie is influenced by the scene in which Noctis is sitting at the back of a limousine car, looking out towards the window. Yozora is doing the exact same motion. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Noctis and Yozora - Car Scene Comparison (Final Fantasy Versus XII, Kingdom Hearts III Re:Mind)" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5xrgOJMcZTA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="134" data-current-count="434" data-injectable="false">Perhaps in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kingdom-hearts-4-release-date-characters-and-everything-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Hearts 4</a>, </em>we’ll see Quadratum’s version of Insomnia and the skyscraper, like those we see in this mod. </p>

<p data-characters="270" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Developer Behaviour Interactive completely reworked how the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-dead-by-daylight-twisted-masquerade-challenges-and-how-to-complete-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twisted Masquerade Event</a> works in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-dead-by-daylight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead by Daylight</a></em> for 2024. It has new mechanics to master that can give you an advantage as both the Killer and Survivor in every Trial, but only if you know how to work them. </p> <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="true">2024’s version of the Twisted Masquerade in <em>Dead by Daylight</em> has Invitations, though not as you know them, and Tryks, which completely change the game in a Trial. Each is designed to give you an advantage. Tryks occur after meeting set requirements and are out of your control, but Invitations add abilities to your Survivor, allowing you to access powers that would usually require Perks for you to activate. </p>
 <h2 id="h-how-tryks-work-in-dead-by-daylight-twisted-masquerade-2024" data-injectable="false">How Tryks work in <em>Dead by Daylight</em> Twisted Masquerade 2024</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="549" data-injectable="true">Tryks is an NPC in <em>Dead by Daylight</em> who roams the Twisted Masquerade, throwing out random effects for the Trials. The Bag of Tryks will apply one status effect and/or temporary change to objectives, and the first one is activated as a Trial begins. </p>
 <p data-characters="447" data-current-count="447" data-injectable="true">A new Tryk will be applied with every two Party Events completed. Party Events are objectives such as repairing generators or hooking a Survivor for the first time. This means multiple Tryks will be in play towards the end of a Trial. However, they’re all disabled when the Trial reaches the end game collapse. Below, I’ve listed every Tryk in the event and what it does to the Trial so you know why strange things might be occurring. </p>
 <ul data-found-items="9" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>You’re Invited</strong>: Killer and Survivors gain 1 Invitation charge.</li> <li><strong>No Invite For You!</strong>: Killer and Survivors lose 1 Invitation charge. </li> <li><strong>Peekaboo!</strong>: Killer’s and Survivor’s auras are revealed to everyone in the Trial for 8 seconds.</li> <li><strong>Move it or Lose it!</strong>: Apply 30% Haste to Killer and Survivors for 60 seconds. </li> <li><strong>Heal You, Expose You</strong>: All Survivors receive get 1 health state back or are mended if they’re inflicted with Deep Wound. Then, they’re afflicted with the Exposed status for 30 seconds.</li> <li><strong>Wait, Where..?</strong>: Suppresses the Killer’s Terror Radius and Survivors’ scratch marks for 30 seconds. </li> <li><strong>Party Totem!</strong>: All Dull totems become Anniversary totems and glow in a festive blue and gold tint. Interacting with them grants Bloodpoints, 30% Haste for 5 seconds, and reveals your aura to the opposing role when successfully channeled. Interrupted actions only give you Bloodpoints. An Anniversary Totem becomes a DUll totem after their gift has been granted. </li> <li><strong>Party Chest!</strong>: All unopened chests become Anniversary Chests that glow a festive blue and gold tint when within 8 meters of them. After 60 seconds, all Anniversary Chests open on their own in an explosion of festive confetti. When within the aura range of any Anniversary Chest as this happens, Survivors will scream and suffer Hindered status effect for 4 seconds, and the Killer will be stunned. If you open an Anniversary Chest before the Tryk expires, you get a guaranteed random Anniversary item. </li> <li><strong>ZZL Zilch!</strong>: Nothing happened, you got Tryks!</li> </ul> <h2 id="h-how-invitations-work-in-dead-by-daylight-twisted-masquerade-2024" data-injectable="false">How Invitations work in <em>Dead by Daylight</em> Twisted Masquerade 2024</h2> <figure data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="431" data-current-count="431" data-injectable="true">Invitations will only appear in Twisted Masquerade Trials in <em>Dead by Daylight</em>. When you pick one up, you’ll automatically have one charge to use it. Once you’ve used that charge, you must wait for the Invitation to recharge before you can use one of its abilities again. You’ll be able to see the location of an Invitation when you’re within 8 meters of it, so keep moving around, and you should spot them. </p>
 <p data-characters="187" data-current-count="187" data-injectable="false">Invitations have different abilities for Killers and Survivors. I’ve listed all of the abilities below so you can see exactly what’s possible when you pick one up in a Trial. </p> <h3 id="h-all-survivor-invitation-abilities" data-injectable="false">All Survivor Invitation abilities</h3> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="307" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Block Window Vault</strong>: During a chase, you can vault through a window and make it unvaultable to the Killer for 4 seconds. </li> <li><strong>Set Party Pallet</strong>: Creates a Party Pallet in an unused Pallet location. </li> <li><strong>Quiet Mode</strong>: For 15 seconds, it reduces grunts of pain, footstep noises, fast actions, and pools of blood by 100%. </li> </ul> <h3 id="h-all-killer-invitation-abilities" data-injectable="false">All Killer Invitation abilities</h3> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="427" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Endure Stun</strong>: During a chase, reduce stun duration by 50% for the next 4 seconds.</li> <li><strong>Remote Destroy</strong>: Breaks a distant pallet or breakable wall. </li> <li><strong>Remote Hook</strong>: Remotely hooks a downed Survivor to the nearest available hook. </li> </ul>

<p data-characters="237" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s safe to say that there are a lot of games included as part of Steam’s Next Fest, but I’ve scrolled through all of them (yes, all of them, it took me a very long time) and downloaded all of the coziest games I could find.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false">Some of these games offer pure cozy vibes, while others may be better described as cozy-adjacent. They’re not all life-sims, but they all offer something unique and provided me with positive vibes while I played. Here’s the ten that came out on top in my playtesting.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-garden-witch-life" data-injectable="false"><strong>Garden Witch Life</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="573" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false">For at least 15 years now, I’ve had a hankering for a game which gave me the same satisfaction as <em>Cooking Mama</em>. I didn’t expect to find it in a game about a girl who just lost her job and is looking for her place in life, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1240450/Garden_Witch_Life/"><em>Garden Witch Life</em></a><em> </em>scratches the <em>Cooking Mama </em>shaped itch in my brain. I mean, you actually get to chop the ingredients for soup!&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="226" data-current-count="586" data-injectable="true">That, along with the glimpse into the heartwarming story offered in the demo, leave me impatiently waiting for the full release of <em>Garden Witch Life</em>. You get ten in-game days to explore your new home, so make the most of them.</p>
 <h2 id="h-tiny-glade" data-injectable="false"><strong>Tiny Glade</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="225" data-current-count="525" data-injectable="true">It’s no secret by now that I love <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2198150/Tiny_Glade/"><em>Tiny Glade</em></a>, the demo for which technically released before Next Fest by a couple of weeks. However, it is included on the list of games available so you know I had to include it here.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="477" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="true">Effortlessly create tiny little towns or medieval ruins, erect a monolithic tower fit for Rapunzel or design a miniature secret garden – <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/after-10-hours-in-the-tiny-glade-demo-im-still-not-bored/"><em>Tiny Glade</em></a> lets you do it all without the worry of having to actually figure out the mechanics, because the game does all of that for you. Where paths intersect a wall, a door or arch is created. Windows are freely movable and flowers pop up at the click of a button. <em>Tiny Glade</em> is set for big things when it releases later this year.</p>
 <h2 id="h-fields-of-mistria" data-injectable="false"><strong>Fields of Mistria</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="134" data-current-count="434" data-injectable="true">If you took <em>Stardew Valley</em> and said “hey, how come the Wizard is the only magical one here?”, you’d get <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2142790/Fields_of_Mistria/"><em>Fields of Mistria</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="346" data-injectable="false">I won’t go into too much detail, as you can read my <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fields-of-mistria-gives-me-flashbacks-to-my-first-stardew-valley-experience/">full opinion of the game here</a>, but it’s safe to say that I’m waiting for the full release on July 5 with bated breath. You get three in-game days to play, which isn’t nearly enough to explore and discover everything, but you do have the option to play again when your three days are up.</p> <h2 id="h-amber-isle" data-injectable="false"><strong>Amber Isle</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="646" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="329" data-current-count="329" data-injectable="false">Imagine you’re a dinosaur, setting out on the biggest adventure of your life, only to fall out of your hot air balloon and through the roof of a newly renovated shop. That’s the start of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1663040/Amber_Isle/"><em>Amber Isle</em></a>, before you meet the incredibly grumpy Mayor of the town and set out to impress him with your crafting and shop-keeping skills.</p> <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="656" data-injectable="true">What cements <em>Amber Isle</em> on this list is the character creation. The options are endless, with a full RGB color selector, which means you can be truly unique. You can change the color and design of everything from your arm tufts to your teeth, so you’re unlikely to look exactly the same as any other dinosaur out there.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-galaxy-burger" data-injectable="false"><strong>Galaxy Burger</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="117" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="true">I would say that this is the strangest offering on this list, but it isn’t. You’ll see a weirder one later.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2749770/Galaxy_Burger/"><em>Galaxy Burger</em></a> sees you running a string of burger joints across the galaxy, beginning on Mercury. It starts out easy enough – griddle the patties, try not to burn the cheese and fulfill orders for cats in mech suits. As soon as you progress to Venus, though, you have multiple customers and a hugely expanded cooking station, not to mention you need to memorize multiple different recipes if you want to get top points for cooking time.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="238" data-injectable="false">I know it doesn’t sound very cozy and, in truth, there was some stress at times. However, there are cats involved and that instantly makes anything cozy… Right? In my defense, I did say that some of these games would be cozy-adjacent.</p> <h2 id="h-love-ghostie" data-injectable="false"><strong>Love, Ghostie</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="538" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="246" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1789490/Love_Ghostie/"><em>Love, Ghostie</em></a> is a game from Janbeh Games where you play as a Ghost who is newly haunting a house of shared occupancy. Without being seen, you need to help the residents of the house couple up, by leaving gifts from one resident to another.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true">You need to manage your resources and decide which residents would make the best couples before becoming a spectral cupid, shooting arrows to make love happen. The art style is captivating and honestly, <em>Love, Ghostie</em> is just a joy to play all around.</p>
 <h2 id="h-tavern-talk" data-injectable="false"><strong>Tavern Talk</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="432" data-current-count="732" data-injectable="true">I don’t know about you, but I’m so used to being on the adventurer side of RPGs that it would be nice to be on the quest-giving side of things every once in a while, almost like being an NPC. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2076140/Tavern_Talk/"><em>Tavern Talk</em></a> offers that, and you play as the barkeep in a tavern visited by adventurers from across the realm of Asteria. You gather rumors and use them to create quests, which can then be picked up by any adventurer who enters the Inn.</p>
 <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="230" data-injectable="false">One visitor, Fable, is an elven girl suffering from cripplingly low confidence and self-esteem issues. She seeks advice, and you give it, but it often feels like you’re giving advice to yourself. Or maybe that’s just me.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="504" data-injectable="true">Alongside the visual novel aspect to <em>Tavern Talk</em>, you also have to mix drinks to specific recipes. Each ingredient corresponds to a different attribute, which will all be very familiar to anyone who has ever played an RPG before, including Dexterity, Strength, and Charisma.</p>
 <h2 id="h-cats-around-us-giant-cat" data-injectable="false"><strong>Cats Around Us: Giant Cat</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true">Now hear me out: I know this is a hidden object game at the most basic level, but there’s more to it than that. Not only do you have to find the 31 hidden cats in the demo, but you can also turn the picture itself into a coloring page and honestly, what’s more calming and cozy than doing some coloring on a rainy day?</p>
 <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false">Like I said, there are 31 cats to find, including the larger than life Giant Cat from the title, but that’s just one level of what will eventually be the full release of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2925310/Cats_Around_Us__Giant_Cat/"><em>Cats Around Us</em></a>. There’s also a speedrun mode, so once you’ve pinpointed where all of the cats are, you can race against yourself to beat your best time – but doesn’t that go against all things cozy?</p> <h2 id="h-farlands" data-injectable="false"><strong>Farlands</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="682" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2252680/Farlands/"><em>Farlands</em></a><em> </em>reminds me of <em>Stardew Valley</em> in a huge way, but if some kind of bizarre event happened to turn your farm into a planet in its own right, and a thousand years passed. The mechanics on the planet are essentially the same, but there’s a whole universe to explore with the help of your spaceship.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="607" data-injectable="true">You can use crops and forageables to create fuel cells and then use the fuel cells to visit every planet in the solar system, meeting new friends and finding new items at every stop. What’s not to love about exploring a galaxy filled with aliens and building questionable relationships with them?</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>Oddada</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="129" data-current-count="429" data-injectable="true">Remember when I said that <em>Galaxy Burger</em> wasn’t the strangest offering on this list? Well, let me introduce you to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1627870/ODDADA/"><em>Oddada</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="320" data-current-count="320" data-injectable="false"><em>Oddada</em> is a game about creating music using toy-like objects which spark a huge amount of nostalgia for childhood years. It’s like putting wooden blocks together, except those wooden blocks are musical and depending on where you put them, or when you place them down, you get a different song at the end of the game.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="712" data-injectable="true">Playing the <em>Oddada</em> demo might have been the most bizarre yet most relaxing ten minutes I’ve had in a very long time. It’s so easy to just zone out and simply play with blocks, and while the music I created definitely won’t be topping any charts (and probably shouldn’t ever be heard by anyone outside of myself), it’s quaint and I felt oddly proud of myself for what I’d achieved.</p>
 <p data-characters="169" data-current-count="169" data-injectable="false">At the end of it all, you get to design a cassette tape to go with your song. And if you don’t know what a cassette tape is, thanks for reminding me just how old I am.</p>

Here's a more specific release date that'll matter more to some of you: The Lost Crown itself will come to Steam on August 8th.

<p>The Lost Crown has been exclusively available via <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">the Epic Games Store</a> and Ubisoft's own launcher since its release back in January. Its pending arrival on Steam feels like it's happening faster than normal, perhaps because The Lost Crown is a critical darling that reportedly hasn't sold that well so far.
</p>
<p>Time was, I'd happily play games wherever they were to be found, but the Steam Deck has changed that. Suddenly I too want all games to come to Steam quickly. The Lost Crown seems like it would be perfect on the handheld, too, so much so that I feel a small tinge of regret that I didn't wait and completed it earlier in the year.
</p>
<p>Only a small tinge of regret however, because The Lost Crown truly deserves to be a critical darling. It's a platforming-heavy metroidvania with a substantial world to explore, some wonderful puzzle arenas to solve, and a series of escalating, bombastic boss fights that I could actually win. Katharine variously called it deep, challenging and intensely friendly in her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review">Prince Of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> review, and she's not wrong. You'll find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2751000/Prince_of_Persia_The_Lost_Crown/">its Steam page here</a>.</p>

			<p><span>We recently went hands-on with the first half-hour of gameplay in <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-long-awaited-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> running on PC. After a brief story-heavy introductory cutscene, we were sent off running through dark corridors at our own pace with danger not far behind. As one that has had more than a short break from the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series (Shadow of Chernobyl and the L.U.R.K. mod were honestly my last real in-depth experience with the series nearly a decade and a half ago, although I did dabble in a bit of Clear Sky back at release), so much of the world and inventory feels right at home. Name one other RPG where random bottles of vodka and tinned cat food are just as essential in your inventory as spare bandages and bullets.</span></p>
<p><span>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl’s gunplay remains a strong focus to differentiate it from other open-world games. Both players and enemies alike go down in just a few bullets and if not for the sparsely littered medkits and bottles of vodka, I would’ve been left traversing the Zone in a permanently critical state. Most weapons thankfully use interchangeable ammo types across the class, however, I found a wide assortment of caliber rounds that would each clutter my inventory in individual stacks despite having never come across a weapon that could use them. Hiding in a side room in one of the buildings I explored was an assault rifle that was numerically slightly more efficient at indiscriminate murder that I wound up swapping to it, only to never find another stash of ammo for it. My packrat nature made me want to hold onto that gun for the rest of the demo, cluttering up my inventory space rather than discarding it. If this were the full game, I’d probably still have held onto it to vendor it for enough rubles to buy a can of Tourist’s Delight.</span></p>
<p><span>Anomalies remain one of the most dangerous aspects of the landscape in STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl. Veteran players have had years of experience throwing bolts at and subsequently activating anomalies just long enough to sidestep them. For the demo, my main character carried around a military-grade scanner meant to extrapolate data from the anomaly breach upon activation. That meant getting close to them and giving them a quick scan before the main story would progress. One anomaly was scanned and eliminated without much of a hitch (save for one enemy approaching and attacking me when I was guarding the scanner), while the other kept hitting me with an electric pulse that would quickly burn through my life and kill me after just a few seconds. This went on for a few tries before ultimately finishing my scan and venturing forth to stumble across a roaming group of bandits before my demo time had lapsed. The first anomaly rewarded me with a low-rank Slug anomaly that provided a small resistance boost once slotted into one of my character’s four artifact slots. As with the last three titles, I’m sure that STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl’s artifacts will be the key bit of kit necessary to surviving the Zone.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/STALKER-2-Reload-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>Cover wasn’t readily available to provide a sense of tactics in <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-gets-new-gorgeous-the-time-of-opportunities-trailer/">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>. Most of the firefights took place in the swampy open world with few objects to duck behind like rusted vehicles and abandoned farm sheds. Roughly midway through my demo, I was caught by surprise in the open against a mutant that would turn invisible and try to get behind my field of view. It took a few deaths and restarts to deal enough damage to stun it long enough to whip out a quick bandage and shoot it when it would phase back into reality. I could’ve easily kept shooting the wispy form as it navigated around, but ammo for my assault rifle and handheld Uzi were both sparse from firefights with random raiders that didn’t give me the right ammo types back when I looted their corpses.</span></p>
<p><span>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl feels modernized in ways that AAA games have developed over the years. A minimap has been replaced with a compass permanently affixed to the top of the screen, pointing to nearby points of interest and quest markers. Enemies are also marked with red dots when alive and gray X’s once they fall, giving the player a visual reminder of where to find their backpacks and that sweet low-level loot within. The firing mode indicator located beneath your ammo count indicates whether the weapon is toggled to semi-auto or fully automatic fire. Most of the information that needs to be conveyed to the player is presented in unobtrusive HUD elements shrunk down to the edges of the screen, giving more screen real estate for players to admire the corrupted beauty of the Ukrainian Zone.</span></p>
<p><span>For many fans, STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl has been a long time coming, but the wait is finally ending. Despite the challenges of developing a AAA title in a country currently ravaged by an invasive war, GSC Game World has put its best foot forward and shown why it’s been worth the wait. The game will be available exclusively on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/">PC</a> and Xbox Series S|X on September 5.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-game-modes-officially-revealed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Bandai Namco Entertainment has unveiled three new Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero  game modes. These game modes include Episode Battles, Custom Battles, and local multiplayer. Discover more about the new game modes below.</p>



<h2 id="h-dragon-ball-sparking-zero-episode-battles">Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Episode Battles</h2>



<p>Episode Battles, a single-player game mode, offers a nostalgic journey through some of the most iconic battles from the beloved Dragon Ball anime series. You’ll get to relive these battles from the perspectives of eight different characters, including the legendary Goku and Vegeta. Each stage in this mode is introduced with a level that revisits the most memorable battles from Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball Super. The single-player mode’s story elements span from Dragon Ball Z’s first arc with Radditz to Dragon Ball Super’s last arc, The Tournament of Power.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The number of stages will differ for each character, and Goku has the most significant number of stages in the game. Additionally, the story segments will include new first-person cutscenes, providing players with a chance to step into the shoes of these characters.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO - Game Mode Showcase" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yW0NyXB62Vs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Furthermore, there is a choice system for certain stages where the events will change according to your decisions. Some instances of this system were shown in the trailer. For example, we saw Krillin die at the hands of Ozaru Vegeta (Ape form), which led to Goku turning Super Saiyan earlier than expected. Another example was Future Trunks and Vegeta performing the renowned ‘Father-Son’ attack against Cell using a Final Flash instead of Kamehameha. I’m excited to see what other scenarios this choice system can lead to!</p>



<h2 id="h-dragon-ball-sparking-zero-custom-battles-nbsp">Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Custom Battles&nbsp;</h2>



<p>This game offers a Custom Battles mode where players can add different modifiers, win conditions, and custom cutscenes to make battles more immersive. Players can try Custom Battles solo or play online with another player. The game also includes a Bonus Battle mode in Custom Battles, with original battle situations and event cutscenes created by the developers, which trigger after meeting certain conditions. </p>



<p>Another interesting feature is the Edit mode in Custom Battles, allowing players to select characters to create custom pre-battle and post-battle cutscenes to make their fights more unique. Players can then submit these creations online for the community to view and play. The Edit mode also allows players to edit existing in-game content and use Bonus Battles as a foundation.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-dragon-ball-sparking-zero-local-multiplayer-nbsp">Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Local Multiplayer&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Bandai Namco has confirmed that Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero will have local multiplayer. However, this feature has some limitations. The local multiplayer mode can only be accessed through the Hyperbolic Time Chamber and will be in split-screen format. Additionally, character selection is designed for single-player mode only, so the two players cannot select their characters simultaneously.</p>



<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero’s producer, Jun Furutani, explained that they made the game with online and offline single-player mode in mind. Furutani expanded that they wanted to include features such as wind blasting and weather changing while charging Ki, include destructible environments to make battles more immersive and leverage the power of the current-gen consoles for this. However, they found it difficult to replicate the experience for local multiplayer, hence the conditions.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero releases on October 11, 2024. The game will be available via Steam for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Remember to check out the<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> pre-order bonuses and game editions</a>.

                <p>When Microsoft was in the regulatory process of acquiring Activision Blizzard, there were some "dark days," Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer said in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-phil-spencer-ign-live-interview-on-the-health-of-xbox-handhelds-and-more" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. He said Microsoft had to plan for "all contingencies," and that included the deal not getting done.</p><p>"We consider everything. You have to in running the business. But we felt like we were on the side of right, meaning we weren't doing this so we could pull Call of Duty from PlayStation players. It was never in our plan. I mean, I think my whole inbox leaked on the internet, so if anybody wanted to find that that was the plan, you would find it somewhere and it wasn't there," Spencer said.</p><p>Spencer said Microsoft "stayed convicted" throughout the process, despite some obstacles like when the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) initially <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-uk-blocked-the-microsoft-activision-merger-so-what-happens-next/1100-6513589/" data-ref-id="1100-6513589">rejected the deal</a>. This was one of the "dark days" during the process, Spencer reflected.</p><p>He also noted that the protracted buyout process, including all of the uncertainty, was a "drag on the teams."</p><p>"It's my fault as the head of the business, I didn't really internalize that in the beginning of what a drain that would be on the team," Spencer added. "It's really nice to be post the acquisition working with those amazing teams."</p><p>Microsoft paid <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-undermining-activisions-independence-with-latest-layoffs-ftc-says/1100-6520894/" data-ref-id="1100-6520894">$74.5 billion</a> to acquire Activision Blizzard and all of its studios and franchises. Also in the interview, Spencer said making the deal will push Microsoft to do more in a variety of areas.</p><p>"Doing a $70 billion acquisition will push us to try to do more. It'll push us on cloud, it'll push us to go find customers in new places, continue to think about access to amazing games, enabling creators to do great work," he said. "But I actually think for the team, that's just a self-motivation that the team has and it's fun to be a part of."</p><p>Following the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, the company's co-founder, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-leaving-the-company-soon/1100-6520060/" data-ref-id="1100-6520060">Bobby Kotick, left the company</a>. Another major effect of the deal is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-campaign-length-revealed-as-dev-discusses-impact-of-launching-on-game-pass/1100-6524149/" data-ref-id="1100-6524149">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will launch on Xbox Game Pass</a>, marking a major shift for the franchise. </p>

<p data-characters="318" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Over the last few years, I’ve grown increasingly fond of playing demos over watching game trailers. Trailers can be fun (as I found myself squealing over the recent Xbox Showcase announcements), but there’s nothing like playing a small slice of a game and seeing your excitement for a game jump massively. </p> <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false">Steam’s Next Fest events are a great source of demos, but the sheer amount can be daunting to sort through. That’s why I’ve curated a list of game demos that are well worth your time. Here are the 10 of what I consider the best Steam Next Fest demos of June 2024.</p> <h2 id="h-10-must-play-steam-next-fest-demos-in-the-june-2024-event" data-injectable="false">10 must-play Steam Next Fest demos in the June 2024 event</h2> <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="561" data-injectable="true">I’ve listed 10 of my favorite demos from the Fest below, but don’t shy away from trying more if you get the chance. For example, GMTK’s <em>Mind Over Magnet</em> was very close to making this list and is still well worth your time. These merely edged out the competition.</p>
 <h3 id="h-schim" data-injectable="false">Schim</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Playism.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="536" data-current-count="836" data-injectable="true">Shadow-based puzzlers are far from a new thing for the puzzle genre, but something about<em> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1519710/SCHiM/">Schim’s</a> </em>use of narrative combined with its novel take on shadow manipulation works very well for me. You play a small shadow frog hopping from shadow to shadow as you try to traverse the world. This includes people moving about as well, and they won’t wait for you to make a jump before going about their day. It grounds <em>Schim</em> in this semi-realistic setting that offers a lot of promise for the full release. <em>Schim</em> releases on July 18.</p>
 <h3 id="h-akimbot" data-injectable="false">Akimbot</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Evil Raptor.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="455" data-current-count="755" data-injectable="true">When I went into <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843540/Akimbot/">Akimbot</a></em>, I was expecting a little platformer where you shoot some enemies and maybe toy around with a few weapons. What I wasn’t expecting was a well-put-together <em>Ratchet &amp; Clank</em>-style platformer, equipped with pleasing scenery, weighty movement, and humor that quickly grows on you. It’s even got fluid combat that quickly gains depth. <em>Akimbot</em> is worth any platforming fan’s time and launches on Steam on August 29.</p>
 <h3 id="h-what-the-car" data-injectable="false">What The Car</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Triband.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="608" data-current-count="908" data-injectable="true">I have yet to play the developer’s previous game <em>What The Golf</em>, but <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2727650/WHAT_THE_CAR/">What The Car</a></em> makes me want to pick it up ASAP. This little physics-based adventure game sees you run a car around (with actual legs, may I add) to cruise through levels and avoid numerous obstacles. However, each stage puts a unique twist on your car such as more legs or rocket boosters to switch things up. It helps elevate a rather one-note experience into one that constantly adapts to keep things fresh, and I can’t wait to see how that’s moved further along in the full release. <em>What The Car </em>launches on September 9.</p>
 <h3 id="h-the-operator" data-injectable="false">The Operator</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bureau 81.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="586" data-current-count="886" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771980/The_Operator/"><em>The Operator</em> </a>scratches an itch I’ve had since playing games like <em>Orwell</em> and <em>Hacknet</em>. This detective puzzle game sees you scour a government database to help Federal Department of Intelligence agents solve cases. You’ll scan for vehicle details, acquire names &amp; addresses, and even locate discrepancies between witness testimony &amp; real events. Its evidence footage can come across as a bit staged, but it has its heart in the right place and comes with full voice acting along with already challenging puzzles. <em>The Operator</em> is currently planned for a Q3 2024 release.</p>
 <h3 id="block-acfef5f6-bb10-4b60-aaf5-ed688deb4b5c" data-injectable="false">Wizard of Legend 2</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Dead Mage.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="501" data-current-count="801" data-injectable="true">I haven’t jumped into the original <em>Wizard of Legend</em> just yet, but as far as I can tell, <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2193540/Wizard_of_Legend_2/">Wizard of Legend 2</a></em> is already doing great to keep that gameplay style while translating it to a 3D space. It even tosses elements of its contemporaries like Hades into the mix to further its appeal. There isn’t too much in the demo to go off of, but I can already envision plenty of unique builds centering around the random character buffs. <em>Wizard of Legend 2</em> currently has no planned release window.</p>
 <h3 id="h-wild-bastards" data-injectable="false">Wild Bastards</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Blue Manchu.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="628" data-current-count="928" data-injectable="true">Strategy shooters like <em>Ready or Not</em> feel right at home for me in their intensity, realism, and attention to detail. While <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1660840/Wild_Bastards/"><em>Wild Bastards</em></a> is nowhere near as realistic, combining strategy FPS elements and boomer shooters works shockingly well. Throw in a cosmic Wild West theme, unique &amp; compelling characters, and more than enough passives, and you have a roguelike that feels almost created for someone like me. I’ve had the previous entry <em>Void Bastards</em> in my backlog for a while, and I’m thinking I’ll be checking that out sooner rather than later. <em>Wild Bastards</em> shoots its way into launch on September 12.</p>
 <h3 id="h-kill-knight" data-injectable="false">Kill Knight</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via PlaySide.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="595" data-current-count="895" data-injectable="true">From the second I saw <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694420/KILL_KNIGHT/"><em>Kill Knight</em></a><em> </em>at the Triple-i Showcase back in April, I knew I needed to get my hands on it. Having played its demo now, that excitement holds firm. This score-based arena shooter is a bit tough to get the hang of at first, but once you do, you feel like a slaughter symphony, weaving various attacks in between each other to wipe out consistently spawning hordes of foes. With plenty more tools in the full release, and more maps to come, this will easily become a great way to kill time while chatting in Discord calls. <em>Kill Knight</em> releases sometime before the end of 2024.</p>
 <h3 id="h-i-am-your-beast" data-injectable="false">I Am Your Beast</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Strange Scaffold.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="694" data-current-count="994" data-injectable="true">One of Strange Scaffold’s previous games, <em>El Paso Elsewhere</em>, got me lost in its unique and impactful story while leaving much to be desired in its gameplay. Five minutes with <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1876590/I_Am_Your_Beast/">I Am Your Beast</a></em> showed this wouldn’t be the same situation. Each level feels like a sandbox waiting to be mastered, with more than enough weapons, explosives, and elevation to manipulate for a better time. It’s even got <em>Mario</em>-esque Goomba stomping, and who doesn’t want Goomba stomping. With a bombastic soundtrack and solid visuals to boot, I’m excited to see how the team expands on the core ideas with more levels to play with. <em>I Am Your Beast</em> is currently set for an August 15 release.</p>
 <h3 id="block-651c687b-bc21-46aa-b890-9810133f1b6f" data-injectable="false">Tactical Breach Wizards</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Suspicious Developments.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="554" data-current-count="854" data-injectable="true">I went into <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1043810/Tactical_Breach_Wizards/">Tactical Breach Wizards</a></em> expecting an<em> XCOM</em>-style experience featuring tactical wizards armed with magic .357 ammunition. While what I got was a tactics puzzle game of sorts, I’m still impressed by how satisfying <em>TBW</em> can make setting up and executing a plan. Baiting an enemy into a trap or sending someone flying out of a window is great, and the story-driven aspects are rife with intrigue and some solid banter between characters. If you want to cast a few magic bullet barrages yourself, <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> releases on August 22.</p>
 <h3 id="h-dungeons-of-hinterberg" data-injectable="false">Dungeons of Hinterberg</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Microbird Games.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="608" data-current-count="908" data-injectable="false">I wasn’t sold on <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1983260/Dungeons_of_Hinterberg/">Dungeons of Hinterberg</a></em> from its trailers, primarily for the art style not jiving with me too well. However, that opinion has done a complete 180 now that I’ve had some time with it. This dungeon-crawler mixes narrative elements with some interesting locales, satisfying combat encounters, and more than enough puzzles. It’s even got some fluid movement through its hoverboard and rail-grinding traversal. It all oozes this sense of style that makes it hard to put down. <em>Dungeons of Hinterberg</em> releases on July 18, and is coming to Game Pass if you want easier access to it.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/altered-most-funded-tcg-kickstarter-ever-is-coming-to-retail</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/altered-the-most-funded-tcg-kickstarter-ever-is-coming-to-retail.900903/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/altered-most-funded-tcg-kickstarter-ever-is-coming-to-retail<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In January, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/altered-tcg-kickstarter-raises-over-1-million-in-day">Kickstarter campaign</a> for the Altered TCG went live. This new card game became the most <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/altered-tcg-ends-kickstarter-as-most-funded-tcg-ever">successful card game project</a> ever on the platform, raising over $6.7 million. Now the developers have announced an official <em>Altered TCG</em> retail release.</p>
<h2>The Altered TCG Retail announcement</h2>
<p>According to a report by ICV2, Asmodee Group will be handling distribution for the Altered TCG retail release. This TCG features a colorful fantasy world. Players build a deck based around one of the setting's factions, and games are represented not as wizard duels but as fast-paced races across the setting.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/altered-tcg-retail-store-page-screenshot.jpg?itok=DF21zXBe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/altered-tcg-retail-store-page-screenshot.jpg?itok=Uf6Dbh9C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Game mats, markets, and standees will be coming as well.</figcaption></figure><p>The innovation of the <em>Altered TCG</em> comes from its print-on-demand system for cards. If you own a single copy of a card, that card can be linked to an account in a marketplace app. You can freely and legally print additional copies through this app for a small fee. This right can be traded to other players through the app.</p>
<p>Compared to other TCGs like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> and the <em>Pokemon TCG</em>, card games that drive engagement through limited prints of cards like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/logan-paul-sets-most-expensive-pokemon-card-purchase-world-record">Pikachu variants</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-one-ring-card-has-been-found">The One Ring</a>, this is a major departure in business model.</p>
<p>The <em>Altered TCG</em> was designed by Régis Bonnessée (Seasons, Dixit, Fabula), and was developed by French studio Equinox. The distribution of the game through Asmodee Group is part of an exclusive <a href="https://corporate.asmodee.com/news/asmodee-equinox-announce-exclusive-partnership-for-global-distribution-of-innovative-trading-card-game-altered-featuring-gamegenic-as-sole-gaming-accessories-partner/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">global distribution partnership</a> that was announced in November 2023.</p>
<p>The <em>Altered TCG</em> retail release will be broken into two SKUs. The first SKU is booster displays. Each booster display will contain 36 packs. Each pack contains 12 cards. On average, each display will contain 36 hero cards, 288 commons, 100 rares, and 4 or 5 unique cards. These displays will be sold at an MSRP of $143.64.</p>
<p>The second SKU is starter deck displays. These displays will contain six different faction decks. Each deck contains 40 cards, a rule leaflet, 5 adventure cards, 2 reminder cards, a foil card, and some markers. The starter deck display will be sold at an MSRP of $89.94.</p>
<p>The <em>Altered TCG</em> retail release date is September 13. The booster displays, starter deck displays, and several themed accessories can be pre-ordered from Asmodee's store page.</p>

Now, GuliKit is officially bringing its drift-resistant magnetic Hall effect joysticks to a PS5, PS4, Xbox, or Nintendo Switch Pro gamepad near you in the form of upcoming upgrade kits. </p><p>They’ll be available for the Sony DualSense, DualShock 4, Xbox Series gamepad, and Nintendo’s own official Switch Pro controller. But surprisingly, GuliKit is no longer bringing it to Sony’s modular DualSense Edge<em> </em><a href="https://x.com/GuliKitDesign/status/1617344363218243585?lang=en">like it originally promised</a> and won’t offer it for Xbox Elite controllers, either. GuliKit business director Jack He tells me that’s because neither Sony nor Microsoft offer working calibration tools for their flagship gamepads. (Hall effect joysticks do need to be calibrated before first use and periodically afterward.)</p><div><figcaption><em>GuliKit says its stick has less error than the originals.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: GuliKit</cite></p></div><p>Instead of producing a drop-in Hall effect module for the DualSense Edge, He suggests that “players can use this new stick to install on the stick module,” presumably soldering it in themselves if Sony adds a calibration tool to the PS5.</p><p>Speaking of soldering, that might be a required skill for these other gamepads, too. While GuliKit’s Steam Deck and Joy-Con sticks are attached with screws and are easy to remove, Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo all tend to solder their ALPS potentiometer joysticks directly to their gamepad circuit boards, as you can see in <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Nintendo+Switch+Pro+Controller+Joystick+Module+Replacement/127716#:~:text=Turn%20to%20the%20backside%20of%20the%20circuit%20board%20for%20clear%20access%20to%20the%20solder%20joints.">iFixit’s</a> <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Sony+DualSense+Controller+Joystick+Cover+Replacement/142063">many</a> <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Xbox+Series+X+Wireless+Controller+Disassembly/146815">guides</a>.</p><p>GuliKit’s He wouldn’t provide other details, prices, or any release dates at this point but tells me these new sticks are “a very new patented technology which is different from our current hall effect joystick.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/30/24168172/scuf-nomad-iphone-mobile-controller-hall-effect-specs-price">Many</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/9/23546851/nyxi-wizard-nintendo-switch-driftless-gamecube-controller-hall-effect">manufacturers</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23841614/hyperkin-competition-xbox-controller-hall-effect-drift-free-sticks-playstation-announcement-specs">have </a><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/10/23911052/gamesir-t4-cyclone-pro-wireless-controller-hall-effect-joysticks">begun to adopt</a> drift-resistant joysticks in their premium controllers and handhelds, many if not all of which are supplied by GuliKit, though others (including Valve) say they believe their existing ALPS sticks are good enough. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/2/24169709/asus-rog-ally-x-price-release-date-inside-gaming-handheld">With the ROG Ally X, Asus is trying to hedge its bets</a>; it’ll ship with ALPS sticks rated for 5 million rotations, but Asus also worked with GuliKit to offer a Hall effect upgrade kit.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24177805/league-of-legends-ahri-bans-immortalized-legend-skin<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="Sefah1"><em>League of Legends</em>’ latest skin has proven controversial with the community. The Immortalized Legend Ahri skin was designed to commemorate Faker as the first pro player inducted into <a href="https://support-leagueoflegends.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/29658317853587-League-of-Legends-Hall-of-Legends-2024">Riot’s <em>League of Legends</em> esports Hall of Fame,</a> called the <a href="https://halloflegends.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/">Hall of Legends</a>. To mark the occasion, the skin has an optional extra tier that costs about $500 to unlock. While <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24167467/league-of-legends-risen-legend-ahri-bundle-fan-reaction">many fans objected to the price tag online right away</a>, their displeasure has now moved in-game, with Ahri’s ban rate suddenly skyrocketing after her new skin’s release. </p>
<p id="k2XwmZ">The skin arrived in patch 14.12, which hit servers on Wednesday. Since then, Ahri has gone from being banned in about 8% of ranked games to being banned in over 15% of ranked games, according to <a href="https://lolalytics.com/lol/ahri/build/?region=na">Lolalytics</a>. While the uptick in bans is true globally, it’s most pronounced in North America, going from around 10% to over 23%, suggesting that either NA players hate this skin a little bit more than the rest of the world, or the region’s ranked players are more committed to sending a message than ranking up — a theory that the region’s Worlds results certainly back up. </p>
<p id="llRA0C">This type of change in bans is usually reserved for champions who get substantial in-game buffs, or with enormously high win rates, but neither is true for Ahri. In this case, it really seems to be all about the skin — which gives no practical in-game bonuses unless you count opulence and pride as psychological buffs.</p>
<p id="zM9gFh">With no meaningful buffs, this admittedly funny banning trend is likely to correct itself in the near future, which means that soon enough <em>League</em>’s biggest spenders will get to show off their shiny new skin. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/latest-on-fables-release-date/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/latest-on-fables-release-date/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Despite being shown at the Xbox Game Showcase last weekend, it doesn’t appear that the release date for Fable is all that close. </p>



<p>Despite the game’s release window <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fable-gets-new-trailer-and-release-window-at-xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being confirmed for 2025</a>, it’s not going to be in the early part of the year. According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/13/24177703/microsoft-xbox-game-showcase-windows-recall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tom Warren of The Verge</a>, Microsoft is aiming for a release date between October and December 2025 for Fable. That would put it during the Holiday shopping season for next year.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has yet to independently verify this information regarding the Fable release. However, Tom is one of the more reliable reporters with accurate information.</p>



<p>Fable is a reboot of the classic franchise that made its debut on the original Xbox in 2004. The game features a brand new story with new characters to meet.</p>



<p>“What does it mean to be a Hero? Well, in the fairytale land of Albion, that is entirely up to you,” the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/fable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">game’s description reads</a>. “With a dark threat looming, and in a world where your reputation precedes you, your choices will change Albion forever.”</p>



<p>When it releases, Fable will be available on Xbox Series X|S and PC. It will also be available day one on Game Pass.</p>

They’re split up by tier, with a new one being released roughly every six days. Note that Tier 3 is glitched and appeared early, which is how I’ve included the challenges here. </p>

These can be found in Twisted Masquerade Trials by completing objectives such as repairing generators. <ul> <li data-index="2"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 5 Rift Fragments, 15,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Community: Be There or Be Square</strong>: As a community, collect 2 million Invitations. You must contribute 2 Invitations to the challenge to complete it, so hop into Trials and start completing objectives to earn them. <ul> <li data-index="3"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 8 Rift Fragments, 25,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Community: Show ’em What You Got</strong>: As a community, activate any of the Invitation’s abilities 3 million times. Once you collect an Invitation, use its ability by summoning a party pallet or blocking a window, or use one of the other abilities to contribute to this challenge. You must add 3 contributions to complete the challenge on your end. <ul> <li data-index="4"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 8 Rift Fragments, 25,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Show ’em What You Got</strong>: Activate any of the Invitation’s abilities 4 times across multiple Trials. Take your time with this one and activate the Invitation as and when you can in the role you’re playing. <ul> <li data-index="5"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 5 Rift Fragments, 15,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Bronze Age</strong>: Earn 6 emblems of bronze quality or better. You get these for playing to the strength of your role, so complete objectives like hooking Survivors and repairing generators, and you’ll earn them without any trouble. <ul> <li data-index="6"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 5 Rift Fragments, 15,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Clean up After Yourself</strong>: Use the Invitation’s power to hook a Survivor remotely 2 times in multiple Trials. This is a fantastic power only the Killer can use. When you’re carrying a Survivor, use the Invitation, and you’ll teleport them to the nearest hook. <ul> <li data-index="7"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 5 Rift Fragments, 15,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Be Very Quiet</strong>: Suppress your footfalls, grunts of pain, and/or pools of blood by using the Invitation’s power 2 times in multiple Trials. This ability is hard to catch. When you’ve got an Invitation, you press the right joystick to activate it, and it’ll silence your Survivor for a short time. Do this twice to blast through this challenge. <ul> <li data-index="8"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 5 Rift Fragments, 15,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Community: Death of the Party</strong>: As a community, experience 5 million effects from the Bag of Tryks. This is incredibly easy, and you only need to contribute 5 experiences. The Bag of Tryks will activate and apply an effect for every two objectives completed, so just play, and you’ll get this done very quickly. <ul> <li data-index="9"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 8 Rift Fragments, 25,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Bloody Rewards</strong>: Earn 50,000 Bloodpoints. <ul> <li data-index="10"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 5 Rift Fragments, 15,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Death of the Party</strong>: Experience 5 effects from the Bag of Tryks.

Encore!</strong>: Activate any of the Invitation’s abilities 3 times in a single Trial. This is a tricky challenge. Pick up the Invitation when you see it and activate its abilities every chance you get. The Invitation recharges over time, so hold onto it, and you’ll be able to use it three times in a single Trial, provided you don’t let things end too early. <ul> <li data-index="12"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 8 Rift Fragments, 25,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>

When you have this challenge available, you’ll have to earn at least 2 gold medals for it, so pick the Killer or survivor role and play until you’ve done it. <ul> <li data-index="1"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 8 Rift Fragments, 50,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Golden Age</strong>: Earn 6 emblems of gold quality or better.

You can activate Invitation abilities by jumping through windows or similar actions and using your Invitation’s power as you do so. Note that you must pick one up in the Trial before you can use it. <ul> <li data-index="4"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 5 Rift Fragments, 35,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Community: Predator or Prey</strong>: As a community, earn a total of 250,000 Evader or Chaser emblems of gold quality or better as a Killer or Survivor. You’ll need to contribute at least 2 medals to the challenge, so pick a role you want to do it with and play until you’re done. <ul> <li data-index="5"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 8 Rift Fragments, 50,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Light of the Party</strong>: Finish repairing 3 Anniversary generators as a survivor in Twisted Masquerade Trials. <ul> <li data-index="6"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 5 Rift Fragments, 35,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Putting up the Decorations</strong>: Hook 6 Survivors on Anniversary hooks in Twisted Masquerade Trials as a Killer. <ul> <li data-index="7"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 5 Rift Fragments, 35,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Encore! Encore!</strong>: Activate any of the Invitation’s abilities 3 times in a single Twisted Masquerade Trial. This is a tough one to pull off. It’s easier to do as a Survivor because more of you are working on spawning Invitations, which will give you more charges for its abilities. <ul> <li data-index="8"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 8 Rift Fragments, 50,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Community: Callousness or Compassion</strong>: As a community, earn a total of 200,000 Benevolent or Malicious emblems of gold quality or better as Survivors or Killers in Trials.

You’ve got to play to your role and spawn an Invitation first, then collect it, then you can use its ability. Note that you can complete this challenge across multiple Trials, so there is no need to sweat about doing it all in one. <ul> <li data-index="10"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 5 Rift Fragments, 35,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Smash their Face In!</strong>: Activate the Invitation to spawn a party pallet 3 times. This can only be done as a Survivor, so hop into Trials in this role, collector Invitations, and get spawning those party pallets. <ul> <li data-index="11"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 5 Rift Fragments, 35,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Community: Suffer or Slaughter</strong>: As a community, earn a total of 150,000 Unbroken or Devout emblems of gold quality or better as a Survivor or Killer. You know the drill by now. These are awarded for playing your role, so pick one, play to that role’s needs, and get the 2 emblems you need to contribute for the grand prize. <ul> <li data-index="12"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 8 Rift Fragments, 50,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Death of the Party</strong>: Experience 5 effects from the Bag of Tryks. This is slightly more challenging to pull off. The Bag of Tryks applies status effects for every objective. If you complete two party events, such as repairing a generator or hooking a Survivor, you’ll trigger a new one. Otherwise, just play 5 Trials, and this challenge will be over. <ul> <li data-index="13"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 5 Rift Fragments, 35,000 Bloodpoints, and 50 Gilded Trinkets.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-division-2%E2%80%99s-new-season-comes-with-a-genius-triple-plot-twist.900867/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24177264/the-division-2-first-rogue-year-6-aaron-keener-plot-twists<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="UUFfqg">The Division franchise is best known for being a post-apocalyptic looter shooter, set in an alternate timeline where society collapsed due to a large-scale biological attack. Since <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/6/23/8827287/the-division-hands-on-e3-xbox-one-ps4-preview"><em>The Division</em></a>’s launch in 2016, Ubisoft’s developers have been telling a long-running story around a mysterious rogue agent. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/3/22/18277513/the-division-2-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc"><em>The Division 2</em></a>’s most recent update includes a twist that is so implausible and goofy that it wraps all the way back around to being a work of genius.</p>
<p id="oN7RqY">In these games, the Strategic Homeland Division is a government agency that is embedded in society until times of great catastrophe, in which case its members are activated as super-cops aided by ISAC, a state-of-the-art AI. In the first game, the player meets with local Division leader Faye Lau, the two of them nearly get murdered, and then the player is authorized to start shooting and subsequently looting their way through New York City. </p>
<p id="ZBcwux">In between boss fights and collectible hunting, the player is introduced to the narrative thread that the Division is actually a bad idea for a crisis response team. A bunch of them have gone rogue, and the worst of them all is a real bad egg called Aaron Keener. Keener remains a background presence in the game’s lore for a while, only emerging to tell us about the recent bioterrorism he planned or all the good schemes he was enjoying.</p>
<p id="d2mEin">The mystery mounted over years. I played through <em>The Division 2</em>’s campaign looking out for any sign of him among my new Division colleagues. One character, Agent Kelso, really seemed like she was going to betray me. She even disappeared for a long time during a crucial mission and reemerged with suspicious timing. But none of my suspicions immediately paid off, and the Black Tusk paramilitary group became the primary threat.</p>
<p id="L196Ry">It wasn’t until the 2020 expansion <em>Warlords of New York</em> that players were finally able to confront Keener. The expansion was full of twists and turns, like Faye Lau murdering the president and framing the Division for the crime in a shocking double-cross. But players finally got to fight Keener as a boss, so that’s over with, right? </p>
<p id="Epq0Az">It’s <em>not </em>over with. You’ve fallen right into Aaron Keener’s trap, you gullible rube. He’s alive and kicking ass.</p>
<div id="oJ3ods"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Z11NerWEkI?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="9xW2oY">Ubisoft helpfully explained the new status quo in a <a href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ubisoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fgame%2Fthe-division%2Fthe-division-2%2Fnews-updates%2F9XK0DbaxzntoNxXqC5ftY%2Fyear-6-season-1-first-rogue&amp;sharedid=polygon.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?subId2=[]pl[p]23941305[m]m-placeholder[s]s-placeholder[t]w[c]c-placeholder[r]r-placeholder[d]d-placeholder\u0026u=https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-division/the-division-2/news-updates/9XK0DbaxzntoNxXqC5ftY/year-6-season-1-first-rogue\u0026sharedid=polygon.com&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:2,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;subId2&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;subId2&quot;:&quot;[]pl[p]23941305[m]m-placeholder[s]s-placeholder[t]w[c]c-placeholder[r]r-placeholder[d]d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;u&quot;:&quot;https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-division/the-division-2/news-updates/9XK0DbaxzntoNxXqC5ftY/year-6-season-1-first-rogue&quot;,&quot;sharedid&quot;:&quot;polygon.com&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">blog post</a>, which reads in part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="sKuGmF">Year 5 Season 3 ended with a shocking revelation, Rogue agent number one and sworn nemesis of The Division, Aaron Keener is alive. In her hunt for truth, Agent Kelso located him and decided to join forces with him.</p>
<p id="9uZ88E">The line between light and dark, agent and rogue, keeps blurring as we learned that Keener was working with Faye Lau to undermine the Black Tusk and neutralize the Hunter threat during the events of Warlords of New York.</p>
<p id="QVebo5">Keener is coming to Washington, D.C. and he has sent us an invitation to parley, but first we will need to pass his twisted trials and prove our worth. An alliance with Keener and his Rogues could be the key to stopping Natalya Sokolova and the Black Tusk. But what will the cost be? </p>
<p id="nEZzhq">Can Keener be trusted? Is the enemy of our enemy truly our friend?</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="9xiqW4">As someone who had kept abreast of <em>The Division 2</em>’s developing story, my reaction to reading this missive and learning this information was “I’m sorry, what?” There’s a lot of double-crosses to sort through, especially since the line between light and dark keeps blurring!</p>
<p id="53Wgrh">I hear you asking: “Wait, if Keener’s a boss in the game who players murder, didn’t players see him die?” You fool. You absolute buffoon. Keener hacked ISAC so it just <em>looked</em> like he was dead. But he’s alive, and now he wants to tell you his <em>real</em> agenda, as long as you can survive his Joker traps...</p>
<p id="QlYpYk">Sir, I have been trying to find you and have a conversation for many years straight, so I’m starting to think you’re just a messy bitch who loves the drama. On the other hand, the audacity of this creative choice wins me over. Of <em>course</em> Keener is a super-genius who faked his own death by hacking your brain. Otherwise, he’d just be a guy in a hoodie recording brooding monologues for colleagues to find, and that’s not very fun.</p>
<p id="NGf8er"><em>The Division 2</em>’s next update includes other content and tweaks, as well as allowing players to access the endgame without purchasing <em>Warlords of New York</em>. Many fans seem surprised to see that <em>The Division 2</em> is still receiving updates, but Ubisoft has been supporting the game — as well as many of its other titles — with years of post-launch support. When that strategy leads to story beats this brilliant, I definitely support it. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24177882/ps5-playstation5-discord-integration-how-to<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="BtggDd"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/ps5/21720698/best-ps5-games-playstation-5">PlayStation 5-havers rejoice</a> — Sony PlayStation announced Thursday that the PS5 will be getting Discord integration. <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/13/ps5-players-will-soon-be-able-to-join-discord-voice-chat-directly-from-their-console/">According to the PlayStation blog</a>, the new feature will roll out to users in the “coming weeks.” At long last, you’ll be able to play <em>Fortnite </em>and other multiplatform games with your dear PS5 friends without fudging around within different in-game chats. </p>
<p id="tDmiXe">Sony PlayStation, which owns a minority stake in Discord, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23582646/ps5-beta-system-update-discord-voice-chat-1440p-vrr">promised integration</a> with the chatting service <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22417630/playstation-discord-app-integration-release-dates-sony-investment">as far back as 2021</a>. It’s not that there <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22911255/discord-playstation-integration-how-to-link">was no way to use Discord as a PlayStation 5 user</a>, but prior use required other external apps and workarounds to use it. Now PlayStation users will be able to log on to chats directly from the console, “without relying on the Discord PC or mobile apps,” the blog said. The feature will launch over the next few weeks, “starting with players in Japan/Asia, followed by Europe, Australia/New Zealand, and the Middle East, and finally the Americas.”</p>
<h2 id="a4ARC2"><strong>How to use Discord voice chat on the PS5</strong></h2>
<p id="JrakCq">Before you begin, make sure you have your console updated to the latest system software update and that your PlayStation Network and Discord are linked. (If you need instructions for <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5/system-software/">how to update your console</a> or link your account, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/subscriptions/link-psn-status-discord/">you can find more details here</a>.)  However once you ahve that set up, it’s pretty easy to join. All you need to do is select the Discord tab in the Game Base in the PS5 Control Center and then chose the Discord server or DM group you want to join. After that, pick your voice channel, and that’s it. And if someone calls you, you’ll get a PS5 notification right away. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/06/13/life-is-strange-double-exposure-video-shares-extended-gameplay-and-reveals-how-it<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Square Enix held a special livestream today for <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-showcase/2024/06/09/life-is-strange-double-exposure-revealed">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>, which was revealed during last week's Xbox Games Showcase. The 48-minute presentation sits down with the game’s developers and performers to shed new light on Max Caulfield’s return to the franchise and her new powers while showing off extended gameplay.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The story seemingly unfolds a few years after the events of Life is Strange. Max has moved far away from Arcadia Bay for a fresh start and now works as an artist-in-residence at&nbsp;Caledon University in upstate Vermont. She has sworn to never use her time-rewind ability again, and hasn't since the first game's conclusion. Despite this, Max’s power has evolved. She can now travel between two timelines, an ability called Shift. Unfortunately, she only discovers this power after stumbling upon the sudden murder of her new friend, Safi.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h5oyn4xIYRY" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Deck Nine, who developed <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/life_is_strange_before_the_storm/b/playstation4/archive/2018/03/07/life-is-strange-before-the-storm-complete-review.aspx">Life is Strange: Before the Storm</a> and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/life-is-strange-true-colors/life-is-strange-true-colors-review-more-powerful-in-life-lessons">True Colors</a>, describes the game as a supernatural murder mystery. Max will travel across two realities: her present one and an alternate timeline where Safi is still alive but very much in danger. In the reality where Safi is killed, Max must find the culprit. In the timeline where Safi lives, she must prevent her murder. Solving and preventing the same crime involves searching for clues across both timelines and interacting with two versions of every character, whose behavior and relationship to Max changes based on the timelines, circumstances, and your choices. Like True Colors, Double Exposure is a single release divided into episodes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, the million-dollar question for fans is how Double Exposure addresses Life Is Strange’s two endings. Deck Nine states the game includes a conversation between Max and Safi about Arcadia Bay, which will allow players to pick the ending they chose. This essentially determines Double Exposure’s canon, and your choice of ending will be reflected in Max’s thoughts, journals, text messages, and conversations with characters going forward. An example we see is a conversation where Safi asks Max who “the blue-haired girl” is to her, presenting a choice to establish Chloe’s relationship to Max.&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>In terms of gameplay, Max has lost her original time-rewind power. Instead, she can instantaneously swap timelines in certain spots to explore two versions of the same space. She’ll use this power to solve puzzles and circumnavigate inaccessible spaces (for example, a locked door in one timeline may be unlocked—or Max learns how to unlock it—in the other one). She can also use a “pulse” ability to extend her supernatural senses to determine weak points between the timelines, allowing her to see and hear ghostly glimpses of people and objects in the alternate reality without Shifting to it. Using this, she can eavesdrop on characters in the other timeline for intel and stealthily track suspects.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, beyond the murder mystery, Max will have to deal with the social drama of working on a college campus. As its artist-in-residence, she serves as a mentor figure to younger students, which she may or may not use to her advantage. An extended gameplay video shows Max hanging out with Safi and her best friend Moses to watch a meteor shower. In addition to showing off some of the choices that can steer this scene in different directions, we also see Max’s camera come into play, where she can capture photos of her friends. We also see the events leading up to Safi's murder.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure looks promising, and as a fan of the original, I'm looking forward to hanging with Max again and solving a new mystery. It launches on October 29 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>

<div>
  <p id="32Eto1">Although fans of <em>The Boys </em>will often refer to Butcher (Karl Urban) as the main character, it was Hughie (Jack Quaid) and Annie (Erin Moriarty) who served as the early seasons’ real co-protagonists. They were the ones who changed the most, who had their worldviews shattered in the pilot episode and had to rebuild themselves from scratch. Butcher’s stayed the same cranky, morally dubious bastard, but Hughie and Annie are unrecognizable from where they began.</p>
<p id="Takniu">And though Hughie had more screen time between the two, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2019/9/17/20870279/the-boys-comics-history-amazon-starlight">season 1 Annie</a> was the more compelling main character. Whereas Hughie had the comfort of at least being surrounded by people who shared his hatred of supes like A-Train, Annie was thrown right into the viper’s nest. She was forced to smile and make things work on a team filled with rapists and murderers, in a position where escape wasn’t a real option and coming forward publicly seemed pointless. Annie’s gradual self-actualization was more complicated than Hughie’s, but that only made it more interesting. Annie is always being pulled between multiple evolving teams with conflicting, dubious motives, but in season 1 the show was pulling off this delicate balancing act. Now, in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24173211/rewatch-the-boys-season-3-4-what-know-gen-v">season 4</a>, almost all sense of consistency or direction with Annie has fallen apart. </p>
<p id="X01vmX">Annie was well loved in season 1 among the <em>Boys</em> fandom, breaking the usual sexist internet trend that the most prominent female character in a franchise is the most loudly hated. As early as season 2, however, the fan sentiment started to sour, largely thanks to one giant misstep in “Nothing Like It in the World.” That’s the mid-season 2 episode where Annie kills an innocent civilian, a guy who was defending himself from what he assumed were violent carjackers. (An assumption that was basically correct.)</p>
<div id="du1kr0"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d8eJiUQRnJw?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="RBZeEl">The story uses this as part of a bonding subplot between Annie and Butcher, two characters who’d struggled to trust each other up to this point. “You know what I was thinking when I was looking at him?” she tells Butcher afterward. “<em>Why’d you pull a gun, you stupid fuck?</em> That’s all. Maybe once I would’ve cried over him, but... now he was just another person in our way.” This hardened, cynical way of thinking is presented as the turning point in her and Butcher’s relationship, the moment when they’ve fully got each other’s backs. </p>
<p id="23Idj4">The monologue is often unfairly interpreted by fans as Annie bragging, or mocking the guy for defending himself. But even among fans who understand this as Annie expressing regret and self-hatred, kicking herself for how callous she’s become, it still doesn’t work. Her murder of that civilian was way more uncalled for than the episode seemed to realize, something that should’ve lingered on Annie’s mind far longer than it does. The show really didn’t seem to understand the parallels to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/9/16/21440032/the-boys-stormfront-american-nazis-white-supremacy-fascism-themes-politics-supervillains-comics">the villain Stormfront</a>’s murder of an innocent driver earlier in the season; it drew that connection between the two characters, seemingly by accident, and then did nothing with it. </p>
<p id="ZQcnxg">This incident has always stuck in the minds of fans who’ve grown irritated with Annie’s role as the virtuous voice of reason, an approach that stirred up even more controversy <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23150171/the-boys-season-3-review-amazon">in season 3</a>. First there was the messy season-long conflict between Annie and Hughie over whether or not Hughie should be using the Temp V. It was an interesting argument between the two; Annie was reasonably concerned about Hughie’s attitude shift and the potential consequences of the drug, while also not quite empathizing enough with just how scary life is for Hughie as a non-supe in this violent world. The problem is that it’s a storyline that doesn’t give Annie an arc. Hughie’s the one who changes, who learns a lesson and grows from it in the end, whereas Annie is presented as correct from start to finish. The end of the season shuts down any moral complexity on the topic when it reveals that Temp V will 100% give Hughie terminal cancer if he takes it again. After that, anything interesting the storyline might’ve told us about Annie’s value system is tossed to the side.</p>
<p id="AUTGrj">Season 3 in general felt uninterested in diving into the hows and whys of Annie’s choices. Beyond Hughie, her decision to focus on taking down Soldier Boy, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23200207/the-boys-finale-homelander-black-adam-superman">not Homelander</a>, also lacked a clear, sympathetic explanation. Annie had three seasons’ worth of personal reasons to want Homelander dead, not to mention the ever-increasing likelihood that he’d snap completely and burn down the whole world. When she instead turned all her focus on opposing the one guy who could take Homelander down, the show’s explanation for it didn’t feel organic. Rather, it felt motivated by the show’s need to keep Homelander alive as long as possible, not by any natural continuation of her character growth from the first two seasons.</p>

<p id="bjr4Gb">There’s a similar sense of aimlessness with Annie throughout the first three episodes of season 4, with her already backtracking on her season 3 decision to give up the Starlight persona once and for all. Her feud with Homelander, which seemed to be her main priority for the first episode, at least, has also given way to refocusing on a new secondary villain. This time it’s Firecracker (Valorie Curry), a new member of The Seven who reveals that her main motivation is to get back at Annie for a mean, slut-shaming prank she did to her in their early teenage years. “Everybody thinks you’re so decent,” Firecracker tells Annie. “Know what I see? A conniving little mean-girl bitch in there. And when I’m done, the rest of the world is going to see it too.” </p>
<p id="aTfGMP">It’s a weird revelation, almost like the writers are engaging with the section of the fandom that resents Annie’s angelic-voice-of-reason status, essentially throwing the haters a bone in response to their increasingly loud complaints about the character. Although the show will almost certainly side with Annie in this feud — basing your whole adult life around a mean-girl incident when you were 13 is deeply unhealthy on Firecracker’s part, and the show is aware of this — the whole dynamic feels oddly trivial. Annie spent the first two and a half seasons having to hold her own against Homelander, and now she’s been thrown into a mean-girl feud with the least powerful new member of The Seven. If you were hoping season 4 would give Annie a sense of direction again, this is not a good sign.</p>
<p id="4RP0yP">It helps that Annie is so clearly better than her comic counterpart, an empty two-dimensional love interest that writer Garth Ennis barely seemed to care about. It’s hard to get too mad at the show’s depiction of Annie when we already know just how sloppily the character could’ve been portrayed. And season 4 is taking steps to deepen her relationship with her powers, establishing that Annie’s legitimately getting stronger, so hopefully during the next big fight scene she won’t be such an afterthought (the way it was with Soldier Boy in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBoys/comments/vwm066/starlight_vs_soldier_boy_expectation_vs_reality/">a widely mocked moment</a> in the season 3 finale). </p>
<p id="4CiVcC">But it’s also hard not to be frustrated when we know how well she could be written. Annie’s arc across the past two seasons so far has seemed scattershot, and unappreciative of just how fun Annie is when she’s actively shaping the plot with her decisions, rather than just the plot shaping her. Season 1 Annie was a vital character, someone whose scenes were filled with constant tension and intrigue. It’s hard to picture how <em>The Boys</em> will return to this, but here’s hoping they give Annie something meaningful to do again sometime soon. </p>
<p id="M2Mx8Z"><small>The first three episodes of </small><small><em>The Boys</em></small><small> season 4 are now streaming on Prime Video. New episodes are released every Thursday.</small></p>

                <p dir="ltr">There are a few interesting guns to be claimed from the Pale Heart of the Traveler in Destiny 2's new expansion, The Final Shape, but The Call is the standout. This little sidearm fires rockets--it's only the second rocket-assisted sidearm to come to Destiny 2, with the first being Indebted Kindness, a gun you could only get from the Warlord's Ruin dungeon. The Calling is easier to get and comes with a mess of good perks, but most importantly, it hits like a truck; once you get a good one of these, it's likely to stay in your loadout for a good, long time.</p><p dir="ltr">The Call sports a lot of options for perks, and quite a few of the combinations are pretty good. There are at least a couple versions of this gun you might want to chase depending on your loadout. What's more, it's also craftable, so you can slap enhanced versions of your favorite perks on the gun for even more devastation. Honestly, there might be a couple "god rolls" for The Call. Here's how you can nab The Call and the perks you're going to want to chase for it.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_To_Get_The_Call">How To Get The Call</a></li><li><a href="#The_Call_God_Rolls">The Call God Rolls</a><ul><li><a href="#The_Call_PvE_God_Roll">The Call PvE God Roll</a></li><li><a href="#The_Call_PvP_God_Roll">The Call PvP God Roll</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_To_Get_The_Call">How To Get The Call</h2><p dir="ltr">The Call will likely come into your inventory naturally through the course of The Final Shape's story campaign. It's one of the weapons that comes from Pale Heart engrams, which you'll get for completing Pale Heart activities and for ranking up your reputation with Ghost as you work through the new destination. There are also some activities, like Alone in the Dark missions in the Pale Heart, that will specifically dish out Deepsight Resonance (red border) versions of Pale Heart guns, so you can unlock the crafting pattern for the weapon.</p><p dir="ltr">So generally, focusing your Pale Heart engrams is the best way to reliably pull new versions of The Call. You can unlock focusing once you've gathered five different Pale Heart weapons, which you can do pretty easily by completing the campaign and doing some Alone in the Dark quest steps. As you rank up with Ghost, you'll also unlock a perk that makes your first focused weapon of the week a guaranteed Deepsight Resonance version, helping you get to the crafted version of The Call faster.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318813-20240613103241_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318813" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318813-20240613103241_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4318813"></a><figcaption>The Call</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4318813-20240613103241_1.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_Call_God_Rolls">The Call God Rolls</h2><p dir="ltr">While The Call isn't much of a PvP weapon because of its slow firing rate and slow projectile speed, it's an absolute monster in PvE activities. It has excellent stopping power, often one- or two-shotting enemies even in raids and at higher difficulties. It also sports a range of perks that offer a ton of build synergy and boost its damage to make it more effective. One of the specific, interesting perks it carries is Beacon Rounds, which gives the gun tracking as you log kills with it and increases that tracking's effectiveness with more final blows. Tracking is actually really handy on this thing, because it allows you to fire into crowds or in the direction of distant enemies without really having to think or aim. Firing The Call from the hip to indiscriminately annihilate whatever's vaguely in front of you can be extremely handy.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="The_Call_PvE_God_Roll">The Call PvE God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Quick Launch / Volatile Launch  <ul><li dir="ltr">Quick Launch: +10 Velocity, +15 Handling</li><li dir="ltr">Volatile Launch: +15 Blast Radius, -5 Velocity, -5 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Tactical Mag  <ul><li dir="ltr">+3 Magazine size, +5 Stability, +10 Reload speed</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Demolitionist / Subsistence  <ul><li dir="ltr">Demolitionist: Kills from this weapon generate grenade energy. Activating your grenade ability reloads this weapon from reserves.</li><li dir="ltr">Subsistence: Defeating targets partially reloads this weapon from reserves.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Desperate Measures / One For All  <ul><li dir="ltr">Desperate Measures: Weapon final blows grant bonus damage. Melee and grenade final blows grant a large damage bonus that can stack.</li><li dir="ltr">One For All: Hitting three separate targets increases damage for a moderate duration.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Velocity / Blast Radius</li></ul><p dir="ltr">It's tough to go wrong with just about any roll of The Call, but there are quite a few great options that, when paired together with the right build, push it over the edge. The first question you want to ask yourself is whether you want to prioritize direct hits over potential splash damage. The Call does fire rockets, but at base, their explosions aren't very big; you can spec the gun to have a larger Blast Radius to mess up more enemies in groups, and that can be great if you go for perks like One For All. But if you expect to use it more like a long-range shotgun, Velocity is probably more useful to make sure the projectiles get to their targets before those targets have a chance to move out of the way. After that, go for putting as many rounds in the magazine as you can with Tactical Mag.</p><p dir="ltr">Perks will depend on how you want to use The Call, but if you've got no other more specific plans, go with either Demolitionist or Subsistence. Demolitionist will give you synergy on restoring your grenade as quickly as possible, because you're very likely to use The Call to put down lots of enemies in quick succession because it's so damn useful. If you don't need the grenade energy or would rather increase your uptime with The Call without reloading it, Subsistence keeps giving you rockets back for each kill--and because so many kills will be one or two shots, you'll just keep firing.</p><p dir="ltr">One other good alternative in this column: Lead from Gold. An issue you might have with The Call is that it's <em>too</em> effective, running you out of Special ammo in a hurry. Lead from Gold can help keep your reserves up if you find you're scrounging a lot of the time. Oh, and finally, Beacon Rounds is probably not a go-to, but can make for a fun version of this gun, with the tracking making it so you barely have to think about what you're shooting at and helping you take out pesky enemies at long ranges.</p><p dir="ltr">The second Perk column is full of damage-boosting options and they're basically all good, so you can pick here based on what's best for your build. Desperate Measures and One For All are the main choices because they're both easy to activate, specifically with the way you'll be using The Call. One For All gives a slightly better damage boost if you can kill three enemies within three or so seconds of one another, which is the primary use case for this gun, but Desperate Measures stacks with your melee and grenade ability and lasts longer. If you're running something like a Prismatic Hunter build with Combination Blow and Liar's Handshake, Desperate Measures is excellent, getting a big damage boost every time you start punching your way through enemies.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="The_Call_PvP_God_Roll">The Call PvP God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Quick Launch  <ul><li dir="ltr">Quick Launch: +10 Velocity, +15 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: High Velocity Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Reload speed, +10 Velocity</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Beacon Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">Final blows grant this weapon tracking. Dealing further damage extends the duration</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Vorpal Weapon  <ul><li dir="ltr">Increased damage against bosses, vehicles, and Guardians with their Super active.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Velocity</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Where The Call has lots of perks that give good synergy in PvE, where you're racking up kills against smaller at a constant clip, most of its perks offer very little in PvP, where kills can be harder to come by. Here, you want to focus on Velocity over Blast Radius because the utility of The Call will be in dealing big direct-hit damage to opposing players, and you want those projectiles to get to their targets as quickly as possible.</p><p dir="ltr">There aren't many great perk options here that you're getting to get a lot of use out of. Beacon Rounds is probably your best bet, adding tracking to your rockets after you notch a kill, which will help you earn a second kill if you're in a fight with more than one Guardian and can live that long. The second column has very little in the way of reliable PvP damage boosters, though. Vorpal Weapon is a decent pick specifically because you don't have to do anything in particular to activate it. If you're scoring a lot of kills, you can opt for one of the other boosters like Desperate Measures, but most don't become effective until <em>after</em> you've already won the fight you're in, making them all pretty equal in being unappealing.</p><p dir="ltr">We've got lots more coverage from Destiny 2's new expansion, so check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">Final Shape guides hub</a> and our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/1900-6418239/" data-ref-id="1900-6418239">Final Shape review</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/parasol-stars-the-story-of-bubble-bobble-3-floats-down-to-consoles-on-july-11/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=parasol-stars-the-story-of-bubble-bobble-3-floats-down-to-consoles-on-july-11<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="283" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It was almost a year ago that we <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/parasol-stars-the-story-of-bubble-bobble-3-is-being-ported-to-modern-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> of modern console port plans for <em>Parasol Stars: The Story of Bubble Bobble 3</em>. Now ININ has come through with a date, opening the umbrella for a smooth glide to PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox consoles on July 11, 2024.</p> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">With that lovely news comes an appropriately bubbly release date trailer, showing some footage of the port and promising “many quality-of-life enhancements.” Please, enjoy another pre-release peek at Bub and Bob in their stout little human forms and prep for the arrival of the <em>Rainbow Islands </em>sequel below.</p> <figure data-current-count="619" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Parasol Stars - The Story of Bubble Bobble III Release Date Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sdflq9NwxCg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="true">As for what those enhancements are, the updated port has added in the usual retro bells and whistles, namely the inclusion of save states and the ability to rewind gameplay. There are also shaders and filters that aim to recreate the experience of playing on a CRT screen. Beyond that, the hook here is very much the ability to play and own a relatively obscure entry in Taito’s storied series.</p>
 <p data-characters="477" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="false">There’s no mention of including the other versions — which spanned Atari ST, Amiga, Game Boy, and NES — so it looks like we’re just getting the PC Engine/Turbografx-16 version of <em>Parasol Stars</em>. That’s fine and dandy, especially considering the fact that it’s priced at a cool $9.99. Nintendo Switch pre-orders are <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/parasol-stars-the-story-of-bubble-bobble-iii-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live now</a> and 10 percent off until July 12, with Xbox pre-orders to follow on June 19. The game can also be <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10008544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wishlisted</a> on PlayStation.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>One of the rarest skins in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504256">Overwatch 2</a> is making its return and all of its sales are going to charity. The Pink Mercy skin has returned to Overwatch 2 for the first time since 2018, along with a new Rose Gold variant and the money from its sales are being donated to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF.)</p><p dir="ltr">Announced in a <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24104271/" rel="nofollow ">blog post</a>, the Pink Mercy skin will be available for purchase from June 25 to July 8, costing $15, the same price it was back in 2018. All of the money, excluding taxes and platform fees, will be donated to the BCRF. During that same period a second charity bundle will be available, the Rose Gold Mercy Bundle. This bundle costs $20 and features the Rose Gold Mercy skin and weapon skin, along with three player icons, sprays, and banners. All proceeds from that bundle will also be donated to charity. It's important to note that since the proceeds are going to charity, these bundles can't be bought with Overwatch Coins and must be bought as a direct purchase.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4318825-rosegoldmercylarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4318825" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4318825-rosegoldmercylarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4318825"></a><figcaption>The new Rose Gold Mercy skin will also be available, with all of the proceeds going to charity as well.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4318825-rosegoldmercylarge.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Pink Mercy skin quickly became one of the rarest and most sought-after skins in Overwatch, thanks to its limited availability. It was only on sale for a short period of time and at the time it was one of the few skins that was being sold for direct purchase instead of being included in loot boxes. It also hasn't been available since 2018, so anyone who started playing Overwatch since that time hasn't even had a chance to get it.</p><p dir="ltr">According to Blizzard, the last time the Pink Mercy skin was sold it raised $12.7 million for the BRCF and it still holds the record for the largest single donation. Overwatch 2 Season 11, Super Mega Ultrawatch, launches on June 20, just a few days before the Pink Mercy skin returns to the store.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/codename-ocean-keeper-is-vampire-survivors-with-an-underwater-mecha-twist/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=codename-ocean-keeper-is-vampire-survivors-with-an-underwater-mecha-twist<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="313" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Amidst the flurry of Steam Next Fest demos, <em>Codename: Ocean Keepe</em>r from RetroStyle Games emerges as a standout, blending underwater mecha action with the survival challenges of <em>Vampire Survivors</em>. Quite the exciting twist, and one that brings with it an interesting new take on the action survival roguelike genre.</p> <p data-characters="472" data-current-count="472" data-injectable="true">At first glance, <em>Codename: Ocean Keeper </em>entices with its premise, merging the allure of ancient horrors with the futuristic focus of underwater mech combat. Players assume the role of a pilot tasked with navigating treacherous undersea environments teeming with monstrous creatures. Drawing from the survival roguelike elements of <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, the game challenges players to scavenge for resources, upgrade their mech, and battle increasingly formidable adversaries.</p>
 <h2 id="h-gameplay-undersea" data-injectable="false">Gameplay Undersea</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ocean-Keeper-Add-3.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image via RetroStyle Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="446" data-current-count="746" data-injectable="true">The gameplay loop of <em>Codename: Ocean Keeper</em> revolves around strategic decision-making based on an ever-looming timer. Each dive into the abyss presents new dangers and opportunities, from important resource gathering to artifact scavenging, testing both reflexes and tactical prowess. Your mech can be customizable with an array of weapons and utilities and becomes the player’s lifeline against the tide of increasingly monstrous denizens.</p>
 <p data-characters="626" data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true">Resource and artifact harvesting are critical aspects of the gameplay loop in <em>Codename: Ocean Keeper</em>. To survive the waves of alien lifeforms that arrive at specific time intervals, players must constantly gather resources and artifacts to purchase upgrades within a session. These upgrades are essential, not only for sustaining themselves but also, for upgrading their mechs and enhancing their chances against the relentless onslaught from the depths. As the countdown to these encounters ticks away, strategic resource management becomes paramount, adding a layer of constant urgency that eats away at you as you progress.</p>
 <h2 id="h-demo-dives-unveiling-the-adventure" data-injectable="false">Demo Dives: Unveiling the Adventure</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ocean-Keeper-Add-1.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image via RetroStyle Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="494" data-current-count="794" data-injectable="true">From the moment I jumped into <em>Codename: Ocean Keeper</em>’s demo, I was immersed in a world where action and strategy merge seamlessly. The game wastes no time throwing you into the thick of it as soon as you start the game for the first time. This immediate engagement hooks instantly, as you’re encouraged by the game’s short tutorial to explore the abyssal depths for vital resources. After this tutorial, the ticking timer begins, and the frantic race for upgrade resources begins.</p>
 <p data-characters="541" data-current-count="541" data-injectable="true">Navigating the murky depths in search of resources felt exhilarating yet perilous. Yes, you’re in an undersea spider mech, but that alone is far from enough to survive the horrors that lurk in the dark. Every moment-to-moment decision counts as resources carry weight, forcing you to carefully balance the amount you gather against the time needed to return them to your mech. This dynamic adds a layer of tension and strategic depth that kept me constantly on my toes, calculating risks and rewards with each venture into the unknown.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ocean-Keeper-Add-4.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="430" data-current-count="730" data-injectable="true">The timer looming in the background heightens the sense of urgency, reminding you that every second counts. It’s a thrilling balancing act that demands both quick thinking and precise execution, ensuring that each gameplay session is a gripping challenge. The monsters of the depths grow stronger with each passing moment, and you’re tasked with keeping up with the tide or risk becoming derelict at the bottom of the sea.</p>
 <p data-characters="668" data-current-count="668" data-injectable="true"><em>Codename: Ocean Keeper </em>shines with its gameplay mechanics, however, I did find myself occasionally distracted by the repetitive nature of its music and audio design. The soundtrack initially sets a mood of suspense and anticipation, which I enjoyed, but the repetitive loops became somewhat annoying after only a few minutes. Particularly, the singular track that played during combat encounters became especially tiresome. Nevertheless, exploring the depths and overcoming challenges in this captivating underwater world was still an enjoyable experience for me, and I have no doubts RetroStyle Games will make the necessary changes for the game’s full release.</p>
 <h2 id="h-looking-forward" data-injectable="false">Looking Forward</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Ocean-Keeper-Add-2.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image via RetroStyle Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="477" data-current-count="777" data-injectable="true"><em>Codename: Ocean Keeper</em> beckons players into its intriguing universe. A recent <a href="https://youtu.be/21JOxYMcH_8">trailer</a> teases a game filled with danger and peril, offering an adventure that’s both captivating and challenging for indie gaming enthusiasts. Setting itself apart from <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, <em>Codename: Ocean Keeper</em> introduces a distinctive twist that seamlessly blends undersea adventure with strategic resource gathering, a blend that highlights the promising bright future ahead for this title.</p>
 <p data-characters="442" data-current-count="442" data-injectable="false">If you’re interested in trying out <em>Codename: Ocean Keeper</em>, you can jump in right now with its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2845630/Codename_Ocean_Keeper/">free demo available on Steam.</a> It’s a great way to explore the game’s universe and experience its challenging strategic gameplay firsthand. Whether you’re drawn in by its unique premise or just looking for something new in indie gaming, the demo offers a taste of what promises to be an exciting change of pace for the genre.</p>
