		<p>Just the endless recycling of fashion trends from 20-odd years ago, the PSP is having something of a spiritual resurgence in 2025. We always knew that Sony’s handheld was incredibly influential – fundamentally, its feature set was folded into every mobile phone on the planet – but a console can’t exist without iconic software to go with it.</p>
<p>We’ve recently seen Sony’s one-eyed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/10/patapon-12-replay-review-rhythm-action-repeat/">Patapon</a> return to screens (and their spiritual successors, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/10/ratatan-early-access-review-rhythm-action-warfare-is-the-best-kind-of-warfare/">Ratatan</a>), and now it’s the turn of blocks that drop. Lumines was one of the most important block-dropping games of its time, standing as a Sony exclusive take on a Tetris-style experience, and now, Enhance are returning to the series with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/lumines-arise">Lumines Arise</a>, fresh from their masterful sojourn into spinning different-shaped blocks for Tetris Effect.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lumines Arise - Exclusive Preview | PS5, Steam" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ilo5NSlpDfw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Lumines is a block-dropping game where timing and the passage of time are key to achieving a high score. The Timeline passes across the screen over and over again, and each time it does, it wipes, or collects all of the 2×2 blocks you’ve created by spinning and dropping the falling blocks into place. Doing this over and over again,will increase your combo, while also keeping you alive as the blocks start to stack up, and it becomes increasingly tricky to manoeuvre.</p>
<p>You can make those blocks bigger and bigger, combining 2×2 shape together, creating 3×3 blocks for an even bigger score, or chaining scores together by having them drop into place just as you clear other blocks. It’s beautifully simplistic, riffing on Tetris’ original block-dropping gameplay, and making it into something more modern and visually exciting.</p>


<p>So far, that’s all as true for the original Lumines as it is for Arise, but the team at Enhance have built on their work on Tetris Effect to maximise the audio-visual experience, while also making a few changes to the moment-to-moment gameplay. The newest addition is Burst. Entering Burst sees blocks of the opposite colour jumping to the top of the playing field, giving you further opportunity to grow a single huge Burst block, with the other coloured blocks continuing to leap out of the way as it grows. Not only will it earn you even more points, it’s a great last-ditch way to try and survive the impending doom of a full screen, adding an exciting extra wrinkle for players to iron out.</p>
<p>Lumines Arise is all very Tetris Effect, which was, in turn, very much Tetris by way of Lumines. At this point, it’s practically block-dropping inception, but all you really need to know is that Enhance are masters of this genre and style, and Lumines Arise is the next step on that audio-visual pathway.</p>
<p>Lumines Arise responds to your gameplay with more feeling, more emphasis, than ever before. Blocks pulsate, breathe, or beat, while your controller throbs, rumbles and thumps in time. It makes you feel like you’re part of the musical track, rather than an observer, and for all that there are moments of frantic, abject terror at losing your streak and failing a level, this is an experiential game that needs to be played and taken part in, rather than simply spoken about.</p>

<p>Much like Tetris Effect, Lumines Arise looks spectacular. The visuals make this feel like a simple block-dropping game that’s come to life, that’s been inhabited by the very spirit of the music that accompanies it. Nothing is still; nothing is permanent, apart from your score and the frame of the gameboard. It’s a perfect juxtaposition of minimalism and maximalism, contained in one screen.</p>
<p>That would all be for nothing, if the soundtrack wasn’t good. Based on our early hands-on, this boasts the same mixture of progressive emotional dance music as Tetris Effect, and even if it’s not necessarily your genre, you can’t help but feel something while you’re playing. Soaring vocals, swelling soundscapes, all fit perfectly with the distinct thump of the drumbeat. It changes and evolves with every level and area, constantly shifting your attention, and the feel of the game, even while you’re performing the same fundamental task throughout.</p>
<p>It’s incredible how a shift in change, colour and tone can alter how the game feels. Circular pulsating shapes within the blocks feel completely different to the cold, harsh lines of straight-edged blocks, and they perform differently when they connect. One early level sees tiny astronauts appearing within the constructed block, floating off into space when the Timeline passes, and it’s hard not to be awe-struck and utterly put off at points. That will probably lessen with time, but, I have to say, I hope it doesn’t.</p>
<p>Pulling on that musical thread, once you’ve worked your way through Journey mode, you can take all of the tracks and create your own playlist. This is a perfect way to curate your own experience, and you can even watch the computer play while you just listen to the music by selecting Theater Mode.</p>

<p>There’s also multiplayer. Here you can compete side by side against other players, with Burst Mode coming in both ranked and custom flavours, while you can also fight your way to the top of the global leaderboards. This wasn’t active in our preview build, and I can’t wait to face off against some other players to see how I fare after years of playing Lumines. Probably not as well as I think I will.</p>
<p>Customisation comes in the form of your avatar, the Loomi. This diminutive floating fella is your in-game representative, and you can spend any Pon you earn while playing on customising them to make them truly unique amongst the other Loomi. It’s all random though, utilising the Loomi-Pon Rubiks-style cube to spit out a random cosmetic. If you want to get your avatar looking just right, you might have to play for a quite a while. Based on our hands-on, that shouldn’t be a problem.</p>
<p>Lumines Arise is the next evolutionary step in Enhance’s journey through audio-visual gaming. Once again, it builds on a framework that’s instantly comprehensible, but layers in an evocative set of visuals alongside some of the most compelling audio design you’ll find. Is Lumines Arise already essential? We won’t have long to find out, with the game set to release for PC and PS5, with PC VR and PSVR 2 support, on 11th November.</p>

<p>Serving up on Kickstarter</p>

<figure data-uuid="5278cd6ac7f6f"><a title="Paper Plates" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5278cd6ac7f6f/paper-plates.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/legendscookbook.jobjobllc.com/post/3m3ampcvlrs2c">JobJobLLC</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>We've seen a fair few game-inspired cookbooks in our time, though few have looked quite as delicious as Paper Plates, a newly-revealed recipe book that's absolutely rammed with <strong>Paper Mario</strong> sweetness.</p>
<p>This one comes from JobJobLLC, the team behind the Zelda-inspired culinary venture '<a href="https://jobjobllc.com/collections/cookbooks/products/the-legends-cookbook-reprint">The Legend's Cookbook</a>', and '<a href="http://brawlinthefamily.keenspot.com/">Brawl in the Family</a>' artist Matthew Taranto. It promises 35 recipes, all with a Paper Mario twist, and enough of the series' iconic art stylings that you'd assume it's been plucked from the backdrop of an unassuming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">Thousand-Year Door</a> locale.</p>
<p>The book recently launched on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/437762268/paper-plates-a-fan-made-cookbook-inspired-by-paper-mario">Kickstarter</a>, where it hopes to raise $35,000 (around £26,000) by 15th November to make its dishy dreams a reality. It's already almost halfway there (and that's after just one day), with some pretty appealing Backer Rewards from a hardcover copy of the book to a denim overalls-esque apron — we're particularly fond of the idea of the latter.</p>
<p>While the adorable aesthetic was enough to draw us in, the recipes themselves look super appetising. Every dish has a pinch of Paper Mario to it too, so if the likes of Honey Shrooms or Checkerboard Cookies sound up your street, you're in luck.</p>

<p>Naturally, all of this is dependent on Paper Plates hitting its Kickstarter goal in the coming weeks, so be sure to keep an eye out for updates on its fundraising page if the mere idea has already got your mouth a-watering.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/06/02/chucklefish-reveals-first-look-at-witchbrook-in-more-than-2-years-steam-page-now-live">Witchbrook</a>, the role-playing life sim game set in a living, breathing wizarding world, has been delayed to 2026. The game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2017/09/01/stardew-valley-publisher-teases-upcoming-39-stardew-valley-meets-harry-potter-39-game.aspx">first teased way back in 2017</a>, was slated to release this winter.</p><p>Witchbrook has been described as a mix of Stardew Valley and Harry Potter, placing players in the shoes of an aspiring witch/wizard who is a new resident in the magical city of Mossport, where they attend Witchbrook College. Here, players can form friendships, engage in romantic relationships, and interact with citizens who have fully fleshed-out daily schedules and lives. As a student at Witchbrook, you’ll attend classes, complete assignments, and sharpen your spellcasting and potion-making skills to become top of your class.</p><p>Outside of classes, you can freely explore Mossport to engage in activities such as starting a business, renovating your home, and more leisurely excursions. As the school year progresses, Mossport and its residents change throughout the seasons. Witchbrook can also be played with others in four-player online co-op.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TIKSGazNOqg"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TIKSGazNOqg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Witchbrook is an ambitious game, and developer Chucklefish <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/development-update/">posted a developer update</a> stating that, despite making good progress en route to launching this year, the team realized it needs more time to ensure Witchbrook lives up to its years-long hype.</p><p>“Witchbrook is a big project – and it’s taking shape exactly as we hoped; full of charm, depth and detail! In our first blog, we shared our goal to create a living, breathing world for you to explore, and as we bring all those elements together, we’re taking the time needed to ensure the world feels rich, immersive, and alive,” reads Chucklefish’s statement.</p><p>The developer update also revealed the game’s world map. Chucklefish also says a silver lining of the delay is that it allows them to explore the possibility of bringing Witchbrook to more platforms. The game is currently slated to launch on Xbox, PC, and was <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/03/27/the-magically-cozy-life-sim-witchbrook-comes-to-switch-this-holiday">recently confirmed for Switch</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/from-silksong-to-elden-ring-heres-every-third-party-game-from-the">Switch 2</a>. The team is also looking to add additional language support and promises more developer updates in the future, including a blog post focused on character customization.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/15/wizarding-life-sim-witchbrook-delayed-to-2026]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Battle.net Workers Unionize As Microsoft Neutrality Agreement Expires]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/battle-net-workers-unionize-blizzard-entertainment-cwa</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battle-net-workers-unionize-as-microsoft-neutrality-agreement-expires.1325653/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Workers on Blizzard’s Battle.net platform have voted to unionize under the Communications Workers of America. The nearly 400 workers under Blizzard Entertainment's Platform and Technology department have created two new unions: one for software engineers, product and project managers, designers, and others; and a second for localization, quality assurance, and customer support.</p><p>The unit made up of Battle.net's tech workers has roughly 300 members, and the localization, QA, and customer support unit has around 80 members. The decision to split the unit into two instead of a single union was "mutually agreed" to by both Microsoft and CWA, according to a CWA spokesperson.</p><p>Microsoft has recognized the units after workers voted by signing union authorization cards and voting through an online portal. The Platform and Technology workers squeezed in their vote ahead of the expiration of <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/2022/06/13/cwa-microsoft-announce-labor-neutrality-agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft and CWA's neutrality agreement</a> this week, which was signed in 2022 when Microsoft was looking to finalize its $68.7 billion <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/2022/01/18/microsoft-to-acquire-activision-blizzard-to-bring-the-joy-and-community-of-gaming-to-everyone-across-every-device/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a>. The neutrality agreement gave game workers at the company a more streamlined process for unionizing and meant that the voting units under Microsoft did not have to go through the National Labor Relations Board's process, making things quicker.</p><p>Unions existed under Activision Blizzard before the neutrality agreement, like at <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/12/02/wow-diablo-blizzard-albany-union/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blizzard Albany</a>, but a bunch more have formed since its signing. The teams that work on <a href="https://aftermath.site/wow-activision-union-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>World of Warcraft</em></a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/diablo-union-activision-blizzard-microsoft-cwa-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Diablo</em></a>, <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/overwatch-game-developers-secure-union-recognition-communications-workers-america" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Overwatch</em></a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/blizzard-union-story-franchise-cwa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story and franchise development</a>, and <a href="https://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/austin-workers-unionize-at-game-studio-blizzard-13286381/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quality assurance</a> all unionized into separate units. The neutrality agreement did not mean Microsoft or Activision Blizzard <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-zenimax-cwa-union-contract-negotiations-strike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supported</a> unions, but that they didn’t interfere in their formation. It's not immediately clear how unionization efforts will fare without such an agreement, or if a new agreement will be signed.</p><p>Daniel Weltz, a principal software engineer who's worked at Blizzard for almost 20 years, told Aftermath that seeing the <em>World of Warcraft</em> team unionize was a turning point for him. "Even just the fact that <em>World of Warcraft </em>organized first, the biggest and most profitable team, gave a big push that made us think, 'we could do this too,'" he said.&nbsp;</p><p>The Platform and Technology department unions had the support of the other Microsoft and Activision Blizzard unions behind them, too. Blizzard senior software engineer Chris Myles, who's been at the company for 18 years, said several of the organizing committees across the company met to "compare notes" and "share what worked and what didn't." He continued, "We also had an organizing committee summit to get together to discuss where we are and where we’re going."</p><p>From here, the Platform and Technology unions will negotiate with Microsoft and Activision Blizzard on their first contracts. Just two unions under Microsoft and Activision Blizzard have completed negotiations: <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/raven-software-workers-secure-first-contract-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raven Software</a>, which announced its QA union in 2022, ratified a contract in August, while ZeniMax Media QA workers, who unionized in 2023, <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-union-contract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached a tentative contract agreement in May</a>. Both had been in negotiations for years.</p><p>Alex Kohn, a senior data scientist at Blizzard Entertainment, said he's looking to negotiate for "policies regarding layoffs and [return-to-office.]" Myles added that watching his long term colleagues get pushed out of Blizzard because of <a href="https://aftermath.site/activision-workers-speak-out-against-return-to-office-mandate-that-they-see-as-soft-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">return-to-office policies</a> is what moved him to get involved in the union. He said that "more equitable treatment of QA and [customer service]" is a priority, too. "The industry always treats the majority of QA and CS like they’re a separate entity, when in fact, we work very closely with them and we can’t really do our jobs without them," he said.</p><p>Aftermath has reached out to Microsoft for comment.</p><p>"We’re past having to wonder what happens if we don’t succeed," Myles said. "I got that question from multiple people—what happens if we don’t get the results that we want? Do we take another swing at it or do we give up? We don’t have to confront those questions anymore."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bus-bound-demo"><h3>Look Out, I’m The Bus</h3></a><p>The Bus Bound demo is pretty fun</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hasan-piker-dog-collar-kaya-nontroversy-twitch"><h3>I Can’t Believe We’re Still Talking About This</h3></a><p>CollarGate is one of the internet's dumbest psychosis events yet</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-party-wooooooo"><h3>We’re Throwing A Party, And You’re Invited</h3></a><p>Celebrate our two-year anniversary with us!</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-assassins-creed-reconstruction-ubisoft"><h3>Everything Is Assassin’s Creed</h3></a><p>"You can look at 15-ish games at this point and watch, nearly yearly, the progression toward the world we live in today"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/battle-net-workers-unionize-blizzard-entertainment-cwa]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="f637b568ebc0f"><a title="ROG Xbox Ally X" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f637b568ebc0f/rog-xbox-ally-x.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Microsoft/ASUS</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ahead of its release on <strong>16th October 2025</strong> (yes, tomorrow), the ROG Xbox Ally X has received a whole bunch of reviews, and it sounds like this thing might be the new king of PC handhelds.</p>
<p>Heck, at <strong>£799 / $999</strong>, you'd hope so, wouldn't you?</p>
<p>We're going to highlight the review over at <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/reviews/rog-xbox-ally-x-an-amazing-handheld-pc-with-plenty-of-console-like-potential">Pure Xbox</a> first and foremost, with the team calling the Ally X a "superb PC handheld with outstanding ergonomics, terrific cooling and natural-feeling controls for Xbox fans". Criticisms include the lack of an OLED screen (welcome to the club), a few software frustrations, and the lack of a trackpad for mouse controls.</p>
<p>All in all though, with a score of 9/10, it sounds pretty great.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:189623 @ 1760546991 -->
<p>The folks over at IGN were similarly positive with another <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review">9/10 review</a>, going so far as to call the Ally X a potential "device for the history books", providing it receives a few software updates.</p>
<p>So it sounds like the Ally X is the PC handheld to beat right now, eclipsing the Steam Deck in raw power, but also commanding a hefty price tag to boot. The standard Xbox Ally is a bit cheaper at <strong>£499 / $599</strong>, but even this is a big ask these days.</p>
<p>It makes the Switch 2 look like somewhat of a bargain by comparison, priced at <strong>£395.99</strong> in the UK and <strong>£449.99</strong> in the US. Yes, it's not as powerful, but you're getting a true console experience with the Switch 2, not to mention the plethora of incredible first-party games that simply won't be available elsewhere.</p>
<p>We do like the Ally X though, and who knows, maybe we'll wind up getting one at some point down the line. Right now, however, the price is just a little bit steep for us, and it's clear that this thing has a very specific target audience in mind.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:185922,192339 @ 1760545803 -->

            <p>If you've been looking forward to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/witchbrook">Witchbrook</a>, your broomstick's going to have to stay grounded for a little bit longer. Developers Chucklefish have opted to push the cosy magic schooler's release from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/magic-school-stardew-like-witchbrook-gets-its-first-proper-trailer">this winter</a> to 2026. At the same time, they've put out an interactive map offering the first proper look at its setting, Mossport.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>A <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/development-update/">blog post</a> seemingly penned by a pair of socks said the "difficult decision" to delay has been made "despite great development progress this year". "Witchbrook is a big project – and it’s taking shape exactly as we hoped; full of charm, depth and detail," they continued. "In our first blog, we shared our goal to create a living, breathing world for you to explore, and as we bring all those elements together, we’re taking the time needed to ensure the world feels rich, immersive, and alive."</p>
<p>Further on in the post, pushing back the date's also teased to have "opened the door to exploring a few additional exciting opportunities, including additional platforms and language support", with more info on those promised soon.</p>
<p>Aside from that, there's the <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/map-of-mossport/">interactive map</a>, which you can open up and click around to get an idea of the distances you'll have to run (or fly on a broomstick, per the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/5-things-i-demand-from-witchbrook-chucklefishs-new-magical-stardew-like">wishes of Alice B</a>) between the spring festival and Shadhollow Forest. Or how feasible a post-class trip to the Parasol Sands beach will be.</p><p>If it is, maybe you can use magic to overcome that issue. After all, what's the point in living with the stuff if you can't use it to get rid of life annoying's quirks, such as the need to use your legs. Then, you can chop off your legs and lob them in some potion which grants you uber-fast spectral legs. You could also hope that the entire map's on the slope of a hill, so you can hop in your cauldron and roll from place to place like a sentient boulder.</p>
<p>You've now got a bit more time to choose between all of those options, some of which probably won't be in the actual game. The cauldron rolling better be there though.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98gta-6-deserves-to-be-100%E2%80%99-saints-row-director-insists-%E2%80%98not-all-games-are-created-equal%E2%80%99.1325626/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Everyone is waiting patiently to see what Grand Theft Auto 6, Rockstar Games’ next open-world epic, will be priced at. For the longest time, the belief has been that the game will be priced at a whopping $100 for the standard edition, and the divisive potential price point has split the community down the middle.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, one of the creators of Saints Row spoke about Grand Theft Auto 6 and insisted that Take-Two and Rockstar Games can charge what they want for what might be the biggest game ever made.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-gta-6-push-the-pricing-boundaries">Will GTA 6 Push The Pricing Boundaries?</h2>



<p>If there’s one game that can ‘get away with’ a $100 price tag, it’s probably Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>



<p>That’s what Chris Stockman, Design Director on the first Saints Row game, insisted in a recent exclusive <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2025/10/saints-row-creator-interview-gta-vi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with Esports Insider</a>. When asked about the <strong>potential </strong>for Grand Theft Auto 6 to emerge with a $100 price point (and likely more for a special edition), Stockman offered his two cents:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>They’re the only ones that can get away with it.</p>



<p>I don’t think it’s a rising tide that floats all boats. I think that there’ll be a tremendous amount of backlash if&nbsp;everyone switched to $100. Not all games are created equal. I think GTA is the only one that can get away with it, and I hope they do. I really hope it’s $100. I think it deserves to be $100.</p>



<p>The scope and magnitude of this production deserves that price tag, but not everything is treated equally. It would be a disaster if everyone tried to match them.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Stockman revealed that Grand Theft Auto 3, released in 2001, was so awe-inspiring that it opened his eyes to the possibilities of gaming. In his words, he believed it was ‘the future of games’. Five years later, he’d play a pivotal role in bringing Saints Row, a solid GTA competitor, to the market.</p>



<p>It was predicted in July that GTA 6 will make <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-make-7-billion-two-months-analyst-predict/">an eye-watering <strong>$7 billion</strong></a><strong> </strong>within two months when it’s released in May 2026. These unprecedented predictions are based on the expectation that GTA 6 will be the fastest-selling game in history. It will easily surpass anything made to date.</p>



<p>Do you think GTA 6 could get away with a $100 price point? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

This even included expanding the score ranks and simplifying certain achievements to make every accomplishment feel like a celebrated win.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->

The first mainline Ninja Gaiden in many years, this new entry in the series has been co-developed by Team Ninja and Platinum Games, and it officially launches on October 21. Global launch times for Ninja Gaiden 4 have been officially confirmed, and if you're in the US, you won't have to worry too much about FOMO during working hours because the game will go live toward the later part of the day on October 20.</p><p>For the middle part of the world, those times translate to a <em>very </em>early launch on October 21, so if you're in London or Paris, at least you can wake up and start playing right away if you preloaded the game. Here's a quick breakdown of the exact Ninja Gaiden 4 launch times across the globe. As a reminder, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-pass-adding-these-12-games-soon/2900-7116/" data-ref-id="2900-7116">Ninja Gaiden 4 will also be a day-one release for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>.</p><h2>Ninja Gaiden 4 release times</h2><h3>Monday, October 20, 2025</h3><ul><li>5 PM PT</li><li>6 PM CST</li><li>8 PM ET</li><li>11 PM CST</li></ul><h3>Tuesday, October 21, 2025</h3><ul><li>1 AM BST</li><li>2 AM CEST</li><li>9 AM KST</li><li>9 AM JST</li><li>11 AM AEDT</li><li>1 PM NZDT</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4585662-ninja-gaiden-4-release-times.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4585662" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4585662-ninja-gaiden-4-release-times.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4585662"></a><figcaption>Ninja Gaiden 4 global release times</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4585662-ninja-gaiden-4-release-times.jpg"></figure><h2>Ninja Gaiden 4 preloading times and install sizes</h2><p>Ninja Gaiden 4 should be a relatively quick download--depending on your home internet connection--as sizes range from 36.82GB on Xbox Series X|S consoles to 54.9GB on PC. PS5 users can expect the smallest download here, as the game clocks in at 23.55GB in size. These are just the install sizes, and they're likely to change with any potential updates or future patches. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-preorders-are-live-supports-play-anywhere-on-xbox-and-pc/1100-6532333/" data-ref-id="1100-6532333">Ninja Gaiden 4 preorders are still live</a> and come with several bonuses.</p><p>Following the release of Ninja Gaiden 2 Black and Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound earlier this year, Ninja Gaiden 4 follows Ryu Hayabusa and a new protagonist, Yakumo, as they explore the underworld of Tokyo. "Ninja Gaiden 4 is shaping up to be a fun reunion for series veterans, as well as a great entry point for newcomers," Jessica Cogswell wrote <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-is-the-ninja-gaiden-game-youre-hoping-it-will-be/1100-6533763/">in her preview of the game</a>. "Ninja Gaiden 4 is whatever style of Ninja Gaiden you want it to be."</p><p>While the series has a reputation for being challenging, this new entry in the franchise looks like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-could-be-the-easiest-or-toughest-game-in-the-series-to-date/1100-6535013/">it could be the most approachable yet</a> thanks to several accessibility options. If you're looking to breeze through the storyline and feel like a master ninja, you can tone down the difficulty for your playthrough, or if you're feeling masochistic, you can dial it up to a sadistic level that's designed to feel purposefully unfair.</p>

                <p>Late last month, Electronic Arts confirmed that it had struck <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/" data-ref-id="1100-6535078">a $55 billion deal</a> to go private under new ownership including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and the private equity firm Silver Lake. There are a lot of unanswered questions about what this means for EA and the industry at large, but now two US Senators are raising the potential "foreign influence" Saudi Arabia could enact with EA under its control.</p><p>Senators Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren--both of whom are Democrats--co-authored a letter to EA CEO Andrew Wilson and Department of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about whether Saudi Arabia will take over EA's editorial independence if the deal is approved. As reported by <a href="https://www.404media.co/senators-warn-saudi-arabias-acquisition-of-ea-will-be-used-for-foreign-influence/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">404 Media</a>, they also suggested that Saudi Arabia's ownership may rise to the level of a "national security" risk.</p><p>"The deal's potential to expand and strengthen Saudi foreign influence in the United States is compounded by the national security risks raised by the Saudi government's access to and unchecked influence over the sensitive personal information collected from EA's millions of users, its development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, and the company's product design and direction."</p><p>Saudi Arabia's PIF has spent a lot of money to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-gaming-companies-saudi-arabia-owns-or-has-invested-in/2900-7081/" data-ref-id="2900-7081">invest in multiple video game companies</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saudi-arabia-is-now-nintendos-largest-outside-investor/1100-6511622/" data-ref-id="1100-6511622">including Nintendo</a>. The country also struck a 12-year pact with the IOC to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2025-olympic-esports-games-will-be-held-in-saudi-arabia/1100-6524936/" data-ref-id="1100-6524936">bring the Olympic Esports to Saudi Arabia</a> for multiple events. Saudi Arabia has been accused of numerous human rights violations as well as the 2018 assassination of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Investing in video game companies and other diversified holdings has been interpreted as a way for the country to whitewash its image on the international stage.</p>

            <p>
Halloween season is well and truly upon us, and there's plenty of spookiness to be found in Sony newly unveiled October additions to its PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium catalogue, including developer Bloober's stellar <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake and the slightly less stellar remake of Until Dawn.
</p>
<p>
These and more - including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yakuza-like-a-dragon">Yakuza: Like a Dragon</a> - join PlayStation's Premium and Extra tiers from Tuesday, 21st October, with the full line-up as follows:
</p>
<h3>PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium</h3>
<ul>
<li>Silent Hill 2 (PS5)</li>
<li>Until Dawn (PS5)</li>
<li>V Rising (PS5)</li>
<li>Yakuza: Like a Dragon (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Poppy Playtime: Chapter 1 (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>As Dusk Falls (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Wizard with a Gun (PS5)</li>
</ul>
<h3>PlayStation Plus Premium:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tekken 3 (PS5, PS4)</li>
</ul>
<p>
So you go! Halloween highlights obviously include the aforementioned Silent Hill 2 remake - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">got the five star review treatment from Eurogamer</a> last year - alongside the rather more divisive do-over of developer Supermassive's brilliant 2015 interactive horror Until Dawn. The original, incidentally, turned ten this year, and we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-at-10-how-supermassive-overcame-sony-scepticism-and-used-the-science-of-fear-to-make-a-modern-horror-classic">delved deep into the fascinating story of its development back in August</a> if you'd like to learn how it came to be.
</p><p>
Also on the spooky front is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/poppy-playtime">Poppy Playtime</a>: Chapter 1, alongside hugely enjoyable vampire survival game V: Rising. But if you're not in the mood for ghosts and ghoulies, there's acclaimed interactive drama in As Dusk Falls, enjoyable RPG action in Yakuza: Like a Dragon, and twin stick shooter chaos with Galvanic Games' Wizard with a Gun. And for Premium subscribers, there's classic fighting action, courtesy of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-3">Tekken 3</a>.
</p>
<p>
As a reminder, all the above don't arrive until next Tuesday, 21st October, meaning you've still got some time to focus on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-our-ps-plus-extra-and-premium-games-for-september">last month's PlayStation Plus Premium and Extra additions</a> before your attention is yanked elsewhere.

            <title><![CDATA[Ball X Pit Review – Sphere factor]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>What a crazy crossover event Ball X Pit is! Who could have foreseen the rotund, spherical ball franchise matching up so well with a great big hole IP? Well, golfers, I suppose. In all seriousness, Ball X Pit is a melding of so many genres and games that the titular ball and the pit feel like the nominal components here, with solo developer Kenny Sun having crafted one of the best arcade roguelite crossovers we’ve ever seen.</p>
<p><iframe title="BALL X PIT – Release Date Trailer – Nintendo Switch &amp; Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/npSBksOTz8c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You’re a treasure hunter, out to delve into the depths of The Pit, bracing yourself to fight off hordes of monsters on your way towards a huge boss. What does that mean in terms of gameplay? Your character fires a steady stream of balls to cause damage, projectiles bouncing around the arena like a riff on Breakout or Arkanoid, and you’re left thinking about angles, avoiding arrows and ice spears, while collecting experience gems from the fallen.</p>


<p>Here’s where it gets interesting. You can carry up to four special ball types. These range from balls that cause bleeding or inflict poison, to slow and ultra-powerful types, or ones that cause lightning to arc between enemies. As you progress, you’ll find Fusion drops alongside the experience gems, and these can do various things to your special loadout. Fission will upgrade them, by up to two levels, increasing damage or area of effect, while Fusion can happen between two, fully levelled special balls, amping them up and combining their effects into one ball.</p>
<p>Evolution is what you’re really looking for. Certain ball types can be combined through evolution into hybrids, gaining additional effects, and making your chances of success even higher. The thing is, you really have to plan ahead, and Ball X Pit isn’t necessarily the kind of game to allow you to do that.</p>


<p>There is a frantic pace to Ball X Pit, though you do have some control over that, with a speed control that’s been nabbed from an RTS. The oncoming hordes that move down the screen are insatiable, and the start of each foray into the Pit is generally balanced on a knife-edge, and it’s that which makes planning ahead difficult. You have three choices each time you level up, but you are still at the mercy of a random drop, so having specific builds in mind is all well and good, but you might have to abandon them in the heat of the moment, and hope that something good comes your way next.</p>
<p>Ball X Pit is a roguelite. Each run into the Pit earns your character experience, permanently levelling their stats, and gaining various other boons along the way, making it more likely that you can tackle the increasingly difficult levels as you descend further.</p>
<p>Ball X Pit throws a swift curveball into this mix, with the way it deals with your ongoing growth. Outside of the Pit, you work on building a settlement on the surface. This hub plays host to the housing for each of your characters, buildings that offer permanent upgrades that carry across all of your team, and then forests, fields and boulders that you use to accrue the resources to build and expand further.</p>

<p>This in itself is a unique addition to the formula, but then Ball X Pit messes with it some more by making it an offshoot of the ball-bouncing gameplay itself. In order to collect resources, or finish buildings, you have to bounce your characters around the town area like pinballs, hopefully completing the jobs you want, or nabbing enough of the particular resource you need.</p>
<p>There’s a really in-depth spot of tactical town planning needed here, and you can rearrange the buildings and fields to your heart’s content. So, you can make a narrow corridor of buildings that need finishing if you want, or a slew of forests at the front of the town to ensure you get plenty of wood. Equally, you can shift other buildings out of the way if they don’t have anything useful to offer at that moment, and it gives you a real shift in atmosphere and thought compared to the main game.</p>
<p>It can introduce some early frustration, though. I initially wasn’t thinking it through fully, and through repeated harvests, I didn’t manage to grab the things I needed. There’s a balance between predictability and chaos that feels quite slim, but there are ways to make things more certain by changing the layout, which I really started to appreciate as I got deeper into the game.</p>

<p>Crucially, it all fits together incredibly well. The central gameplay is exciting, and immediately rewarding, feeling like a vertical shooter as much as a Breakout-style ball bouncer. It is arcade-y and, by its nature, repetitive, but if you find that feeling of zen from a million things pinging around the screen, there are few games that can come close to Ball X Pit’s immersion.</p>
<p>The town building adds to that, with your downtime bringing you a host of things to consider, and upgrades and resources to focus on. It’s slightly retro-esque looks complete the experience well, and they’re topped off by the constant gothic rave of the soundtrack. I have to say, Ball X Pit feels like more or less a perfect game to me, building on several classic genres and ideas, while infusing them with unique and rewarding new ideas.</p>

<figure><a title="BALL x PIT Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159601/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Here comes a ball – a great big wrecking ball, ready to smash down the headquarters of productivity that might otherwise control your life. Kenny Sun Studios’ <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ball_x_pit">Ball x Pit</a> is a mercilessly addictive mix of, well, a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>First, take a big dollop of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> and a healthy scoop of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/breakout_recharged">Breakout</a> – then just mix in little pinches of almost whatever you feel like: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/neogeo/puzzle_bobble">Puzzle Bobble</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/balatro">Balatro</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/space_invaders">Space Invaders</a>… and maybe even a tiny sprinkle of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a> for good measure.</p>
<p>But if this roguelite concoction sounds like a pure distillation of all the addictive gameplay ideas from history — and if that puts you off — just hang around a little longer. Ball x Pit definitely brings enough structure and variety, and demands enough creative thinking, to be well worth the time it will inevitably eat up.</p>
<p>You start as a knight at the bottom of a vertical channel. Up top, a small horde of skeletons drops in and starts clomping slowly downwards. They need smashing, and for that, you have a collection of balls. Here’s where the Breakout-ness comes in: bounce the balls to gradually smash the skeletons. Unlike Breakout, you don’t need to stop the balls from falling off the bottom of the screen (although you can catch them if dexterous enough): they’ll just bounce back into your hands, ready for another throw.</p>
<figure><a title="BALL x PIT Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159605/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The super-satisfying strat in Breakout is to get the ball on top of the blocks, so that it ricochets about, wreaking havoc without you having to do anything. That’s a killer move in Ball x Pit, too, but there’s a catch. If you’ve got your balls bouncing about up above the enemies, then the enemies on the front line are marching in untouched.</p>
<p>You need to balance the high damage-per-second latticework of rapid bounces with route-one attacks on the clear and present danger edging towards screen bottom. Any beastie that gets there will make a final lunge and bite off a chunk of your health meter. That’s where you’ll frequently meet your demise – drowned in swathes of enemies, pinned to the bottom edge.</p>
<p>Now, where do the Survivors ideas come in? Well, you start with a handful of “baby balls” that deal minimal damage, plus one special ball that delivers greater damage of different kinds depending on the ball. These include burn, poison, freeze, various area-of-effect attacks, and more. Pressing 'X' toggles auto-fire. I pressed it exactly once, turning it on, then concentrated only on moving in two dimensions with the left stick while aiming with the right.</p>
<figure><a title="BALL x PIT Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159608/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As enemies are dispatched, they drop crystals, which can be collected to get new special balls, help items, or buffs. You can hold up to four special balls at once, but once you reach capacity, rainbow collectibles allow you to fuse or evolve balls to combine two into one, presenting you with a spare slot to pick another. Each special ball can also be levelled up twice, enhancing its power.</p>
<p>The result of all this is total chaos. Enemies are launching projectiles, you’re launching projectiles, your projectiles are launching projectiles, and even little golems or turrets you can pick are launching projectiles. In summary, there are a lot of projectiles.</p>
<p>Reading the action is confusing at first, but soon becomes clear as you learn what you need to dodge and what you can collect. Consistently fluid performance helps no end in enabling this flow state that is the powerful hook of the game.</p>
<p>To assist in finding that flow, the soundtrack offers a haunting, trancelike electronic beat, with enough drive to pump the adrenaline as bosses arrive and enough dreaminess to drift off into ball heaven when a rare safe patch arrives. The sounds are wonderfully moreish rattles and bounces, clicks, pops, growls, and grunts: rhythmical and tight, firing happy feelings in the brain.</p>
<figure><a title="BALL x PIT Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159603/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>So far, so compelling. But how does this formula avoid getting samey? If we zoom out a bit, there is actually a narrative setting for the game. The city of Ballbylon (yes) has been destroyed, leaving behind a vast pit. Descending into the pit via an enormous lift is what takes you to ever deeper levels, each new one unlocked by completing an earlier one with two different characters and gaining special cogs. This overworld provides a space to gain those new characters and to buff them, and it’s managed, remarkably enough, through a base-building mechanic.</p>
<p>You gather gold while playing the main game, then can use it to purchase a wheat field. Harvesting wheat lets you buy a forest and harvest wood, and so on. Harvesting is done by firing your characters across the base like balls themselves. They ricochet off things and collect resources from the tiles they touch.</p>
<p>Among all this, you can build. Blueprints collected in the pit enable construction of homes for new characters (more play variety and more harvesters) and other buildings that increase stats or improve the rate at which characters develop.</p>
<figure><a title="BALL x PIT Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159610/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The base building is a different flavour of addictive; it keeps you wanting more, but gives you a break at the same time. A round of building and harvesting clears the mind and sets up the next run in the pit. Jumping back in is satisfying, but it’s also a good time to turn off, knowing your next go is ready to take you even further than before. A built-in reality check is a welcome addition to such a compulsive genre.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Ball x Pit is a tremendous brew of so many ideas it ought to collapse under the confusion. However, it operates in such perfect balance that it appeals both to the one-more-go instinct and to more cerebral planning and creativity. Kenny Sun Studios set itself a heck of a challenge but, fortunately, hasn’t dropped the ball.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier today, when we covered <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-until-dawn-ps-plus-extra-october-2025/">Billbil-kun's report on Dealabs</a> that leaked a few of the games coming to the PS Plus Extra Games Catalogue, we wrote that the official announcement probably wasn't too far behind, and that if it didn't appear today, it would surely appear before the end of the week. Well, we were right the first time, as a new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/15/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-october-silent-hill-2-until-dawn-v-rising-yakuza-like-a-dragon-and-more/">PlayStation Blog post</a> confirmed most of the Dealabs report, with some additional announcements not in the report.</p>



<p>Starting off, yes, Bloober Team's Silent Hill 2 Remake is the big headlining game for PS Plus Extra for October 2025. It's also joined by the 2024 version of Until Dawn, V Rising, and As Dusk Falls, as we saw in the earlier report. Dealabs also got one of the PS Plus Premium games right coming into the Classics Catalogue with the original PlayStation version of Tekken 3 entering the service. Everything will also arrive, as predicted, next week, on October 21, 2025.</p>



<p>What we didn't see in the Dealabs report is that Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Poppy Playtime: Chapter 1, and Wizard with a Gun are also joining the PS Plus Extra Games Catalogue this month. Here's the full list of games coming to PS Plus Extra and PS Plus Premium this month.</p>



<ul>
<li>Silent Hill 2 Remake - PS5</li>



<li>Until Dawn (2024) - PS5</li>

            <title><![CDATA[Magical Life Sim Witchbrook Delayed Into Next Year]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witchbrook-delayed-2026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/magical-life-sim-witchbrook-delayed-into-next-year.1325581/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Chucklefish and Robotality have announced that magical life sim&nbsp;<em>Witchbrook&nbsp;</em>won't be coming out in 2025 as originally planned.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1846700/view/501712599669276725" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on Steam, the two studios say that while they had originally planned to release the game in winter, you won't be able to play&nbsp;<em>Witchbrook&nbsp;</em>until 2026. This, they say, will give them the "time needed to ensure the world feels rich, immersive, and alive".</p>

<p>Despite this setback, Chucklefish and Robotality say that&nbsp;<em>Witchbrook&nbsp;</em>is "taking shape exactly as [they] hoped", and that the game will be "full of charm, depth, and detail" when you do finally get to check it out next year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/witchbrook-delayed-school.jpg?itok=z3OFYLZK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/witchbrook-delayed-school.jpg?itok=Txx9GEYJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Witchbrook&nbsp;</em>won't be coming out in 2025, sadly.</figcaption></figure><p>To cushion the blow of the delay somewhat, Chucklefish and Robotality have released an interactive map that shows just how large&nbsp;<em>Witchbrook</em>'s playable area will be. You can check that map (which is interactive!) out <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/map-of-mossport/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

<p>Incidentally, this isn't the magical life sim that was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-delays" rel="nofollow">delayed as a result of&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>'s release</a>; that was&nbsp;<em>Little Witch in the Woods</em>, which went on to release on September 15th. I guess this is kind of like indie game convergent evolution.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Witchbrook&nbsp;</em>is, it's a life sim in which you'll play "the newest resident witch in the bustling seaside city of Mossport". There, you'll find new people to befriend, spells to cast, and recipes to craft, as well as plenty of customization options for both you and your abode.</p>

<p>Naturally, you'll have plenty to do outside of the titular college as well. You'll be able to explore Mossport during your off-hours, playing games at the arcade or simply taking artful snapshots of the city with your camera.</p>




<p><em>Witchbrook&nbsp;</em>launches sometime in 2026 for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1846700/Witchbrook/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/witchbrook/9P54Q8W3TF4W" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and both Nintendo Switch consoles. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-pc-specs-revealed.1325575/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Paradox and developer The Chinese Room have announced the PC specs you're going to need if you want to run&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>when it launches next week.</p>

<p>As you can probably imagine, running the game at Ultra settings in 4K is going to take a pretty beefy rig, but if you're happy to make a few compromises, then a less powerful machine will probably do the trick.</p>

<p>Handily, the two studios provide seven different presets depending on what kind of level you want to run the game at, so you should be able to find something that works for you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-pc-specs-combat.jpg?itok=v27gKSSS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-pc-specs-combat.jpg?itok=yVO5R_qK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em>'s PC specs are finally here.</figcaption></figure><p>Here's all the PC spec info you're going to need if you want to run&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em>. Bear in mind that all of these presets require 30GB of free storage, and you'll also need Windows 11 for all but the lowest preset, as well as 16GB RAM (8GB will suffice for Minimum).</p>

<h3>Minimum - 1080p at 30fps, Low preset</h3>

<ul><li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 6GB,&nbsp;AMD Radeon RX 480 8GB, or Intel Arc A580 8GB</li>
	<li>CPU: Intel Core i3-8350K or AMD Ryzen 3 3300X</li>
</ul><h3>Recommended - 1080p at 60fps, High preset</h3>

<ul><li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti 8GB or AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT 12GB</li>
	<li>CPU: Intel Core i5-12600K or AMD Ryzen 5 5600X</li>
</ul><h3>2K - 1440p at 60fps, High preset</h3>

<ul><li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 8GB or AMD Radeon RX 7700 XT 12GB</li>
	<li>CPU: Intel Core i5-12600K or AMD Ryzen 5 5600X</li>
</ul><h3>4K - 2160p at 60fps, High preset</h3>

<ul><li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 16GB or AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX 24GB</li>
	<li>CPU: Intel Core i7-13700K or AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D</li>
</ul><h3>Ultra 2K DLSS - 1440p at 60fps, Ultra preset, DLSS enabled</h3>

<ul><li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti 8GB or RTX 5060 8GB</li>
	<li>CPU: Intel Core i5-12600K or AMD Ryzen 5 5600X</li>
</ul><h3>Ultra 4K DLSS + FG 2X - 2160p at 60fps, Ultra preset, DLSS (Quality) and Frame Gen enabled</h3>

<ul><li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 12GB or RTX 5060 Ti 16GB</li>
	<li>CPU: Intel Core i7-13700K or AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D</li>
</ul><h3>Ultra 4K + DLSS + MFG 4X - 2160p at 240fps, DLSS (Performance) and Multi Frame Gen (4x) enabled</h3>

<ul><li>GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 16GB</li>
	<li>CPU: Intel Core i7-13700K or AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D</li>
</ul><p>Whew! That's a lot of presets. As you can see, later presets only list DLSS, which is why you won't see AMD cards as part of those listings; it hasn't yet been confirmed whether the game will support AMD's FSR technology or not.</p>




<p><em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>launches <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-october-2025" rel="nofollow">on October 21st</a> for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/532790/Vampire_The_Masquerade__Bloodlines_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10007767/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/9pf9rkwb9b50" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> (and it's been a very long road indeed to get here).

              <p>Microsoft first unveiled Windows 11 and its Pro version in 2021, and since then, the OS has become the go-to option for students, work professionals, creatives, gamers, and even casual users.</p>
<p>If you’ve been meaning to upgrade but don’t want to spend close to $200 on a license, we’ve found an affordable (and legitimate) route. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4452/">Stacksocial is currently offering a lifetime license for Microsoft Windows 11 Pro for just $15.</a> That’s a straightforward $184 discount on a one-and-done purchase.

<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4452/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2>A Wide Range of Built-In Productivity Features</h2>

Even better, there’s DirectX 12 Ultimate support to ensure a more immersive, high-performance gaming experience on compatible hardware.</p>
<p>However, there are some hardware and system requirements you need to meet before making the jump.

This deal takes $184 off the usual $199 price, letting you upgrade for just $15. That’s a massive 92% discount, but it might not last long.

            <title><![CDATA[From Hades to Dead Cells: The 7 Best Roguelites of All Time]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/best-roguelites-all-time/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/from-hades-to-dead-cells-the-7-best-roguelites-of-all-time.1325554/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As a gamer, finding enough time to sit and enjoy a game can be tough. That’s especially true when you have responsibilities like a full-time job or being a parent. Luckily, there’s a specific genre of game that exists for this exact reason: roguelites. These games offer quick, pick-up-and-play action without much setup. But what games are the best roguelites of all time?</p>



<p>Overall, there are hundreds of these games to choose from over the years, but some stand out more than others. These are seven of the best roguelite games that you can pick up and play right now.</p>



<h2>What’s The Difference Between Roguelikes and Roguelites?</h2>



<p>You’ve probably heard people toss around “roguelike” and “roguelite” as though they mean the same thing. And while they do share many similarities, there are enough differences to make each game feel different. </p>



<p>Roguelikes are games that often stick to the formula of permadeath and procedurally-generated levels. Every run is a fresh start, so it’s all about your skill, learning tendencies, and getting a bit lucky.</p>



<p>Roguelites, on the other hand, add on to that formula. While they also follow the single-run strategy, they give players some sort of progression system. As you play, you’ll unlock abilities, new levels, characters, upgrades, and more to keep you coming back. </p>



<p>TL;DR: Roguelikes start you from zero every time, while roguelites let you grow a little with each run, making them easier for players to jump into and keep playing.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-best-rogulites-of-all-time">The Best Rogulites Of All Time</h2>



<h3>Dead Cells</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>A metroidvania-inspired Roguelite, Dead Cells is one of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-cells-gets-final-update-from-evil-empire/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the toughest games</a> you’ll find on this list. The game has you exploring an ever-changing castle, where the more you play, the easier it <em>should </em>get. As you play, you’ll unlock new levels, mutations, weapons, and abilities to help you out. Weapons like the War Spear and Panchuku&nbsp;will have you mowing through your enemies like a hot knife through butter. </p>



<p>There aren’t any checkpoints, meaning that once you die, it’s back to the beginning in a new corpse. It’ll be frustrating at times, but it’s the type of frustration that has you thinking you finally figured out how to make it to the end. </p>

<h3>Risk of Rain 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Risk of Rain 2 is a thrilling roguelite game that puts you in the shoes of a survivor who crash-lands on a hostile alien planet. The game is full of action and exploration, as you fight your way through randomly generated levels and collect powerful items and abilities. The game has a co-op mode that lets you play with up to three friends online. Each run in the game lasts about an hour, making it perfect for quick sessions.</p>



<hr>



<h3>Slay the Spire</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Slay the Spire is a unique roguelite game that combines card games and dungeon crawling. The game challenges you to build your own deck of cards and use them to fight your way through procedurally generated levels full of enemies and bosses. The game has four different characters to choose from, each with their own cards and abilities. The game also has a daily challenge mode that offers new twists and rewards every day. The best part? Each run in the game takes about an hour or less.</p>



<hr>



<h3>Hades</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Hades is a critically acclaimed roguelite game that tells the story of Zagreus, the son of Hades, who tries to escape from the underworld. The game features stunning graphics and voice acting, as well as an engaging combat system that lets you wield different weapons and powers from the gods. The game also has a rich narrative that unfolds as you interact with various characters and learn more about their stories. Each run in the game takes about 30 minutes to an hour, depending on your skill level.</p>



<p>If you wrap up your time in Hades, you can then jump into the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hades-2-highest-rated-game-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">equally impressive sequel</a>, Hades 2.</p>



<hr>



<h3>Enter the Gungeon</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Enter the Gungeon is a hilarious roguelite game that parodies various pop culture references and tropes. The game is set in a dungeon full of guns and bullets, where you play as one of four adventurers who seek to find a legendary gun that can kill their past. The game has over 300 different guns and items to discover and use, as well as dozens of secrets and hidden rooms to explore. The game also has a co-op mode that lets you play with one friend locally. Each run in the game takes about an hour or less.</p>



<hr>



<h3>Absolum</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The newest game on this list, Absolum, is one of the<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/absolum-review-a-must-play-roguelite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> best games in the genre’s history</a> without doing anything to reinvent the wheel. The game follows four heroes working to save the world from Sun King Azra, who has used the world’s fear of magic to take over and enslave wizards. Each character offers unique abilities and skill sets that differ enough to make you want to try each out. Each run features route branching along with upgrade changes and enemy spawns to keep the game feeling fresh, no matter how many hours you put in. Add in the multiplayer aspect, and you have a game worthy of your time.</p>



<hr>



<h3>The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is one of the most popular roguelite games ever made. The game follows Isaac, a young boy who escapes from his abusive mother into his basement full of horrors. The game is dark and twisted, but also funny and creative, as it features hundreds of items and enemies inspired by biblical references and other sources. The game also has multiple endings and unlockable characters that add replay value. Each run in the game takes about 30 minutes or less. </p>



<p>If you want more Binding of Isaac content, you can pick up the recent Repentance DLC that adds enough content to make it an entirely new game.</p>

It details blanket changes across every Conquest map in Battlefield 6, as the developers aim to ensure matches “finish at a more natural pace.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To achieve this, BF Studios says it has reduced ticket sizes – which essentially represent each team's available reinforcements – from 1000 tickets to a unique ticket goal for each map. These range from 900 tickets on maps like Siege of Cairo and Empire State to 700 tickets on maps like Mirak Valley and Operation Firestorm. You can see the full breakdown below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">New Conquest Ticket Sizes in Battlefield 6</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Siege of Cairo from 1000 to 900</li><li>Empire State from 1000 to 900</li><li>Iberian Offensive from 1000 to 900</li><li>Liberation Peak From 1000 to 800</li><li>Manhattan Bridge From 1000 to 800</li><li>Operation Firestorm From 1000 to 700</li><li>New Sobek City from 1000 to 900</li><li>Mirak Valley from 1000 to 700</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">"Previously, many rounds were hitting the time limit instead of ending when one team ran out of tickets," the post explains. "We'll keep monitoring feedback and data to make sure the flow of each match feels right."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BF Studios says its goal is to keep matches moving at a more natural pace, but players aren’t convinced that reduced ticket requirements are what Battlefield 6 needs. In fact, many now say they're happy to play out 1000-ticket matches and enjoy the stress of last-minute comebacks. What's really hampering the pace for many isn't large ticket requirement that result in the timer running out – it's the timer itself.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">why have a time limit? what’s wrong with longer games? i swear back in the day a conquest game used to run for 30-40 minutes</p>— reece (@reece_us) <a href="https://twitter.com/reece_us/status/1978462255608914183?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 15, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"The easier solution would just be to remove the time limits," content creator <a href="https://x.com/MoiDawg/status/1978464857952284858" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@MoiDawg replied</a>. "Close games are incredible and this artifical time limit ruins comebacks. Just let us play Conquest. I'm not joining a Conquest game thinking it'll be over in 20 minutes.

That's certainly the case in new clip posted by Rebs Gaming.</p><p>In the sequence, the Battlefield 6 player XxOsiris187xX ejects from a jet high above the battlefield and just as they go to open their parachute, another jet appears below them. The player lands on this jet, walks to the front, dome-shots the pilot, and then gets into the hijacked jet to make a getaway. It's seriously impressive stuff that you need to see to believe--take a look for yourself in the clip below.</p><p>There have been numerous astonishing Battlefield 6 clips that have emerged following the game's big launch on October 10. In another clip, the professional player FaZe Scope uses a drone to vault himself into the sky, then whips out a sniper rifle and takes out a helicopter.

It remains to be seen if Battlefield Studios can keep the momentum and engagement going, but the company has seemingly laid a strong foundation to build on. </p><p>Next up for Battlefield 6 is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-and-free-content-revealed/1100-6535112/" data-ref-id="1100-6535112">launch of Season 1 on October 28</a>, and that's also the day that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/" data-ref-id="1100-6533631">the game's battle royale mode is rumored to launch. </a></p><p>As for the competitive landscape, EA veteran Patrick Soderlund's Embark Studios is launching its new multiplayer shooter Arc Raiders on October 30, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 comes out on November 14.</a></p>

This is a joke, and yet it's very real at the same time, as seen in the video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgpXBGbeM4U" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="68">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SgpXBGbeM4U?start=68" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"This isn't just merch," reads the description on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/15/the-outer-worlds-2-moon-man-couch-panion-sweepstakes/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a>. "This isn't just a plush. This is a lifestyle choice. A statement piece. A co-pilot for every late-night quest and awkward snack run. It's satire you can hug--and proof that The Outer Worlds 2 lives beyond the game."</p><p>The Moon Man Couch-Panion is three feet tall and includes a popcorn bucket holder in its head, weird stress-ball squishy hands, and straps designed to hold a TV remote and an Xbox Wireless Controller. It's also got a creepy face that only a nightmare could love. And while these Couch-Panions aren't going to heading to stores, fans will get their chance to win one.</p><p>Starting today and going through November 16, Microsoft is running a contest that will let ten fans receive a Moon Man Couch-Panion of their own. To enter on X, players need to follow <a href="https://x.com/Xbox" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox on the platform</a> and repost <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1978445838452986255" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the original Moon Man Couch-Panion contest post</a> with the #MoonManSweepstakes hashtag. Instagram users can also join in by following <a href="https://www.instagram.com/xbox/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox on Instagram</a> and by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/xbox/p/DP1LAntkeVg/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">commenting on the official contest post</a> with the #MoonManSweepstakes hashtag before the end of the contest period.</p><p>Microsoft recently unveiled a pair of limited-edition <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-is-getting-some-pricy-customizable-xbox-controllers/1100-6535316/" data-ref-id="1100-6535316">Outer Worlds 2 Xbox Wireless Controllers</a>, which are customizable and more expensive than the game's $70 price.</p><p>The Outer Worlds 2 will hit Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on October 29, and will be a day-one Game Pass Ultimate release. Obsidian <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-launch-times-revealed/1100-6535442/" data-ref-id="1100-6535442">shared the launch times</a> earlier this week, while early-access players will get to dive into it on October 24.</p>
