		<p>You will soon be able to sheath your Fortnite character in a Fantastic Four skin. These delightful creations are to tie in with the Marvel movie, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, which can be seen in UK cinemas from July 25th 2025.</p>
<p>The Fantastic Four skins have not been detailed, but it is assumed that you will be able to purchase all four members of the team: Mister Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch and the Thing. Data miners have porked around in the code and found the details below, but nothing official has been posted.</p>


<ul>
<li>Reed Richards: – Skin, has a beard – Emote (With Prop &amp; Hologram) – Glider – Bundle</li>
<li>Sue Storm: – Skin – Emote – Pickaxe – Backpack – Bundle</li>
<li>Johnny Storm: – Skin (Normal &amp; Fire Style) – Emote – Emoji – Pickaxe – Backpack – Bundle</li>
<li>The Thing: – Skin – Spray – Emote – Pickaxe – Backpack – Bundle</li>
</ul>

<p>Epic have not posted a release date but it is assumed it will be somewhere near the launch date of the film. Galactus is the main villain in the movie, but it is rumoured that many lesser-known characters may make an appearance so they may get a Fantastic Four skin as well.</p>
<p>Data miners have also found reference to four pairs of Nike shoes that are linked to the characters, all of which are based on existing real world kicks.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Reed Richards:- Harbor Blue Air Max 90s</li>
<li>Sue Storm: – Air Force 1s with a blue swoosh</li>
<li>Johnny Storm: -Red and orange Air Max 95s</li>
<li>The Thing: – Orange Dunks</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The four skins are the latest Superheroes to be added to the game,&nbsp; on July 10th a version of Superman based on the new DC movie starring David Corenswet was added to the game. Previous additions included Dead Pool, Black Panther, Captain America, Doctor Doom, Black Widow, Ant-Man, Blade, Harley Quinn, Batman and Spider-Man.</p>

		<p>Kalypso Media has revealed the next entry into the Sudden Strike series with the announcement of Sudden Strike 5, which is due to come out in 2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS. To mark this announcement, Kalypso Media has put Sudden Strike 4 on sale until Sunday 20th July, with the base game and all the DLC available for $16. An announcement trailer for Sudden Strike 5 has also been released.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sudden Strike 5 | Announcement Trailer | US" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DlNfzXuifFs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Much like the previous games in the series, Sudden Strike 5 will be set during World War 2 and maintain the real time strategy gameplay. This entry will have 25 missions in the main campaign, and give players access to 300 units, with this split between 190 vehicles and 110 infantry units. Players can also select a commander that is best suited to their strategic thinking. During play, you will be able to see the whole battlefield from above allowing for better tactical planning as you look to capture and defend key resources including headquarters and supply depots. Sudden Strike 5 will feature online PvP multiplayer too, so you can face off against other commanders to determine who has the best tactical ability.</p>
<p>For those that are interested in Sudden Strike 5, a closed beta will be taking place through which players can test the game and provide feedback to the developers ahead of the full release next year. To sign up for the Sudden Strike 5 closed beta you need to visit the official <a href="https://www.kalypsomedia.com/sudden-strike-5">Sudden Strike 5</a> website.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<p>We are no different from the ants, no we are far worse!</p>
</section><section>

<p>Arc System Works Europe has just announced that the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/hunter-x-hunters-fighting-game-delayed-until-2025-now-adding-rollback-netcode">ever-so-slightly-delayed</a> 2D fighter, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hunter_x_hunter_nen_x_impact">Hunter x Hunter: Nen x Impact</a>, releases today on Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Developed by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/browse?title=company%3Abushiroad">Bushiroad Games</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/companies/eighting">Eighting</a>, this one has got some pedigree in that Eighting has given us some well-known fighters in the past, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/naruto_clash_of_ninja">Naruto: Clash of the Ninja.</a> With Hunter x Hunter: Nen x Impact, you get down and dirty in 3v3 tag-team-styled action, which is detailed in the official press release thusly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"HUNTERxHUNTER: NENxIMPACT is a 3-on-3 fighting game based on the iconic anime and manga series HUNTERxHUNTER, written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi. In this game, players create a team of 3 characters and battle against the opposing team with a tag system: calling out their allies for an assisting attack, or for swapping characters on the fly!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those not in the loop, Hunter x Hunter is one of those incredibly long-running anime comics that's got a legion of hardcore fans, although it's not quite in the same league as the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_ball_fighterz">Dragon Ball</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/naruto_x_boruto_ultimate_ninja_storm_connections">Naruto</a> - which also get much flashier, big-budget games to boot. First printed in Weekly Shonen Jump all the way back in 1998, the manga, written and illustrated by Yoshihiro Togashi, focuses on a young boy named Gon Freecss who discovers that his father, now missing, is a world-renowned Hunter.</p>
<p>This 2D fighter uses the universe of the comics to bring some beefy-looking scraps to life. We're always down for some tag-team action, and whilst it's not going to be winning any awards for sharpest graphics, there's an interesting core combat experience here that could provide ample cover for any presentation shortcomings. Indeed, any fighters we've played from Eighting in the past have been right bangers in the mechanics department.</p>

<p>Alongside the digital edition, which is priced at £49.99 (or whatever that translates to where you are!) there's also a physical edition that comes in standard and limited edition flavours, with the limited containing the following extras:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full Game</li>
<li>Special Box</li>
<li>Artbook</li>
<li>Acrylic Stand</li>
<li>Season 1 Pass</li>
<li>Alternate Costume Pack Hisoka &amp; Kurapika</li>
</ul>

<p>This limited edition, which comes in a very nice box, will set you back £84.99.</p>
<p>Hunter x Hunter has made the news a few time already in this game form, having been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/hunter-x-hunters-fighting-game-delayed-until-2025-now-adding-rollback-netcode">delayed to add rollback net code,</a> as well as finding itself <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/new-switch-anime-fighter-due-out-in-2025-refused-classification-down-under">banned in Australia for including material deemed "inappropriate"</a>.</p>
<p>You can check out the trailer for the game at the top of this very article and, whilst it's definitely not a particular looker in comparison to some other Switch fighters, if it's got it where it counts — in the actual fighting dept. — and you're a fan of the anime already, this one could well be worth a shout.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-lawsuit-krafton-bonus</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/subnautica-2-lawsuit-revealed-as-krafton-reportedly-extends-bonus-period.1245990/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Charlie Cleveland and his fellow Unknown Worlds co-founders have released the public text of their&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>lawsuit, and it comes just as publisher Krafton reportedly extends its employee bonus period to cover 2026.</p>

<p>As a quick reminder, Krafton, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-owner-krafton-buys-subnautica-dev-unknown-worlds" rel="nofollow">the parent company</a> of&nbsp;<em>Subnautica </em>studio Unknown Worlds,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-delayed-2026" rel="nofollow">recently delayed</a>&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2</em>'s Early Access release&nbsp;into 2026. The announcement of the game's delay was made shortly after original Unknown Worlds founders Cleveland, Max McGuire, and Ted Gill were ousted from the company.</p>

<p>In response to their ousting and&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2</em>'s delay, Cleveland and his fellow co-founders <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-charlie-cleveland-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">pledged to sue Krafton</a>, claiming not only that the game was ready for Early Access but also that Krafton delayed it in order to avoid paying out a potentially large bonus to employees if a 2025 revenue target was met.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/subnautica-2-lawsuit-krafton-fish.jpg?itok=CP0P78d8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/subnautica-2-lawsuit-krafton-fish.jpg?itok=kN4gRjKy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Charlie Cleveland and company's&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>lawsuit (or, at least, the public version of it) has been released to the public.</figcaption></figure><p>Now, Cleveland has once again taken to social media in order to release a <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/889109175/Fortis-Advisors-v-Krafton-via-Aftermath" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">redacted public version</a> of the lawsuit against Krafton. It's a lengthy legal document, but in essence, Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire are suing Krafton for breach of contract with specific reference to the payout.</p>

<p>The three are alleging that Krafton deliberately delayed&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>in order to avoid paying $25 million of a $250 million bonus to Unknown Worlds employees, and that this is also why the three were dismissed from their positions at Unknown Worlds.</p>

<p>In a move that might muddy the waters somewhat, however, Krafton is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-15/krafton-extends-subnautica-2-bonus-period-is-sued-by-founders" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reportedly</a> extending the bonus payout window to cover 2026, and it's also apparently planning to advance part of the 2026 bonus pool to employees by the end of 2025.</p>

<p>If this move goes ahead, it sounds to me like it might invalidate a large part of Cleveland's claim, although I'm not a legal expert. We'll just have to wait and see what happens next, but as many lawsuits do, this process may well drag on for a while yet.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Subnautica 2&nbsp;</em>itself, it's currently due for launch on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1962700/Subnautica_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/subnautica-2/9PJPCB188SVG" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> sometime next year. Of course, there's every chance it could be delayed until 2027, in which case the aforementioned bonus extension would cease to matter, but that's too far in the future for us to meaningfully speculate on.</p>

We’ve seen the reintroduction of ex cards, the return of Trainer Pokémon, and even a new invasion from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-review-pull-rates-mewtwo-1851781001&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-review-pull-rates-mewtwo-1851781001">Team Rocket</a></span>. At the same time, we’ve also seen a <em>lot</em> of drab sets with pull-rates that ensure you’ll get <em>something</em>, while making the most desirable full-art cards near impossible to collect. Then, during fall 2024, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920">everything got out of control</a></span>. The hobby saw a new surge of interest, driven by skyrocketing prices made vastly worse by scarcity caused by scalpers, and ever since it’s been close to impossible to buy a new pack of Pokémon cards from the store without waiting in line, or engaging in a fist fight. Multiple attempts to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-available-journey-together-stock-1851772771&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-available-journey-together-stock-1851772771">thwart scalpers have failed</a></span>, and even pre-ordering a new set months in advance is now a lottery. Unless you want a pack of the entirely unloved Twilight Masquerade. Everywhere has that poor set.</p><p>It’s into this furore that the English-language’s first ever split set is launched. Black Bolt and White Flare are two overlapping sets of cards, each with their own unique Pokémon and cards, released as a so-called “special set” to finish off the <em>SV</em> generation. Except, “special set” actually means, “harder to buy for some reason,” where packs are only sold as part of collection boxes, or in Elite Trainer Boxes, with no single packs available (unless you go to a canny specialist store, that’ll strip the collection boxes down for their packs), and certainly no 36-pack booster boxes. Then, released as a split set, it’s twice as hard to collect all the cards you might want, given you not only need to be able to find any at all to buy, but you also need to be sure to get the right half of the collection. Yay?</p><h2 id="h698586"><a id=""></a>All 156 Pokémon from...Unova?</h2><p>Black Bolt and White Flare feature all 156 Pokémon from the Unova region, as featured in the 2010 <em>Pokémon Black</em> and <em>White</em> video games. Why? Gosh that’s a good question.</p><p>Obviously, if you’re a fan, you’ll know the set features fan-favorite Legendary Pokémon Zekrom and Reshiram. And then, um, oh dear. Look, if 2010 was your entry into the hobby, then I imagine the Pokémon within have a special place in your heart. But looking back across all the new monsters, it’s surely by far the worst. Filled with deeply unimaginative creatures, like three different evolutions based on flipping ice cream and a second pigeon-based pocket monster, I struggle to muster passion for such a derivative set. Oh, and it also forced Pansear, Pansage and Panpour on us, three creepy-faced monkey-things in a game that was already just fine with Aipom. (Simisear, the evolution of Pansear, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/latest/2016/6/17/unpopular-pokmon-launches-pr-campaign-to-improve-image&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/latest/2016/6/17/unpopular-pokmon-launches-pr-campaign-to-improve-image" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was once voted the least popular Pokémon</a></span>, ever.)</p><p>This means it’s not easy to get worked up about seeing the set get celebrated here, especially when—and italicized all-caps is really the only option here—<em>THIS IS THE LAST SET FROM SCARLET &amp; VIOLET</em>. Maybe celebrate that set?

Pull rates are tricky to convey at this point, because  Black Bolt and White Flare are packed with so many twiddly extras that you’ll inevitably get <em>something</em> out of a couple of packs. Because, oh my, there are so many variants here.</p><p>There are new holo Energy cards that show up pretty frequently, and then the most egregious array of reverse holo versions of every card. So, for every Basic Pokémon (the ones with the small window art on the top half), there are <em>four</em> different versions. The regular, the standard reverse holo, then a Poké Ball holo pattern, and <em>then</em> a Master Ball holo pattern. This means to complete a master set, you’ll need to collect a ridiculous 800 cards, and also be a billionaire scalper who lives in a Pokémon card factory.</p><h2 id="h698587"><a id=""></a>What about pull rates?</h2><p>To give you an idea from my unscientifically small sample of 35 packs (very kindly supplied by The Pokémon Company, and roughly half Black and half White) I pulled a gratifying seven full-art cards (six Illustration Rares, one Ultra Rare full-art Trainer), four standard ex cards, eight holo Energies, 14 Poké Ball holos, and one Master Ball holo. And written down, that might sound like a really impressive haul. But given just how common Poké Ball variants clearly are, they immediately didn’t feel special, and the Energies are much the same, while ex cards have been bland throughout the last three years. So, it’s really only those seven full-arts and the Master Ball that felt like special pulls. Still, eight out 35 is vastly better than we’ve seen from other sets, and not to be sniffed at.</p><p>The other side, however, is that this meant I didn’t see a single Special Illustration Rare at all, from either Black Bolt or White Flare, meaning those 18 valuable cards must be incredibly tough to find. Obviously I could have just gotten unlucky, but if they’re really fewer than one in 30 or so, that’s going to be grim.</p><p>The collection sets themselves are pretty nice. The poster collection’s poster is just <em>enormous</em>, while the binder collections come with a top-quality 3x3 side-loading binder, featuring either Reshiram or Zekrom. ETBs have nine packs of either Black or White, depending on the box, while the two-pack mini tins have one of each. As ever with Pokémon, everything is super-good quality, none of the extras feeling like tat.</p><figure id="" data-id="d6cca7a72cc1d603d025be40d82cd6f6" data-recommend-id="image://d6cca7a72cc1d603d025be40d82cd6f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The black Zekrom card everyone will want." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The black Zekrom card everyone will want." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d6cca7a72cc1d603d025be40d82cd6f6" data-recommend-id="image://d6cca7a72cc1d603d025be40d82cd6f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The black Zekrom card everyone will want." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But, you know, I’m left feeling a lot of anticlimax. Is that really it for <em>Scarlet &amp; Violet</em>? Does it not even go out with a whimper, but not even starring in its own branded packs?! (This is, after all, “Scarlet &amp; Violet: Black Bolt”.) Also, was that it for Trainer Pokémon? We had the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-review-pull-rates-iono-1851772464&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-review-pull-rates-iono-1851772464">awful Journey Together set</a></span>, followed by the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-review-pull-rates-mewtwo-1851781001&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-review-pull-rates-mewtwo-1851781001">fantastic Destined Rivals</a></span>, and then...they’re all gone.

I do hope so. But if not, then Black Bolt and White Flare is a pretty naff way to end things. If you can find it, you’ll likely pull something glittery out of it, but given it’ll be a Unovan Pokémon, won’t add anything radical to the table-top game, and is extremely unlikely to be rare, it’s hard to get all that excited. The sets are available from Friday, July 18.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/black-bolt-white-flare-pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-1851786465]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The battlefield just got a whole lot bigger. <em>Off The Grid</em> officially launched on Steam today, meaning players of the cyberpunk battle royale game can now compete across devices to be the last avatar standing.</p><p>Set in a dystopian universe crafted by Hollywood filmmaker Neill Blomkamp—who directed <em>District 9</em>, <em>Elysium</em>, <em>Gran Turismo</em>, and more—<em>Off The Grid</em> was initially released for early access back in October of last year. The free-to-play title has steadily gained popularity since that time, thanks to its fluid third-person shooter gameplay, vast array of looting possibilities, and consistent, thoughtfully crafted updates that keep the in-game experience fresh. Players are especially drawn to <em>Off The Grid</em>’s unique mechanic of switchable cyberlimbs, which grant special abilities and make each session feel completely different from the last. These cyberlimbs can be looted from the map, stolen from other players, or purchased through the player-to-player marketplace, offering a wide range of distinctive abilities and customization options.</p><p>“Every major step forward has been shaped by player feedback,” stated Vlad Korolov, the CEO and Co-Founder of Gunzilla Games. “This launch is a celebration of that collaboration, and it’s only the beginning.”</p><p>Founded in 2020, Gunzilla Games is an independent AAA video game developer that has continued to emphasize innovation and a “gamer-first ecosystem” that “pushes the limits of the games” industry. With <em>Off The Grid, </em>their first and primary title, Gunzilla seeks to bend and reshape the battle royale genre in bold, unexpected ways.</p><p>Unlike traditional battle royales, <em>Off The Grid</em> leans deeply into narrative depth. Players complete PvE missions within a PvP environment, so they might find themselves competing with—or against—others while pursuing their own objectives. This adds unpredictability and strategy beyond what’s offered with the standard shrinking-map formula. The result is a living, breathing world where actions have consequences for other online players, and no two sessions feel quite the same.</p><p>Meanwhile, the community “strands” that constitute the game’s DNA are reflected in frequent enhancements centered around performance, expanded maps, new swappable cybernetic limbs and weapons, and all-new game modes. Deathmatch and Solo Mode, for example, are designed to challenge different playstyles and encourage experimentation and creativity.</p><p>On Steam, <em>Off The Grid</em> is now available to the platform’s more than 130 million active users from every corner of the gaming universe, as it enables seamless cross-play among PC, Xbox, and PS5 gamers.</p><p>“Bringing <em>Off The Grid</em> to Steam is a major milestone for us,” said Korolov. “Not just because of the platform’s reach, but because it allows us to welcome an entirely new wave of players into [the] game.”</p><p>Steam’s powerful community integration tools align with Gunzilla’s aims for <em>Off The Grid</em>. From digital forums and user-generated guides to live broadcasts and support functions, the platform fosters a deeper, more meaningful level of engagement between developers and players. It also allows Gunzilla to gather instant feedback, monitor technical issues, and deploy improvements quickly, helping the team respond to user needs faster and keep the game evolving smoothly. That kind of real-time connection will be invaluable.</p><p>An additional benefit of <em>Off The Grid</em>’s presence on Steam is that the platform’s auto-update capabilities ensure that players stay synced with the latest builds. In effect, there are no patches, software updates, or downloads to chase, creating a hassle-free experience.</p><p>The cyborgs are calling. Whether you’re a first-time player or a seasoned veteran, get plugged in and go <em>Off The Grid</em>. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/off-the-grid-steam-neill-blomkamp-game-1851786461]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Ousted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> studio founder Charlie Cleveland has hit back at claims made by former employer Krafton in a newly unsealed court document, accusing the publisher of deliberately hindering the Subnautica 2 project in order to avoid paying out a $250m bonus.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this month, Krafton announced Cleveland - alongside chief executive officer Ted Gill and special projects director Max McGuire - had all <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-studio-leadership-replaced-by-krafton-despite-looming-early-access">departed Subnautica studio Unknown Worlds</a>, but insisted it had "sought to keep the... co-founders and original creators of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> series involved in the game's development". Shortly after, though, it was claimed the team had been "pushed out", and that the move was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-delayed-by-publisher-krafton-just-months-before-alleged-250m-payout-to-developers">part of a plan by Krafton to avoid paying out a $250m bonus</a> for the development team.
</p>
<p>
The report was followed by a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-delayed-by-publisher-krafton-just-months-before-alleged-250m-payout-to-developers">delay for Subnautica 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-drama-escalates-ousted-developers-launch-legal-action-as-krafton-accuses-them-of-abandoning-project">Krafton's own statement</a>, insisting Unknown Worlds' leadership team had "abandoned" their responsibilities. Specifically, the publisher said it had "asked [Cleveland] to devote himself to... Subnautica 2" but, "instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project".

<p>
However, as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-16/-subnautica-2-leaders-say-krafton-sabotaged-game-over-payout">reported by Bloomberg</a>, a lawsuit against Krafton, filed for breach of contract by Unknown Worlds' former leadership team, claims that Cleveland was, in fact, working on a Subnautica movie the publisher is said to have specifically asked the studio to develop. Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier later <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lu4as2noxc2b">noted on social media</a> that "Cleveland was also working on some sort of AI Christmas film, which Krafton was likely referring to. They just didn't mention the Subnautica film part of it."
</p>
<p>
As for the $250m bonus that increasingly appears to be at the centre of Krafton's fallout with the former leadership team, the lawsuit alleges things began to turn sour in early 2025, when Gill started negotiating bonuses for employees who weren't eligible under the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-company-krafton-buys-subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds">acquisition</a> terms. In one part of the complaint reviewed by Bloomberg, it's claimed: "After Krafton's leaders reviewed Gill's projections and evaluated the anticipated revenue and earnout numbers, everything changed."

It's alleged the combination of Subnautica's release on mobile and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, alongside the impending early access launch of Subnautica 2, meant the studio was now presenting Krafton with revenue projections significantly higher than Unknown Worlds' initial conservative estimates. It's claimed this is the point Krafton began pushing to delay Subnautica 2 into 2026, halted its publishing duties - including marketing and localisation - and refused to support Subnautica 2's planned summer release.
</p>
<p>
The lawsuit also alleges a senior Krafton executive told Gill "pulling these resources was a permissible way for [the company] to avoid supporting the earnout", and that Krafton later asked Unknown Worlds' leadership to accept a lower sum. It's around this time Krafton head Changhan Kim is alleged to have written to Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire describing Subnautica 2's progress as "slow and underwhelming", and accusing them of "failing to fulfil [their] responsibilities". This is despite the complaint's claim that pre-release tests for Subnautica 2 "drew high marks and confirmed that the game was ready to meet... lofty expectations."
</p>
<p>
According to Bloomberg, Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire are now seeking damages "in an amount to be determined at trial" following their termination.
</p>
<p>
All this comes after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-latest-subnautica-2-twist-krafton-confirms-this-leaked-internal-review-document-is-real">mysterious leak of an internal Krafton review document</a> this weekend, claiming Subnautica 2's planned early access release lacked "the freshness and volume expected of a sequel", and fell "short of meeting... high expectations". Almost immediately after, Krafton took the unusual step of announcing, unprompted, that the document was real, claiming that doing so would 'minimise speculation and ensure accurate communication with players'. It seems likely we'll hear again from Krafton soon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Obsidian’s gorgeous fantasy RPG <em>Avowed</em> just got a new patch, promising the usual list of bug fixes and some new features. The game is also now “Verified” for Steam Deck. What’s it like in a portable form factor? Well, it certainly boots up. It’s certainly <em>playable</em>, hitting a semi-decent 30 FPS that doesn’t necessarily feel <em>that</em> terrible to play. How it looks on Valve’s handheld PC, however, is another story. Have a seat, let’s talk about it. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196447,196663" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Set in an imaginative world with all the trappings of lush forests and pretty, sparkly magical effects, <em>Avowed</em> may not be aiming to be the most graphically impressive title out there, but it sure is a looker.

Distant objects look really messy, splotchy, shimmery, and sometimes pixel-art adjacent—in fact, it sorta reminds me of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/bVw1Mpb0QFo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/bVw1Mpb0QFo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">playing that <em>Oblivion</em> quest</a></span> where you’re stuck in a painting. It hovers at a 30-40 FPS status, which isn’t too bad, but the odd visuals, I think, actually make me play worse (I’m also used to playing this game on mouse and keyboard, not the gamepad layout of the Steam Deck, to be clear).</p><p>Yes, it will sorta settle down at times when rendering and FSR3 catch up, but it’s still not great. And the second you move, distant options look all crunchy and shitty again.</p><h2 id="h697896"><a id=""></a>What about the new class options and other features?</h2><p>I’ve been playing on the hardest difficulty in <em>Avowed</em> with a ranger-ish build that primarily uses rifles. Surprisingly, it feels like playing a first-person shooter more than something like <em>Fallout 4</em> did. My brain is sorta in <em>Doom</em> mode when I’m playing. While the game put up a tough fight early on, I eventually reached a certain level of power where I was annihilating everything. I’m also doing every quest and finding everything on every map, so my character has a lot of experience invested in her stats.</p><p>The fighter and ranger got new active and passive abilities. And the update refunded everyone’s skill points, so you can already get to trying out new builds. From the looks of things, this is only going to make me more unstoppable than I already am. The “Sharpshooter” ranger passive looks like it will make my pretty sweet rifle even deadlier. That said, abilities like “Shadow Step,” a previously NPC-exclusive ability that lets you vanish and appear behind your target, feel a little redundant since I can already go invisible. </p><p>I’m going to need to mix and match these new abilities for a while to judge just how transformative they are for a game I didn’t find that challenging anyway. So maybe I’m not the best judge of how helpful the new build options are. I’ll get back to you if something really blows my mind. You can read all the nitty gritty details of the patch, which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134877-patch-15-notes/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134877-patch-15-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">includes some new weapons and attire, here.</a></span></p><p>Anyway, <em>Avowed</em> rocks. It’s a serious contender for GOTY in my book—just don’t play it running natively on Steam Deck if you can help it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The credits for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> have shined a light on the game's voice cast, including one actor who is reprising his role from the Japanese dub of Super Mario Bros. Movie.</p>
<p><strong>Please be aware of cast spoilers for Donkey Kong Bananza below.</strong></p>

<p>Donkey Kong's emotive grunts and the like in Donkey Kong Bananza are all voiced by Kouji Takeda, who is credited as the game's main character in all of its various language options (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-credits-confirm-dks-new-voice-actor-and-theres-a-fresh-voice-for-pauline-too">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>If you think that name sounds familiar, that's because Takeda has also provided the voice of Donkey Kong in the Japanese dub of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, as well as the Japanese voice of Daruk in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, to name just two.</p>
<p>Takeda also voiced Nintendo's leading ape in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, replacing Takashi Nagasako, who previously voiced Donkey Kong for over two decades. And, DK isn't the only character with a new voice for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> era. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/princess-peach-voice-actor-confirms-shes-been-replaced-after-18-years-in-the-role">Samantha Kelly confirmed she'd been recast as the voice of Princess Peach and Toad after 18 years</a>.</p>
<p>As for Bananza's other lead, Pauline, she is voiced by Jenny Kidd for the English version. The character in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> is voiced by Kate Higgins, however in the Switch platformer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-wont-confirm-donkey-kongs-age-in-new-game-as-its-good-fodder-for-player-theories">Pauline is significantly older than in Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/mini-review-tomtoc-fancycase-g05-for-switch-2-a-slim-case-that-nails-the-fundamentals</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Sometimes simplicity is key, and when such simplicity is available for a decent price (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DT46HMRB?th=1&amp;tag=nlife-20" rel="sponsored noopener">$36.99 on Amazon</a> at the moment), that’s an even sweeter peach to sink your teeth into. Don’t bite the tomtoc FancyCase G05, mind you, although in all likelihood you wouldn’t do any damage to the console inside.</p>
<p>Yes, it might look simple from the outside (and it is), but this little case is well worth a look if you want to keep your Switch 2 console safe. The first thing you’ll notice is that this is a <em>slim</em> case. There’s very little wasted space at all, and when a gap is present, it’s for a good reason. There are even raised areas in the top in which your Joy-Con sticks can safely nestle themselves.</p>
<p>The exterior of the case is <em>reasonably</em> hard. I mean, it’s got a little bit of give to it, but in all honesty that’s not a bad thing, as it should help absorb any impact force from when you inevitably drop your console whilst waiting at the bus stop. Butterfingers.</p>
<p>There’s a handle at the top as well, which can double as a wrist strap should you want to use it. We’re not entirely sure why you would, but I suppose if it’s strapped to you directly you’re less likely to drop it whilst waiting at the bus stop.</p>

<p>Inside, the plush, velvet-like lining provides a nice little bit of cushioning for your device, including an extra bit of padding to make sure your shoulder buttons have adequate clearance, and the classic flap that folds over the screen also homes some elasticated slots in which you can store your games.</p>
<p>As a small bonus, mine even came with a few little dummy cards made of… well, card, that say ‘Name’ and ‘Contact’ on each side. Keep one of these in your case and should you lose it, whoever finds it should be able to get in touch with you. Assuming they’re honest, naturally.</p>
<p>All things considered, there’s not much to say about this case, but that’s a <em>good</em> thing. There’s nothing exceptional about it, but it gets the fundamentals absolutely bang-on. It’s the functional option, and that is no bad thing.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-likely-24gb-ram/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-6-likely-to-feature-24-gb-ram-for-advanced-ray-tracing-and-machine-learning-without-raising-costs.1245924/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 6 is expected to feature more RAM than the 16 GB RAM of the PlayStation 5 and the PlayStation 5 Pro, but the tech experts at Digital Foundry don't think the next-generation system will have much more RAM than the current systems for several reasons.</p>



<p>Replying to a supporter's question during their weekly podcast, the known tech-experts commented on how much RAM the next-generation systems should be expected to have, starting with the PlayStation 6. Given what already can be achieved with 16 GB and how we are already hitting limits in regards to textures and art assets, 24 GB of RAM sounds reasonable, as the extra RAM over the current systems will be needed for machine learning and the more advanced ray tracing that's already been teased as part of the future of PlayStation. Additionally, the cost of DRAM is high and hasn't seen any significant drop in the past few years, so this will undoubtedly be a limiting factor. Also, if the rumored PlayStation handheld is real, it will likely come with 16 GB of RAM, making 24 GB RAM a more sensible choice for the home system if developers are supposed to target both systems with their games.</p>



<p>With the next Xbox, however, predictions are a little harder to make, as Microsoft may decide to go in a different direction and not compete directly with the PlayStation 6 with their next-gen system, but with pre-built PCs. As such, a premium system could easily have a bigger APU and more RAM than Sony's system. According to Digital Foundry, studies were done at Microsoft some time ago looking into the possibility of launching a "PC-in-a-box" rather than a lead console, highlighting how costs escalated dramatically, making such a system not an enticing option in the console space. In the pre-built PCs space, however, there's a price gap between the cheapest systems and consoles that such a system could fill, so the possibility is definitely there to launch a "PC-in-a-box" with better specs than Sony's next-gen system.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Though Sony is expected to launch a PlayStation 6 in the next few years, it will be much more interesting to see if the rumored PlayStation handheld is launching alongside the traditional home console. This system is said to be able to run<a href="https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-ps5-games-patch/"> PlayStation 5 games natively</a> and will be more powerful than the<a href="https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-more-powerful-xbox-series-s/"> Xbox Series S.</a></p>

		<p>EA has taken a slightly different approach this year for its EA Sports FC 26 reveal trailer. Instead of just having footballers running around and playing the beautiful game, this reveal trailer addresses player complaints about the previous entries to the series and how FC 26 is looking to improve them. Of course, there are still the big name stars present in the trailer including Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Jude Bellingham, and Jamal Musiala.</p>
<p><iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 26 | Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TSi0iJYSQ24?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“FC 26 reflects our ongoing commitment to building this game with and for our community,”</em> said John Shepherd, VP &amp; GM, EA SPORTS FC. <em>“We are players too, and that shared passion drives everything we do. This year brings an overhauled gameplay experience, new Tournaments and Live Events in FUT, all-new Archetype customization in Clubs, and a Career Mode that comes alive through evolving Challenges. We can’t wait for players to feel the difference this September and help shape the future of FC.”&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Let’s dive into some of these changes coming to EA Sports FC 26 a bit more, beginning with the Archetypes system. The Archetypes system will be part of Clubs and Player Career, with it being a class system. As part of Archetypes you will be able to unlock and develop different attributes, along with Archetype perks that provide additional bonuses. These perks are based on some of the best players in football. The gameplay is getting overhauled again to make things more fluid and responsive, with examples being better dribbling, improved goalkeeper reactions, better ball behaviour, more fluid passing, and better off the ball player movement and interactions. As part of the overhaul Competitive Gameplay and Authentic Gameplay presets will be available to choose from. Competitive Gameplay is aimed for the multiplayer parts of FC 26 including Clubs and Ultimate Team, while the Authentic preset is more for single player modes like career.</p>
<p>Manager Career is being changed for this release too with the introduction of Manager Live. Manager Live will introduce various challenges into the manager career mode, and there will be new scenarios introduced that are based upon real world football events. In Ultimate Team, there will be new live events and tournaments to take part in. Rivals and Champs will also be given updates too. Finally, EA has confirmed FC 26 will include over 35 leagues, over 750 teams across clubs and international, 120 stadiums, and over 20,000 footballers.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/ea-sports-fc-25-review/">EA Sports FC 25 Review</a></h2>
<p>In our EA Sports FC 25 review, I said, <em>“EA Sports FC 25 is a slightly better offering than FC 24, thanks to the new Rush mode. FC IQ is still in its early stages and while it could have a huge impact on future titles, it is not yet very apparent how it is impacting the on the pitch action in this game. This is the EA Sports FC as you already know it. Whether that is a good or bad thing is up to you.”</em></p>
<p>EA Sports FC 26 is set to be released on September 26th, though those who buy the Ulitmate Edition will get access from September 19th. The game will be available on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series XS, Xbox One, Switch, and Amazon Luna.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Roblox is introducing a way to let trusted friends chat more freely among themselves, but it will require that they use a new age estimation tool to verify that they’re over 13.</p><p>The platform is renaming Friends to Connections, and people can only use unfiltered text chat and the <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/12/join-the-party-on-roblox">Party social feature</a> with a more exclusive group of “Trusted Connections.” The new age estimator tool prompts users to take a video selfie, “which is analyzed against a large and diverse dataset to estimate their age,” according to <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/07/advancing-safety-on-roblox-with-age-based-commu%20nication">a blog post</a> from chief safety officer Matt Kaufman.</p><p>“If the system is not able to estimate the user’s age with high confidence, then the user’s age will remain unconfirmed and the user won’t be able to access Trusted Connections,” Kaufman says. If a user doesn’t pass the age estimation tool but they are actually over 13, they will be able to confirm their age via <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/4407282410644-Age-ID-Verification">ID verification</a> “and, in the future, verified parental consent.”</p><p>Roblox partnered with identity verification company Persona on the age estimation technology, Roblox’s Ryan Ebanks said in a call with reporters, and he says biometric data will be deleted 30 days after collection “except for a few exceptions where legally required.” Persona is “providing the core age estimation and ID verification services to Roblox,” spokesperson Juliet Chaitin-Lefcourt tells <em>The Verge</em>, and “Persona’s model is integrated into the Roblox app with additional UI and logic that has been customized by Roblox.”</p><p>Users 13 through 17 who have their age confirmed will be able to add each other as Trusted Connections. Teens will only be able to add someone older than 18 as a Trusted Connection if they know them in real life, Kaufman says, and they can do that by scanning a QR code in person or using <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/7416652004884-Letting-Friends-Find-You-on-Roblox-with-Contact-Importer">Roblox’s Contact Importer feature</a>.</p><p>Although chats with Trusted Connections can be unfiltered, Roblox will monitor the conversations for “critical harm.”</p><p>“This includes, but isn’t limited to, any predatory behavior aimed at manipulating or harming minors, the sexualization of minors, engaging in inappropriate sexual conversations with or requesting sexual content, and any involvement with child sexual abuse material,” Chaitin-Lefcourt says.</p><p>Last year, a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/?srnd=undefined"><em>Bloomberg</em> report</a> highlighted issues with predators on the platform, and the company introduced safety tools like letting parents <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641167/roblox-parental-controls-block-friends-experiences">block and report</a> people on their child’s friend list and has banned kids under 13 from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289837/roblox-banning-preteens-social-hangout-spaces">accessing “social hangout” spaces</a>. Age verification has growing momentum behind it — platforms like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/704468/bluesky-age-verification-uk-online-safety-act">Bluesky</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/707125/reddit-age-verification-uk-online-safety">Reddit</a> also recently rolled out age verification tools in the UK to comply with the Online Safety Act, and the EU is testing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/699151/eu-age-verification-app-dsa-enforcement">a prototype age verification app</a>.</p><p>Roblox is also introducing new features intended to support users’ well-being. A new option will let people control who sees whether they’re online. (Before, they could only hide which experience they were in.) Users can also set a Do Not Disturb timeframe to silence Roblox’s push notifications, and teens will be able to set their own screentime limits (a feature previously limited to parents).</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/708670/roblox-trusted-connections-age-estimation-privacy]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Julian LeFay, the father of The Elder Scrolls series, is leaving the video games industry following a terminal cancer diagnosis.</p>



<p><span>In a new message shared on YouTube, Victor Villarreal</span>, Creative Producer of The Wayward Realms, and<span> Ted Peterson,</span> co-founder of OnceLost Games confirmed that the father of one of the most popular RPG series still running today is leaving the gaming industry due to a terminal cancer diagnosis. The heartfelt message goes over how the two met, their work on The Elder Scrolls series, and how development of their new game continued even as Julian LeFay was battling cancer courageously, documenting his vision and concepts well to ensure the team was left with the resources needed to complete the game even beyond its Early Access build. We extend our best wishes to Julian LeFay and his loved ones, and our deepest respect to his legacy, which will not be forgotten by anyone who experienced the games he has worked on.</p>

<p>Julian LeFay joined Bethesda shortly after the company's creation in 1987, holding the role of Chief Engineer for many years before quitting the company for good in 1998. Among the games he has worked on, as already mentioned, are the first entries in The Elder Scrolls series, Arena and Daggerfall, as well as Battlespire. He also worked on the third entry in the series, Morrowind, as a contractor before leaving Bethesda. In 2019, he co-founded OnceLost Games with Ted Peterson, whose first game, The Wayward Realms, is a spiritual successor to Daggerfall.</p>

The pair gave <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-creators-reveal-how-accidental-plagiarism-was-part-of-its-origin-story">a talk together at 2024's GDC</a> delving into those early days at Bethesda, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-daggerfall-developers-reveal-a-teaser-for-their-open-world-rpg">the RPG</a> they've been working on at OnceLost since 2019 is very much aiming to recapture Daggerfall's vibes.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>OnceLost Games <a href="https://x.com/OnceLostGames/status/1945643058336600200">shared the news</a> of LeFay stepping away via a statement from Peterson and a YouTube video from Wayward Realms creative producer Victor Villarreal.</p>
<p>"Julian has been courageously battling cancer," reads Peterson's statement, "His doctors have informed us that his time with us is limited, and we are preparing to say goodbye to a true legend of the industry." It continues as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even in the face of this challenge, Julian’s dedication to The Wayward Realms and to all of you, our community, has never wavered. He has worked tirelessly to ensure that his vision for “The Grand RPG” will live on, but now Julian must step away from OnceLost Games for his health and to live his final moments surrounded by his loved ones.</p>
<p>Julian has complete faith in the ability of the team to bring the game he has envisioned to life for this incredible community. Anticipating this possibility, Julian has documented his vision and concepts well, ensuring the team is left with the resources needed to complete the game. The full game, beyond the Early Access build.</p>
<p>During this difficult time, we invite you to share your thoughts, prayers, well wishes, memories, or the impact Julian’s life and work have had on you. Your words of support mean more than you know, not just to Julian, but to all of us who have been privileged to work alongside him.</p></blockquote>

<p>Peterson closed out the statement by sharing something LeFay said during the most recent OnceLost team meeting he attended: "It is personal. And if it’s not personal, then you’re just doing work for hire and you’ll never have the motivation to accomplish a significant goal.”</p>
<p>As the team intended, the comments on the video are filling up with folks wishing LeFay well and sharing how his work's touched their lives. Villarreal reiterated that this is an eventuality OnceLost have been preparing for, and while LeFay's understandably their focus right now, they'll share "more details on how it affects the projects" in the future.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-elder-scrolls-developer-julian-lefay-steps-away-from-his-daggerfall-esque-the-wayward-realms-as-cancer-worsens]]></content:encoded>

Next year’s <em>Hoppers</em> has just released its first trailer, and it shows what looks like a delightful talk-to-the-animals movie. But will it be enough to rescue the studio after <em>Elio</em>’s box office bombing?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196406" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196406,197586,197589" data-current="196406"><div><p>Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21954.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I hope so! And from this first lighthearted teaser trailer (although, given this plays out like a regular trailer, I don’t think the word “teaser” has any meaning left at all), it sure looks like it deserves success. Pixar certainly thrives when it comes to meatier discourse, exploring complex emotions and relationships, but it’s hard to argue against the studio aiming for a more broad comedy.</p><p>The premise—a group of scientists create a device that allows a human mind to inhabit a mechanical animal so as to blend in and learn about their culture—is so blatantly lifted from <em>Avatar</em> that the opening of the teaser just flat-out acknowledges it. However, subject Mabel Tanaka gets into the body of a beaver and then refuses to leave, in order to help the local creatures battle an evil construction company set to destroy the local habitat.</p><p>The two-minute trailer shows lots of fun observation humor about animal life, based on Mabel’s sudden ability to understand what the other creatures are saying. It’s the sort of goofball territory I feel Pixar hasn’t reveled in since the days of <em>A Bug’s Life</em>, and I’m very happy to see it happening. However, I’m also pretty aware that this is perhaps considered Dreamworks’ territory—the rival animation house dominates the field with its <em>Madagascar</em> and <em>Kung Fu Panda</em> franchises, and even the brief life of <em>Over the Hedge</em>. It’ll be interesting to see how that works out.</p><p><em>Hoppers</em> isn’t quite Pixars last chance—Enrico Casarosa’s (<em>Luca</em>) next animated feature <em>Gatto</em> is due for early summer 2027, featuring a black cat called Nero who befriends a Venetian graffiti artist while attempting to escape from the feline mob. That’s <em>quite</em> the pitch. <em>Luca</em>, sent straight to Disney+ during the pandemic, became a sleeper hit with a massive fanbase, so if Disney can figure out how to market <em>Gatto</em> to that audience—i.e. market it as if it were a sequel—it could fly.</p><p>Otherwise, it <em>is</em> just sequels. Pixar’s upcoming roster for the next few years includes <em>Toy Story 5</em>, <em>Incredibles 3</em>, and <em>Coco 2</em>, with <em>Inside Out 3</em> all but inevitable. But the reality is, their top-grossing movies all have at least a “2” in the title, with no original property ever hitting the all-important $1bn box office. However, the wise person might want to point out you cannot ever have any of those billion dollar sequels if you don’t have the first movie first! Hopefully someone at Disney can recognize this—even if <em>Hoppers</em> isn’t the all-consuming megahit they way, <em>Hoppers 2</em> very well could be.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/hoppers-trailer-pixar-animation-teaser-inside-out-2-1851786456]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The alleged risk of using a well-known <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> exploit is causing widespread confusion among the game's community, fuelled by a dire warning from a senior player that supposedly originates from the app's own development team.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Said warning states that Pokémon Go's developers are aware of the exploit in question — which allows users to interact with in-game locations from further away than normally possible — and consider it "a violation of the Terms of Service of the game." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Continued use of the exploit is detectable by the developer's anti-cheat teams, the warning goes on to claim, and risks users' accounts being flagged for cheating — an offense that can eventually result in a permanent account ban. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The appearance of this message, and the claim it is being passed on from Pokémon Go's makers, has sparked a firestorm of debate, primarily over the rights and (mostly) wrongs of this exploit being viewed as cheating in the same vein as more nefarious tactics. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many players have said that this "trick" simply makes use of a unintended bug in how the game functions, and is not comparable to the tools some players use to actively break the game, such as by using third-party apps and hacks to spoof their location.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also a debate over the veracity of the message itself — both over its origins, which appear to be from a senior player marked as a Community Ambassador who has spoken to the game's developers, and over the likely intent behind what was said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To understand the nuances here, it's worth taking a look at the issue in more detail. At a base level, the exploit allows players to access a raid lobby slightly beyond their normal interaction radius via a Daily or Premium Raid Pass, rather than by using a more expensive Remote Raid Pass. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Performing the exploit — referred to locally among players as "flying," "floating," or "tricking" — is clearly not intended behavior, but can hardly be considered game-breaking. Accessing a raid lobby that's less than 100m away but slightly out of your normal range is considered by many players to simply be a convenience — and potentially an aid to taking part in more raids overall, even if this is done so without the top-tier Remote Raid Pass. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, a simple glance at the game's Terms of Service (TOS) shows that, according to the letter of the law, this could indeed fall under the game's description of cheating as it stands. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN contacted the Pokémon Go development team to ask about the origins of the warning, whether the exploit was indeed considered cheating, and what actions players might expect if they continued to use it. In response, a spokesperson pointed us back to the game's <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/terms" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TOS document</a>, and specifically its section on cheating, which we'll quote below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, it's entirely possible to see how this exploit <em>could </em>fall under the TOS' definition of using "techniques to alter or falsify a device's location" and therefore — again, according to the letter of the law — is something that <em>could </em>be considered cheating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But by pointing IGN back to its TOS, the Pokémon Go development team is also — deliberately or not — highlighting something potentially crucial around this issue's enforcement. And that's the fact that, once again, according to the letter of the law, playing with multiple accounts is <em>also </em>considered cheating — despite it being something that a percentage of the game's playerbase does, with absolutely zero infraction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What this may all ultimately boil down to is someone purportedly asking the Pokémon Go development team for its view on an issue that the game's makers would obviously never sanction, but which seems unlikely to suddenly result in waves of players being banned. And yet, because of the murky origins of the warning, and because nuance can be difficult when messages get passed over the internet, players have now been left aggrieved and concerned.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will the exploit stick around in the game forever? It seems unlikely. Will players suddenly find themselves banned for using it while it's still possible? This seems unlikely too. But, we should state, this is just one reading of the situation, in lieu of any formal statement being provided — something which, if formalised, would likely only prompt the need for actual enforecement, which the majority of players seem to be against.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Movie</a>, now appears to have taken over as the video game voice of Donkey Kong as well, unifying the ape's grunts across mediums. This was something that was previously speculated — though not confirmed — when his name popped up in the credits of Switch 2 launch title Mario Kart World, while DK's previous veteran voice actor did not.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Eagled-eyed Nintendo fans noted that Takashi Nagasako, who previously voiced Donkey Kong for 21 years, was no longer credited for the character as of Mario Kart World. At the time, this was discussed as likely yet another change by Nintendo of its long-term voice acting cast, following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/princess-peach-and-toads-veteran-voice-actor-says-nintendo-told-her-shed-been-replaced-on-switch-2-launch-day-as-mario-kart-world-released-without-her-in-it">the replacement of Princess Peach and Toad actress Samantha Kelly</a> after 18 years and more than 70 games, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-charles-martinet-is-not-involved-in-super-mario-bros-wonder">retirement of Charles Martinet as the voice of Mario, Luigi, Wario and Waluigi</a> after almost 30 years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bananza's credits also reveal a new voice for Pauline, with actress and musician Jenny Kidd now voicing the character for its English dub. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Super Mario Odyssey, Pauline is voiced by Kate Higgins, who also sings the game's theme song Jump Up, Super Star! But perhaps this change is to be expected — after all, Bananza's Pauline is now a younger, 13-year-old incarnation.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Donkey Kong Bananza Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have some interesting theories around this version of Pauline being a precursor to the character we see in Odyssey, something that would make Bananza a prequel — and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-wont-say-why-donkey-kong-bananzas-pauline-is-13-years-old-specifically-wants-players-to-puzzle-out-the-answer-themselves">we even asked the game's development team for their take</a>. But to say more, for now, would venture into spoiler territory — something that's best left avoided until you play the game for yourself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Intrigued?

            <p>Sega has announced its forthcoming Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds release will have the full game on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> card, unlike many other third-party titles on Nintendo's new console.</p>
<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is set for release across other consoles and PC in September, including the original Switch. The Switch 2 version will arrive digitally during this year's holiday season, with the physical version launching "early 2026".</p>
<p>Many third-party publishers have drawn ire from players for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-most-switch-2-third-party-physical-releases-dont-have-the-game-on-the-card">using Nintendo's game-key cards for Switch 2 games</a> - essentially containing a download key instead of the full game. That includes Sega's already-released Sonic x Shadow Generations.</p>

<p>With Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, though, the company has u-turned. "The physical version will feature the full base game on the cartridge," it said in a press release.</p>
<p>The game will cost £64.99 on Switch 2 for the standard edition, and £79.99 for the digital deluxe edition. That compares to £54.99 on the original Switch.</p>
<p>There will also be an upgrade pack for original Switch users, which will carry over progression to the Switch 2 version. An <a href="https://www.sega.com/news/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-faq">FAQ</a> on the game's website states this will be $10 (Eurogamer has asked for clarification on UK pricing), matching the difference between the consoles.</p>
<p>The news was shared along with a new trailer for the game, showing off its customisation options. Players will be able to tweak their vehicles to amend stats and weapon combos (known as gadgets), with Sega boasting over 70,000 unique combinations will be possible.</p>
<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will release across PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC and original Switch on 25th September. The game's unique gimmick allows players to choose how tracks morph into others across each lap, hence its title. That extends to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hatsune-miku-personas-joker-and-minecrafts-steve-join-the-roster-for-sonic-crossworlds">crossovers with other characters</a>, including Joker from Persona 5 and Ichiban from the Like A Dragon games, as well as vocaloid artist Hatsune Miku and Steve from Minecraft.</p>
<p>Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson stated the game "might be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-might-be-the-most-mechanically-rich-kart-racer-ever-made-hands-on">most mechanically rich kart racer ever made</a>" after going hands-on.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-will-buck-third-party-switch-2-trend-with-full-game-on-card]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Plenty of toilet humour"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Art of Play, Boat Rocker Media, and the BBC have announced a new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/danger_mouse">Danger Mouse</a> game based on the hit cartoon series from the '80s.</p>
<p>Scheduled for launch in <strong>2026</strong>, Danger Mouse will be a side-scrolling affair with 15 levels to work through. Co-op play will be available to include Penfold as a playable character, and the title is said to include "plenty of toilet humour", so we're definitely morbidly intrigued to see what that entails.</p>
<p>There's little else to note at the moment, but from the few screenshots available at the time of writing, the visuals actually look pretty cool; very faithful! We'll definitely be keeping an eye on this one in the coming months.</p>
<p>For now, let's check out the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- 15 Levels – Side-scrolling, arcade battle action, super danger-filled levels!<br>
- Team Up – As Danger Mouse and Penfold in cooperative multiplayer to take on the Baron’s evil epic do-overs!<br>
- Take Control – Of the iconic Mark IV to drive, dive, fly, and tap dance your way to victory again…!<br>
- Plenty of Toilet Humor – But no potty mouth. Just incredibly dangerous foes to battle all over the globe!<br>
- Time Wasters – Errr… um… We mean mini games. Yes. Mini games!</p>
</blockquote>

            <p>Charlie Guillemot has addressed concerns of nepotism after being named co-CEO of Ubisoft's new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>-funded subsidiary, following in the footsteps of his father Yves Guillemot.</p>
<p>Ubisoft announced in March it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-launches-new-business-for-assassins-creed-and-other-big-ips-with-116bn-tencent-investment">launching a new subsidiary with €1.16bn of investment from Chinese conglomerate Tencent</a>. This subsidiary will be the home of the company's biggest franchises: Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six, and Far Cry.</p>
<p>Now the company has named Christophe Derennes and Charlie Guillemot as co-CEOs. Derennes has spent over 35 years at Ubisoft, co-founded Ubisoft's Montreal studio in 1997, and most recently served as managing director for the company's North American output.</p>

<p>Charlie Guillemot, meanwhile, began his career in 2014 at Owlient, a studio acquired by Ubisoft. The studio's biggest release, mobile game Tom Clancy's Elite Squad, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tom-clancys-elite-squad-shuts-down-a-year-after-launch">shut down a year after launch</a> having failed to find an audience. Before that, the game was embroiled in controversy following accusations of including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-pulls-black-lives-matter-raised-fist-from-new-tom-clancy-game-following-backlash">imagery promoting alt-right Black Lives Matter conspiracy theories</a>.</p>
<p>After this, Guillemot left Ubisoft to co-found <a href="https://www.unagi.games/">Unagi</a>, a company known for Web3 gaming, AI, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFTs</a>.</p>
<p>In a press release announcing its new subsidiary co-CEOs, Ubisoft stated: "Charlie Guillemot has built a hybrid career at the intersection of management and innovation. He brings an entrepreneurial perspective and a sharp understanding of evolving industry dynamics and players' expectations, shaped by his experience in game development. With a strong product mindset, deep tech culture, and a passion for games, he represents a new generation of leadership focused on innovation, quality, and putting players at the centre of decision-making."</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/ubisoft-spinoff-ceos-christophe-derennes-charlie-guillemot-1236453661/">Variety</a>, Guillemot then directly addressed any concerns of nepotism, following in the footsteps of his father.</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm Yves' son," he said. "That's not something I hide from. But my appointment isn't only about family ties; it's about what Ubisoft needs at this moment."</p>
<p>He continued: "I've spent the last decade building experience both inside and outside Ubisoft, leading teams, managing brands, and navigating change in a fast-moving industry. I also made the conscious choice to step away when it made sense, to learn and grow elsewhere.</p>
<p>"What matters now isn't my name, it's the work ahead. Ubisoft is at a pivotal moment. What's expected of me is to help push the company forward by bringing energy, focus, and by relying on the incredible expertise that already exists across the teams. I see myself as someone here to contribute, support, and help create the right conditions are in place for everyone to do their best work."</p>
<p>In the same interview, the co-CEOs detailed how their roles will complement each other. Guillemot will be "in charge of the 'what'", focusing on creative direction and marketing of the company's brands. Derennes will be focused on production and technology - the "how".</p>
<p>In a separate <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-gb/article/60h1Sq3PKN8WlNdlic2KLN/ubisoft-announces-christophe-derennes-and-charlie-guillemot-as-coceos-of-new-subsidiary">interview published by Ubisoft</a>, the pair also spoke of opportunities for growth in the games industry today.</p>
<p>"The biggest difference today is that the market is stable, compared to the previous decades in which there were massive disruptions one after the other which brought big changes - I'm thinking of the new console releases and the arrival of online gaming, to name a few," said Guillemot. "Of course, generative AI and cloud are likely to revolutionise game creation and the player experience in the long term, but what really matters today is standing out. That means being able to offer high-quality content, and sometimes that means shorter content, speaking to new generations that consume content in a different way. I'm convinced the industry will face new tech disruptions we can't fully predict yet. And Ubisoft intends to play an active role in shaping that future."</p>
<p>Derennes, meanwhile, spoke of expanding franchises beyond games. "Whether as references, as new ways of telling a story or as ever-expanding transmedia universes, video games' cultural impact as the tenth art is a reality. And this reality is exactly what we aim to capture with this new organisation," he said.</p>
<p>Back in May, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-moving-some-of-our-biggest-productions-into-2026-and-2027-after-positive-impact-of-assassins-creed-shadows-delay">Ubisoft stated it had postponed several of its "biggest productions"</a> to allow for more development time, following in the footsteps of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/charlie-guillemot-follows-father-as-co-ceo-of-ubisofts-new-tencent-funded-subsidiary-nepotism-claims-addressed]]></content:encoded>
