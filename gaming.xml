            <p>One of my favourite things in the entire world is the brash poetry inherent in the word 'skyscraper', and the many writing and language lessons gleaned from considering how utterly mundane that word actually feels to use. This week, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines">Cities: Skylines</a> community join me in the "probably thinking too much about skyscrapers" club. Paradox's city <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> has turned ten.</p>
<p>To celebrate, they've <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/cities-skylines-anniversary">constructed a towering roadmap of freebies</a> for it and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines-2">Cities: Skylines 2</a>, including new radio stations, new content, and a free-to-play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/542225339665876198">Steam event</a> for the original running March 20-24.</p>

<p>Some<a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/cities-skylines-ii/news/ten-years-of-cities-skylines"> blogly</a> musings:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We founded Colossal Order with the dream of creating a city-builder that would bring more freedom and creativity to the cities players can build. With Cities: Skylines, that dream not only came true, but thanks to the continued support of our amazing fans, we had the opportunity to keep growing and building this game and community many years after its release and take it even further than anticipated. It's been an incredible journey that's taught us so much - and still has more to teach - and we are forever grateful to everyone who made it possible and who joined us along the way.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Cities: Skylines has continued to receive updates throughout the years, the most recent being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-latest-dlc-came-out-this-week-18-months-after-its-final-dlc-came-out-last-year">last October</a>. Its sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-review">launched in a rough state</a> a year prior, though has seen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-six-months-of-renovations-cities-skyline-2-performance-is-considerably-less-terrible">some improvements since</a>. It's also seen some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skylines-2-devs-apologise-for-rushed-dlc-offer-refunds-promise-conciliatory-fan-summit">controversy surrounding "rushed" DLC</a>, and still looks a ways off from overtaking the original in both popularity and reception.</p>
<p>Paradox have fessed up to misjudging the impact of Skylines 2's launch technical shortcomings. Players are now "less accepting that you will fix things over time," Paradox CEO Mattias Lilja <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/players-are-now-less-accepting-that-games-will-be-fixed-say-paradox-after-underestimating-the-reaction-to-cities-skyline-2s-performance-woes">told Edwin last year</a>, with CCO Henrik Fåhraeus commenting seperately that "we were aware that performance was not great, but we underestimated how it will be perceived by players." </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-is-nothing-beyond-this-point-except-a-promisingly-odd-metroidvania-about-exploring-the-void<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
One of my Foundational Video Games is <a href="https://www.macintoshrepository.org/4498-mazeworld-the-ghost-of-mordaine">Mazeworld</a>, an elder Apple Macintosh first-personifier in which you explore a Carollian landscape of blue-walled darkness and rainbow-shelled snails. I was a young slip of a boy when Mazeworld released, and prone to daymares about crocodiles floating through the ceiling. Imagine my reaction to a game in which you are immediately confronted by a slathering, bodiless Cheshire Cat, its face a grinning smear that is only visible when it's charging right at you.
</p>
<p>
I'm always looking for games that similarly hide themselves, throwing you into a chasm of occult potentiality from which anything might emerge, given the appropriate rites. Games like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nix-umbra-review-occult-horror-at-its-most-focused-and-intense">Nix Umbra</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-of-a-wish">Death Of A Wish</a> and now <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nothing-beyond-this-point">Nothing Beyond This Point</a>, a topdown metroidvania in which you are a flaming cube surrounded by floating rods, dropped into a pixelart-scuffed void. RPS reader Mr_B recommended it in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-are-we-all-playing-this-weekend-324?view=comments">our last weekend plays thread</a>, and I couldn't resist trying the demo.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The aforesaid void isn't quite a blob of bad vibes, in practice. It has structure and the suggestion of an orderly grand design. There are 16 areas divided into tacit rooms, with reassuring fixtures such as campfires. There are genre-familiar activities such as having to clear a room of foes before you can leave it, or choosing between three permanent power-ups at key junctures.</p>
<p>There is also a fair amount of Enigma, however. Some rooms wrap around themselves and can only be exited from a certain side. Campfires aren't just "access points" and "save points", they're there to provide "a false sense of security". There are sigils that can eventually be interacted with in the form of a doodling minigame, altering the environment. There are also three gods to find, and the rudiments of coherent places. At one point a disembodied voice started talking to me in garbled Cthulhu language, alluding to a distant obelisk. 
</p>
<p>
The combat is also quite ingenious so far. Basically, you're immortal as long as you're surrounded by floating rods, which dissolve when you take damage and can be regenerated by holding space - which locks you in place for a fateful second or two. Rods are also spent to perform special abilities such as fireballs and AOE blasts, so battles are inherently tenser and more focussed on resource management than in a lot of vanias. Enemies consist of crawling horrors, sniper ghosts, and mallet-wielding machines.
</p>
<p>
I do get some sense that Nothing Beyond This Point will resolve eventually into a straightforward game of room clearance, levelling, and boss battles (I broke off playing the demo after I was slain by a robot-building robot) but then again, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3321280/Nothing_Beyond_This_Point">the Steam page</a> cautions that "you've seen nothing yet". Haha, I don't see what they did there. I wonder if they have a Cheshire Cat. I wonder if they have crocodiles. Argh.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-factions/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-factions%E2%80%94everything-we-know-about-battlefield-2025-factions.1129824/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-factions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlefield’s Factions determine which regions fight each other in matches. The concept has been around for decades, and Battlefield 6, which may release in 2025, will again feature waging Factions.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> could be pivotal for both EA and the storied shooter franchise. Recent Battlefield games haven’t fared too well. Battlefield 1 was solid, whereas Battlefield 5 focused too much on what fans didn’t ask for. On the other hand, Battlefield 2042 was the series’ comparison to jumping the shark.</p>



<p>2025 aims to bring Battlefield 6 and make it one of the best. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs</a> Factions have been the topic of conversation, so let’s dig into the latest details.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-factions-confirmed-so-far">Battlefield 6 Factions Confirmed so far</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Who will you fight? Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Battlefield 6’s 2025 pre-Alpha footage has shown NATO and what looks to be a PMC outfit called Pax Armata</strong> <strong>as the main opposing Factions.</strong></p>



<p>There are a few things to consider with Battlefield 6’s Factions so far. Firstly, this is a pre-Alpha, and it’s <strong>likely EA is using a ton of placeholders and unofficial names</strong> for now. The focus is on the gameplay, network connectivity, and overall game stability.</p>



<p>Given recent criticism of the franchise, it’s understandable if the multiple developers aren’t as bothered about the names of the game’s Factions for now. Secondly, don’t be surprised if EA does end up sticking with more generic Factions such as NATO and either an unnamed PMC (Private Military Company), or the generic use of “PMC” instead.</p>



<p>Real-life global tensions mean these decisions can’t be taken lightly. Battlefield 2042 did use “Russian Army,” “United States Marine Corps,” and “British Army,” but times change. So don’t be surprised to see Battlefield 6 adopt safe Faction names.</p>



<p>Even if Battlefield runs with NATO, you likely won’t be stuck with the same few default selections. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1j6wy6t/thats_a_union_flag_right/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">A Reddit post</a> has identified a Union Flag on a soldier’s uniform using the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-leaks-reveal-battlefield-4-vibe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 leaks</a>. This means there’s potential wiggle room for customization options. The OP for the post said: “I’m hoping Dice is brave and gives us some clear depictions of Russian, Chinese &amp; Iranian uniforms for the opfor Faction.”</p>



<p>Again, real-world scenarios and events have a bearing on how Battlefield 6’s final content looks. We’ll have to see how close EA and DICE push the boundaries.</p>



<hr>



<p>We’re still not 100% sure when Battlefield 6 is set to launch, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-launch-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA has claimed it will be before April 2026</a>. We’re still not ruling out a 2025 launch either. </p>



<p>What do you think of Battlefield Labs so far? Does the game look promising? Are we finally due a brilliant Battlefield game?</p>

            <p>Doom: The Dark Ages serves as a prequel to 2016's Doom and its sequel Doom Eternal, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-is-an-origin-story-for-the-doom-slayers-rage">tells the "epic cinematic origin story of the Doom Slayer's rage"</a>. But, even though it's a prequel, don't expect The Dark Ages to end with the Slayer being popped in a coffin.</p>
<p>As a reminder, 2016's Doom opens with the Slayer lying in a coffin, before he swiftly breaks free from the chains binding him so he can shoot the faces off advancing baddies. It is quite the way to kick things off.</p>
<p>So, if The Dark Ages is going to set us up for Doom 2016, surely we already know how the upcoming game is going to end, right? Wrong!</p>

<p>"I mean, that would end the Dark Ages, the medieval chapter of the Doom saga. This is kind of like the Chronicles of the Slayer," Doom: The Dark Ages game director Hugo Martin told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/doom-the-dark-ages-wont-end-with-the-slayer-in-a-coffin-waiting-for-the-start-of-doom-2016-that-would-mean-that-we-couldnt-tell-any-more-medieval-stories/">PC Gamer</a>, when asked about potentially seeing the Slayer getting locked away.</p>
<p>"So if we took it all the way to that point, then that would mean that we couldn't tell any more medieval stories. And I'm not announcing projects or anything other than to just say it's better to leave it open."</p>
<p>The game director added that the Doom: The Dark Ages team has some DLC planned for the prequel, so again putting the Slayer in a coffin during the main story wouldn't make sense.</p>
<p>"We do have a DLC and things like that, so it won't - I'm not giving away spoilers - but it doesn't end with him [in the coffin]," the developer continued.</p>
<p>"The story is that they collapsed a building on top of him and then put him inside of that sarcophagus that we find him in at the beginning of 2016," said Martin.</p>
<p>"And this game doesn't end that way."</p>

			<p>There are two castles, and that ‘V’ between them means that they’re not on the best of terms. You play cards from your deck in an effort to destroy the nefarious enemy castle. And… well, that’s just about the only the aim of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3398880/Castle_V_Castle/">Castle V Castle</a>.</p>

<p>The demo that you can currently leap into as part of Steam Next Fest does away with any pretence of tutorials or storytelling, instead leaning on the idea that the title does both of those things. What more could you need to know?</p>


<p>Castle V Castle is a strategic resource management game, accruing enough of each to use in offense and defence against that vile enemy castle. There’s probably some deep-seated visual analogy for the fact that you and your enemies look identical, but I’ll let you mull that over on your own time.</p>
<p>These resources are broken down into separate sections, with your castle’s level prominently displayed at the top. You’ve then got Build, which displays the number of bricks you have, and the number of builders, followed by the Attack category which shows your soldiers and number of weapons. Finally, there’s Magic, which contains Witches and Magic Power.</p>

<p>Each of these can be utilised to grow your castle, expand defences, or go on the attack, whittling the enemy castle down faster than they whittle yours. It’s simple, but there’s a real push-and-pull between the two sides.</p>

<p>Successfully completing a stage grants you a reward chest or, if you’re unlucky, a cursed chest. Either will give you the choice between two permanent upgrades or curses, before sending you off again to fight the next castle. They really do throw them up these days, don’t they? As you progress you might have to decide whether to focus on magic or old fashioned sword-swinging, depending on the curses and boons you’ve chosen.</p>
<p>The biggest sticking point comes when you don’t have enough resources to play a card. Discarding one will see it replaced by another, but you also lose your turn so it can completely change the outcome of a round if you don’t get it right. I found it easier to get rid of higher value cards, focusing on easier to play, low value cards, but you miss out on the most powerful attacks if you do that, from whirling dervishes of knights, to a robot that counts down through ten rounds before annihilating you.</p>
<p>There’s a great sense of character here, despite the simple black and white visuals and focused gameplay. The demo is quite short – 20 minutes, if that – so it’s not a huge timesink to check out, and if it captures your attention, there’s a daily challenge that you can hop into each day. Castle V Castle is listed as a singleplayer title, but it feels like a natural fit for online multiplayer, which I hope is something the team at Nopopo consider. Either way, I can see it capturing a good number of players in its grey brick walls when it releases.</p>
<p>Castle V Castle is a smart spot of strategy, with a great aesthetic. It’s definitely one to keep an eye on.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has today received its latest update, fixing a number of issues.</p>
<p>The update, known as ver.1.000.05.00, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-soon-to-fix-monster-hunter-wilds-issue-where-its-celebrated-food-scenes-arent-showing">was announced last week</a>, and now that it's live Capcom has released a full list of fixes.</p>
<p>Alongside an issue where the game's celebrated food scenes weren't showing, other fixed issues include the Monster Field Guide not being accessible (which is pretty crucial), players falling through the map after the Towards Fervent Fields mission in Chapter 2-1, and issues with screen rendering causing force quits.</p>

<p>A full list of fixes can be found in the <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/support/wilds/en/faq/detail/060">patch notes</a>.</p>
<p>Capcom has also updated its list of known issues. These will presumably be fixed in the next patch, though some of these issues have been on this list for the past couple of patch notes.</p>
<p>The known issues are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A network error occurs when firing an SOS flare right after a quest begins.</li>
<li>Link Members are not prioritized over other players and may not appear in some places including Base Camps.</li>
<li>Palico’s attacks with blunt weapons do not inflict stun and exhaust damages.</li>
<li>Hunter Profile cannot be edited properly on some occasions.</li>
<li>Some side missions cannot be completed under certain situations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Capcom has requested players restart the game and update to the latest version before playing again.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds has proven exceptionally popular since its release at the end of February. While Steam player numbers have taken a dip, its all-time concurrent player count peak was at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-has-a-truly-wild-debut-smashing-series-player-numbers-on-steam">over 1.38 million players during its first weekend</a>. That's the fifth highest peak ever on the platform.</p>
<p>The game sold 8m copies in its first three days on sale to become <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-is-capcoms-fastest-selling-game-ever">Capcom's fastest-selling game ever</a>. That number will have risen even further since.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-new-mod-introduces-highly-requested-feature-still-missing-from-the-vanilla-game.1129791/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mod-highly-requested-feature/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Monster Hunter Wilds shared online today introduces yet another highly-requested feature that is still missing from the vanilla game.</p>
<p>The Layer Any Weapon mod, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/496?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>, introduces a very simple Layered Weapon system that allows hunters to layer the appearance of any weapon onto the currently equipped one, similar to what is possible to do in the vanilla game with armor. Given how the strongest weapons in the game, the Artian weapons, don't have the best looks in most cases, this mod is a must for those who want to look at something other than the mechanical design of these weapons.</p>
<p>Shortly after the launch of the game last month, plenty of mods were released online addressing some of Monster Hunter Wilds' biggest issues, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mod-addresses-stuttering/">performance</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-new-mods-address-biggest-issues/">low challenge level</a>. Even with these issues, however, the latest entry in the series proved to be very successful, selling <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-sold-8-million-units-in-3-days-the-fastest-game-in-capcoms-history/">8 million units in 3 days</a>, the fastest ever for CAPCOM. The game's success, in my opinion, is completely deserved, as it is a very solid game that's really fun to play, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review.</a></p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-version-gets-esrb-rating-hinting-at-imminent-launch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-version-gets-esrb-rating-hinting-at-imminent-launch.1129773/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-version-gets-esrb-rating-hinting-at-imminent-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The ESRB has <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40439/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> the official rating for the PlayStation 5 version of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, sparking inevitable discussions about the game's imminent debut on Sony's console.</p>
<p>This title went back and forth several times. It was already planned to go fully multiplatform in the beginning, but then Microsoft renegotiated the deal with Disney and Lucasfilm after its acquisition of Bethesda to make it a PC and Xbox exclusive. However, by the time the game actually got its final release date, Microsoft had shifted its policy toward multiplatform releases. At Gamescom 2024, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-release-as-timed-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle would launch in December for PC and Xbox and in Spring 2025 for PlayStation 5. The latest rumors point to a release on Sony's console sometime next month and today's finding of the ESRB rating certainly supports this theory.</p>
<p>MachineGames has already published a few post-release updates, although to be fair, the game was already great at launch, as I discussed <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in my review</a>:</p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is an excellent adventure/action game that features one of the best Indiana Jones stories, great level design that rewards exploration, and awesome ray traced visuals. This might just be the best game dedicated to Dr. Henry Walton we've ever seen.</em></p>
<p>Still, some of those improvements could come in handy for this new version. The game now supports fully ray traced shadows; moreover, the most recent update <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-3-adds-amd-fsr-3-frame-generation-and-path-tracing-support-on-amd-intel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduced</a> support for path tracing on AMD (and Intel GPU) and AMD FSR 3 Frame Generation integration. Given that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle already <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-an-impressive-ray-tracing-xbox-series-x-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featured a great ray tracing implementation on the Xbox Series X</a>, it is possible the developers might push it even further on the PlayStation 5 Pro, which features several hardware-based ray tracing optimizations.</p>
<p>Could this game be the first path traced title available on the PS5 Pro? Maybe. When we floated the idea of path tracing for Sony's console <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mark-cerny-qa-we-ask-about-vrr-improvements-pssr-fg-path-tracing-and-ml-project-with-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in an interview with System Architect Mark Cerny</a>, he remained cautious, adding that developers 'need to have a highly optimized strategy for doing it if you're going to do it on PlayStation 5 Pro'. Well, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is likely the most optimized path tracing game available right now, so there's no better candidate in theory. We'll see if MachineGames actually tries it or sticks with a more conservative enhanced ray tracing target.</p>

            <p>A new trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> has dropped.

Bold choice if so, although not the only one. Here's the trailer, complete with familiar mechs and very familiar bandanas. See Konami, this is what happens when you pop out for five minutes to re-release <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suikoden-i-and-ii-hd-remaster-gate-rune-and-dunan-unification-wars">Suikoden</a>.</p>

<p>Alongside The Solitude of Prime Numbers's Luca Marinelli wearing a Snakely bandana and a Rex-reminiscent mech, the trailer also has a console release date: 26th June 2025, or 63 days before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>. This is approximately enough time for players unfamiliar with Kojima's works to pick up Death Stranding 2 on a whim, finish it, buy  Delta of out curiosity, then think "hey, this Snake guy is a total rip-off of Luca Marinelli's character!". A paratextual commentary on identity, memory, and hero worship? Kojima you sly old dog, you've done it again!</p>
<p>Shared as part of a panel at SXSW, the trailer joins news of an <a href="https://kojimaproductions.jp/en/deathstranding-concerts-announced?dm_i=74N0,1E4S2,1MPLY2,4YF2G,1#m-scroll-target">orchestral concert </a>and <a href="https://kojimaproductions.jp/en/deathstranding2_hamilton_announced?dm_i=74N0,1E4S2,1MPLY2,4YF2G,1#m-scroll-target">a watch</a>. Why, you could wear the watch to the concert and draw attention to yourself in the queue by loudly asking "what time does this thing start, anyway?!" and theatrically glaring at your wrist, then smarmily asking "oh, this old thing?" at great volume to no-one in particular. You'd be really cool if you did that.</p>
<p>It took about eight months for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> to break console containment. If this follows suit, we might well see the sequel on PC by the end of the year. I reckon we got the best of both worlds with the original's late release though: more time to play other games, and a shiny Director's Cut to boot. I enjoyed it so much I was compelled to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/object-ive-review-death-strandings-pizza">spill words aplenty on pizza</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>For the best part of a decade we’ve explored video games through a historic lens in <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/playing-with-history">Playing With History</a>, studying AAA blockbusters such as <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a> to indie gems like <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/radio-commander">Radio Commander</a>, examining the real-world people, events, and cultures that inspired them.</p>
<p>We’re proud to announce that Playing With History is to become a premium print publication with its first volume heading to crowdfunding platform, Kickstarter, later this year. Available digitally and in both paperback and hardback, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/playingwithhistory/playing-with-history-pixels-polygons-and-the-past">Playing With History: Volume One</a> promises over 200 pages of developer interviews, deep dives, and retrospectives, all presented in a visually arresting format.</p>
<div id="attachment_457611"><p id="caption-attachment-457611">Battlefield: The Endless War For Wake Island is just one of many original articles created for Playing With History.</p></div>
<p>Together, with video game creatives and historians, we investigate a wide spectrum of historic eras and how they are represented, from the prehistoric playgrounds of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/far-cry-primal">Far Cry Primal</a> to <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a>’s nightmarish Normandy landings and far beyond. Whether it’s Romans, Vikings, samurai, or pirates, we leave no virtual stone unturned, with plenty of fascinating detours along the way.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microtransactions-are-stopping-creativity-reckons-josef-fares/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Always the outspoken game designer, Hazelight's Josef Fares has recently commented on the negative influence that the widespread usage of microtransactions is having on the game industry. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjgQpyc1gh4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to YouTube channel Fall Damage</a> in a reaction video to user comments, Fares explained:</p>
<p><em>Of course, and that goes for everything we do at Hazelight. I think that kind of shit affects the design of how the game should be done. Every time you take a design decision based on you making more money in the game, I think it's a huge problem, and it's stopping our industry from a creative perspective.</em></p>
<p>For a few years, especially around 2017-2018, there were instances of highly aggressive microtransactions that triggered massive backlash from fans. Famous instances include <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-hit-by-class-action-for-nba-2k-loot-boxes-microtransactions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NBA 2K</a>, Star Wars Battlefront II (where Electronic Arts was <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-microtransactions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forced</a> to remove them just before launch), <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-avengers-now-features-gameplay-related-microtransactions-despite-promises-itd-never-happen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marvel's Avengers</a> (in this case, too, the developers had to quickly cut them from the game), and more recently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-community-is-angry-at-the-new-microtransactions-techland-responds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying Light 2</a>. Microtransactions even made it into several single player games, like <a href="http://wccftech.com/shadow-of-war-director-microtransactions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Middle-earth: Shadow of War</a>, various Ubisoft games, and even CAPCOM's <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-5-has-time-saving-mtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Devil May Cry V</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-mods-bypass-microtransactions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon's Dogma 2</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-gets-microtransactions-for-instant-weapon-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resident Evil 4</a>.</p>
<p>Nowadays, developers are more careful when implementing microtransactions, sticking strictly to cosmetic items in most cases. However, microtransactions are more pervasive than ever, especially since the game industry isn't growing meaningfully anymore and development budgets continue to increase. The only solution, then, is to try to squeeze more out of the average consumer.</p>
<p>Thankfully, if you don't want anything to do with microtransactions, there are still several games completely devoid of them, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-has-no-drm-or-microtransactions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</a> or even Josef Fares's own Split Fiction, which just launched to positive reviews. On Wccftech, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned an 8/10 score from Nathan Birch</a>:</p>
<p><em>Split Fiction may tell a more conventional story than Hazelight Studios’ last couple of games, but it’s hard to get too hung up on that, given how expertly it builds on and refines It Takes Two’s unique approach to co-op action without sacrificing any of its ingenuity. Split Fiction may not end up being everyone’s favorite Hazelight joint, particularly if you’re not up for its sometimes-frustrating level of challenge, but the game is anything but by-the-books.</em></p>

            <p>Over the weekend, hectic 1v1 shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/straftat">Straftat</a> got yet more free maps in an update. The developers added <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2386720/view/509574242369537162">eight new cramped deathzones</a> alongside a further four maps for owners of the "maps 'n' hats" DLC, then threw in a new submachine gun and a music player for good measure. But over on the game's Discord server, amid the mine-laying mercenaries and bum-sliding shootscum, the developers also held a poll that revealed future plans. They asked players what they'd prefer: a 2v2 mode or a four-player free-for-all? </p>
<p>"We'll do both," said devbrother Leonard Lemaitre, "but it's a matter of which one comes first."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The poll, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1124764095623741473/1265760231913422969/1347947995441664121">posted on Saturday</a>, currently puts the presumably chaotic four player free-for-all mode ahead, with twice as many votes as the 2v2 mode, which I can only imagine will be an intense bonding exercise for connoisseurs of early 2000s multiplayer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> lobbies. Although the poll is being conducted with emojis, and it's possible a lot of voters are getting the "two silhouetted people" emoji confused with the "two silhouettes hugging" emoji, thereby splitting the 2v2 vote. Is there an electoral commission for frenzied first-person killsports? Nah, we can solve this with a first-to-three in Chateaux_13_Alt_Alt. </p>
<p> It's very pleasing to see the game pumping out updates. It was already an "anarchic first-person speed dater you'll fall in love with" according to our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/straftat-review">Straftat review</a> from Rick, and that was before they added <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/straftat-resurrects-a-counter-strike-map-you-either-love-or-hate-cannibalising-fps-history-in-the-best-way-possible">another heaving bunch of maps to the concrete bullet brawler</a>. Including this latest update, my estimate is now 192 maps (if you own the DLC) although I could have easily lost count. There's a reason it was one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-24-favourite-games-of-2024">favourite games of 2024</a>.</p>
<p>This weekend's update adds a few other bits and bobs. You can now view your match history in the stats menu, for example. And you can disable your crosshair in the options, if you are some kind of instinctually accursed murder master. Don't matchmake with me, please, I don't like that.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A new filing from the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) has confirmed multiple Switch 2 features.</p>
<p>Now we know Amiibo figurines will be supported, as Switch 2 will support NFC - it's in the right Joy-Con, just like the original Switch.</p>
<p>It's also confirmed to have faster Wi-Fi compatibility with support for Wi-Fi 6 networks with up to 80MHz of bandwidth, up from Wi-Fi 5 on the original Switch. However, it doesn't appear to support the more recent Wi-Fi 7 or Wi-Fi 6E.</p>

<p>Further, we already knew Switch 2 would have USB-C ports both on top and at the bottom of the console, but these filings confirm both ports can be used to charge the console.</p>
<p>We also now know the Switch 2's code designation is BEE, with BEE-001 being the model of the console, BEE-012 and 014 being the left and right Joy-Cons, and BEE-053 being the Relay Box.</p>
<p>Similarly, the GameCube had the code DOL (for Dolphin) and the Wii had RVL (for Revolution).</p>

<p>We still don't know the release date for the Switch 2 but it's not long now until we find out - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-timing-of-its-dedicated-switch-2-direct">Nintendo is hosting a Direct livestream</a> on 2nd April at 2pm UK time.</p>
<p>Little is known about the console so far, beyond its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">reveal back in January</a>, but it's hoped the Direct will provide a wealth of information: from its release date and price, to the launch line-up. Presumably that will include the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">new Mario Kart game previously teased</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>ESRB has rated Indiana Jones and The Great Circle for the PS5.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://x.com/wario64/status/1899020272331575558?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wario64</a>, if you search for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on ESRB’s <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40439/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>, you will find two search results now, one for Windows PC and Xbox Series and one for the PS5. The game has been rated ‘T’ (Teen) with “Blood and Gore, Drug Reference, Mild Language, Violence” highlighted on the listing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> in August last year that the game would arrive on the platform in Spring 2025. However, an ESRB rating for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on the PS5 hints that things are well in motion and an official release date announcement could be around the corner. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The ESRB rating summary describes the game as a first-person action adventure in which players uncover mysteries, solve puzzles, and defeat villains. The game includes different types of combat, such as hand-to-hand, stealth, whip use, and ranged combat with the help of machine guns and rifles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The summary also highlights some of the game’s sequences that aren’t for all audiences, such as a scene with a severed arm and another with a corpse impaled with a spike trap. It also mentions certain drug references and curse words that were heard in the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, more Indiana Jones games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-indiana-jones-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are reportedly in development</a>.

            <p>After its VR catalogue was removed from the Meta Store earlier this year, Insomniac has announced the affected games are now making a return.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, three of the four previoulsy delisted games are again available on the Meta Store. These are Edge of Nowhere, Stormland, and Feral Rites.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Insomniac is still "actively" working on getting the fourth of its Meta VR titles - The Unspoken - back on the store front. "VR players, we appreciate your patience while we work with Meta [to] restore access to these games," <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/1898232148911702187">Insomniac wrote on social media</a>.</p>

<p>All four of the affected games were developed with funding by Meta. While no reason was given for their removal from the store, the general consensus was that it was due to the certification process. A <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/stormland-oculus-rift-store-missing/#:~:text=Stormland%20and%20The%20Unspoken%20are%20back%20for%20sale,our%20blog%20from%20September,%E2%80%9D%20Meta%20explained%20via%20email.">similar thing happened back in 2022</a>, as well.</p>
<p>While the four games had seemingly been absent from the store for several months now, their removal was recently highlighted by freelance journalist <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dominictarason.com/post/3ljd4dorpt42n?ref=uploadvr.com">Dominic Tarason</a> on Bluesky.</p>
<p>"I thankfully picked up Stormland (their best-known game) and can still access it, but the others are so thoroughly vanished that not even pirate and torrent sites seem to have the rest anymore," Tarason wrote at the start of the month.</p>

<p>The fake Snake is Neil, played by Luca Marinelli - a new character for the sequel. We see him towards the end of the trailer wearing a bandana in a look strikingly similar to the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> protagonist.</p>
<p>The rest of the trailer includes plenty of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-sure-sounds-a-lot-like-death-stranding-so-far">elements familiar to fans of the first game</a>, but with plenty more surreal and bizarre happenings.</p>
<p>There's a mysterious faction, an environment warped by chiralium, and some absolutely nightmarish BTs. We also see Sam Bridges exploring more varied locales, from lush forests and snowy mountains, to a post apocalyptic city caught in a storm, and the more familiar Icelandic tundra.</p>

<p>There are plenty of story hints too inspired by the Covid-19 pandemic, though at this point little of it makes sense. Kojima also continues his penchant for simplistic descriptive names: Dollman, Doctor, and Rainy, for instance.</p>
<p>The trailer is soundtracked by a new song from musician Woodkid called To The Wilder, which is out now.</p>
<p>Speaking of music, a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> Strands of Harmony World Tour will take place this year, beginning at the Sydney Opera House on 8th November and then visiting 12 countries across four continents until it ends in Toronto on 28th March 2026. The London date is 16th November.</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will be available to pre-order from 17th March. According to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-details-leak-ahead-of-kojima-panel-later-today">leak ahead of the panel</a>, the collector's edition will cost $230.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-luca-marinelli-solid-snake/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kojima-brings-a-%E2%80%98spitting-image-of-solid-snake%E2%80%99-to-death-stranding-2.1129707/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-luca-marinelli-solid-snake/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It was recently revealed that Death Stranding 2 will be released worldwide on June 26. Alongside the reveal, Hideo Kojima’s team at Kojima Productions released a new trailer to showcase the ambitious (and somewhat confusing) sequel to the 2019 epic that sold almost 20 million copies. The trailer, which was bursting with cinematic quality, boasted a runtime of a whopping 10 minutes.</p>



<p>In the trailer, we get a look at Neil, a mysterious character played by Luca Marinelli. If you get Solid Snake vibes from his character’s reveal, that’s because it’s almost by design.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-solid-stranding">Solid Stranding</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDMIVpVnef5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an Instagram post</a> from 2020, Hideo Kojima noted that Luca Marinelli had ‘caught his eye’. He remarked that the actor would be the ‘spitting image of Solid Snake’ if he put on a bandana, and lo and behold, he does just that in the latest trailer for Death Stranding 2 all these years later.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="DEATH STRANDING 2: ON THE BEACH | Pre-Order Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HdzIwQhYABQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Luca Marinelli’s reveal in the Death Stranding 2 trailer could be pulled straight out of a Metal Gear remake – but the similarities to franchise that arguably made Kojima more than two decades ago don’t end there.</p>



<p>Further in the trailer, we get our first look at ‘Magellan Man’, a hulking construct that could be an alternate rendition of a Metal Gear weapon.</p>



<p>We don’t see much of Luca’s character in the Death Stranding 2 trailer, but like everything else featured, it’s more than enough to get the hype train stoked a little further. This is easily one of the most highly anticipated releases of 2025, and it promises to be a cinematic showstopper.</p>



<p>In tandem with the development of Death Stranding 2, Hideo Kojima is working with A24 to produce a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-adaptations-kojima-confirm/">Death Stranding movie</a>, as if the man wasn’t doing enough with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-od/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OD</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-physint-inspiration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Physint</a>.</p>



<p>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach has been a long time coming – are you excited about the impending release? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>In just a few days, GDC will take place in San Francisco (and <strong>Insider Gaming </strong>will be in attendance!). It’s a proving ground for countless developers and publishers to show off what they’re working on, as well as for manufacturers to reveal the latest and greatest in gaming technology.</p>



<p>One topic that has surfaced recently concerns EA Motive’s Iron Man game, which has been kept mostly under wraps since it was revealed more than two years ago. In a recent schedule post, it was revealed that Motive will be presenting <strong>something </strong>to do with Iron Man at GDC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-becoming-stark">Becoming Stark</h2>



<p>Almost nothing is known about the Iron Man game being pieced together by Motive, but there are high hopes that it’ll deliver nicely on expectations. Fans are wishing for an open-ended game with full suit customisation that allows them to immerse themselves in the role of Tony Stark.</p>



<p>In September 2022, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/motive-studios-officially-announces-new-iron-man-game/">revealed that Motive</a> is working on the game, as well as contributing to the ongoing development of the next Battlefield title. Historically, Motive has contributed to the Dead Space Remake, Star Wars Squadrons, and Battlefront II.</p>



<p>On the Iron Man front, all we know right now is that it’s a single-player, third-person action title. Shortly after the game was announced, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/motives-iron-man-game-already-starts-playtesting/">we covered the playtests</a> that were going on behind closed doors, and since then, production has kicked off in earnest, so it must be in a much better state by now.</p>



<p>Recently, eagle-eyed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1j7gl6h/motive_may_show_off_iron_man_game_at_gdc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit users</a> discovered an Advanced Graphics Summit segment <a href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/advanced-graphics-summit-revolutionizing-texture-pipelines-eas-journey-with-texture-sets/909461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">taking place at GDC on March 17</a>. The session is being led by a technical artist from Electronic Arts, and the content is set to be focused on the development of texture sets for Dead Space and Iron Man at Motive. </p>



<p>The belief is that Motive will be showing off at least <strong>something </strong>from Iron Man during this segment, which would represent our first look at the game since it was announced in 2022. Even if the technical demo provides little more than <strong>a look </strong>at Iron Man’s suit, fans will be satisfied.</p>



<p>As you need certain credentials to access the tech summit hosted by EA at GDC, it’s highly unlikely that anything will be released publicly around this time, but you never know. It’s also entirely possible that we’ll see some kind of demo or trailer revealed during the Epic Unreal showcase at GDC, given that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-iron-man-game-to-use-unreal-engine-5/">Iron Man is being built in UE5</a>.</p>



<p>What hopes do you have for Motive’s Iron Man? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, rumours started circulating that developers are starting to prepare games for the ‘next Xbox’. The focus title of these rumours was Call of Duty 2026 – it was claimed that it’d be released on whatever hardware the tech titan produces next, but a recent insider has suggested that might not be the case and that the next Xbox device will likely arrive in 2027 <strong>and not </strong>2026.</p>



<p>It was also suggested that the next Xbox won’t be a console at all, but more of a gaming PC with defined hardware that developers can better work with.</p>

<h2 id="h-the-end-of-consoles-for-xbox">The End of Consoles for Xbox</h2>



<p>For a while, Xbox has been teetering on a precipice. The brand has well and truly lost this generation of home consoles to the PlayStation 5, and the Xbox One generation should be forgotten about entirely at this point. Recently, a marketing campaign from Xbox proved that ‘everything is an Xbox’ and that you don’t even need a console anymore to be an Xbox-based gamer.</p>



<p>A former Xbox executive even went on record suggesting that Microsoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-consoles-microsoft-would-not-make-choice/">would stop making hardware</a> right now if it had the choice.</p>



<p>In a segment on the most recent episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAOt7CKUEFY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Xbox Two podcast</a>, Jez Corden, an insider with a solid track record, mentioned that something drastic might be on the horizon.</p>



<p>Instead of creating a full-fledged Xbox console for a 2027 release, he said that Microsoft will instead produce ‘a PC in essence but with a TV-friendly shell that also has a specific set of specs in mind.’</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Developers will be building for a Windows PC in a way but in such a way that they know exactly what the specs will be, so they can optimise exactly for it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Corden also leaned towards writing off the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2026-xbox/">Call of Duty 2026 rumours</a>, explaining, <em>‘the devkit talk is more about what kind of specs they’ve been told to target for the next Xbox. I’m pretty sure the new hardware is not 2026; it’s 2027.’</em></p>



<p>The general assumption now is that the next Xbox will be a micro-form Windows-powered PC in a ‘console-like’ shell and chassis that can sit nicely under a television. </p>



<p>It’ll be compatible with all manner of peripherals and inputs, and it’ll likely have a ‘switchable mode’ that ports between a gaming interface and a general Windows layout, so you can treat it like a desktop PC as much as you would a home gaming console. </p>

<p>OpTic Texas has found itself in a sticky spot since 2025 kicked off. The team’s last win in a qualifying stage was at the end of January, and at the Major in Madrid, the team crashed out after winning just one series in the lower bracket. The squad is on a historic losing streak, losing 15 maps in sequence and sitting one from the bottom in the CDL stage standings.</p>



<p>The team is drawing a 50-50 win-loss record right now in the overall season standings, but one more loss will push them into negative ground and could move them further down the leaderboard.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-texas-in-turmoil">Texas in Turmoil</h2>



<p>The impact of the losing streak has been visible on the faces of the OpTic Texas crew in recent weeks. They’re looking sullen and extinguished on their camera feeds, and the energy that usually drives them is sorely lacking.</p>



<p>Recently, the organisation’s owner, Hector ‘H3CZ’ Rodriguez, made a controversial statement on stream, dubbing the squad the worst OpTic team ever. This losing streak is indeed like nothing we’ve ever seen for the organisation.</p>



<p>This stage alone, OpTic Texas has lost with an 0 – 3 scoreline against:</p>



<ul>
<li>Toronto Ultra</li>



<li>Miami Heretics</li>



<li>Carolina Royal Ravens</li>



<li>Minnesota Rokkr</li>



<li>Atlanta FaZe</li>
</ul>



<p>The running joke now is that even the Vegas Falcons, a team that has lost two dozen Hardpoint rounds since the season started and sits on a record of 0 – 16 overall has put up a better fight this stage.</p>











<p>OpTic’s most recent loss came at the hands of Toronto Ultra, which laid the utter smackdown against the team from Texas. In this series, JoeDecieves (ULT) set a new KD record at 2.05, helped by going double positive in the opening Hardpoint.</p>



<p>It was a crushing blow for Texas through and through, and the closing round of Control was a 3 – 0 masterclass from Ultra. Ironically, this is OpTic Texas’ Major event. The upcoming LAN tournament will be played at the arena in which they won their CDL Championship last year, and they’re entering the running in the worst position possible.</p>



<p>On social platforms everywhere, fans of the OpTic franchise are writhing and desperately figuring out a plan to right the ship. The consensus is that a major roster change is needed, but nobody seems to know who is at fault. The finger pointing is generally levelled at Kenny, and one of the most common claims is that Huke never should have been pushed back out for the return of Pred.</p>



<p>What do you think needs to be done for OpTic Texas to win a series? Let me know in the comments.</p>
