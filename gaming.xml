            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-shiver-entertainment-purchase</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-buys-hogwarts-legacy-and-mortal-kombat-porting-studio-shiver.877092/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-shiver-entertainment-purchase<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that it is to purchase&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>porting studio Shiver Entertainment from former owner Embracer Group.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/240521e.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">notice announcing the acquisition</a>, Nintendo says it will acquire "100% of [Shiver's] outstanding shares", making the company a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Japanese gaming giant.</p>

<p>According to Nintendo, Shiver is an "experienced and accomplished" porting studio, although given the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-for-switch-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank">response</a> to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-mortal-kombat-1-is-an-excellent-console-game-but-switch-simply-isnt-good-enough" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Switch version</a> of&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>, I suspect there are some out there who will disagree.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-shiver-entertainment-mortal-kombat-1.jpg?itok=ABc56L6n 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-shiver-entertainment-mortal-kombat-1.jpg?itok=vQ1y7GdL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Shiver Entertainment is perhaps best-known for porting&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>to Switch (although the PC version is pictured here).</figcaption></figure><p>The notice goes on to say that Nintendo will utilize Shiver's talents as "high-level resources for porting and developing software titles".</p>

<p>From Shiver's perspective, it doesn't sound like much will change; Nintendo says Shiver's "focus will remain the same" and that the studio will continue to take "commissions that port and develop software for multiple platforms including Nintendo Switch".</p>

<p>Nintendo also says that the Shiver acquisition will have "only a minor effect" on its fiscal results for the year, so although the amount for which Shiver was acquired hasn't been disclosed, it's unlikely to be a devastatingly expensive transaction for Nintendo.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-switch-nintendo-shiver-entertainment.jpg?itok=2t3UhA6Q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-switch-nintendo-shiver-entertainment.jpg?itok=b4RX_QUc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You may also know Shiver's name from its&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>Switch port.</figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's purchase of Shiver comes at a time when Embracer Group is undergoing a rather drastic restructuring that will see it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-splitting-three-companies">split into three different companies</a>.</p>

<p>The first, Coffee Stain and Friends, will handle IPs like&nbsp;<em>Goat Simulator&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory</em>, while Middle-earth and Friends will oversee major IP like&nbsp;<em>The Lord of the Rings</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>, and more.</p>

<p>Finally, tabletop giant Asmodee will constitute the third company in Embracer's restructuring effort, and the studio has already been <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-saddled-with-eu900-million-debt-by-embracer-group">saddled with almost a billion euros in debt</a> as a result of the restructuring.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Nintendo's purchase of Shiver Entertainment will yield, but you can expect to see the studio's name on more ports in the future, it seems. Stay tuned for more.</p>

			<p>Today, Criterion Games <a href="https://x.com/NeedforSpeed/status/1792882777009905855" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/need-for-speed-unbound-to-get-second-year-of-support-inspired-by-previous-franchise-entries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Need for Speed Unbound</a> Vol.7, an update that adds modes and progression systems inspired by Need for Speed: Underground.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drift Mode:</strong> Players can elevate their street racing experience with the new Drift Mode. Designed for those who speak in corners and think in throttle, this mode updates the classic drifting experience with an overhauled handling model for drift builds - delivering unparalleled control and deeper levels of drift mastery. Drift playlists have also been added to PVP and Free Roam.</li>
<li><strong>Drag Mode:</strong> This mode redefines racing in Need for Speed Unbound with a fresh approach when players need to take a break from the track. It's a deep dive into the essence of street racing, where the thrill comes from manual gear shifts, strategic lane changes to avoid obstacles, and perfectly timed nitrous boosts. With up to four players, it's not just about the fastest car, it's about the sharpest driver. Drag playlists have also been added to PVP and Free Roam.</li>
<li><strong>League Mode:</strong> In Need for Speed Unbound, The League revives the competitive spirit of Need for Speed Underground and offers a richer solo experience in Free Roam. Challenge new rival racers in head-to-head battles throughout the game to win their unique rides. This feature also introduces a community challenge that requires a collective effort to unlock the final boss and claim a new custom. With Rival Racers appearing regularly and new leagues on the way, this is where strategy, skill, and community come together to push players to earn their place among the legends of street racing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Need for Speed Unbound Vol.7 also adds the BMW M3 Competition Touring '23 and the Ford Mustang Dark Horse '24. These cars are fully customizable and include several unlockable body kit options. Players can get them by completing the Speed Pass and Premium Speed Pass, as outlined below.</p>

            <p>
After completing this morning's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wordle">Wordle</a> I found myself drawn to a "New!" link advertising WordleBot, a smart-sounding addition to The New York Times app which promised to analyse my puzzle solution and compare it with others. (I got today's word in six, for which I'm still feeling a little shameful.)
</p>
<p>
Scrolling through its results I was impressed - not only does WordleBot show how other players began today's game and then narrowed down the solution over subsequent guesses, it also shows how WordleBot itself, programmed with a set of rules and likelihoods, fared too. (WordleBot only got today's word after five guesses, which immediately made me feel a little better.)
</p>
<p>
This was my first experience of WordleBot, a program I now understand has existed for some time online, but has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/crosswords/wordlebot-games-app.html">only this week been added to the New York Times puzzle app</a> - where I play a set routine of Wordle, the Mini Crossword and then (if I'm not running too late by this point) Connections as well.

<p>
Writing back in 2022, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/17/upshot/wordle-wordlebot-new.html?pgtype=Article&amp;action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks">The New York Times</a> described its work-in-progress Wordlebot as "the tool that sometimes uplifts you when you think your Wordle performance has been terrible, and sometimes chides you when you think you've played superbly". And after a pretty poor six-guess run today, I do feel a little better. 
</p>
<p>
To begin with, Wordlebot says my starting guess was strong - but unlucky with today's word. I always pick TEARS, which is a relatively popular choice in the grand scheme of things (a subsequent screen tells me it's 17th out of all possible starting words, though most people pick either ADIEU or AUDIO.
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Untitled-1_sX1BT4B.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>A set of Wordlebot results showing partial guesses to today's Wordle. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer / The New York Times</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Wordlebot always starts with CRANE, a word The New York Times has chosen specifically and has changed over time (it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/10/upshot/wordle-wordlebot-starting-word.html">used to be TRACE</a>, and in hard mode is now TROPE). Interestingly, though, Wordlebot's CRANE was an even tougher pick today, requiring 3.6 guesses to solve versus TEARS' 3.3. (So, at least at that point, I should have beaten Wordlebot! Darn.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Spoiler warning:</strong> From here on out, we show the solution to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wordle-answer-today-21-may-1067-9433">today's Wordle puzzle</a>. Beware!
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Untitled-2_uGeyx6F.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>A set of Wordlebot results showing partial guesses to today's Wordle. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer / The New York Times</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Delving on through each guess, I came to my fourth attempt - PILON - which I'm pretty sure was me just trying random placements for the vowels at this point and not expecting anything to work. Wordlebot is impressed by my knowledge of the word, though happy to tell me it was probably too obscure to be a likely result. Hard agree! 
</p>
<p>
After an unlucky start and some mid-game stumbles, I'm cheered to see Wordlebot also went for BINGO before the ultimate answer DINGO, which I initially discounted for being too obscure to Americans. Ah, well. But, as mentioned, WordleBot still took only one fewer guess to arrive at the right result. It feels like today was a tricky one in general?
</p>
<p>
All in all, it's fascinating stuff - and something I'm going to use in future as I play.  One downside, though - after your first look, Wordlebot reveals itself to be a paid-for feature, so you'll need to stump up £2.99 a month from here on out for more. But hey, if it helps you feel better about your results - and I think I need do - then maybe give it a try?

            <title><![CDATA[Kingdom Hearts Steam Releases Confirmed for Next Month]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-hearts-steam</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-hearts-steam-releases-confirmed-for-next-month.877077/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-hearts-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has revealed that the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>series is making its way to Steam next month, marking the first time it's been available outside of the Epic Games Store on PC.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/kingdom-hearts-pc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a> announcing the Steam releases, Square Enix announces the games will be available on Steam from June 13th and provides a rundown of the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>series as it currently stands (or as close to one as it's possible to provide, anyway).</p>

<p>The three major&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>releases you can currently buy on the Epic Games Store will be available on Steam, but it looks like rhythm-action title&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/kingdom-hearts-melody-of-memory">Melody of Memory</a>&nbsp;</em>is missing out on a Steam release, at least for now.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-hearts-steam-frozen.jpg?itok=9cAWwOG- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-hearts-steam-frozen.jpg?itok=1JjcLajH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Hearts 3&nbsp;</em>and its predecessors are coming to Steam soon.</figcaption></figure><p>So, which games in the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>series are heading to Steam? You'll have to bear with me, because this can get a little complicated.</p>

<p>First up, there's the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX&nbsp;</em>collection. This includes&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts 2</em>, as well as spinoffs <i>Re:Chain of Memories</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Birth by Sleep</em>. It also includes&nbsp;<em>358/2 Days</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Re:Coded&nbsp;</em>in cinematic form.</p>

<p><em>Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue</em>, meanwhile, includes&nbsp;<em>Dream Drop Distance HD</em>, a rework of a game that originally appeared on 3DS in 2012. It also includes an HD movie by the name of&nbsp;<em>Back Cover</em>, as well as a short sequence starring&nbsp;<em>Birth by Sleep</em>'s Aqua.</p>

<p>Lastly, you'll be able to grab&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts 3&nbsp;</em>and its&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/kingdom-hearts-iii-remind-review"><em>Re Mind&nbsp;</em>DLC</a>, which are packaged together in the Steam version.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-hearts-steam-birth-by-sleep-cast.jpg?itok=2FJfSwkG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-hearts-steam-birth-by-sleep-cast.jpg?itok=sJ0ZKjU4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Birth by Sleep&nbsp;</em>is just one of the many&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>spinoffs you'll need to play to fully understand the series' story.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll be able to purchase all of the aforementioned collections separately, but a bundle containing all of them will also be up for grabs. It's called&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece</em>, because of course it is.</p>

<p>If you buy that bundle, you'll get yourself a bonus Keyblade called the Dead of Night. You'll also get that Keyblade if you pick up&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Re Mind</em>, so presumably, the Keyblade is specifically for use in that game.</p>

<p><em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>and its many sequels and spinoffs (although not all of them, unfortunately) make their way to Steam on June 13th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p data-characters="306" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you were expecting a new <em>Helldivers 2 </em>patch to drop today, don’t. In fact, developer Arrowhead Game Studios can’t confirm when its next patch will arrive, with community manager Thomas ‘Twinbeard’ Petersson saying the team wants to “take some more time for this one.”</p> <p data-characters="409" data-current-count="409" data-injectable="true">When asked on Discord (as highlighted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cx45ru/no_patch_today_dont_know_when_next_one_will_be/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>) when players can expect the next patch, Twinbeard only answered with “When it’s done,” adding that future patches may potentially come out less frequently. He explained that the team has felt it’s been putting out patches too often, which risks making it difficult to “maintain the quality standard we want and you deserve.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="424" data-current-count="724" data-injectable="true">Twinbeard’s not exactly wrong. <em>Helldivers 2</em> has seen a near-constant stream of patches since its February launch to address bugs and glitches as well as add new content to the game. As an ongoing live-service, this regularity does seem like it can only be a good thing, but some feel that<em> </em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/is-helldivers-2-pushing-forward-far-too-quickly-for-its-own-good/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Helldivers 2</em> has been growing and updating too quickly</a>, and pushing out so much so often is affecting the quality of the updates.</p>
 <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="268" data-injectable="false">Twinbeard also explained how patching a lot can “easily disrupt work flow and takes more resources than you might think.” This is why the studio is opting to slow things down a bit and stretch the next patch out, “hopefully with a good result.”</p> <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="725" data-injectable="false">Players would need to adjust not having patches drop at least once a week, but it may be beneficial for <em>Helldivers 2</em> in the long run, and allow for more meaningful updates and content additions. It’s strange, though, that what seems like a pretty significant notice for players has been delegated to the Discord channel. There’s no mention of this on the official Twitter account or Steam page, with it falling to fans to spread the word around.</p>

            <p>PlayStation's London Studio has shared a short goodbye with its community, following the announcement of its closure by Sony.</p>
<p>"For over 20 years London Studio has been home to some exceptionally talented and wonderful people in the games industry," it wrote on social media platform X. "As we close the doors, and all go forward to new adventures, we wanted to say a heartfelt thank you, to all our past and present, players and colleagues who have supported us over the years.</p>
<p>"We've had one wild and wonderful journey!"</p>
<p>The studio then signed off with a waving emoji, and a single blue heart.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-laying-off-900-playstation-employees-london-studio-to-close-in-its-entirety">Sony announced it was laying off 900 people</a>, equating to eight percent of its workforce. At this time, it announced it would close London Studio as part of these layoffs.</p>
<p>Ahead of its closure, London Studio was working on an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstations-london-studio-working-on-ps5-online-game">online game for the PlayStation 5</a>, which was going to be set in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstations-london-studio-working-on-online-co-op-combat-game-set-in-fantasy-london">fantasy version of the UK's capital</a>.</p>
<p>In 2022, co-studio heads Stuart Whyte and Tara Saunders shared more details about this game, calling it the team's "most ambitious project to date".</p>
<p>"With this project, we really wanted to explore some new avenues and set ourselves some new challenges," Whyte said. "We definitely wanted to try something a little bit different, and I think this new project really channels our 'brave' value and allows us to push ourselves on the 'curious' front, too. It's an exciting future, it really is."</p>
<p>The studio's earlier games, meanwhile, include the SingStar and EyeToy series, to name but two.</p> <div>

            <p>
Microsoft has shown off how its Copilot AI feature will soon be able to give players a helping hand in games such as Minecraft by offering up real-time advice. 
</p>
<p>

The company shared two videos to its social media account on X last night, demonstrating this feature. In the first video, a person playing Minecraft needs some assistance crafting a sword. 
</p>
<p>

"To craft a sword, you'll need some materials," Copilot says, prompting the player to open their inventory. The Copilot notices the player does not have all the necessary resources available, so offers a suggestion of what to do next.

<p>

A second video shared, still with Minecraft as an example, shows the player being besieged by a zombie. The Copilot once again offers up some useful advice to the player. "Run! You need to get away from it fast. Either sprint away or quickly build a tower of blocks straight up to get out of its reach."

Microsoft's AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman stated this feature is "taking Copilot to the next level" thanks to its real time assistance. 
</p>
<p>
"Real personality. Effortless interactions. The ability to see what we see. I've long argued that AIs with EQ, IQ and AQ are coming. Here's the first real glimpse of what it's gonna feel like," Suleyman wrote. "It's a magical experience: smart, intuitive, natural, and useful."

            <p>
A new report states that 46 percent of players use gaming for self-expression, to ignite their imagination, and for creation.
</p>
<p>
That's according to this year's fifth annual Inside Gaming Report, published by entertainment and gaming wiki Fandom.
</p>
<p>
As well as indicating the prevalence of character creators in games, the results come as little surprise considering the popularity of live-service and sandbox games like Minecraft, Fortnite, and Roblox in which creativity is paramount.
</p>
<figure><div>

<p>

While the top reason why people play games is for stress relief and to unwind at 54 percent, creation and self-expression is the second most likely reason at 46 percent - an increase of 10 percent compared to last year's report. 
</p>
<p>
More specifically, the most popular form of customisation used for self-expression is character personalisation (76 percent), followed by Gamertags and usernames (48 percent) and communication (35 percent).
</p>
<p>
Further, 80 percent of players claim their gaming personality differs from real life, while 64 percent believe it's easier to be themselves online than in person. Of course, games offer a level of fantasy to players, but they're also a powerful way for players to explore an idealised version of themselves.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, 72 percent of respondents surveyed would think more favourably on a brand that allowed a player's online and real-life presence to be aligned, especially players from minority backgrounds.
</p>
<p>
The findings are from a survey of 5000 entertainment and gaming fans, as well as an analysis of first-party data.
</p>
<p>
Key games offering self-expression, according to the report, include the likes of Roblox, Minecraft, Genshin Impact, Grand Theft Auto, Fortnite, The Sims, and Stardew Valley.
</p>
<p>
These rank among the most popular games of the moment, so it's unclear if they are popular due to the inclusion of self-expression, or if self-expression has become more integral for players due to the popularity of these games.
</p>
<p>
Either way, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-might-the-ultimate-character-creator-look-like">character creators are a primary way for players to explore creativity and identity</a>, though diverse representation is required.

</p>
<p>
What's more, these stats play into the popularity of live-service games and developers' concern over their sustainability. 
</p>
<p>
A survey by the Game Developer Collective reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/70-of-developers-concerned-about-sustainability-of-live-service-games-new-study-suggests">70 percent of developers have concerns over the sustainability of live service games</a>, particularly with players losing interest over time as well as competition with other live-service games and rising user acquisition costs.

</p>
<p>
So while players may enjoy these types of games to express themselves, for developers it's a crowded and highly competitive market.

<p data-characters="216" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Call of Duty</em>‘s latest FPS competitor is finally here, and <em>XDefiant</em> not only brings high-octane action to your PC or console, but 13 Trophies that you can also earn to prove you’re a true fan of the game. </p> <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="284" data-injectable="false">For some, collecting Trophies is not just a side-quest on your gaming experience, but a necessity. Some people are simply completionists, and if a game developer puts a challenge in front of them, they just can’t help but grind the game until they’ve ticked them all off. </p> <p data-characters="263" data-current-count="547" data-injectable="true">Truthfully, I’ve never managed to unlock every Trophy for any game, ever, but with just 13 Trophies total, <em>XDefiant</em> might be the first one I manage to do it on. If you want to see the achievements and how to complete them, we’ve created a list below. </p>

 <p data-characters="155" data-current-count="155" data-injectable="false">Thankfully, none of these are too difficult to complete, so getting them all done should be possible, and just requires a little time to get through them. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Does <em>XDefiant</em> have a platinum Trophy?</h2> <p data-characters="248" data-current-count="403" data-injectable="true">No, <em>XDefiant</em> does not feature a platinum Trophy on PlayStation, and will only feature bronze, silver, and gold achievements.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/21/microsoft-announce-ai-copilot-for-pc-and-xbox-games-shoving-ai-into-minecraft/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Microsoft has presented their next generation AI enhanced PC’s and Surface tablets, and along with it the reveal that their AI Copilot software will soon be embedded in PC and Xbox games. The first will be Minecraft and you can see it in action in the short video below.</p>
<p>https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1792630909151133768</p>


<p>Microsoft has been aggressively pursuing AI over the past couple of years, investing billions into OpenAI, adding it to their Bing search engine and trying to find ways to apply it to Windows, Office and now Xbox gaming.</p>
<p>As you can see form the Minecraft demo, the player can simply use their own voice to ask for help within the game and Copilot will tell them exactly what they need to do with natural language interactions. In this instance, Copilot can be asked for a crafting recipe and the AI will check you have everything needed in your inventory, guide you through collecting anything else you need, and take you step-by-step through the process of crafting a sword.</p>
<p>it’s a clever demo that will send a shiver down the spine of gaming sites that rely on guides to be profitable, but there’s a lot of question marks for how this will actually work. Microsoft is putting an emphasis on privacy, which will mean that Copilot tools will try to run locally before polling the cloud, and that will require dedicated hardware with new chips featuring an NPU (Neural Processing Unit) – the demos used PCs with Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon X Elite chips featuring a hefty built-in NPU.</p>

<p>There’s also other things to overcome. For an AI to be useful, it also needs to be all-knowing and always available. While AIs can analyse what they see on screen, that will be a much more intensive process than having APIs and direct hooks into the backend of a game – otherwise they can’t really know what’s in your full inventory, where you are on the world map you are, what the quest steps are or anything else that they need. Game developers and engine developers will probably need to put in the systems for AI to interact with.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day, gaming AIs will also need to have all the answers, and who’s going to give these to them? If game guides become unprofitable (which they would do if everyone just asked AI what to do instead of visiting websites) then sites would stop publishing them… but without the game guides, the AI has nothing to reference and could give players the wrong information. And so it’ll then be up to the game developers to provide them, but devs have enough on their plate just making the games. Sony already has a developer-led video hints and tips system built into the PS5 system software for trophies, but they’re far from universal.</p>
<p>Then there’s Microsoft’s rivals. They can put this into all their games and systems, but they’re in third place this generation, and who knows what their future games business is going to look like? If Sony and Nintendo don’t put AI assistants in their future games consoles and chipsets, then third party developers almost certainly won’t bother. It’s not like Sony or Nintendo are going to use MIcrosoft’s AI for that anyway.</p>
<p>This definitely feels like the way things are going, but Microsoft’s vision for what AI assistants will be like when added into video games still has a long way to go.</p>

            <p>The music in haunting 2D <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/norco">Norco</a> was so good it’s one of the few soundtracks I’ve actually bought on Steam, so I’m deeply intrigued to learn that developer Geography of Robots are putting music - and dancing - front and center in the new demo for their next project, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silenus">Silenus</a>. You can bop your way between screens, reader!</p>

<p>Swapping out Norco’s Southern gothic for techno industrial (also somewhat gothic) vibes, Silenus offers the chance to “uncover the secrets of an oil refinery operated by an obscure organization in this short, atmospheric narrative adventure.” Don’t take my word about Steam’s word about the developer’s word on it, though, that’d be sheer madness. There’s a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2927440/Silenus/">free demo </a>available. I initially thought the choice to name it the ‘Umbilical Pre-Release Demo’ was just the devs being arty. But it actually refers to the album Umbilical from contributors Thou, who did loads of Norco’s soundtrack. By playing the demo, you’ll be able to unlock the entire album to listen to in-game. Creatives creatively boosting the creative work of other creatives? What is this, some sort of good timeline?</p>
<p>Here are some more Steam deets:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rubens Link, an enigmatic company with an unclear agenda, has taken control of the Gulf Flow oil refinery. Officially, they're introducing new automation technologies, but the changes they've implemented suggest something more confounding. In this narrative micro-adventure, you play as Titian, Rubens Link's flagship android. Explore the refinery’s machinery, tank farms, and offices, deciphering clues from computer logs, discarded journals, and the remnants of vanished workers. Solve puzzles, absorb the atmospheric soundscapes of FmAura &amp; Gewgawly I, interact with unique characters, and wander deeper down the rabbit hole of Gulf Flow Oil.</p></blockquote>
<p>I was going to do a bit about ‘Reuben’s link’ but I already linked the demo. Not a massive loss for comedy, honestly. For what it’s worth, I loved Norco to haunted little bits. It was a brilliantly written 2D adventure set in  South Louisiana that makes me want to use words like 'hauntological' and such. Silenus is in 3D and takes a completely different visual approach, but as much as I’d have eaten up another offering in Norco’s vein, it’s great to see Geography of Robots not pigeonholing themselves this early. Silenus is currently “very early in development”, which gives you enough room to go play Norco. Twice!</p>

            <p>I could pretend I understand Square Enix's action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> series Kingdom Hearts, but I don't need to, 'cos what I do understand is how popular it is. Until fairly recently the nearly 15-game-strong series, where Disney characters cross over with Final Fantasy and go to war alongside a child wielding a key (I said I don't properly understand it), wasn't on PC. After some games arrived on the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/browse?q=kingdom%20hearts&amp;sortBy=relevancy&amp;sortDir=DESC&amp;count=40">Epic Games Store</a> in 2021, Squeenix <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/kingdom-hearts-pc">have confirmed</a> that multiple Kingdom Hearts games are coming to Steam next month, on June 13th. Unlucky for some, maybe, but not Donald Duck and Goofy, two of the main characters. Long has Goofy been seen as just a joke character in the minds of people people who didn't watch A Goofy Movie. Hopefully this brings his heroism to a wider audience.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The titles coming to Steam are Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX, Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue, and Kingdom Hearts III + Re Mind DLC, which doesn't sound like a lot until you realise they're compilations that each contain several games therein. You could also get the Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece, a bundle containing all three. At this point making jokes about Kingdom Hearts' naming conventions is about as tired as calling the actor who plays Dr. Strange "Englebort Cucumberthatch" or whatever, so I will just point you to <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/kingdom-hearts-pc">Squeenix's post about it</a>, which has a pretty comprehensive breakdown of what is in which compliation. </p>
<p>To expand on my glib summary in the intro, Kingdom Hearts is actually about a young man with huge gloves called Sora, who becomes a hero in the first game when his homeland is almost consumed by a faction of evil goons called the Heartless. The Heartless are also encroaching on the Disney kingdom (ruled by King Mickey, obviously), and Donald Duck and Goofy are sent to find Sora. The series continues from there with many subplots involving Disney villains, new enemies, quests for special weapons, and so on. The popularity of the series, which plays quite like Final Fantasy, as I understand it, is in part because there are extremely dramatic scenes featuring love, loss, sacrifice, and so on, and, like, a cartoon duck without pants on is just there. Which, to be fair, is a good pitch.</p>
<p>Look out for Kingdom Hearts on Steam on June 13th</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-may-only-deliver-4k-30-fps-with-nvidia-dlss-but-it-would-be-a-%E2%80%9Cmisuse%E2%80%9D-of-the-upscaler.877017/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-4k-30-fps-dlss-misuse/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 may be able to deliver only 4K resolution, 30 frames per second gameplay with NVIDIA DLSS, but we are unlikely to see this scenario much, as it would be a "misuse" of the upscaler.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel">Digital Foundry</a> discussed if the next Nintendo console could be able to deliver 4K, 60 FPS gameplay with NVIDIA DLSS in a new video. The consensus seems it won't be able to for a few reasons. Upscaling to 4K resolution is more expensive than upscaling to 1080p and 1440p resolutions, and it would be an extremely large part of the frametime of a game, leaving 60 FPS off the table. Given how Nintendo tries to go for 60 FPS in most of its games, it is unlikely they will go for 30 FPS to have NVIDIA DLSS upscale to 4K resolution.</p>
<p>How 4K, 60 FPS is likely not viable on the Nintendo Switch 2 was also highlighted in a previous test where Digital Foundry attempted to replicate the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-chip-hardly-match-xbox-series-s/">T239 chip</a> that will power the system. In this test, upscaling from 720p to 4K with DLSS Ultra Performance in Death Stranding added 18.3 milliseconds to frametime over native resolution, which would fail to deliver a 60 FPS experience. Upscaling to 1440p, on the other hand, looks way more viable, as it only added 7.7 milliseconds over native 720p resolution. As such, 4K, 30 FPS could be doable, but it would be a misuse of the upscaler, having over half GPU time spent on just upscaling. Such a high fixed cost on the GPU would also be difficult for developers to work around and greatly limit what they could achieve on the system.</p>

<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is said to support Ray Reconstruction alongside NVIDIA DLSS, which would make it the best ray tracing-capable gaming console to date. Hopefully, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-release-march-2025/">it won't take much longer</a> to see how these technologies will be used to deliver a next-gen Nintendo gaming experience.</p>

            <link>https://www.gamesindustry.biz/getting-developers-started-with-gamemaker</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/getting-developers-started-with-gamemaker.877014/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/getting-developers-started-with-gamemaker<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>Gurpreet Singh Matharoo talks us through how the company is making it easier for newcomers to get to grips with the 2D-centric game engine</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>It’s been almost 25 years since Dutch professor Mark Overmars created GameMaker, a game engine primarily devoted to 2D graphics and sprites.</p>
<p>While major engines like Unity and Unreal Engine also offer 2D tools in addition to cutting-edge visuals, GameMaker keeps things simple with its drag-and-drop visual scripting tool. Its 2D focus has helped small teams create incredible experiences like Hyper Light Drifter, Hotline Miami, Chicory: A Colorful Tale, and Undertale.</p>
<p>GameMaker also saw a boost in awareness and use last year; just as Unity walked into a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/unitys-pricing-is-a-symptom-not-the-cause-of-tougher-times-ahead-for-the-games-industry-opinion">massive pricing controversy</a> last year, GameMaker flipped the script and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gamemaker-offers-more-free-options-for-non-commercial-use">made its tech free</a> for all non-commercial use.</p>
<p>We sat down with Gurpreet Singh Matharoo, a lead technical writer at GameMaker, to discuss how GameMaker plans to entice developers who weren't fans of the Unity fiasco. Matharoo works in the team responsible for the company’s documentation in addition to video content on their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GameMakerEngine">YouTube channel</a>, "aimed primarily at first-timers to GameMaker."</p>
<p>Matharoo was quick to state that it’s "not particularly hard to create documentation and fill it with information"; instead the challenge lies in "making it easily digestible for new users, while keeping it informative for seasoned developers."</p>
<p>"For new users, I ensure that my writing (and that of my staff) is made up of short paragraphs, uses simple words that a fourth-grader could understand, and gets to the point," he said.</p>
<p>Nurturing new talent is an imperative that is becoming increasingly important as established studios engage in layoffs across the industry. Despite rising profits and popularity, the age-old question of '<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-gieditorial-061006">What's a young person hoping for a career in this sector meant to believe?</a>' rears its ugly head.</p>
<p>While an indie gold rush would be held back by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-current-state-of-games-investment">investor caution</a>, there’s no denying that making games and creating them is becoming more accessible outside Western markets. GameMaker has its sights on a larger slice of an expanding pie.</p>
<p>"Developers can now export their [GameMaker] games to all desktop platforms, web, Android and iOS for free, for non-commercial use,’ Matharoo notes.</p>
<p>"Commercial exports are now a $100 one-time purchase, and half the price on Steam for Indian users. With GameMaker more financially accessible, I hope more people will adopt it as one of their engines."</p>
<blockquote><p>"The time cost for making 3D games and financial cost of learning the required skills is high. 2D development is easier and achievable on more affordable machines"</p></blockquote>
<p>Regional pricing can make all the difference, especially in countries that are beginning to embrace game subscriptions and digital purchases. But <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/not-everyone-bows-to-the-inevitability-of-subscription-models-opinion">not everyone’s sold</a> on this mode of expansion. Even fewer creators are optimistic about emerging tech like AI and NFTs.</p>
<p>As GameMaker’s parent company <a href="https://press.opera.com/2023/02/27/opera-openai-collaboration-announcement/">Opera collaborates with OpenAI</a>, the game engine is also poised to implement AI, reportedly without sacrificing individual expression. The official GameMaker roadmap suggests that this AI assistant is still a work in progress. If done right, it could help novices as they build their first game. But there’s enough <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ai-online-platform-regulation-and-loot-boxes-legal-trends-to-watch-in-2024#section-1">evidence of malpractice and talent theft</a> that any AI implementation warrants extra scrutiny.</p>
<p>Another aspect of GameMaker’s approach to accessibility is effective documentation. Matharoo mentions that, for newcomers and experienced users alike, "you don’t want to hide anything." When it comes to deconstructing technical concepts, Matharoo relies on one word: dissection.</p>
<p>"When a set of features is presented to me [to document], it’s usually a full page of information presented in no particular order," he tells us. "It’s a substantial task to digest all that information and understand it fully. Once I have an understanding of the subject matter, I create a document and compartmentalize everything into separate sections and sub-sections."</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/gamemaker_aornouB.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>GameMaker made its engine free for non-commercial use in the wake of the Unity Runtime Fee fiasco</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Focusing on "crucial steps to use the system for the first time" and "anything that impacts their use of the system" helps Matharoo design a "beginner-friendly guide that even non-beginners can benefit from."</p>
<p>"I first make a high-level plan of what I’m going to document. I usually divide all information into separate pages. I ensure each page is clean and digestible, and don’t hesitate to add another page if it makes things simpler. Using links is also important, as it’s an invitation to the reader to read more."</p>
<blockquote><p>"I hope more people within the industry educate others about game development and push schools to include game-making in their curriculum"</p></blockquote>
<p>Matharoo likens it to going "deep into a Wikipedia rabbit hole."</p>
<p>As an engine geared towards 2D development, it’s no surprise that GameMaker is finding a user base in emerging markets.</p>
<p>"The time cost for developing 3D games and the financial cost of learning the required skills is high," Matharoo tells us. "2D development, on the other hand, is easier to kickstart and is achievable on more affordable machines. For developers with a passion for 2D games, that is all they need. That is where GameMaker supports the indie heart of India. The program is easy to access (Windows, Mac, and Linux) and does not require a particularly strong system. We even have a Chromebook beta!"</p>
<p>Despite the layoffs and the turbulent weather faced by the gaming industry, Matharoo remains optimistic. He believes that game development is "an incredibly fun hobby, and as an ever-growing industry, a perfectly viable career path."</p>
<p>"As a fun way to learn problem-solving, programming, art, music, and many other skills, it’s incredibly fruitful," he concludes. "I hope that more people within the industry educate others about game development and push our schools to include game-making as part of their curriculum."</p>

<p data-characters="282" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Zombies</em> players are some of <em>Call of Duty</em>‘s most passionate fans, but with the release of the <em>MW3</em> Season 4 roadmap, those fans are slamming Sledgehammer for the lack of content for the mode, calling it “pathetic” and claiming that the dev has given up on the game. </p> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">Activision dropped the Season 4 roadmap on Monday, May 20, giving fans a look at what’s coming to both <em>MW3</em> and <em>Warzone</em>. With the major <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/yes-its-real-gundam-is-coming-to-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Gundam</em> crossover</a> and the return of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-is-the-kar98k-coming-to-warzone-mw3-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kar98k</a> sniper on the way, there’s been big disappointment among <em>Zombies</em> fans who got just one small square in the roadmap. </p> <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="683" data-injectable="true">Unstable Rift is the sole addition to <em>Zombies</em>, which will see players go through a portal and head to a new location to fight off a large horde of zombies to earn rewards during matches. Not only are <em>Zombies </em>fans disappointed in this offering, but the fact that it’s an in-season inclusion and won’t be available when <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-season-4-early-patch-notes-new-maps-modes-killstreaks-and-equipment-items/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4</a> launches has really riled them up. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>You’ll need to search for <em>Zombies</em>. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="555" data-injectable="true">In a post on the official <em>Zombies</em> subreddit, players were quick to slam Sledgehammer for the lack of content, with punchrockchest calling it the “worst update ever,” while –ULTRA– labeled the lack of content “pathetic.”</p>
 <p data-characters="519" data-current-count="519" data-injectable="true">“This is just sad at this point,” bemoaned Fall_Cake. “I feel so depressed looking at that.” For many, the fact that <em>Zombies</em> as a mode takes up less space on the roadmap than Ranked Play rewards and even new Killstreaks for multiplayer is a sign of how little the dev team cares about the mode, with one particularly frustrated player writing: “Remember when they said that the amount of Zombies content in Season 1 is what we should expect for every season? Aged like f**king milk.”</p>
 <p data-characters="320" data-current-count="320" data-injectable="false">Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like things are going to get better either, with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/treyarch-focusing-on-cod-2024-not-working-on-mw3-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Treyarch no longer working on the mode</a> as they focus on this year’s <em>Call of Duty</em> release. For <em>MW3 Zombies</em>, it seems like time is truly up, and no major updates are coming down the pipe for the rest of the game’s lifespan. </p>

            <p>Nintendo has made its first acquisition in two years.</p>
<p>The company has entered a deal with embattled Swedish games company Embracer to purchase Shiver Entertainment, a studio responsible for porting the likes of Mortal Kombat 1 and Hogwarts Legacy onto Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>On the deal's completion, which is "pending satisfaction" of all relevant customary closing conditions, Nintendo will acquire 100 percent of Shiver's outstanding shares, making it a wholly owned subsidiary.</p>

<p>"By welcoming Shiver's experienced and accomplished development team, Nintendo aims to secure high-level resources for porting and developing software titles," Nintendo said in its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/240521e.pdf">notice of acquisition</a>.</p>
<p>"Going forward, even after it becomes a part of the Nintendo group, Shiver's focus will remain the same, continuing commissions that port and develop software for multiple platforms including Nintendo Switch."</p>

Prior to these acquisitions, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-buying-luigis-mansion-3-developer-next-level-games">Nintendo also purchased Next Level Games</a> - the studio behind Luigi's Mansion 3 - in 2021.</p>
<p>Resharing Nintendo's notice of acquisition on social media platform X, Embracer thanked "all the great people at Shiver for their contribution".</p> <div>

<p>Following the collapse of<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-shares-plummet-after-proposed-2bn-partnership-collapses"> a $2bn "major strategic partnership" last May</a>, Embracer began a "comprehensive restructuring programme".

<p>
Phew. That's <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/kingdom-hearts-pc">a lot of games</a>. We don't yet know the prices as they're currently not listed on Steam for pre-order or wishlist.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the next question is which of these to start with? Maybe just start from the top and work down?

<p>
If you're completely unfamiliar with the series, it originated on PS2 as a unique Final Fantasy meets Disney action-RPG, but has since expanded into a huge series of other games with a twisting, convoluted storyline that's taken on a life of its own.
</p>
<p>
The games are already available on PS4, Xbox One and Switch (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-back-catalogue-coming-to-nintendo-switch">poorly received cloud gaming versions</a>), as well as PC via the Epic Games Store.

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-4-is-officially-on-the-way">Kingdom Hearts 4</a> is also on the way, revealed in 2022 with a new trailer for the series' 20th anniversary. Director Tetsuya Nomura has said his team is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nomura-trying-to-find-a-good-balance-of-final-fantasy-characters-in-kingdom-hearts-4">"trying to find a good balance" of Final Fantasy characters in the game</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/risk-of-rain-2">Risk Of Rain 2</a> is one of my fave <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> roguelikes, as it's a good time with pals and has all the hallmarks of things I enjoy most in my games: shooting and looting. That's why the latest free update excites me so, as it introduces an artifact that makes chests malicious and another that lets you hatch angry lizard companions. Oh, and there's a new map, too.</p>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/632360/view/4184483630843392751">The Devotion Update</a>, AKA version 1.10, adds two new Artifacts - run modifiers, basically. The first of these is called the Artifact Of Delusion, which resets all chests once a teleporter event has finished (i.e., once you've killed a stage boss). You'll have a chance to return to chests you'd previously cracked open, but if you do, you'll be presented with three options: the item you were originally granted, and two you definitely weren't. If you remember what that specific chest gave you, then you'll get another! But if you don't, you'll lose the item entirely. My short term memory couldn't cope with this.</p>
<p>The other Artifact sounds like a winner, though. It's called the Artifact Of Devotion and it replaces drones (turrets, helpful healy bots etc.) with eggs that spawn Lemurian pals (little lizard guys). You'll need to sacrifice an item to hatch a lizard friend and if multiple Lemurians are present, items are shared between all of them. If a Lemurian survives a teleporter event, it'll grow stronger, giving them new attributes, plus an extra stack of whatever item you sacrificed to birth them. If they die, they'll drop a scrap of the same tier of item they were given and their item is straight up removed from the pool (ouch?). As someone who loves AI companions, I can't wait to raise my own lizardy guy.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, there's a new map called Verdant Falls to explore. It looks all lush and green with the odd waterfall, so that's me sold on it. There's also a new Mercenary skin that lets you dress up as the guy from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a>, and that I'm sort of indifferent about, but hey, it's a nice touch if you are a fan of Dead Cells Man.</p>
<p>Risk Of Rain 2's next DLC, Seekers Of The Storm, is "coming soon," so you may want to keep up with its progress over on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2306620/Risk_of_Rain_2_Seekers_of_the_Storm/">Steam page</a>. It'll add new maps, playable characters, items and more.</p>

            <p>The neighbourhood citizens of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-by-you-release-date">Life By You</a> are positioning themselves as bright-eyed pretenders to The Sims. But in this ultimate game of keeping-up-with-the-Jones, the life sim from Paradox has slipped on a wet kitchen tile. The game has been delayed for a third time, and the developers are reluctant to set a new date for the planned release into early access. "[We] believe it is more prudent to hold off while we plan ahead," said Mattias Lilja of Paradox Interactive, "rather than committing to a new date that we cannot be certain to meet." </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"After much consideration, we regret to announce that we have decided to retract Life by You’s Early Access release date, previously set for June 4th," said <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/media/update-on-life-by-yous-early-access-release-date">the announcement from Paradox's deputy CEO</a>. "This was not an easy decision, especially since we understand the anticipation and excitement that many players have for the game. However, we believe that additional development time is needed."</p>

<p>Announced in March last year, the game was originally set to launch in September 2023. But was then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-by-you-early-access-launch-delayed-until-march-2024">delayed into March 2024</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-by-yous-early-access-release-gets-another-delay-to-june-4th">once again to June</a>. </p>
<p>This might be understandable, given the scope of the game's goals to create a town-sized simulation in which all NPCs can be possessed at a moments notice. Life By You is hoping to distinguish itself from The Sims with deeper customisation and pawns whose powerful command of actual human language (as opposed to Simlish babble) allows them to live out deep and fulfilling lives. Katharine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-by-yous-humans-are-always-watching-you-and-some-of-them-can-be-real-creepy-about-it">saw a demo last year</a> in which she witnessed "a conga line of complete strangers who followed our demo character home and stood around her in an ominous circle while she was trying to do some gardening". Uh.</p>
<p>But she was also impressed by the scale and ambition of the sim. According to the developer, players will be able to edit and create quests, write their own character dialogue, come up with new traits, and directly control the characters in a third-person view, among many other mod-friendly tools. When you'll be able to do this, of course, we no longer know.</p>
<p>The Sims 4 was one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">best management games</a> but we don't yet know when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sims-5-everything-we-know">The Sims 5</a> will be coming out either, so I guess Paradox technically is keeping up. Life By You isn't the only one treading on EA's toes, however. There is also indie contender <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paralives">Paralives</a> to consider, which is due out some time next year. </p>

			<p>CD Projekt RED proudly announced that Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty has won awards for Best Polish Game and Best Polish Narrative at this year's Digital Dragons.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar, the <a href="https://conference.digitaldragons.pl/dd-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Dragons Awards</a> are the oldest and most prestigious awards in the Polish games industry. The winners are selected by the votes of experts appointed to the jury and the entire game development community. The gala, which took place on Monday, May 20, was right in the middle of the three-day-long Game Development Conference, one of the largest events of its kind in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>The Best Polish Narrative Award was received by Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Open World Designer Jakub Tomczak and Quest Designer Maria Mazur. The game was also nominated for Best Polish Game Audio, Best Polish Game Visual Art, and Best Polish Game Design awards.</p>
<p>Here's the full list of Digital Dragons winners:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best Polish Game - Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty</li>
<li>Best Polish Game Design - Against the Storm</li>
<li>Best Polish Game Visual Art - Inkulinati</li>
<li>Best Polish Game Audio - The Invincible</li>
<li>Best Polish Narrative - Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty</li>
<li>Best Polish Mobile Game - Hero Legacy</li>
<li>Best Foreign Game - Baldur's Gate 3</li>
</ul>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty launched in late September to great reviews, completing the game's comeback alongside the free 2.0 update. I <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> in my review:</p>
<p><em>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty builds upon what was an already great game to deliver more fantastic storytelling (with a spy thriller theme, this time around), exciting combat, and very high-quality side content. The perk tree overhaul is a major improvement to progression, and additions like vehicle combat and the overhauled police system are very welcome, albeit not game-changing. If you've been holding out on Cyberpunk 2077 until now, you'll find a huge game with over 120 hours of quality content and an incredibly immersive game world to literally lose yourself in. On top of that, it's by far the most beautiful and technically advanced game available if you have the hardware for it (PC and RTX 40 GPU).</em></p>
<p>The game went on to sell <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-has-sold-more-than-5-million-units-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over five million units in 2023</a>. CD Projekt RED is now busy with the next The Witcher game, but they are also already planning the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel currently codenamed Project Orion. It will be made at their Boston studio, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-project-orion-gets-high-profile-hires/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently bolstered</a> by recruiting many high-profile industry veterans.</p>

    <p id="t0Af6B">Happy Cool Sword Day to all that celebrate. What, you forgot?</p>
<p id="paAPG3">We get it. It’s easy to forget Cool Sword Day, the #1 holiday dedicated to cool swords in all walks of media, because it arrives in the lead up to the “more legitimate” national holiday of Memorial Day. But that doesn’t mean it deserves any less effort or observation. After years of overlooking Cool Sword Day ourselves, Polygon decided we would finally step up in 2024 and do Cool Sword Day right. </p>
<p id="hyQKH2">Here’s what you can expect from Cool Sword Day: some cool flippin’ swords!!!!! You will find us dissecting the big-boi magnitude of <em>Elden Ring</em> and <em>Monster Hunter</em>’s greatswords, writing love letters to <em>World of Warcraft</em> blades, rattling off some need-to-know sword trivia, talking to real-life swordmakers, and cementing lists of swords for the history books. Cool Sword Day demands cool sword coverage, so that’s what we did.</p>
<p id="3dr21P">You won’t find much Cool Sword Day coverage on other sites, perhaps because they’ve gone all in on [checks notes] <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/fun/talk-like-yoda-day">Talk Like Yoda Day</a>? With all due respect to the Jedi master, there are more cool swords out there than just lightsabers, and the world needs to know. Polygon is on the case this Cool Sword Day.</p>

  <p id="H36ijC">Weapons maker <a href="https://sabersmith.com/">Sabersmith</a> is a unicorn, according to general manager Mark Lienhart.  Founded in the 1990s by Tim Lawler, the manufacturer does all of its own work in its well-equipped 15,000 square-foot facility located in Sunfield, Michigan. That makes it the single largest manufacturer of 100% American-made swords in the country.</p>
<p id="dKU31T">“Last year alone I think we built over 2,500 swords,” Lienhart said. “It was over 7,000 weapons total, including knives, swords, polearms. The whole kit and caboodle.”</p>
<p id="guPt9s">On the occasion of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23922505">Cool Sword Day</a>, Polygon called on Lienhart to answer a simple question: What is the coolest sword to make? The answer surprised us. No, it wasn’t the hand-and-a-half or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2015/8/19/9165933/knight-classes-inside-chicagos-only-school-for-medieval-longsword">Italian longswords</a> that are so ubiquitous in cosplay, nor was it the gently curving Japanese katana. Instead, it was something far older.</p>

<p id="4DHTyO">“My favorite sword, hands down, has always been the gladius,” Lienhart said. The shortsword was the standard sidearm of the Roman legion, who attacked with it using quick thrusting motions from behind locked shields. But it’s not Lienhart’s favorite because of its martial past. Instead, it’s in part because of Sabersmith’s uniquely modern design.</p>
<p id="1acx5i">Turns out that, just like the food portions here in America, our swords are also bigger than average.</p>
<p id="I1mKy1">“Our customers are obviously American men and women,” Lienhart explained. “A traditional Roman gladius [...] was made for the Roman legion. My customer base is, on average, six inches taller than a Roman legionnaire. So why wouldn’t I proportionally make that sword fit my customers?”</p>
<p id="ydbsCY">There are traditionalists who might look down on these kinds of modern adaptations, but for Lienhart it’s right in line with his company’s overall philosophy.</p>

<p id="7nc8LK">“We do what we refer to as a combination of historical and modern techniques,” Lienhart said. That ethos extends beyond the design of the weapons to the manufacturing process as well. His factory floor obviously includes a traditional hammer and anvil, but it also has a high-pressure water jet for cutting large pieces of metal to shape. Instead of a coal-fired forge, he uses a vat of molten salt heated to more than 15,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Sabersmith even recently purchased a few computer-controlled milling machines for doing things like engraving and cutting fullers — long, deep channels in the blade that reduce weight and enable more elasticity in the final product.</p>
<p id="Aa6TPo">Despite those modern tools and processes, Lienhart says that “the core of swordmaking really hasn’t changed all that much” since the 1500s. All of Sabersmith’s pieces feature the same parts that you’d find on an historical blade — including a full “tang” that runs from the blade all the way through the handle. That’s what makes them “battle ready.”</p>
<p id="1uelqa">What’s his second favorite sword to make? Lienhart said it’s the Egyptian khopesh. The one-handed blade is just a little bit shorter than a gladius, but it features an aggressively curved blade in the shape of a half-moon. It’s a design you simply don’t see much of anymore.</p>

<p id="gi5TaL">“That blade [shape] did not end up sticking around long-term,” Lienhart notes, but it is nonetheless “a really cool blade.”</p>
<p id="BCyN4C">You can find Sabersmith’s work online, where dozens of models are ready to ship. Built-to-order swords are also available, which allow customers to choose everything from the color of the leather wrapping on the handle to the tint of the steel blade itself. You can also find Sabersmith on the Renaissance fair circuit, including a booth opening up July 6 at<a href="https://renfair.com/bristol/"> Bristol Renaissance Faire</a> in southern Wisconsin.</p>
<p id="y5pzaE">Just be careful. Everything on display is razor sharp.</p>
<p id="sEBec1">“I do dull ones on request,” Lienhart said, “instead of the other way around.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24156656/three-swords-at-once-tri-wielders-zoro-nightcrawler<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="IZwGkG">Cool Sword Day gives us plenty to celebrate each year. Meteorite swords. Video game swords. People commissioning swords from local swordsmiths. There are so many cool swords, you might be tempted to use two of them at the same time.</p>
<p id="Er6n2X">But to paraphrase Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker in the (sword-less) masterpiece <em>The Social Network</em>: You know what’s cooler than two swords? Three swords.</p>
<p id="y0GREf">Roronoa Zoro understands this. The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/23845804/one-piece-explained-anime-manga-netflix-live-action"><em>One Piece</em></a><em> </em>legend has never been content to let something as trivial as “only having two arms” hold him back from greatness. That’s what your mouth is for (another sword). </p>
<p id="00HORs">(<em>One Piece creator </em><a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/what-is-one-piece#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIn%20Japan%20there%20was%20a,giving%20him%20one%20additional%20sword.%E2%80%9D">Eiichiro Oda has said</a> that making Zoro a tri-wielder was a way to one-up legendary Japanese swordsman Musashi Miyamoto, considered one of the greatest to ever wield a blade. “He was known for using two swords. My childish idea was to simply make Zoro even greater by giving him one additional sword.”)</p>
<p id="eT9TyY">Nightcrawler understands this. Ain’t nothing in the Bible says <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhuyJ3SsLic&amp;pp=ygUVbmlnaHRjcmF3bGVyIDMgc3dvcmRz">you can’t wield a third sword with your tail</a>. Nightcrawler would know, he reads that thing every night.</p>

<p id="avZ5JU">General Grievous, the overachiever, understands this, using not two, not three, but <em>four </em>lightsabers. He gets eliminated on a technicality from this discussion — lightsabers aren’t swords, and having four arms makes this a whole lot easier — but his effort is appreciated nonetheless.</p>
<p id="VmQVv1">Shout out to these heroes (and villain) for their efforts in moving the sword game forward in fiction. It’s a tragically underserved character choice, but Zoro and Nightcrawler are more than happy to shoulder that burden. Please, if there are more characters you love who wield more than two swords at once, tell me in the comments. I anxiously await your response.</p>

<p data-characters="236" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After already being turned into a two-part movie, the sci-fi slice of life manga series <em>Dead Dead Demons Dededede Destruction</em> is getting a TV adaptation too. And unlike the movies, this adaptation is getting an official Western release.</p> <p data-characters="427" data-current-count="427" data-injectable="true">Even better is that the show is starting very soon, with the first episode premiering on Crunchyroll on Thursday, May 23 at 8pm PT / 10pm CT / 11pm ET (any UK readers will need to wait until 4am BST on May 24). There will be 18 episodes in total airing weekly and the show promises to feature “brand new footage” not seen in the movies. So, even those who’ve watched both movies have a reason to check it out.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="461" data-current-count="761" data-injectable="true">In case you’re unfamiliar with the original manga, <em>Dead Dead Demons Dededede Destruction</em> begins with an alien spaceship appearing above Tokyo. However, that’s not the focus of the story, with it jumping ahead three years later and centering around the normal lives of high school girls Kadode Koyama and Oran “Ontan” Nakagawa as they learn about growing up, adult life, and how the supposed alien invaders may not be the true threat to humanity.</p>
 <p data-characters="585" data-current-count="585" data-injectable="true">Just like the movies, production has been handled by Production +h, with Tomoyuki Kurokawa as director, a screenplay by Reiko Yoshida, and music by Taro Umebayashi. All three held the same roles for the movies, so things should feel consistent between the two adaptations. Voice actors Lilas Ikuta and ano have also reprised their roles as the two leads, Kadode and Oran. There’s so far no mention of whether the show will get an English dub, but there’s little reason not to watch it regardless, especially since there’s no sign of the two movies ever leaving Japan.</p>
 <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false">Written by Inio Asano, the original <em>Dead Dead Demons Dededede Destruction</em> manga ran from 2014 to 2022, and has sold over three million copies. At San Diego Comic-Con in 2018, it was named one of the year’s Best New Manga and was nominated for an Eisner Award in 2019.</p>

            <p>To borrow a tired Xitterism: The Venn diagram between ‘games that have reference points outside of other games’ and ‘games I’m likely to get excited about’ is a circle. For the benefit of people who’ve discovered the one weird trick that therapists hate and improved their mental health tenfold by deleting the bad place, here’s an incredibly cool thread I stumbled upon this morning where indie developers share non-game influences on their projects.</p>

<p>Using variations on the line ‘The indie game we’re making and three of the non-game inspirations behind it”, devs are sharing their projects alongside the films, books, shows, and real-world happenings that have influenced the direction of their WIPs or released projects. Kicking things off with the place I first discovered the trend, here’s Dan Martin of this month’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/rps-game-club">RPS Game Club</a> pick, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deathbulge-battle-of-the-bands">Deathbulge: Battle Of The Bands</a>.</p>

<p>The keen-eyed among you will also spot <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crow-country">Crow Country</a>’s creative lead Adam Viet  as the quote-Xeet, although I am not smart enough to recognise any of the references. Why couldn’t you have been like Dan and just cite Peep Show and Big Mouth Billy Bass?</p>
<p>Here’s Sega Rally homage <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/over-jump-rally">Over Jump Rally</a>, which Graham has been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/over-jump-rallys-demo-is-a-fan-created-homage-to-sega-rally">eyeing up lovingly</a>, with theirs, including Manga series Initial D.</p>

<p>There’s also the lovely two-for-one bonus of this kind of trend, where you get to not only learn more about the games you have heard of, but hopefully discover a few hidden gems along the way. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paleophage">Paleophage</a> was not on my radar. And now it is. Because it’s a Dino Crisis homage.</p>

<p>There’s plenty of responses already, so do go have a nostril and let me know if you dig up anything <em>spectacular</em>. I’d say it all left me feeling both inspired and a bit like a cultureless ogre, but that is every day.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-review.876951/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Watching Senua emerge from a shipwreck onto the shoreline bruised, bloodied, and struggling to breathe immediately drags us back into the depths of desperation and despair of Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II’s psychosis-affected lead from the outset. What follows is a supremely taut, six-hour tour across the human realm of Midgard that’s conveyed through staggeringly vivid action sequences, stunning Nordic-inspired locations, and intense encounters with towering terrors intimidating enough to make a Viking mess their furs. Hellblade II serves up another satisfyingly brutal and consistently enthralling heroine’s journey, even if its streamlined swordfighting favours cinematic spectacle over substantial gameplay depth.</p><p>Although it’s been some seven years since <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice">Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice</a>, the events of Hellblade II take place shortly after the original’s vengeful highway to Helheim, with Hel’s belle now feeling empowered by her psychosis rather than encumbered with it. (Suffice it to say, if you’re jumping into Senua’s story here then the included story recap is mandatory viewing.) However, after the Icelandic slave ship she stows away on is wrecked during a severe storm, survivor’s guilt sees her prior struggles with self doubt reemerge to clash with her own stoic sense of justice, setting her down another gripping and tortured path towards battling both her own inner demons and the bloodthirsty monsters roaming Midgard as they take human and mythical forms.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Senua is joined along the way by a handful of human companions, including a shackled slave master who begrudgingly accompanies her on her path and a settler she saves from a sacrificial altar. None of these supporting characters are given enough screen time to really develop much of a personality beyond the surface, but I appreciated having them along for various parts of the quest since their incidental conversation felt like a far more organic method to process exposition than the superimposed live action vignettes of the first game. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I completely bought into her determination to battle through the fear and self-loathing.</p></div><p>It’s the battle-scarred Senua herself who is the star, though, portrayed to stirring effect by Melina Juergens, returning from the still gorgeous original game now in near-photorealistic form. Juergens is a truly courageous and compassionate presence, and I completely bought into her determination to battle through the fear and self-loathing, from moments where she’s paralysed by anxiety through to shocking outward bursts of blood-boiling rage.  </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II Review Screens</h3></div></output><p>Hellblade II once again takes Senua to some dark and disturbing places, but the sequel’s environments have been painted from a broader colour palette than the mostly bleak backdrops of the original. Sure, you’re still forced to hold your breath during crawls through heinous pits of blood and gristle and infiltrate marauder camps decorated with gruesome bouquets made out of human bones, but these darker moments are contrasted with peaceful mountain treks beneath beautiful coral-coloured skies and jaw-dropping glimpses of aurora borealis so vivid you can almost smell the steamed hams cooking in Principal Skinner’s kitchen. The impressive lighting and fog effects employed throughout bring added depth to each destination, making for a journey that feels grounded even as it shifts between reality and the haunting altered states that spill out of Senua’s psyche. The tradeoff is that Hellblade II runs capped at 30 frames per second on Series X, but I felt its visual design was gobsmacking enough to justify that limit.  </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Playing with headphones on is an absolute must.</p></div><p>These immaculate visuals are once again reinforced by first-class binaural audio design, and playing with headphones on is an absolute must in order to really appreciate the detailed environmental touches like flies buzzing around mutilated corpses and drops of water echoing in underground caverns. More importantly, the swirling voices in Senua’s head seem so close you can almost feel their breath on the back of your neck. This time around not only do these disembodied backseat drivers serve as the bickering angel and devil on Senua’s shoulders casting confusion over every decision she makes, but they also cleverly sow suspicion about the supporting characters around her, making it tough to know who to trust along the way to the story’s thoroughly cathartic conclusion.  </p><h2>En Garde in Midgard</h2><p>Whereas much of Senua’s war in the original Hellblade was waged against demonic manifestations of the Northmen who raided her village and murdered her lover, in Hellblade II the majority of her foes are flesh and bone human warriors. This means that every attack you land feels all the more brutal, with Senua’s sword splitting surface wounds in her opponents’ skin that continue to bleed for the duration of battle, and enemy encounters can be brought to a viciously abrupt end by jamming Senua’s blade so far down their Nordic necks that they’d need to perform a Helheim-lich maneuver to cough it back up again. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Enemy encounters can be brought to a viciously abrupt end.</p></div><p>The combat camera is so tight on each conflict that every weighted blow lands with concussive force, and I was acutely aware of Senua’s knees buckling under her as I blocked an incoming series of powerful slashes. Dodging feels far more physical too, lurching you out of harm’s way but leaving you open to a followup attack in the brief moment it takes Senua to regain her footing, if you don’t manage to time it just right. Timing is also now more key to performing successful parries relative to the original, and the window in which to do so has been shortened to the point where I wasn’t able to just calmly deflect each and every enemy assault with Jedi-like consistency anymore. That made each fight feel like a little less of a foregone conclusion.</p><p>That said, while I remained consistently engaged in each ferocious and remarkably fluid fight to the death, I do wish the team at Ninja Theory had done a little more to build upon the fairly modest combat template established in the original Hellblade with what they’ve served up here. Admittedly, Hellblade II’s swift six-hour run time leaves little room to cram in a skill tree to flesh out or additional attack combos to unlock, but it does feel a touch familiar to play through another campaign with the same basic two-button mix of light and heavy sword slashes, as superbly animated as they may be. </p><p>If anything, Hellblade II’s fighting feels even further streamlined than the original, where Senua also has a guard-breaking melee attack. That’s been dropped entirely, with nothing to replace it. Meanwhile, her slow-motion focus ability, which was unlocked midway through the original Hellblade, is made available in this sequel virtually from the outset, with no further attack-altering abilities to be found for the remainder of the story. Hellblade II’s combat encounters are consistently menacing and muscular as new enemy types like flame-spitting cultists and nimble ghouls are introduced, but without any additional charged attacks or alternative weapons to wield my basic methods for overcoming each marauding mob remained mostly unchanged from start to finish – even on the hardest difficulty setting. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Hellblade II’s combat encounters are consistently menacing and muscular.</p></div><p>One combat change that I did appreciate, however, is the way Hellblade II limits each duel to one-on-one encounters. With no HUD to indicate incoming attacks and the whispers of warning from the voices in Senua’s head easily missed during the heat of battle, in the original Hellblade I often found myself getting stabbed in the back by an unseen offscreen assailant whenever I found myself outnumbered. Thankfully that’s no longer an issue here, and the way Hellblade II’s energetic direction brings new opponents seamlessly barrelling into frame the second another foe is violently dispatched successfully sells the illusion that Senua is stuck amidst a proper rough and tumble free-for-all, rather than the carefully choreographed turn-taking brawls of a Bruce Lee movie. </p><p>Speaking of direction, there are some exceptionally well executed sequences that revolve around murderous giants who have crossed over into Midgard from another realm and are hoovering up sacrificed slaves like they’re human-shaped snack bars. These encounters are urgent, desperate scenarios that put Senua through rigorous physical trials, and although they don’t ever actually put her in head-to-gigantic head conflict with one of the man-hungry monoliths, they still deliver some blood-pumping story peaks to Senua’s Saga that fill the void left by the absence of any traditional boss battles.</p><div data-cy="carousel"><p><h3>10 of the Best-Looking Games on Xbox Series X</h3></p></div><h2>Norse Code</h2><p>Hellblade II isn’t all life and death fighting, though, and as was the case with the original game there’s an equal amount of environmental puzzles to tease your brain as there are combat challenges to test your reflexes. At regular junctions the path forward will be blocked by a swirling, kaleidoscopic gate made of fractalized body parts – one of the most disconcerting images to be found in a journey packed to the brim with startling sights – and the only way to progress past it is by carefully lining up elements of the environment around you and resolving them into the shape of a specific symbol. I was a big fan of these perspective-based puzzles in the original Hellblade, and was happy to see them return here.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>One mid-game stretch felt like something straight out of the PlayStation 2 classic, Ico.</p></div><p>In addition to a bit of Midgard Magic Eye, Hellblade II sprinkles in the use of torchlit braziers and bubble switches that each transform the terrain around you and open up new paths towards your goal. They’re effectively new spins on the landscape-altering portals from the previous adventure, and although they might not be quite as brain-bending to behold they’re still just as satisfying to solve. None of these environmental riddles are particularly taxing, though, and for the most part Hellblade II’s puzzles have seemingly been designed to momentarily stall Senua’s forward march rather than ever truly stump you, but there are still some stand-out sequences. One mid-game stretch that involved sharing Senua’s puzzle-solving torch with an unnamed spectral assistant on the opposing side of the arena was particularly inventive, and felt like something straight out of the PlayStation 2 classic, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/ico">Ico</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Despite the wide-open appearance of its world, Hellblade II is every bit as much a linear adventure as the original. However, the lorestones that were hidden off the beaten path in the first Hellblade make their return here, triggering further teachings about the Northmen from Senua’s friend Druth, delivered with earnest gravitas by returning voice actor Nicholas Boulton. Supplementing the lorestones is a second new string of secrets: hidden trees of Nordic knowledge that can be stumbled upon by focusing on faces found in the world that then dissolve into hidden paths like one of the false walls in Jim Henson’s Labyrinth. Neither give you any gameplay benefit but I still felt compelled to collect them, and unlike its predecessor, Hellblade II unlocks a welcome chapter select feature upon completion so that you can go back for anything you may have missed without having to replay the entire story from start to finish.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A new fund for Ireland-based indie game developers is now accepting applications, with grants of up to £15,000 on offer.</p>
<p><a href="https://ardan.ie/games-2/indiedev-2024-the-cross-border-games-prototype-fund/">IndieDev2024</a> is run by Ardán, a division of Galway Film Centre, and Imirt: The Irish Game Makers Association, with support from both Northern Ireland Screen and Screen Ireland.</p>
<p>The pilot programme for this fund aims to support indie developers across the entirety of Ireland, with applications open to any studios that are "habitually resident" — i.e. based in, or intend to stay in — in Northern Ireland of the Republic of Ireland.</p>
<p>The fund is open to teams of up to five people. Individuals are welcome to apply, but the organisers encourage developers to apply as teams.</p>
<p>In addition to funding of up to £15,000 / €15,000, successful applicants will also receive mentorship and other forms of support, available from Northern Ireland Screen's via Pixel Mill co-working space in Belfast, and Ardán and IMIRT events and workshops in both Galway and Dublin.</p>
<p>These workshops will amount to two weeks of helping to conceive ideas and initial prototypes. By the end of the 12-week programme, indie developers will have a playable concept prototype.</p>
<p>The deadline for applications is 12pm on May 31, 2024.</p>
