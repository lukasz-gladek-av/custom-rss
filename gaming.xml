              <p><em>Spider-Man Remastered</em> will once again be free for paid PS Plus subscribers to play when the hit open-world superhero adventure returns to the service later this month. In fact, August is looking like another decent haul for the Game Pass competitor, with<em> Mortal Kombat 1</em> and<em> Resident Evil</em> PS1 classics also joining the fray.</p> <p><em>Spider-Man</em> had originally been on the service’s subscription library until it was removed in April 2023 <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-ps5-marvels-spider-man-ps-plus-extra-ps4-1850328471">shortly before the sequel was released for PS5</a>. Originally going head-to-head with Microsoft’s Game Pass strategy, which included day-one first-party exclusives, it’s no longer a guarantee that Sony games will cycle into PS Plus library and stay there even years after they’ve released. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-ps-plus-may-2025-gta-5-resistance-batman-1851778091"><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em></a> exited just last year ahead of its own remaster arriving.</p> <p>Here’s the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/13/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-august-mortal-kombat-1-marvels-spider-man-sword-of-the-sea-earth-defense-force-6-and-more/">full list</a> of games joining the PS Plus Extra tier in August 2025:</p> <ul> <li><em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Marvel’s Spider-Man</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Sword of the Sea</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Earth Defense Force 6</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Unicorn Overlord</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Atelier Ryza 3 Alchemist of the End &amp; the Secret Key</em> | PS5, PS4</li> <li><em>Indika</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Harold Halibut</em> | PS5</li> <li><em>Coral Island</em> | PS5And here’s what’s joining the Premier tier:</li> <li><em>Resident Evil 2</em> | PS5, PS4 (PS)</li> <li><em>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis</em> | PS5, PS4 (PS)</li> <li><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em> free game trial | PS5Everything will become available starting August 19, including <em>Sword of the Sea</em> which is a day-and-date release. It’s the latest atmospheric adventure from Giant Squid, which also made <em>Abzu</em> and <em>The Pathless</em>, one of the PS5’s more underrated launch games. <em>Sword of the Sea</em> has a lot of Journey-style dune surfing in it so I’m excited to check it out.There are some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1m16p8q/games_leaving_ps_extradeluxepremium_on_august_19th/">notable games leaving PS Plus</a> on that day as well, however. <em>The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt</em> is ending its latest tour on PS Plus, and 2023’s excellent <em>Monster Hunter</em>-like <em>Wild Hearts</em> will be departing as well. <em>Star Wars: Jedi Survivor</em>, <em>UFC 5</em>, <em>TopSpin 2K25,</em> and<em> Bugsnax</em> will all be gone as well.</li> </ul>

<p>In my decades as a video game player and reviewer, I've used the humble PC mouse in hundreds of games for everything from first-person aiming and third-person character movement to basic menu navigation and unit selection. In all that time, I can't recall a game that required the use of two mice at once.</p>
<p>That was true until I spent some time with Nintendo’s utterly unique <em>Drag x Drive</em>. The game asks you to take a Switch 2 Joy-Con in each hand, turn them both so the narrow edge lies on a flat-ish surface, and then slide them around to power a game of full-contact wheelchair basketball.</p>
<p>It’s a fresh control scheme that comes with its share of issues, mostly stemming from the lack of convenient mouse surfaces in most living rooms. With a little bit of practice, a good playing surface, and some online friends to play with, though, I found myself enjoying the high-impact, full-contact, precision positional gameplay enabled by holding a mouse in each hand for the first time.</p>
<h2>Still kind of buff from using the mouse</h2>
<p>When you picture using two mice at once, you might imagine each wrist making a series of small, controlled movements, one controlling lateral movement and the other controlling directional angle. <em>Drag x Drive</em>'s dual-mouse controls bear no resemblance to this vision. Instead, you end up vigorously swiping each mouse forward or backward in constant sweeps; side-to-side movement is neither required nor useful.</p>
<p>That repetitive front-and-back swiping is mirrored by your avatar’s hand on the top side of either wheel on the wheelchair, creating a sort of tank-like control scheme where you turn by moving one wheel forward and one wheel backward. Small swipes of the mice can be used for precision angling, but more often, you’ll be sweeping the mouse in long lines to build speed. To shoot, you simply lift up a Joy-Con and mime a basketball shot a la <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/08/drag-x-drive-is-a-uniquely-fun-and-frustrating-showcase-for-switch-2-mouse-mode/%E2%80%9Dhttp://arstechnica.com/gaming/reviews/2009/07/the-wii-is-born-again-ars-reviews-wii-sports-resort.ars%E2%80%9D"><em>Wii Sports Resort</em></a> (your accuracy seems to have more to do with distance and your angle to the basket than real-world form, thankfully).</p>

<p>That dual mouse movement system makes <em>Drag x Drive</em> a surprisingly physical game. I don't mean that in a virtual sense—even though bashing your wheelchair into the opposing team is your main form of defense. I mean your real-world shoulders and forearms will get a decent workout as you repeatedly make the huge backward and forward swipes to power your avatar up and down the court.</p>
<p>The sheer amount of physical mouse mileage required to play <em>Drag x Drive</em> outpaces even the most frenetic clickfests on the PC. It almost feels like a virtual reality game where you’re expected to tediously mimic real-world actions with one-to-one movements of your hands.</p>
<h2>Awkward in the best way</h2>
<p>When it comes to gameplay, the <em>Drag x Drive</em> movement system is awkward in the best way—less <em>NBA Jam</em> and more <em>Rocket League</em>. The lack of easy lateral movement means you need to carefully manage your forward momentum and near-term path planning. Success in <em>Drag x Drive</em> is about constantly gauging not just your position relative to the opponents and teammates but also the angles they're facing, which determine where they're likely to go next and which paths may be clear.</p>

<p>The main missing element is <em>Rocket League</em>'s sense of verticality—jumping is limited to awkward bunny hops and runs up halfpipes on the edges of the court, meaning there’s little in the way of mid-air acrobatics or shot blocking. Instead, this is an ice hockey-style slide-and-bump affair; hitting an opponent from the side simply gives an annoying temporary jolt (which also disrupts their shooting motion) while hitting an opponent head-on forces a loose ball turnover and a mad scramble for the ball.</p>

<p>That kind of full-contact free-for-all is definitely most fun in an online setting, especially if you can join a GameChat session and talk trash with friends the whole time. In single player, it’s much less interesting to weave through bots that flip-flop dramatically between “almost immobile” and “god-level wheelchair-seeking missiles” depending on the difficulty settings. There are a few movement-honing solo mini-games to round things out, but overall, this is a game that will live or die by the size and quality of its online competition.</p>
<p>I can also see a pretty big skill-based gap developing in that online community. Quickly switching between long swoops to build up speed and small mouse adjustments to quickly change angles is a subtle skill that rewards players who can master it with smoother, faster traversal around opponents that can seem like they’re standing still. Those willing to put in the effort will find a high skill ceiling that rewards physical motor skills in a way few other games can.</p>
<h2>Where do I put these things?</h2>
<p>The most immediate problem with <em>Drag x Drive</em>’s dual mouse setup for most players will be where to use the mice when playing in their living rooms. I started out trying the mice on a flat, wooden lap desk I had handy, but the repeated, insistent thunking of the Joy-Cons on the hard surface quickly got annoying. I switched to swiping the Joy-Cons on the top of my thighs, but the irregular surface formed by my shorts fabric and/or hair-covered legs did not work all that well.</p>
<p>I had some more success laying the Joy-Cons on a large, upholstered ottoman, each repetitive swoosh mimicking the sound of corduroy pants rubbing against thighs. After a bit of play, though, my back started to hurt from leaning so far forward while constantly moving my forearms up and down.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>The most comfortable control option I was able to find involved relocating my Switch 2 to my computer desk, where I plugged the dock into my HDMI-compatible monitor, moved my PC keyboard and mouse to the side, and used the newly available desk space as a sort of massive dual mouse pad. Here, I could play comfortably for extended periods, with enough surface area for precise control. I also tried swiping the Joy-Cons on the armrests of my computer chair, which felt pretty natural (and mimicked the positioning of the wheels on my avatar's chair).</p>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5aDS3U27SSY?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, even with this bespoke setup, I still had to deal with the discomfort of gripping the Joy-Cons. Unlike a computer mouse, which has a broad top surface to rest a controlling palm and fingers, the Switch 2 Joy-Cons have an extremely thin edge in mouse mode. Getting a firm grip around that edge requires twisting your hand into a claw-like clutch on either side.</p>
<p>Besides the obvious discomfort, my grip never felt quite secure enough for the large, sweeping mouse movement required for a game like this. I would recommend plugging a pair of standard USB mice into the Joy-Con dock to fix this problem, but <em>Drag x Drive</em>'s reliance on motion controls for shooting makes this solution a non-starter.</p>
<p>If you can power through these mouse-related annoyances, though, <em>Drag x&nbsp;</em><span><em>Drive</em></span> is one of the more unique and fun action-sports games out there. I hope a critical mass of people give it a chance because I’d love to see some professional e-sports athletes madly swooping their Joy-Cons across a desk in a near-future Twitch stream.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Helldivers 2 - Official Bring the Boom Trailer (With Halo ODST Teaser) | Out August 26</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">At first, the signal seems familiar but doesn't quite sound like anything from Halo. However, when the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1moadmj/clip_comparing_a_segment_of_the_reversed_signal/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=action_bar&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-grunts-think-theyve-found-more-evidence-of-a-halo-crossover-thanks-to-a-very-familiar-unknown-signal-detected-by-the-galactic-warning-system-is-that-the-superintendent/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">signal's audio</a> is reversed, it sounds almost identical to the phone alarm for the AI Superintendent from Halo 3: ODST. It's that alarm which helps guide ODST's Rookie through the embattled streets of New Mombasa following a Covenant invasion. Is the Superintendent now trying to warn Helldivers of a coming threat?</p><p dir="ltr">Developer Arrowhead Studios hasn't said anything official about a Halo crossover just yet, but Halo's ODSTs and Super Earth's Helldivers are so similar that it would be a crime against Managed Democracy if a collaboration didn't happen. What all the crossover will entail is still anybody's guess, but there will almost certainly be ODST cosmetics for players to earn or purchase, as was the case when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2s-first-crossover-is-officially-killzone-2-and-the-dlc-is-out-now/1100-6528541/" data-ref-id="1100-6528541">Helldivers 2 crossed over with Sony's Killzone</a> franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani gave credit to publisher <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-did-helldivers-2-end-up-on-xbox-it-was-all-sonys-decision-dev-says/1100-6533765/" data-ref-id="1100-6533765">Sony for deciding to release Helldivers 2 on Xbox</a>, stating to a fan on Discord that the choice was "all PlayStation" but that Arrowhead was "all in support of course." Helldivers 2's most recent Control Group Warbond introduced some new experimental tech for players to test out, including a mini-teleportation device and a gun with seven-barrels that can be more than a little <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/be-careful-firing-helldivers-2s-new-weapon-if-you-have-a-lot-of-ammo/2900-6760/" data-ref-id="2900-6760">dangerous if you have a lot of ammo</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Tekken is a mainstay of the Evo tournament series--and of the entire fighting game genre. But things haven't been entirely rosy at the King of Iron Fist tournament lately. Despite very strong sales for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tekken-8/" data-ref-id="5000-572026">Tekken 8</a>, many competitive players have expressed a dislike for the changes to characters and overall gameplay introduced in Season 2, and they've been very vocal about it on social media. Knowing that things are a bit stormy around Tekken 8's competitive scene lately, I went into an interview with members of the Tekken team at Evo to ask questions about their upcoming content plans, how to deal with criticism, revisiting past games, and the impending return of their number one 3D fighting game rival.</p><p dir="ltr">As the session began, I was shown the trailer for Armor King by director Kohei Ikeda, often referred to by players and staff as Nakatsu. Armor King is a classic returning character, with appearances going back to the very first Tekken. He leans heavily into the "heel" wrestling persona, with a black, spikey outfit and an offense-oriented skillset with a new stance called Bad Jaguar. He can even make the stage floor crumble when performing his rage art.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Tekken 8 Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">I noticed that when Armor King's attacks hit the opponent, there's a brief flash of the Japanese kanji "aku" (悪), meaning evil. "You're the first person to notice that," Tekken designer and interpreter Michael Murray said. "It's there because Armor King's classic costume used to feature that kanji prominently."</p><p dir="ltr">These kinds of character details have become increasingly important in Tekken 8. "In the past, we [included] lots of character details, such as Kazuya being a sneaker collector," Murray said. "But over time, we kind of stopped doing it. Then the fans were like, 'Why? We used to love those kinds of details.' So we tried to bring that back for Tekken 8."</p><p dir="ltr">I then got to see the debut of the all-new character, Miary Zo. Miary hails from the African island of Madagascar and fights using traditional African martial arts. Tekken Project producer and series veteran Katsuhiro Harada wanted to emphasize that they did their homework when they decided to design the series' first African character. "Makatsu [Ikeda] and I actually went to Madagascar for research. We were able to connect with not just the local fighting game community, but also different groups of people. One thing we learned is that Madagascar's place in the African region is quite unique in how it came about, with its people and its culture located off the coast of the African continent.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549274-tek3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549274" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549274-tek3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549274"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549274-tek3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"So what we found out was that their roots come from Southeast Asia as well as the main continent. The people of Madagascar have a different look to them than those of the African mainland, like with skin color and hairstyles. For example, we noticed a lot more people in Madagascar had straight hair, especially women."</p><p dir="ltr">The pursuit of authenticity had some unexpected challenges. "When we were trying to do the voiceovers, we learned that there's no established industry in Madagascar for voice recording, it's mainly a few people who sometimes do dubs for TV shows in the local language. So to find a voice actor for Miary Zo, we actually had to look for young folks who wanted to be voice actors. We did several rounds of auditions to find the person who was adequate for this task. But then also once we found them, recording at the studio itself was tough, because there's many power outages throughout the day. So actually finishing the recording was quite a challenge."</p><p dir="ltr">After this new character introduction, I felt that it was time to address the elephant in the room: How was the team responding to criticism of Tekken 8's Season 2? "We had a lot of new people on the team," Harada explained. "I'm actually fairly conservative when it comes to game design. I usually wouldn't make huge changes, but with Tekken 8, I do feel like our team successfully created something unique and new. When the game launched, players loved it. It had a 90 Metacritic and won Best Fighting Game at The Game Awards. But this was before Season 1 ended.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549276-tek1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549276" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549276-tek1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549276"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549276-tek1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"That being said, we realized that a portion of the Tekken fanbase is also very conservative. Many people would perhaps want to see something closer to Tekken 7, for example. But then that's very hard to tell from the outside, because you have all these strong opinions on the internet. Then you have other people who just joined from Tekken 8, who don't know anything about Tekken and are enjoying themselves. Even though there may be a conflict between those opinions, we don't want to make them fight against each other about what's proper Tekken."</p><p dir="ltr">"We had this brand-new game in Tekken 8, and we were trying to make it feel even more different and new in Season 2," Harada continued. "So some people liked it, and some people didn't. We're trying to continue to monitor the community and to have a discussion with them to find a middle ground that everyone can enjoy--whether you were a series fan, a fan of Tekken 7 in particular, or whether you like the new systems in Tekken 8."</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, with social media being what it is, it's easy to get overwhelmed with negativity and hate-baiting clout farming. How does the team separate signal from noise? "It's difficult," Harada admitted. "Social media is actually a good way to collect information for Tekken development. It's also important to come to events like Evo or Comic-Con, though. I can hear the opinions of people who compete in tournaments--sometimes I hear opinions different from what the pro players are saying. At an event like Comic-Con, I can talk to fans who are less engaged in the competitive side of things."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1579032315" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

I keep an open mind and remember it's not a personal attack. It feels like it is sometimes. But I take the data and try to get to what they're saying, then lay it on the table with Nakatsu. We look it over and say, 'Okay, what represents most of our gaming population? What would make the most people happy?' rather than worrying about what people are trying to do on social media."</p><p dir="ltr">"I do listen to negative opinions, but I only think of it as one person's opinion," Harada continued. But online media can have the effect of making that negativity seem bigger than it is. When you're listening to all these different people, are they saying what they're really believing, or are they just echoing the sentiment of some other person that they heard? Also, some people who are unhappy with something voice that opinion, but others just leave without saying anything. On the other hand, there are people that are happy with the current state of Tekken 8, and they keep playing the game, but we don't hear from them either, because they're not vocal about it."</p><p dir="ltr">Murray chimed in with his own anecdote: "Harada often told us a story about developing around the Tekken 3 and Tekken Tag Tournament era. The team wanted to make a new game, so they took all the stuff that people didn't like about Tekken at the time. The thinking was, 'If we get rid of those parts, then obviously everyone's going to love the new game.' But that didn't work out. They came up with Tekken 4, which at the time was thought of as a strange version of Tekken.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549277-tek.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549277" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549277-tek.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549277"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549277-tek.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We use that as a lesson--that just taking things and limiting elements that people are complaining about doesn't necessarily make a good game. So that's why we're trying to be very careful in our evaluation of what people say about Tekken 8."</p><p dir="ltr">Despite online complaints, Tekken 8 continues to have a strong playerbase, though some players have decided they'd rather play older titles like Tekken 5 Dark Resurrection or Tekken Tag Tournament 2 instead. This isn't uncommon in the fighting game scene--if some players don't care for a new game, they'll often continue to play an older game in the series.</p><p dir="ltr">I asked Harada if he'd consider putting together a compilation of older Tekken titles for these players. "It's a bit difficult," he replied. "It's a concept that's worked well for Capcom. Maybe popular sentiment has changed over time, but back when the subject of reissuing past Tekken titles came up, we did research about the concept's market viability. But 3D fighters--for example, Virtua Fighter and Tekken--have typically been showcases of the latest technology in gaming at that time. That's less the case with 2D fighting games. When we were looking at people in the 2D fighter audience, they would go back and play the older titles, whether that's Street Fighter II or Street Fighter III Third Strike, whatever. Maybe they wouldn't move to the latest game, or maybe they'd play both at the same time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549278-tek4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549278" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549278-tek4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549278"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549278-tek4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"But with 3D fighters, the majority of people would always go to the latest installment, because it had the prettiest graphics and the best technology at the time. Not many people went back and played the older titles. And we noticed, in the console version of Tekken 5, we included the older iterations of the arcade versions for Tekken 1, 2, and 3. People would boot the games up and go, 'Oh yeah, I remember this!' And then they return to the main game. But maybe things have changed, and we need to revisit our thinking."</p><p dir="ltr">"Personally, as a business decision for the company, it makes sense to have someone port the games and repackage them," Harada continued. "But as a developer, it's not very entertaining to go back and recreate something I've already worked on. And there are other factors. For Tekken Tag 2 as an example, it's a game some of the hardcore Tekken fans really love. Makatsu and I both love it too. But when you look at the overall sales, it did even worse than Tekken 4. It almost killed the series. Sometimes, peoples' memory of something is much different than reality."</p><p dir="ltr">With a new Virtua Fighter game on the horizon, Tekken's most-prominent competition in the 3D fighting game arena has returned to the ring. Despite what many people think, however, the Tekken and Virtua Fighter teams are quite amicable towards one another, with Harada having frequently pushed publicly for a new Virtua Fighter game. With that in mind, I asked about his feelings seeing Virtua Fighter return after such a long time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549279-tek2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549279" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549279-tek2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4549279"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4549279-tek2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"From an emotional viewpoint and also a business or company employee viewpoint, we've always had a friendly rivalry," said Harada. "For a while, it felt like the series stopped. People were resigned to not knowing when or if a new Virtua Fighter would release. For quite some time, even when Tekken became thought of as the longest, continuing 3D fighting game series, no one said, 'Hey, wait, there's Virtua Fighter.' Everyone seemed to feel that VF was done.</p><p dir="ltr">"I found it frustrating, because that left us as practically the only big name in 3D fighting. To have our rival just disappear and not be a vital part of the genre was maddening. I want them to come back, and quickly, because it's lonely here. We want other games like VF to be around, because they attract attention and bring people into 3D fighters."</p><p dir="ltr">To close out the interview, I asked Harada about his feelings on the current fighting game landscape. "There's a lot of people coming into the space in addition to these new, major fighting game titles. People talk about the '90s fighting game boom, but it ended kind of abruptly. But now everyone is back in full force. Sales of major franchises--Street Fighter, Tekken, Mortal Kombat--all have done very well, not just for fighting games, but for video games in general. If you look at the competitors and viewers for Evo year over year, or even for our own Tekken World Tour, I think the fighting game boom is happening as we speak."</p>

<p>Hint: it's the same as Japan!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Clear River Games has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/r-type_delta_hd_boosted">R-Type Delta: HD Boosted</a> will launch on Switch in the West on <strong>20th November 2025</strong>. That's the same date as Japan!</p>
<p>Developed by City Connection Co. Ltd, the game will receive a physical edition in addition to the usual digital release on Switch, a whopping 27 years after its original release on the PlayStation in 1998.</p>
<p>R-Type Delta will run at 60fps on the Switch and you'll also have the option to swap between the new HD visuals and the original presentation. A newly arranged soundtrack is also available, while players can tinker around with the game's multiple difficulty settings for the optimum experience.</p>
<p>If you want a taster before launch and happen to be attending either GamesCom or PAX West this year, R-Type Delta: HD Boosted will be available to try out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In the year 2163, having triumphed over the Bydo Empire, the R9 was recovered and stored within a space fortress orbiting Earth. Humanity breathed a collective sigh of relief, but this was short-lived when in 2164 unidentified objects fell from the sky, followed electronic weapons systems running amok, and culminating in an ‘annihilation unit’ stored alongside the R9 suddenly going berserk, descending to Earth and beginning a wave of destruction. To bring the situation under control, the prototype test unit “R9 Delta” is deployed—marking the beginning of a new battle against the Bydo."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We'll keep you up to date on any fresh announcements regarding R-Type Delta as soon as we hear more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>PlayStation has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/13/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-august-mortal-kombat-1-marvels-spider-man-sword-of-the-sea-earth-defense-force-6-and-more/">announced</a> the games being added to the PS Plus Extra and PS Plus Premium game catalogs for August 2025, with Mortal Kombat 1 and Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered headlining the 11-total titles added across the Extra and Premium tiers.</p>



<p>Technically, for PS Plus Premium subscribers, it's a full 12 games that they'll have access to thanks to their subscription, but the twelfth title is just a new game trial for Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, so it doesn't really count to make this month's catalog additions a full 12, since you only get five hours with it before you'd have to buy the game to play the rest.</p>



<p>This month's additions also include a new day-one release, with Sword of the Sea launching into PS Plus Extra when it arrives on August 19. The game comes from some of the same developers who made Journey, and was showcased earlier this year at a <a href="https://wccftech.com/everything-shown-at-the-june-2025-state-of-play/">State of Play</a> event.</p>

<p>Other notable inclusions among the nine games entering the PS Plus Extra games catalog, and the two games entering the PS Plus Premium Classic's game catalog include Vanillaware's Unicorn Overlord, and one of 2024's standout indie titles, Indika. And in the case of Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered, subscribers on PS5 will be able to access the native PS5 remaster, while subscribers on PS4 will get access to the Marvel's Spider-Man: Game of the Year Edition, which includes all the DLC released for the game.</p>



<p>And as far as the two classic games are concerned, it's a Resident Evil-focused month, with the original PS One versions of Resident Evil 2 and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis being added to the classic's catalog.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games being added to the PS Plus Extra and PS Plus Premium game catalogs:</p>



<ul>
<li>Mortal Kombat 1 (PS5)</li>



<li>Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Sword of the Sea (PS5) - available as of August 19</li>



<li>Earth Defence Force 6 (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Unicorn Overlord (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Atelier Ryza 3 Alchemist of the End &amp; the Secret Key (PS5, PS4)</li>



<li>Indika (PS5)</li>



<li>Harold Halibut (PS5)</li>



<li>Coral Island (PS5)</li>



<li>Resident Evil 2 (PS5, PS4) - <strong>PS Plus Premium subscribers only</strong></li>



<li>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (PS5, PS4) - <strong>PS Plus Premium subscribers only</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Along with these 11 games, if you're a Premium-tier subscriber, then you're getting a total of 14 games you can try out in August, including the three games previously announced for subscribers on the base Essential-level tier, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-august-2025-lies-of-p-dayz-my-hero-ones-justice-2/">Lies of P and DayZ.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Light Brick Studio and publisher Annapurna Interactive have announced the release date for upcoming cute co-op adventure&nbsp;<em>Lego Voyagers</em>, and it's not too far off at all.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer, you can expect to play <i>Lego Voyagers&nbsp;</i>on September 15th, and it'll be releasing across most current platforms (with the exception of the Xbox One and the Nintendo Switch 2, but you can play the Switch version on the Switch 2 via backwards compatibility).</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Lego Voyagers</em>, it's a co-op adventure game that was revealed during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-game-fest-2025-recap" rel="nofollow">this year's Summer Game Fest</a>. The game is intended for two players, as indicated by its rather adorable little stud characters and emphasis on co-op puzzling.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lego-voyagers-release-date-train.jpg?itok=jj5x0-f3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lego-voyagers-release-date-train.jpg?itok=E6ymVuth 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lego Voyagers&nbsp;</em>is set to launch in September.</figcaption></figure><p>Annapurna and Light Brick say that&nbsp;<em>Lego Voyagers&nbsp;</em>revolves around the journey of two friends, who embark on a mission to "rescue an abandoned spaceship", building their friendship (and a whole lot of Lego structures) along the way.</p>

<p>The two studios are promising a "poetic, non-verbal narrative, set in beautiful brick-built environments" complete with an "atmospheric soundtrack". You'll also find "many challenges" to complete, and you can either play in local co-op or online as well, although it doesn't seem that the game will support single-player.</p>

<p>Much like EA's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-4m-battlefield-skate" rel="nofollow">smash hit&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Lego Voyagers&nbsp;</em>will also come <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-friends-pass-crossplay" rel="nofollow">complete with a Friend's Pass</a>, which means that if you've got a friend who wants to play it alongside you, they'll be able to do so at no extra cost. It's not entirely clear whether this pass will be cross-platform in the same way that&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>'s pass is, however.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lego-voyagers-release-date-swing.jpg?itok=nxqIXzXT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lego-voyagers-release-date-swing.jpg?itok=qukpsPUR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You and a friend can enjoy&nbsp;<em>Lego Voyagers&nbsp;</em>for the cost of just one copy.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Lego Voyagers&nbsp;</em>when it launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1538550/LEGO_Voyagers/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10011346" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/lego-voyagers/9NKD66G942R8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>Whether or not there's going to be a Switch 2 version appears to be a little up in the air; in the <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2025/june/lego-voyagers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">original announcement</a>, the Switch 2 isn't mentioned, but the new trailer's description points to "Nintendo Switch platforms", so perhaps a native Switch 2 release is on the cards. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>On August 13, Konami confirmed that <em>Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater Delta</em>‘s new multiplayer mode–<a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-3-delta-snake-eater-fox-hunt-online-1851784404">Fox Hunt–</a>won’t support crossplay on PC or consoles. It’s not the only game to lack the popular feature this year. <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> doesn’t support crossplay and arcade soccer hit <em>Rematch</em> launched without it, too. But in 2025, it is weird that some games are still lacking what feels like an industry standard for multiplayer games.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/metalgear_jp/status/1955585126286377462">In a small post on Twitter on Wednesday</a>, Konami announced that its upcoming <em>MGS</em> remake won’t feature crossplay multiplayer in Fox Hunt. It’s the latest bit of bad news about the game’s online mode after Konami confirmed last week that <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/metal-gear-solid-deltas-fox-hunt-multiplayer-mode-just-got-delayed/"><em>MGS Delta: Snake Eater </em>multiplayer won’t be available at launch</a>. Instead, it will be added to the game via a free update in the fall. Many players are now worried that when Fox Hunt finally arrives, the mode, which was likely to have a small playerbase compared to more popular online games anyway, might suffer from long wait times and will feel dead soon after launch. Crossplay could have united the small groups of players spread across PS5, Xbox, and PC, but now that won’t happen. And the upcoming <em>MGS</em> remake isn’t the only big-name game to skip crossplay in 2025.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">【ご案内】<br>『METAL GEAR SOLID Δ: SNAKE EATER』のオンライン対戦モード 「FOX HUNT」につきまして、異なるプラットフォーム間でのクロスプレイは非対応となります。</p> <p>対応機種<br>PlayStation®5、Xbox Series X|S、Steam®<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MGSDelta?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MGSDelta</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MetalGearSolid?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MetalGearSolid</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%83%A1%E3%82%BF%E3%83%AB%E3%82%AE%E3%82%A2%E3%82%BD%E3%83%AA%E3%83%83%E3%83%89?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#メタルギアソリッド</a> <a href="https://t.co/sGsv3CjyhW">pic.twitter.com/sGsv3CjyhW</a></p> <p>— メタルギア公式 (METAL GEAR) (@metalgear_jp) <a href="https://twitter.com/metalgear_jp/status/1955585126286377462?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-review-in-progress-difficulty-1851782700"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a> has received rave reviews from players and critics and has consumed the lives of at least five different people I know, including my wife and <em>Kotaku</em> reporter Ethan Gach. But the game launched without crossplay, and FromSoftware is unlikely to ever add it. Sure, some players might be annoyed by crossplay in competitive games like <em>Call of Duty</em>&nbsp;because it allows PC hackers to screw with console players easily. But in something like <em>Nightreign</em>, that would have been a non-issue. Most people are playing the online, run-based RPG with friends, and the game is all PVE co-op. Another 2025 game that lacked crossplay at launch is the fantastic soccer game <em>Rematch</em>, though <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/sloclap-rematch-dev-update-july-18th-2025">according to the devs,</a> it is being added in the near future.</p>

 <p>It wasn’t that long ago that crossplay was a novelty that we rarely saw in console games. Then, around 2019, <em>Fortnite</em> became mega popular, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/cross-platform-gaming-has-been-great-1845804328">Xbox, Sony, and Nintendo were all forced to play ball</a> as it became clear that players wanted to play with their friends regardless of platform. Nowadays, a game announcing crossplay isn’t news. Instead, it’s only the lack of the feature that catches people’s attention, like with the <em>MGS Delta: Snake Eater </em>announcement.</p> <p>So why are some games still avoiding crossplay? There’s definitely some tech reasons behind the decision. Even if it’s easier today than before to implement crossplay, it’s still extra work for devs and adds more complications to big games that are already complex pieces of software. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/sony-charges-for-crossplay-support-to-protect-psn-revenue-documents-show/">There’s also the claim that Sony is reportedly</a> still charging publishers fees to add crossplay to games ported to <a href="https://kotaku.com/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-cross-play-ps5-xbox-borderlands-1848649295">PS4 or PS5.</a> That extra cost might make a publisher pass on supporting crossplay, especially in co-op-only games like <em>Nightreign</em> or <a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-online-mgo-2-rpcs3-fox-hunt-delta-remake-2000616716">niche online modes like <em>MGS’s</em> Fox Hunt.&nbsp;</a> Whatever the reason, it is now very odd not to include crossplay, and it’s only going to get weirder to do so as a new generation of gamers grows up in an era when almost every game supports cross-platform multiplayer action.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nba-2k26/" data-ref-id="5000-685486">NBA 2K26</a> is releasing soon, and with it comes a whole new crop of rookie players looking to make their mark in the real world and the virtual one as well. To continue on with 2K26's ratings week, the developers have revealed the best rookies in the game at launch. While the first few members of the top 10 rookies are as expected, there are some shifts at the bottom of the list compared to how draft night went earlier in 2025.</p><p>Below, you can see the top 10 rookies in NBA 2K26 according to their ratings at launch.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh57YWNaQC4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Mh57YWNaQC4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>NBA 2K26 rookie ratings</h2><p>We'll count down each of the top rookies by their rating below. There's certainly one outlier on the list, and you can probably guess who that is, but there are some other rookies you'll definitely want to keep your eye on as the NBA season begins.</p><h3>Cooper Flagg - 82 OVR</h3><p>Let's get first-round draft pick Cooper Flagg out of the way. The new Dallas Mavericks forward is given a rare 80+ rating for a rookie, which doesn't often happen unless 2K believes the player is a generational prospect. The jury is still out on Flagg as we haven't seen him in any real action yet, but he has the tools to be an immediate star.</p><h3>Dylan Harper - 78 OVR</h3><p>We're back to reality now, and second overall draft pick Dylan Harper of the San Antonio Spurs comes in at the number two spot on the list. If Cooper Flagg wasn't in the draft, Harper is the first overall choice by a landslide, and the Spurs are certainly building something special between him and Victor Wembanyama.</p><h3>Ace Bailey - 77 OVR</h3><p>Ace Bailey was the fifth overall draft pick in 2025, but he should've been a higher selection under normal circumstances. Bailey had an interesting pre-draft process, to say the least, that dropped his draft stock slightly, but his talent is undeniable. Bailey should be firmly in the running for Rookie of the Year along with Flagg and Harper.</p><h3>V.J. Edgecombe - 76 OVR</h3><p>There's significant hype around what V.J. Edgecombe could bring to the Philadelphia 76ers in 2025 and beyond. Edgecombe is an intriguing prospect with tools to make an impact on both sides of the ball, and could form a lethal duo with second-year player Jared McCain.</p><h3>Kon Knueppel -75 OVR</h3><p>Kon Knueppel was the fourth overall draft pick, going to the Charlotte Hornets. While the Hornets likely won't be in contention during the 2025 season, Knueppel could find his way into the starting roster based on what we saw in the NBA Summer League, where he was named MVP.</p><h3>Tre Johnson - 75 OVR</h3><p>Tre Johnson was considered a fantastic value pick by the Washington Wizards in the 2025 draft. Coming out of Texas, Johnson could have gone as high as third overall, according to some analysts, but wound up in Washington, where he gets to learn from several savvy veterans and showcase his offensive talent.</p><h3>Khaman Maluach - 74 OVR</h3><p>Khaman Maluach is the first player to be rated outside of where he was drafted. Maluach was drafted tenth overall by the Rockets, but he wound up traded to the Phoenix Suns, where there's room for some young talent to shine after the departure of Kevin Durant.</p><h3>Jeremiah Fears - 73 OVR</h3><p>Jeremiah Fears is up next, coming in at 73 OVR after he was drafted seventh overall by the New Orleans Pelicans. Fears will need some time to develop at the NBA level, but he has the potential to make a huge impact on an always-struggling Pelicans roster.</p><h3>Egor Demin - 72 OVR</h3><p>Egor Demin was drafted by the Brooklyn Nets eighth overall in the draft. Demin has the potential to be one of the best passers in the NBA. However, Demin needs to shore up his shooting ability at the next level if he wants to be rated any higher.</p><h3>Collin Murray-Boyles - 72 OVR</h3><p>Rounding out the list of the top 10 rookies is Toronto Raptors draft pick Collin Murray-Boyles. Coming out of South Carolina, Murray-Boyles was renowned for his defense and niche offensive abilities. Comparisons to Marcus Smart and Jrue Holiday were made all throughout the draft process, and that's certainly not a bad mold for the Raptors' rookie.</p><p>That does it for the top 10 list of the best rookies in NBA 2K26.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-broke-my-foot-but-the-iwalkfree-gave-me-mobility-back.1269312/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><figcaption><span><p>The iWalkFree 3.0 is a mobility device that works a little bit like an extension of your leg.</p>
</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>My foot is currently what the medical profession would call “busted.” This happened due to the structural collapse of a step, and the result was my 4th and 5th metatarsal being broken into two and “multiple” pieces respectively. Like Bart Simpson in the<em> Rear Window </em>parody episode “Bart of Darkness,” I am now forced to spend the remainder of my summer recuperating indoors while friends have fun. But there is one piece of gear that has made my life a little bit easier: the iWalkFree, a mobility aid that does not oversell itself and has helped me get back a tiny bit of mobility.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Uchi-mata - Basic principles" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N9lpgFLKqvE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>This is not the first time that I have had a bone shattered below the knee. The first time was around 2008, during a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu class. I was training with a still fairly new white belt who ominously told me he “had a fight in Long Island coming up” and who had zero experience in standup Judo throws. The class was learning the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uchi_mata" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Uchi-mata</a>, a basic throw that involves lifting your leg between your opponent’s legs and rolling them over your hip. He did not do that. Instead he turned around and pushed into me sideways, causing my left ankle to catch the majority of the force and breaking my ankle. I was young and uninsured and had never broken a bone, and there was an EMT training there who said it looked like a sprain.</p><p>Not knowing what a hospital visit would cost, I stumbled out, iced it with a Diet Coke on the street, hailed a taxi homeward, realized I would not have enough money to get home, staggered down the two flights of the First Avenue L train, got on the train, staggered out of my stop in Bushwick, walked two blocks, walked up three flights of stairs and rested. I walked on it for two weeks before I got an X-ray confirming that it would need to be rebroken and pins and plates would need to be put in (total count was I believe eight pins), but in the meantime I did attend my college graduation ceremony on crutches. This is what it was like to be young and dumb before Obamacare extended the length of time you could be on your parents’ insurance to the age of 26.</p><figure><figcaption>Medical professionals have told me that it should not look like that.</figcaption></figure><p>This time around, I took a spill in my backyard and immediately went to the hospital. For the second time in my life, I have a plate in my lower body, but at least I caught it early. Suddenly being on crutches is not a fun experience, but for me will be transitory. Lower leg breaks are a reminder that every non-disabled person is likely to gain a disability on a long enough timeline, some sooner than others, and what the limitations of the place you live in are (the MTA, for example, <a href="https://dralegal.org/press/mta-subway-elevators-lawsuit-proceeding-to-trial/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is so bad at this they got sued for it</a>).&nbsp; It also requires relearning big parts of your life, and for me the hardest part was not going out and socializing but being able to go to the deli for a soda and putter around my house to do basic tasks. Grabbing several small tools scattered from around my house is like 50 percent of my day when I’m in project mode, and having an impediment slowed me to a snail’s pace.&nbsp;</p><p>Being Aftermath’s resident “<a href="https://aftermath.site/category/hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gear Guy</a>,” I decided to solve this problem with hardware. I had seen those knee scooters people use, and while they appear to be very fast, my understanding is they come with a higher than normal fall risk. They also do not help with my main problem: my home has stairs. This is where I stumbled on the iWalkFree, a hands-free crutch that functions somewhat but not entirely like a prosthetic peg leg. It’s a T-shaped device that you tightly strap your lower leg into and walk around in a way approximating non-disabled locomotion. You can often find them on Marketplace or Craigslist for cheap, but the one deal I tried to get fell apart. iWalkFree is often sold refurbished at a discount on their website (and if you have a health HSA or FSA you can use that) so that’s the path I decided to go down.</p><figure><figcaption>I trust Vibram implicitly at this point in my life. Credit: iWalkFree.</figcaption></figure><p>A minor detail that immediately sold me on the iWalkFree is that it has a Vibram sole. Vibram makes “the good soles,” and most of the shoes and sandals I buy have them. When I see that little yellow octagon logo, I’m confident that it’s not going to slip easily. iWalkFree also apparently sells an aftermarket Vibram sole for snowy weather, which makes sense considering how big a fall risk ice is. iWalkFree also does not oversell their device in videos and advertisements – it has height and weight limits and it isn’t going to be the same as non-disabled walking. They are transparent that the device takes some getting used to and comes with tradeoffs. This is not going to be a full replacement for walking at a rigorous pace, but if you need to stand for long periods where you use your hands or carry something light from room to room, it turns out it’s perfect.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="iWALK3.0 - Setting Realistic Expectations" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0lTFemYHUyQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I ordered my refurbished device and quickly assembled it. The instructions on how to fit and use an iWalkFree are hyper specific and worth following in their entirety. You not only have to adjust the three layers of straps to the exact length of your leg in two different color-coded paces, you also have to adjust the top using two thigh support dials to accommodate upper thigh circumference. Getting these settings dialed in for your particular leg and body shape is extremely important, and the thigh supports in particular are going to influence if the sole of the device is going to land squarely on the ground.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="iWALK3.0 First Time Use Instructions" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X5KfaPa9Jic?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I took to the iWalkFree quickly. Within 30 minutes I had not only <a href="https://aftermath.site/gaggiuino-gaggia-classic-pro-mod-open-source-hack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulled a shot of espresso</a>, I had started curing<a href="https://youtu.be/p3gfaq_RYnI?si=VHCMdJI7ccp2aQvE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> salmon sashimi</a> for meal prep. The iWalkFree also has a handle at the top of the thigh, which helps for learning and balance and if you need to get someplace quickly, but when you dig into walking you rarely need to balance on the handle.</p><figure><figcaption>There's actually a rotatable 3D model of the device on iWalkFree's website and you can see how the strap system and the thigh adjustment works here. Credit: iWalkFree</figcaption></figure><p>The iWalkFree is not without its drawbacks. You do need to be more cognizant of obstacles and terrain, and it can take a little bit for your other leg to adjust to the added strain of walking. Every time you need to stand up or sit down, you are going to need to strap or unstrap the device. Doing this correctly every single time is vital but can get slightly tedious and requires you to game out the process of sitting down or standing up. But once you have actually gotten up you’re fine for a while. Many people, myself included, also complain about knee discomfort. The rationale iWalkFree gives is that they would rather have a device fit snugly than to have excess cushioning interfere with the process walking. This does not bother everyone, but if it really bothers you due to the geometry of your knee then a knee pad or a piece of memory foam seems to solve the issue fairly quickly. I was also considering throwing myself into a research hole about trekking poles anyway for hiking once my foot healed, so I may bite the bullet on those sooner rather than later</p><p>But despite its minor drawbacks, I’m having a blast. With the iWalkFree, I trip less than I did on crutches, all while being able to use my hands. There are stumbles to be sure, but far fewer than when I was back on crutches. But the part that impresses me almost as much as hands free walking is something much simpler: a company putting out a well made product while being very up front about its caveats and limitations.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/blizzard-union-story-franchise-cwa"><h3>Hell Yeah, Another Blizzard Union</h3></a><p>Members of Blizzard’s Story and Franchise Development team have unionized with the Communications Workers of America</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/subnautica-2-lawsuit-krafton-response"><h3>Krafton Responds To Subnautica 2 Lawsuit, Doubling Down On Claims That Executives ‘Abandoned’ Development</h3></a><p>Krafton lawyers say the lawsuit is over ‘a multimillion-dollar payday [the former executives] haven’t earned’</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-drifter-point-click-adventure-game-lucasarts-king-carpenter-australia"><h3>I Bloody Love The Drifter</h3></a><p>A homage to Lucasarts, John Carpenter and so much more</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/iwalkfree-review-broken-foot]]></content:encoded>

<p>So, it was with some trepidation that I went into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_tactical_takedown">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</a>, a turn-based reimagining from developer Strange Scaffold that launched on PC earlier this year promising yet another "new" take on the brothers' beat-'em-up formula. It's a promise that I've been stung by too many times in the past, and I expected nothing but the same again. Dear reader, I was wrong.</p>
<p>Tactical Takedown is a fresh take on what a Turtles game <em>can</em> be. The restraints and rigidity of a turn-based board shouldn't match the fluid motion of a beat 'em up, but somehow, here, they do. It's a bite-sized experience that isn't without flaws, but if you've grown tired of the IP's persistent punching in recent years, this is the reinvigorating pizza slice you've been waiting for.</p>
<figure><a title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158002/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Let's start with that big selling point: yes, it's turn-based. Tactical Takedown takes the Turtles' usual combo-focused combat and translates it into the world of strategy. Each hero has six Action Points per turn, which can be used to move around the arena or take on members of the Foot Clan. With them all spent, it's the Enemy Turn, and you'll see whether your strategic planning paid off, or if your Turtle is going to take a beating.</p>
<p>This format isn't especially new, but it <em>is</em> new for the Turtles. The beat-'em-up trappings are still there (giant 'GO' signs still crop up to guide you through the stages, don't worry), but Strange Scaffold has impressively folded them into the turn-based structure to create something that will feel instantly familiar to Turtles fans, even if you've never touched a strategy RPG before.</p>
<p>Take the brothers' four distinct playstyles, for example. It's a fundamental part of any good Turtles game, and it's well-translated to the turn-based arena. Mikey is all about manoeuvrability, Raph jumps straight into the action and deals heavy hits, Donnie attacks from range and has access to techy traps, and Leo chains together KOs to slice up foes with precision. You can purchase new moves and switch up each Turtle's 'loadout' before each level, but on the whole, Tactical Takedown nails the feel of each character without any tweaking needed.</p>
<figure><a title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157996/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Historically, such differentiation has meant there's objectively a 'best' character to play as (and let's admit it, it's Donnie), but the four Turtles feel nicely balanced here, with each level highlighting their pros and cons in isolation.</p>
<p>Wait, "isolation"? Yep. Chalk it up to another method of standing apart from the TMNT big hitters that have come before it, if you want, but Tactical Takedown's four-storyline plot means you'll only ever be controlling one Turtle at a time. I had no issues with this off the bat, where it's handy to play each hero individually to get used to their unique moveset, but the bros are best when they're together, so it would have been nice to see how these different playstyles and strategies could intertwine in later stages.</p>
<p>This is particularly true considering how nice the whole thing feels to play. It took me a couple of stages to get my bearings, but I was soon chaining together combos to get in and out of the action like a true ninja, and I can only imagine how satisfying that would feel if I could set the brothers up to bounce off each other. There's no option for touch controls, which I normally like to see in small-scale strategy like this, but the button inputs are simple enough that I didn't find myself longing to wipe my greasy mitts across the screen.</p>
<figure><a title="Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157997/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The brothers' separation aside, this is clearly a team that understands its source material. The story itself feels like a classic cartoon plot (Karai and Baxter Stockman are wreaking havoc in the city after Shredder's death, what a shocker!), and the brothers' distinct personalities shine through in the charming writing — Raph's hothead-to-loving-brother arc is particularly well handled.</p>
<p>Visually, it moves things in an interesting direction, too. Perfectly matching the turn-based tone of the gameplay, Tactical Takedown all looks as if it's a tabletop board game. Sections of the city pop up in isolation as you move through the stage (leaving plenty of room for punting enemies off the side of the map), and each character is represented by a miniature standee, which changes its pose based on its last action. Its simplicity feels right at home on Switch, and while the pared-back personality of the Turtles' look might not suit everyone (I, for one, missed a good idle animation), it's nice to see the heroes in a half-shell reimagined in yet another new style.</p>

<p>It's worth flagging that even if these visuals are completely up your street, you don't get to soak them up for all that long. Tactical Takedown is a bite-sized experience (I finished my initial playthrough in around five hours), and while you <em>can</em> head back into the levels with a new loadout or to beat your high score, it's still the same structure with the same difficulty, which is rather easy.</p>
<p>Remix Mode, a new addition for the Switch release, alleviates this somewhat... but only <em>somewhat</em>. This optional extra lets you replay each level at a higher difficulty with more variety in the enemy types. The difficulty bump is a noticeable one — I died once on my initial playthrough, but I was lucky to get through the opening stages unscathed in Remix — and the new enemies bring their own helping of challenges, but it does still feel like the same old level with the same old Turtle. Which, in fairness, it is.</p>
<p>So, replayability isn't the name of the game in Tactical Takedown, and that's okay. I do wish that the main campaign had lasted for a little longer, but I'd always rather be left wanting more than see a gameplay loop outstay its welcome.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The combination of turn-based strategy and beat-'em-up gameplay felt like a bit of a square peg, round hole situation, but Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown melds the two to deliver one of the freshest takes on TMNT that I've seen in a long time. It's a short-but-sweet experience that might not gel with <em>everyone</em>, but after 35 years of beat 'em ups and brawlers, this showcases the Turtles like you've never seen them before. And come on, that's pretty radical, dude.</p></section>

Two puzzles in, I can already tell you that I like it a lot.</p><p>The rules in <em>Mini Sudoku</em> are quite similar to regular sudoku: you need to fill in all of the blank spots of a puzzle with a number, but a number can’t repeat in a line, row, or box. But the twist with <em>Mini Sudoku</em> is that it uses six numbers instead of nine, meaning the game has smaller puzzles that are a little easier to take in across a mobile phone screen. You can also make notes and ask for hints if you need them.</p><p>The smaller puzzles have also (so far) been faster for me to solve. <em>The New York Times’</em> easy sudoku puzzle usually takes me more than five minutes to finish (could be a skill issue), and the first two <em>Mini Sukoku</em> puzzles have taken me about two and four minutes to complete, respectively. I know that’s not a huge jump, but every minute counts when I’m trying to finish a puzzle before my toddler wakes up in the morning.</p><p>The most annoying thing about <em>Mini Sudoku</em> is that it’s on LinkedIn, so it means I’ve found myself accidentally scrolling my LinkedIn feed. But I might have to learn to deal with that to finish my daily puzzle.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has an exciting proposition on its hands with ARC Raiders. The multiplayer shooter exudes all the qualities of a well-thought-out and handcrafted extraction game, so let’s check out its release date and potential start times to see when we can get you above the ground.</p>



<p>There’s been serious buzz around <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-arc-raiders-pvp-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> since day one. Having Embark Studios behind the project—creators of the chaotic and addictive The Finals—has naturally generated hype. Sprinkle in some fun lore, angry machines, and the constant danger of encountering other real-life players, and ARC Raiders could be something.</p>



<p>Let’s check out its confirmed release date.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-arc-raiders-coming-out">When is ARC Raiders Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The surface isn’t safe. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>We have a fixed October 30 release date for ARC Raiders.</strong></p>



<p>Once the initial <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-arc-raiders-invite-code-for-tech-test-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders playtest</a> finished, all anyone wanted was a release date. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-players-think-they-found-a-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Players even thought they’d found one</a>, only for this to be false. However, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-release-date-summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer Game Fest 2025</a> finally answered prayers and gave us a concrete release date.</p>



<p>It’s arriving in the middle of a competitive window. Battlefield 6 and Black Ops 7 will be waging war on either side of the Oct 30 date. If you’re after a competent, tactical extraction shooter instead of all-out multiplayer warfare, <a href="https://arcraiders.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ARC Raiders</a> might be what you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-arc-raiders-start-times">Do we Know ARC Raiders’ Start Times?</h2>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, it’s too early to give you exact start time for ARC Raiders, but we might be able to hazard a guess based on previous data.</strong></p>



<p>I find that previous betas and playtests can be a good indicator of the final launch times. One particular ARC Raiders playtest started at 1:30 AM PT. Does this mean ARC Raiders will release at 1:30 AM on October 30? We’ll have to wait and see.</p>



<p>The only thing I can do is tell you we’ll be updating this article once we have the accurate start times. The confirmed release date is the crucial aspect for now, and you can see where the game falls in a crowded game calendar.</p>

<p>Based on the playtests and early footage, what is making ARC Raiders so desirable to you? Is there a standout feature, mechanic, or design choice swaying you harder than Escape From Tarkov or Gray Zone Warfare, for example?

In addition, the patch notes reveal more that's been added to the drug-dealing title. A vehicle called the Hotbox and a pump shotgun can now be found within the game, too, for instance.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer TVGS announced the rollout of the Schedule 1 cartel update for beta players <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/546742887822393994" rel="nofollow ">on Steam</a>. It's noted that you won't interact with the Benzies family until unlocking "a few customers in Westville."

After finishing the storyline with the Benzies crew, Schedule 1 players can purchase Hyland Manor.</p><p dir="ltr">The Schedule 1 update also alters how new regions become available to players. The cartel influence level has to be lowered to a certain threshold before moving on to another area, per the patch notes.

<p>"It would be a very good business decision"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Tekken 8 Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f1ca4b8d5119e/tekken-8-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 release schedule is already home to a bunch of ports that never would have been possible on Switch 1, and we can only assume that this will continue for the years to come. One title that's yet to be eyed for the new hybrid is <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/tekken_8">Tekken 8</a>, but that's not to say that the game's director hasn't thought about it.</p>
<p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-switch-2">Eurogamer</a>, director Katsuhiro Harada confessed that Bandai Namco's latest fighter on Switch 2 is "an interesting option, and not totally off the table," but it sounds like it would be far from a simple port. "It would require a lot of work on the game to get it running on that hardware," Harada continued.</p>
<p>"From a business standpoint, [Switch 2] is doing quite well, so it would be a very good business decision if you're trying to get a bigger audience," the director mapped out, "but the amount of work that would have to be done on the game makes it not a very easy decision".</p>
<p>It's far from any kind of confirmation (Harada even emphasised that there is "nothing to announce" on this front right now), but it's interesting to hear these pros and cons, nonetheless. As for introducing the game to a bigger audience, that can only be a good thing for Tekken 8 at the moment. It's still under some serious heat after its <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/04/tekken-8-season-2-patch-notes-are-here-insane-buffs-have-fans-asking-if-its-an-april-fools-joke">Season 2 patch</a> resulted in heavy backlash and even boycotts from the fans, and the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/05/tekken-8-ps5-fans-miffed-by-latest-content-roadmap">latest content roadmap</a> didn't go down much better.</p>
<p>Maybe all that work for a Switch 2 port would be worthwhile, then? We'll just have to wait and see. The good folk over at our sister site, Push Square, gave Tekken 8 a whopping 9/10 in their <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/tekken-8">review</a>, calling it "the franchise at its bombastic best", so we sure wouldn't mind getting in on that action too...</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-franchise-could-bring-back-%E2%80%98social-stealth%E2%80%99.1269243/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A popular feature from the Assassin’s Creed franchise, ‘social stealth’ could make its return in one of the next games in the series. </p>



<p>Since Assassin’s Creed: Shadows has now been released, players are already waiting for the next big game in the series. Recently, Ubisoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-over-remake-slip-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threatened to sue</a> the actor of Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag over a slip-up with the remake details. Now, the developers have revealed that an old feature hasn’t been ruled out from the franchise, which means we could see it in one of the next games. </p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-devs-reveal-why-it-didn-t-have-social-stealth">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Devs Reveal Why It Didn’t Have Social Stealth</h2>



<p>During a recent AMA segment with the devs on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1mo3rmj/hi_were_simon_andr%C3%A9_and_luc_developers_on/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">r/assassinscreed</a> subreddit (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/ubisoft-explains-why-assassins-creed-shadows-ditched-social-stealth-but-says-its-likely-not-gone-for-good-our-stealth-team-chose-to-put-100-percent-of-their-energy-on-the-moment-to-moment-tactical-shinobi-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), the developers were asked whether “social stealth elements” could make a comeback in the future. Additionally, they were also asked why social stealth was not a part of Assassin’s Creed: Shadows. </p>



<p>The developers responded, stating that for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, the stealth team had put “100% of their energy on the moment-to-moment tactical shinobi experience”, which is why there was no room to add social stealth. However, that “does not mean that Social Stealth is gone from the Assassin’s Creed franchise”. </p>



<p>For those wondering, social stealth was a feature seen in previous Assassin’s Creed games, where the protagonist could hide from his enemies and pursuers by blending in with the crowd. </p>

<h2 id="h-assassins-vs-templars-conflict-is-the-core-pillar-of-the-ac-series">Assassins Vs. Templars Conflict is the Core Pillar of the AC Series </h2>



<p>During the same AMA segment, the developers added that the Assassins vs. Templars conflict has always been a core pillar of the Assassin’s Creed series. With Shadows, they planned to establish their protagonist in the setting before expanding on the conflict. Now that it is done in the main game and through the Critical Role story drop, players should expect “more deep dive in this conflict in the near future.”</p>



<p>In other news, the Claws of Awaji DLC is scheduled to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-releases-in-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release this September</a>. Additionally, Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-rating-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rated for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>. What are your thoughts on social stealth returning to the Assassin’s Creed franchise? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

                <p>Developers at Arkane Studios in France have called on their parent company, Microsoft, to stop supporting Israel during its ongoing war in Gaza, which a <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2024/11/un-special-committee-finds-israels-warfare-methods-gaza-consistent-genocide" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">UN Special Committee</a> said was "consistent with the characteristics of genocide."</p><p>The <a href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2025/08/open-letter-from-the-arkan-studios-union-section-to-microsofts-and-its-subsidiaries-management/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">open letter</a> published online (via <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-microsoft-has-no-place-being-accomplice-of-a-genocide-arkane-union-workers-demand-microsoft-cut-ties-with-israeli-regime" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>) is addressed to the "heads of Zenimax, Microsoft Gaming and the overall Microsoft group." It says that the ongoing situation in Gaza and Microsoft's work with Israel could "affect our reputation and work" and asks Microsoft to take the "appropriate measure" to resolve it. It joins the Boycott, Divest, and Sanction (BDS) movement, which has set Microsoft as a priority target of its boycott. BDS specifically mentions Microsoft's gaming division and Game Pass among its boycott targets.</p><p>"We think that Microsoft has no place being accomplice of a genocide, and as Microsoft employees, we don't want to be part of this sinister project for Gaza," the letter continues. "Moreover, we think it's our responsibility, as tech workers, to raise the alarm, and to ensure that our technologies are used to make the voices of the oppressed heard, and not facilitate their demise.</p><p>"In a more direct manner, we think this could very well affect our life directly, by reducing the audience for our games, thus directly compromising the viability of Xbox Games, and, in the long run, our very own jobs."</p><p>The letter cites reporting from the <a href="https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/best-of-the-week/first-winner/2025/as-israel-uses-u-s-made-ai-models-in-war-concerns-arise-about-techs-role-in-who-lives-and-who-dies/" rel="nofollow ">Associated Press</a> showing Microsoft has collaborated with the Israeli military through its cloud and Azure services, as well as its AI systems that have been used to define bombing targets. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/microsoft-israeli-military-palestinian-phone-calls-cloud" rel="nofollow ">The Guardian</a> also found that Israel's military surveillance agency has used Azure to extensively monitor Palestinians. Microsoft denied any knowledge of this use, and said it did not "build or consult" with Israel surveillance, but has reportedly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/09/microsoft-israeli-military-azure-cloud-investigation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">opened an internal investigation</a> regardling the claims.</p><p>Arkane said it is joining an existing petition from Microsoft employees called No Azure for Apartheid, which has laid out specific demands including: termination of all ongoing or future contracts with "Israeli Occupation Forces," transparent disclosure of ties to the Israeli military including an independent and public audit of its contracts and services, an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza, and free speech and safety for pro-Palestinian employees. Microsoft employees and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-11/microsoft-investors-prod-company-over-work-with-israeli-military?sref=uE15RiYa" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shareholders</a> began pressuring Microsoft for increased transparency in spring. In May, an employee <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/669362/microsoft-employee-protest-build-conference-satya-nadella" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">interrupted Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella</a> during a keynote with a "Free Palestine" protest.</p><p>For its part, in a <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/05/15/statement-technology-israel-gaza/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post in May</a> Microsoft claimed that it conducted both internal and external reviews and "found no evidence to date that Microsoft’s Azure and AI technologies have been used to target or harm people in the conflict in Gaza." At the same time, though, it acknowledged that it does not have visibility into how customers use its software.</p><p>Since the start of the BDS boycott, the situation in Gaza has worsened. A <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/07/1165517" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">United Nations report</a> published in late July says that food security experts warn of a "worst-case scenario of famine" unfolding in the region, as "widespread starvation, malnutrition and disease" are driving an increase in hunger-related deaths. Israel prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israels-leader-claims-no-one-in-gaza-is-starving-data-and-witnesses-disagree" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">claimed</a>, "There is no policy of starvation in Gaza, and there is no starvation in Gaza."</p><p>Arkane is the Microsoft studio behind games like Dishonored, Prey, and Deathloop. Its current project is an adaptation of Marvel's vampire hunter Blade, though we haven't seen much of the game yet. The studio said in 2023 that it was going to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-new-blade-game-wont-be-discussed-for-a-while/1100-6519831/" data-ref-id="1100-6519831">"stay silent for a while."</a></p>
