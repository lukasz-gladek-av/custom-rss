			<p>Okomotive, the developer behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/far-lone-sails-hope-never-truly-lost/">the FAR series</a>, has revealed its brand <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3047750/Herdling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new adventure title</a>,&nbsp; Herdling, providing gamers with a brand new adventure.</p>
<p>Okomotive &amp; Panic are set to debut Herdling in the realm of gaming. The title revolves around the adventure of making an expedition with "a herd of loveable beasts," encountering several mysteries and surprising obstacles in the journey to reach a mystery on the summit. According to developers, the main idea behind Herdling is to provide gamers with an immersive experience that is relatable not just to the users but to the actual creators themselves. Here's how representatives from both Okomotive &amp; Panic express their optimism towards the upcoming title:</p>
<p>"With Herdling we wanted to start a new kind of adventure, not only for the players, but also for us. To create the herd of beasts and their mountainous world was an ambitious challenge for us, and we enjoyed every step of that journey," said Co-Founders Don Schmocker and Goran Saric.</p>
<p>Nick Suttner, Panic's Director of Publishing, also stated: "The FAR games are moody, moving masterpieces as far as we're concerned, so we couldn’t be more thrilled to work with Okomotive on their brand-new adventure. Herdling feels like a return to the scale and fidelity of something like Firewatch for us, so it’s really exciting to have it in our lineup. We’re huge fans of games like Inside and The Last Guardian - stirring, solo adventures that really communicate a sense of awe, loneliness, and a particular brand of companionship."</p>
<p><em>-Nick Suttner, Panic’s Director of Publishing.</em></p>
<p>Okomotive's newest title surely has fans waiting out, given the initial glimpses that show that the "herding" experience has gotten a lot more enticing. Here is how Herdling is expected to play out for fans:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&nbsp;Guide, protect, and fall in love with a motley herd of Calicorns</em></li>
<li><em>Traverse stunning mountainscapes, fog-wreathed forests, snowy plateaus, and forgotten valleys</em></li>
<li><em>Hone your herding skills as you navigate a wide range of challenges, threats, and light</em><br>
<em>environmental puzzles</em></li>
<li><em>Feel the rush of the mountain air alongside your herd in exhilarating stampede sequences</em></li>
<li><em>An emotional, wordless tale of trust, survival, and companionship during a great crossing</em><br>
<em>through a fallen world</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of the release of the title, Okomotive x Panic is expected to showcase the behind-the-scenes look at the Panic Games Showcase, which is set to be held by August 27, with first-hand playable demos to be held at PAX West 2024. Herdling will debut on PC and consoles by 2025, but we haven't gotten an exact launch date yet.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-hits-2-3-million-concurrent-players-at-steam-surpassing-cyberpunk-2077-elden-ring/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-myth-wukong-hits-2-3-million-concurrent-players-at-steam-surpassing-cyberpunk-2077-elden-ring.959664/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-hits-2-3-million-concurrent-players-at-steam-surpassing-cyberpunk-2077-elden-ring/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Black Myth: Wukong, the title that has taken the industry by storm, has now broken records for Steam concurrent viewers, reaching its all-time peak.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong has become a favorite in the industry. Just within a few hours of launch, the title has managed to hit 2.22 million concurrent players on Steam, the highest for a single-player title ever on the platform, beating the likes of Counter Strike-2, Dota 2, Elden Ring, and Cyberpunk 2077. Given that this number is limited to players on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358720/Black_Myth_Wukong/?snr=1_4_4__118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam only</a>, it's imminent that the overall figures will be much higher.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>This is shocking for the industry, given that the hype around Black Myth: Wukong pre-launch wasn't that massive for it to be translated into such figures. But the gaming industry has its ways, and we might have an idea about the turn-out of the title. Black Myth: Wukong is highly popular in Eastern regions, particularly in China, and given the population the nation holds, we believe that 2.22 million players aren't the actual peak, and there's still a lot to happen.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">How China-specific is interest in Black Myth: Wukong? A lot: <a href="https://twitter.com/gamediscoverco?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GameDiscoverCo</a>'s current estimate of its Steam country split for players is 88.1% China, 3% U.S., 1.6% Hong Kong, 1% Japan. <a href="https://t.co/FeAFn85NBH">pic.twitter.com/FeAFn85NBH</a></p>
<p>— Simon Carless (@simoncarless) <a href="https://twitter.com/simoncarless/status/1825818693751779449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>An estimate by GameDiscoverCo shows that around 88.1% of Black Myth: Wukong's share is owned by China, while other nations such as the US, Hong Kong, and Japan hold a lesser portion. This shows that Chinese influence is indeed playing its part in the viewership of Black Myth: Wukong, and by the looks of it, the viewership figures are expected to skyrocket from hereon, too.</p>
<p>For those unaware, Black Myth: Wukong is a title which seeks to combine rich storytelling with stunning visuals and a unique take on the action RPG formula, putting players on a journey to discove ancient Chinese mythology, breathtaking landscapes, and a diverse cast of memorable characters based on their novel Journey to the West. The close attachment of the title to Chinese cultures and traditions is one of the main reasons why there has been a massive portion of players from the region. Along with that, the in-game mechanics and the visually stunning staff-based melee combat system have elevated the title's experience to new levels.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">review of&nbsp;</a><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Myth: Wukong</a> also showed that the title "couldn't have been a better debut for Game Science." The game has received a Metacritic average score of 82, showing that in terms of the overall experience, it is undoubtedly something to savor and something gamers should look forward to.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Just Six of Yesterday's Gamescom Announcements Are Confirmed for Switch]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamescom-onl-2024-switch</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/just-six-of-yesterdays-gamescom-announcements-are-confirmed-for-switch.959658/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamescom-onl-2024-switch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An eagle-eyed observer has noted that of the 62 announcements and reveals featured during yesterday's Gamescom Opening Night Live show, just six are definitely coming to Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>As noted by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/of-all-the-62-games-featured-at-the-gamescom-opening-night-live-only-7-games-are-available-or-will-be-available-on-switch.959187/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ResetEra user BY2K</a>, 62 announcements were made during Gamescom, of which some were new games, some were expansions or updates for existing games, and some were release date trailers or launch trailers for games we already knew about.</p>
<p>Just six of those announcements were for games that are either already on Nintendo Switch or are coming to the console at some point in the future, BY2K notes. One of them, HoYoverse's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-50-release-date">soon-to-be-updated</a>&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>, has a very uncertain future indeed on Nintendo's console.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nikoderiko-nintendo-switch-gamescom-announcements.jpg?itok=S8Dpe33v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nikoderiko-nintendo-switch-gamescom-announcements.jpg?itok=lBupvOuK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Colorful platformer&nbsp;<em>Nikoderiko: The Magical World&nbsp;</em>is one of just six Gamescom ONL 2024 games definitely coming to Switch.</figcaption></figure><p>Here's the full list of confirmed Switch releases from last night's Gamescom presentation in all its glory.</p>
<ul><li><em>Dave the Diver</em>'s upcoming crossovers (with&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/potion-craft-alchemist-simulator"><em>Potion Craft</em></a>, and YouTuber mxmtoon)</li>
<li><em>Nikoderiko: The Magical World</em></li>
<li><em>King of Meat</em></li>
<li><em>Sid Meier's Civilization 7</em></li>
<li><em>Little Nightmares 3</em></li>
<li><em>Floatopia</em></li>
</ul><p>BY2K's list also includes&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>as a "maybe", but even if we include that game, seven out of 62 announcements isn't the best look for the machine that is still Nintendo's only current console on the market.</p>
<p>Many of these games are titles we already knew weren't on Switch, like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/naraka-bladepoint"><em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/black-myth-wukong"><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/street-fighter-6"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a>, to name but a few. For others, it's not surprising they're missing the Switch;&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred&nbsp;</em>was hardly going to appear on Nintendo's console when&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>doesn't.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-gamescom-announcements-switch.jpg?itok=9GhIqfMP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-gamescom-announcements-switch.jpg?itok=T_ZXc3R3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some of yesterday's Gamescom announcements were guaranteed Switch no-shows, like&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Still, the lack of Switch ports or versions for many of yesterday's Gamescom games arguably demonstrates that the need for Nintendo to make an announcement regarding the Switch's successor is growing more urgent.</p>
<p>Many of these games are likely skipping the Switch because it simply doesn't have the technical prowess to run them; it's hard to imagine&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>running on a Switch, for instance.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Nintendo has pledged that it will reveal information about the Switch 2 (or whatever it ends up being called) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">before the end of this fiscal year</a>, which means we'll likely learn something between now and this coming April. Stay tuned for more.</p>

It’s a wired companion for existing Xbox controllers and includes four buttons, an Xbox thumbstick, and two additional buttons for bumper and trigger controls.</p><p>The Xbox Adaptive Joystick allows you to operate a controller without having to use both hands, making it ideal for any players who might have difficulty using the thumbsticks on existing controllers. All the buttons are fully customizable, and there are a variety of 3D printable thumbstick toppers to customize the sizes, heights, and width of thumbsticks.</p><p>“From very early on with the adaptive joystick, we had disability community be hands-on with early designs and functional prototypes,” explains Kaitlyn Jones, senior accessibility product manager at Xbox, during a Gamescom stream. “Even from a software perspective, we’ve really heard from our players that they’ve wanted an affordable joystick for their adaptive controller, but also something that fits in seamlessly with their existing setup.”</p><div><figcaption><em>The joystick has four buttons and easy access to an Xbox thumbstick.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Microsoft</cite></p></div><p>You can connect the Xbox Adaptive Joystick to Microsoft’s Adaptive Controller for a full adaptive setup, or you can plug it directly into a PC or Xbox. It can even be mounted, thanks to a threaded insert like you’d find on a camera tripod.&nbsp;</p><p>Community feedback played a big role in shaping this hardware. Microsoft visited a hospital in Seattle with a box of prototypes for one particular feedback session. “We got feedback on the grip size, shape, the number of buttons, and where the buttons are located,” says Chris Kujawski, principal designer at Xbox.&nbsp;</p><p>Alongside Microsoft’s own Xbox Adaptive Joystick, the company has also revealed a new $59.99 <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/lite-se-wireless-xbox/">Lite SE controller from 8BitDo</a> that’s also designed for gamers with limited mobility. It has low-resistance buttons and Hall effect joysticks, and all the buttons are accessible at the top of the controller.</p><div><figcaption><em>8BitDo’s new accessibility controller.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: 8BitDo</cite></p></div><p>Microsoft has also built a new toggle hold feature for Xbox controllers that’s available to test for Xbox Insiders today. “This new feature is intended to help make using a controller even easier and supports players who have difficulty holding prolonged button presses,” says <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/08/21/xbox-accessibility-adaptive-joystick-thumbstick-toppers/">Microsoft’s gaming accessibility team</a>. “Similar to sticky keys on a computer, assign any button or port on the Xbox Adaptive Controller, Xbox Adaptive Joystick, or Xbox Elite Series 2 controller to stay pressed until pressing again to release.”</p><p>The Xbox Adaptive Joystick also comes with improved packaging that’s similar to what Microsoft did with its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/25/17611488/microsoft-xbox-adaptive-controller-unboxing-packaging">previous Xbox Adaptive Controller</a>. Microsoft is also improving the accessibility of the packaging for its three new Xbox Series S / X console options that are launching in October.</p><p>The <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fxbox-adaptive-joystick">Xbox Adaptive Joystick</a> will launch in early 2025 in select Xbox markets worldwide and will be sold exclusively through the Microsoft Store, priced at $29.99.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Star Wars is for kids. At least, that's the excuse that gets rolled out whenever one raises an issue with poor plotting, fart jokes, or pat moral lessons. But Star Wars also takes place in a universe with dark implications, like a fascistic Empire that turns a blind eye to crime lords who trade in sentient slaves and illicit drugs. Star Wars has long shied away from letting its seedy criminal underworld simply be unapologetically seedy, but by setting itself in the midst of it, Star Wars Outlaws may just be the scumbag simulator we've been waiting for.</p><p dir="ltr">While it would be easy to lay this problem at the feet of the kid-friendly Disney corporation, the Star Wars franchise's unease with portraying criminals actually began much earlier, with franchise creator George Lucas. Lucas himself authored the classic ur-example of a charming dirtbag with a heart of gold, Han Solo. Years later, he apparently felt conflicted about one of pop culture's most enduring icons being introduced as an unrepentant killer. As one of many changes made to the "Special Edition" releases of Star Wars, he altered Han's confrontation with Greedo. What was originally Han making a wry comment and then casually offing the Rodian, was changed to Han awkwardly "dodging" a shot and then firing in self-defense.</p><p dir="ltr">Subsequent edits have altered the timing slightly, and the most-recent edit has Greedo more explicitly threatening to kill Han to make the latter's actions read more as self-defense. Arguably it was always self-defense; Greedo was a bounty hunter openly stating his intentions to turn Han over to Jabba the Hutt, a ruthless crime lord who later kept Han as a trophy out of sheer spite.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4354377-3311590-han-solo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4354377" data-ratio="0.64833333333333" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4354377-3311590-han-solo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4354377"></a><figcaption>The dirtbag with a heart of gold, Han Solo</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4354377-3311590-han-solo.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Han_shot_first" rel="nofollow ">"Han shot first" controversy</a> rocked the early internet and Star Wars fandom, but at the core of the controversy was the sense that Han Solo was supposed to be a dirtbag. That was part of his character arc. He was a scoundrel and a loner who stumbled into a cause bigger than himself with friends he loved and that moved him to change. The Han Solo that we see gently smiling at the end of Return of the Jedi is not the same Han Solo who put a smoking hole in Greedo's torso, and that's the whole point. Those who favor the original cut, like myself, argue that it's actually good writing to show that a character has grown and changed as a person and is learning from their adventures. That's why we go to the movies.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Lucas decided his hero needed to be more unambiguously heroic, and less dark. Since the first change was made in 1997, 20 years after the original release, Han Solo has now spent more time being a justified self-defender than a good old-fashioned dirtbag.</p><p dir="ltr">The kid-friendly view of crime continued into the prequels, when Obi-Wan and Anakin visit a seedy Coruscant bar in Attack of the Clones while hot on the trail of a failed assassin. Our clearest signal that this is a sleazy place is when a random patron offers Obi-Wan some death sticks. That character's name? Elan Sleazebaggano. Subtle!</p><p dir="ltr">This trend continued into the Disney era with the reintroduction of Boba Fett. The popular character had lived on in expanded universe books for a long time but hadn't been seen in the main, canonical cinematic universe since he was ignominiously and presumably killed, by accident, by a blind Han Solo in Return of the Jedi.</p><p dir="ltr">Fett showed back up in live action The Mandalorian, Disney's biggest Star Wars hit on the small screen from a sheer merchandising perspective. Baby Yoda, aka Grogu, has certainly sold more lunchboxes than any other character in recent years. But Boba Fett's appearance followed a story arc revolving around Cobb Vanth, a local Tatooine lawman played by Timothy Olyphant--essentially reprising his gunslinger roles from shows like Justified, except in a Star Wars context. Vanth had found Boba Fett's old Mandalorian armor and was using it to clean up this-here town. But the title-character's fanatical obsession with Beskar armor being the birthright of true Mandalorian heritage led circuitously to the reappearance of Fett to reclaim his armor.</p><p dir="ltr">That was all to set up The Book of Boba Fett spin-off, a miniseries focused squarely on the character. The Book of Boba Fett was, unfortunately, a boring slog--to the point where the show itself just surrendered a whole episode to its more-popular character, Din Djarin.</p><p dir="ltr">But at the heart of the Book of Boba Fett's pacing problems was the simple fact that this was a story about a crime boss that was afraid to be about a crime boss. Boba Fett took over Jabba's old crime business to become Daimyo of the Mos Espa region: a sort of gentleman-criminal ruler in the style of old mobster movies. They carve up territory, put vassals in charge of pieces of their business, and keep the gears oiled with bribes and favors between government officials. It's a meaty idea that Star Wars could have sunk its rancor teeth into.</p><p dir="ltr">However, the show shied away from going into any detail about what crimes they were doing or how the enterprise worked. We saw him flexing on other crime bosses and saying his business would be run on mutual respect, but it felt toothless because the show went out of its way to tell us that Fett was a crime boss who wasn't interested in doing crimes. Instead, Fett came off as a kindly grandpa, sometimes pushing back on other crime lords who threaten him, but otherwise minding his own business and leaving the citizenry alone. At its climax, another famed bounty hunter came to town and confronted Fett, telling him that he couldn't just change his stripes so easily. While that could have been a compelling dramatic hook, the whole affair up to that point had been too muddied. Rather than feel like the culmination of the show, audiences were left asking: Wait, that's what this has been about?</p><p dir="ltr">Imagine the arc of The Godfather or Breaking Bad but in reverse: a skeezy criminal transforming into a good, boring, law-abiding citizen. There's probably a way to do this in an entertaining fashion, to make the character's redemption compelling, but this wasn't it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4354378-3911759-screenshot2021-11-29at16.41.44.png" data-ref-id="1300-4354378" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4354378-3911759-screenshot2021-11-29at16.41.44.png" data-ref-id="1300-4354378"></a><figcaption>The Book of Boba Fett was a narrative mess, but the armor is still cool</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4354378-3911759-screenshot2021-11-29at16.41.44.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Now at long last we have Star Wars Outlaws, a game that appears to actually be about the criminal underworld, with nary a Jedi or Mandalorian in sight. This may finally be a Star Wars crime story that allows itself to be about criminals doing crimes, and dirtbags getting their hands dirty. Ubisoft is leaning into that direction in its public statements, outlining various criminal syndicates like the Hutts and Pykes, and stating that the rise of the criminal underworld is all a byproduct of a galaxy under the boot of the Empire.</p><p dir="ltr">"What happens when you have a civil war consuming the galaxy? Well, criminal organizations and syndicates, they find a space to rise up," narrative director Navid Khavari told <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-developers-on-creating-the-most-ambitious-star-wars-game-yet/1100-6515135/">GameSpot</a>. "This [era sees] them thriving and seeking all kinds of opportunities--them at their strongest, to a certain extent. To enter into the underworld within that window felt like a perfect starting point for someone like Kay and for the player."</p><p dir="ltr">And Kay herself is no shining beacon of virtue. The central plot revolves around her planning a massive heist, and maintaining good working relationships with the syndicates with factional alignments is how you make your way through the campaign. That sounds as if your choices aren't so much good or evil, but rather, different variations of bad.</p><p dir="ltr">I have no doubt that protagonist Kay Vess will ultimately be a criminal with a heart of gold--taking risks to save people she's come to care about or to stop some greater, unrepentant evil from taking place. That's just how this character template works. But it's the contrast between her criminal activities and her heroism that makes these stories work, and for that to be believable, we have to give the universe some room to show us how shady it can be. I'm excited for Outlaws for lots of reasons, but mostly because I hope we finally get a closer look at the underworld.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> GTA 6 (Grand Theft Auto VI) Official Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The number of people playing video games and the time spent playing continues to fall behind the all-time highs achieved in 2021, Circana said. The downturn is attributable in part to inflation on everyday items people need to live like groceries, which in turn has left less money available to the average person to spend on gaming, Circana said.</p><p>For 2024, video game hardware revenue is expected to continue to decline due in part to the total number of units sold and their average prices declining. People have shifted some of their play time to more accessible platforms like PC and mobile, and this has helped offset some of the declines in the console market, Circana said.</p><p>"This will continue to be a difficult year for video game manufacturers and publishers, as an overall spending decline, albeit in the low single-digits, is expected," Piscatella said.</p><p>Looking ahead to 2025, though, Piscatella said the US video game industry is poised for a rebound. GTA VI, which is among the most-anticipated games of all time, along with the massively hyped Switch 2, should help the video game industry's fortunes in 2025, Piscatella said.</p><p>"The anticipated first-half debut of Nintendo's next generation hardware platform should provide a significant boost, as should the launch of Grand Theft Auto VI, which may just become the biggest entertainment launch in US history," Piscatella said.</p><p>Not only are video game industry revenues falling this year in the US, but a number of major developers are cutting jobs. More than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-layoffs-sadly-continue-with-more-cuts-at-ubisoft/1100-6525884/" data-ref-id="1100-6525884">10,000 video game jobs have been lost so far in 2024 worldwide. </a></p>

But many were surprised that Capcom had recast the voice of beloved protagonist Frank West. After weeks of speculation, Capcom has finally announced the new West: Jas Patrick.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-dev-team-interview">IGN in a recent interview</a>, the development team behind Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster confirmed that Patrick would voice Frank West. Patrick is best known for his work on Octopath Traveler 2, where he voiced Partitio. Additionally, Patrick has lent his voice to other projects, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnKwHlxLklE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genshin Impact</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UY8vpu2OZE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jojo's Bizarre Adventure</a>, and the 2023 version of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVRgS4pVATg&amp;t=6s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rurouni Kenshin</a> anime, to name a few, as shown on his YouTube account and listed on <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm10572395/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">his IMDb page</a>.  </p><p>"Jas Patrick is the new voice of Frank West for Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. We're very pleased with the work he's done for this project," the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster Development Team confirmed to IGN in the interview.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster was announced in late June. The<a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-official-teaser-trailer"> first teaser trailer</a> revealed that T.J. Rotolo, the original voice actor for Frank West, was not voicing the character. Following the trailer's release, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/original-frank-west-voice-actor-says-capcom-didnt-ask-him-to-return-for-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster">Rotolo revealed</a> to a fan on <a href="https://x.com/FrankByDaylight/status/1806716618699059583?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> that he was not reprising his role in Deluxe Remaster because Capcom did not contact him, and "the reasons are the producers' own." </p><p>When we asked them about this, the development team said they regret that "[they] were unable to have TJ Rotolo reprise his role in Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster." However, Capcom added that the studio "sincerely" appreciates all of the work Rotolo did for the Dead Rising series. </p><p>Frank West is just one of many characters who received a new voice actor in Deluxe Remaster. Nevertheless, as I mentioned briefly <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/we-love-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-so-far-unlocked-655">in an episode of Unlocked</a>, Frank West's new voice grew on me. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Dead Rising Dexlue Remaster is the second remastering of the 2006 original. Powered by the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-release-date-revealed-will-run-in-4k-and-60fps-in-re-engine">RE Engine</a>, Deluxe Remaster improves the lighting, in-game backgrounds, and environments. More importantly, a ton of quality-of-life changes have been introduced, such as the ability to move while aiming and improved survivor AI. Some things have also been removed, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-removes-the-erotica-genre-from-the-photography-mini-game-update">such as the "Erotica' genre</a> in the photography mini-game. </p><p>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster will be released on September 19 for digital storefronts, while the physical version will be released on November 8.

Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster provides a quality-of-life update to a beloved zombie game that seeks to revive this dormant series and appeal to a wider audience. I was fortunate enough to ask the development team behind the remaster a few questions I was curious about following my hands-on preview.</p><p>In the interview, we discussed an array of changes in Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. This includes what other changes fans can expect in the full release, what <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-finally-adds-an-option-to-pause-infinity-mode">changes were made to Infinity Mode</a>, what the future holds for the series, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-frank-west-voice-actor-officially-revealed">who exactly is voicing Frank West</a>. </p><p>Check out the full interview below, and if you want to know my impressions from an early build, check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-preview">my hands-on preview</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>IGN:</strong> <strong>What inspirations did Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster carry over most from the previous Dead Rising games, like Dead Rising 2, and what might be the most surprising changes to veterans of the series beyond what was already previously announced?</strong></p><p><strong>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster Development Team:</strong> Playing through <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-rising-2">Dead Rising 2</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-rising-3">3</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-rising-4">4</a> and listening to fans’ feedback helped us reaffirm what elements needed to be included in <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-rising">Dead Rising 1</a>. In particular, we’ve put a lot of thought and care into Frank’s characterization. </p><p>One major change from the original game is the addition of several new skill books, which players can pair with in-game items for a new gameplay experience. We’ve also made adjustments so that all items players encounter have their own special uses. We encourage you to try things out for yourself without getting too hung up on your impressions from the original game. </p><p><strong>Speaking of changes, I noticed several, if not all, of the previously voiced characters, like Brad and Jessie, received new voice actors, most notably Frank West. Was there any specific reason for some characters not having their original voice actors reprise their roles?</strong><br>
<strong>DRDR Dev Team: </strong>Based on fans’ wishes and our own developmental wishes, we wanted to use the English voiceover from the original game without making any changes. Unfortunately, we weren’t able to move forward with this plan because the contract for the 18-year-old game was outdated. Another one of our goals for Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster was to make the game fully voiced, so we made some changes to the cast of voice actors. We’ve all been very pleased with the new actors’ performances. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Based on fans’ wishes and our own developmental wishes, we wanted to use the English voiceover from the original game without making any changes </p></div><p><strong>Speaking of Frank West, many in the Dead Rising community, including myself, have been trying to figure out who is voicing Frank West. Who is the talent voicing Frank West in Deluxe Remaster?</strong></p><p><strong>DRDR Dev Team: </strong>Jas Patrick is the new voice of Frank West for Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. We’re very pleased with the work he’s done for this project. </p><p><strong>I know Frank West’s original voice actor, TJ Rotolo, revealed he </strong><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-confirms-licensed-music-from-original-dead-rising-will-be-in-deluxe-remaster"><strong>was not contacted by Capcom</strong></a><strong> about reprising his role. Is there any reason why you decided not to contact Rotolo to return and voice Frank West?</strong></p><p><strong>DRDR Dev Team: </strong>We regret that we were unable to have TJ Rotolo reprise his role in Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster and accommodate the requests of our dedicated fans. We have selected a new voice actor for Frank West, but we sincerely appreciate all that TJ Rotolo has done for the Dead Rising series and wish him the best in his future endeavors.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster Screenshots</h3></div></output><p><strong>We received a ton of information on 72-Hour Mode but little to nothing on the other modes. Regarding Infinity Mode specifically, can you describe some of the biggest changes introduced that make it a little less challenging to play while still maintaining the challenge of obtaining achievements like 5- or 7-day survivor?</strong></p><p><strong>DRDR Dev Team: </strong>Regarding Infinity Mode, players are now able to save mid-game and exit without losing their progress. Along with the ability to fast forward time, we made some adjustments that we think will allow players to enjoy the mode more casually than in the original game. Since zombies now drop items at a low rate, a more aggressive playstyle has become a viable option for this mode as well.</p><p><strong>Before Deluxe Remaster, the series remained dormant since Dead Rising 4’s release in 2016. Should fans take Deluxe Remaster as a sign of things to come? Is there a chance Capcom will go back and remaster other Dead Rising games or perhaps consider developing a new entry altogether?</strong><br>
<strong>DRDR Dev Team:</strong> Capcom would like to continue to bring back many of its IPs. In hopes of expanding upon the Dead Rising series in the future, we’d first like to put effort into promoting Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster and share its appeal with fans around the world. </p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-everything-you-need-to-know-before-starting-the-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Black Myth: Wukong is an action-packed adventure based on the classic novel, Journey to the West, but no matter how well you might know the story of Sun Wukong, this video game adaptation will still challenge you. If you want to be like the Monkey King, you’ll have to master the game’s many mechanics. Here’s everything you need to know to start that journey on the right foot.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/19/bmw-again-1724069282623.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2><strong>Combat Basics</strong></h2><p>Black Myth is all about the battles, so knowing your combat basics is essential. Sprinting, attacking, and dodging will all cost you stamina, which is represented by a yellow bar beneath your health in the bottom left corner. That yellow meter lasts longer than you might expect, even at low levels, but it can run out. When it does, you’ll move and attack much slower, so keep an eye on that meter and learn how to feather it during your fights.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/blackmyth-brandedtipsandtricks-v2-0002-1724237735630.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Watch your stamina bar, if it depletes you'll be slow to dodge enemy attacks</figcaption></figure></output><p>There’s a floatiness to the combat that makes everything look really flashy, so don’t be afraid to hammer on that attack button when you can, and dodge away when necessary. Your dodge roll is pretty generous, and your aerial attacks are a great way to get in a hit while still dodging a sweeping attack from the enemy.</p><h3><strong>How to Heavy Attack</strong></h3><p>Speaking of attacks, your heavy attack requires its own talking point here. Heavy attacks work quite differently than you might expect in this game; you can’t just alternate between light and heavy on a whim. </p><p>By doing successive attacks, or executing a perfect dodge, you’ll fill a curved meter in the bottom right and earn yourself a Focus Point. These can then be spent to unleash a heavy attack in the middle of your combo. Alternatively, they can be charged up and released, if you have a window to do so. In both cases, the heavier attack will deal big damage and potentially stagger the enemy. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/blackmyth-brandedtipsandtricks-v2-0003-1724237787215.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Unleash heavy attacks with focus points</figcaption></figure></output><p>It’s worth noting too that your heavy attacks will change depending on what stance you’re in. The Smash Stance heavy attack is the strongest of the three and can be charged while moving, but has the least amount of range; the Pillar stance heavy attack does great AOE damage, but is fairly slow; and the Thrust Stance heavy attack does very good single target damage from a great distance away, but it can be easily interrupted, thus losing the charged up focus attack points. All of these stances can be unlocked by reaching the required level, and then placing a single point into their skill tree.</p><h3><strong>Making Use of Magic</strong></h3><p>There’s a lot of melee combat to be had in Black Myth, but our monkey is also capable of casting powerful magic. You’ll unlock a handful of spells throughout the game, and it’s worth using each one at first just to get a feel and figure out which one best suits your play style.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/blackmyth-brandedtipsandtricks-v2-0004-1724237817527.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Freeze enemies, even bosses, with Immobilize and get in a few hits</figcaption></figure></output><p>For example, Immobilize can hold enemies in place, letting you get in a few free hits while they’re paralyzed. If you’re able to land a strong attack while the spell is still active, like the final hit of a light combo or a heavy attack, you can actually stagger them and land even more hits even after the spell ends. Upgrading this can lengthen the effect and even stack your damage, so more aggressive players might want to consider it. For a stealthier option, you can focus on Cloud Step. This spell leaves behind a decoy while you sneak around with invisibility. This enables you to pop out of stealth for a powerful surprise attack. This can be especially effective when trying to break through a group of archers to ambush them from behind.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/blackmyth-brandedtipsandtricks-v2-0005-1724237899367.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Sneak behind the enemy with Cloud Step</figcaption></figure></output><h3><strong>Beating (or Fleeing) Bosses</strong></h3><p>Even with all those tricks up your sleeve, you’ll still have a tough time with some of the bosses in Black Myth: Wukong. The good news is that you don’t have to fight every single one. Yes, there are mandatory bosses that must be beaten, but several are optional, or even avoidable if you run into them in the field. Chapter 1’s Wandering Wight is one such example.</p><p>So, just because you see a health bar at the bottom of the screen doesn’t mean you’re locked in. You’re not a coward for running away and coming back later to fight a boss that seemed a bit too strong at the time. </p><h2><strong>Skill Trees &amp; Sparks</strong></h2><p>When it is time to level up, it’s super simple: this game lets you do it right from the pause menu. Just choose the Self-Advance tab, and you’re in. There are a ton of skill trees to choose from and advance, including your health and stamina stats, as well as the magic spells mentioned earlier.</p><p>Unlocking and leveling any of those up will cost you a Spark, aka a skill point. Fight enemies and bosses, and you get XP. Get enough XP, and you’ll earn yourself Sparks. That’s pretty straightforward. You can even get free Sparks from the scattered Meditation Spots -- just pop a squat. As the game goes on, you’ll unlock more and more places to put your skill points. Just note that some branches are locked until you reach a high enough level.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/blackmyth-brandedtipsandtricks-v2-0007-1724237955188.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Use Sparks to unlock new abilities</figcaption></figure></output><h2><strong>Keeper’s Shrines</strong></h2><p>Now, if you want to respec, that’s easy enough to do from one of the many Keeper’s Shrines. Resting at one of these will restore all your vitals and respawn most enemies, but they also serve as checkpoints, fast travel locations, and so much more. This is also where you can buy consumable items or sell some of your treasures for Will, wispy in-game currency you’ll find floating around in little green orbs, or from enemies or even pots. The Keeper’s Shrines are always updating too, so it’s worth checking in at each one for new opportunities.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/blackmyth-brandedtipsandtricks-v2-0008-1724237984107.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Visit Keeper's Shrines to recover health, fast travel, craft armor and more</figcaption></figure></output><p>Beyond everything else we just mentioned, the shrines are also where you can craft new weapons and armor. More sets unlock as you beat bosses and clear each chapter. If there is a red dot by anything in the Keeper’s Shrine, that means there’s something new unlocked in that menu. It’s definitely worth spending your materials whenever you can.</p><h2><strong>Gathering &amp; Crafting</strong></h2><p>Let’s talk more about that. Gathering resources in Black Myth isn’t like in a survival game; you’re not going out and chopping down trees for minutes at a time. Instead, you’ll spot various mushrooms, flowers, and other items along the road. It’s worth picking them up every time, because there aren’t enough to eat up too much of your time, and you can carry so many of each resource that you’re probably never going to run out of space.</p><p>Get into the habit of spending those resources every time you check in at the Keeper’s Shrine, and you’ll be able to stay on top of the best gear as you unlock it. That said, you don’t want to ignore any of the full armor set bonuses if they’re suitable for your play style. You shouldn’t always chase the higher defense or resistance number if it means losing one of those unique bonuses. Grab any and all the plants you see along your path and should have a healthy supply of ingredients for making medicines. Ginsenginling, a monstrous plant-hybrid which likes to disguise itself as one of these resources. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/b1-2024-08-07-15-38-19-05-0002-1724238029768.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Watch out for enemies disguised as plants!</figcaption></figure></output><h2><strong>Status Effects</strong></h2><p>It’s a good idea to pick up antidotes and other consumable items too, because several of the game’s enemies will hit you with nasty status effects. Some of the earliest ones include burning and poison, which should be all too familiar to the gaming crowd. Both will slowly sap your health, but unless you stop, drop, and roll or use an item, it won’t go away.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/blackmyth-brandedtipsandtricks-v2-0011-1724238369556.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Shock, poison and burning are status effects you'll want to avoid</figcaption></figure></output><p>On the flip side, Black Myth has several items that buff you too. You can increase your resistance to such burns and poisons, and even increase your attack or defense for a short time. Sometimes that can make all the difference in a tough boss fight. As always, make sure you check in at the shrine for its ever-changing stock. In addition to adding new wares over time, each chapter has its own main stock, so if you move onto a new region, fast travel back and buy up any medicine you forgot to grab!</p><h2><strong>Summoning Spirits</strong></h2><p>Would you believe we’re still not done with all of the game’s combat tricks and tips? You should be using everything at your disposal in Black Myth, and that includes spirit attacks and transformations. Spirit attacks are like quick summons, letting you replicate an enemy’s attack for yourself. Each one also confers a bonus like higher defense or critical hit chance when equipped. </p><p>Beyond those single attacks, you can also fully transform into certain creatures with their own health and stamina bar. This transformation is completely separate from your own stats, so once you run out of health or might, whichever comes first, you’ll just revert back to your regular form. It’s a great way to vary up your combat and keep yourself a little safer during boss fights.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/blackmyth-brandedtipsandtricks-v2-0014-1724238397936.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Transform into beaten foes and use their unique abilities</figcaption></figure></output><h2><strong>Get Gourd</strong></h2><p>Speaking of health and stamina, we need to talk about gourds. Drinking from these is how you’ll heal yourself out in the field, but as you can imagine, this healing is limited. One aspect you’ll need to get used to is that your remaining gulps from the gourd are represented by an icon, not a number. The amount of sips doesn’t change unless you upgrade the gourd, so do yourself a favor and memorize how many sips you can actually take before you run dry.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/blackmyth-brandedtipsandtricks-v2-0013-1724238441081.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Switch up the drink in your gourd to get different effects</figcaption></figure></output><p>As stated, you can upgrade your gourds and even swap in different ones to get additional buffs. Each one has a different rate of healing as well as bonus effects, and you can further mix things up by adding Soaks, additional bonuses like temporary poison resistance. As with all the other permutations in Black Myth: Wukong, you should find the combination that works best for you.</p><p>And with that, we’ve given you a great list of tips before starting the game. Remember that you can always visit our wiki on IGN for more strategies and guides. Good luck on your journey.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Officially licensed by PlayStation, the SN850P has a preinstalled heatsink, so it's ready to be plugged into the PS5's M.2 slot out of the box. But there is one large snag here: The WD Black 8TB SN850P retails for a staggering $1,000. Though that price is aligned with 8TB models from other manufacturers, this means the small SSD you install in your PS5 costs twice as much as the console itself.

They offer 7,200MB/s read speeds, which is well over the minimum 5,500MB/s required for PS5. But 8TB is overkill for the vast majority of PS5 users--even if they don't mind spending $900-$1,000 on an SSD.</p><p>For PC users, 8TB makes more sense considering you're storing more than just games. After all, plenty of people have external hard drives exceeding 8TB. That said, these drives are usually hard drives with comparatively slow read and write speeds, because needing a lot of storage space and needing to access that amount of data quickly are two very different things. For example, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Western-Digital-Elements-External-external/dp/B07D5V2ZXD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8TB Western Digital Elements external hard drive</a> is $170 at Amazon. You could buy five of these drives for the price of one 8TB SN850X.</p><p>With all that said, AAA game file sizes are only getting bigger as time goes on. At the moment, the 8TB SN850P can store approximately 45 copies of Call of Duty on PS5. Owners of this 8TB WD Black SSD may be laughing in a few years when they are able to store 10 whole AAA releases on their PS5 or PC.</p><hr><h2 dir="ltr">More PS5-compatible NVMe SSDs</h2><p dir="ltr">Below, you'll find SSDs from other brands such as Samsung, Lexar, Crucial, and Silicon Power. All of these drives are compatible with PS5. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Corsair-MP600-NVMe-PCIe-Gen4/dp/B0CJRN3LLX?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Crucial also has an 8TB PS5-compatible SSD with a heatsink</a> and 7,000MB/s speeds.

                <p>Save for that blissful half-hour of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-love-letter/1100-6500662/" data-ref-id="1100-6500662">Silksong</a> that I played back in E3 2019, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/constance/" data-ref-id="5000-591522">Constance</a> is, so far, the best <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight/" data-ref-id="5000-448603">Hollow Knight</a>-like game I've ever played. It's not exactly the same--Constance takes a page out of Splatoon's book and features a main character that can wield dangerous purple paint and submerge into puddles in order to slink past enemies or obstacles or ascend up walls--but I couldn't help but be reminded of my time spend in Hallownest. My time with the game was unfortunately quite short--I played a 20-minute <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamescom-opening-night-live-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5715/" data-ref-id="2900-5715">Gamescom</a> demo--but I adored what I saw of its quirky world and enjoyed how much the various designs of the robotic enemies and assortment of paint-based abilities shook up each combat encounter. Just as Hollow Knight's gameplay emulates the acrobatic dance and frenzied movements of insects, combat in Constance feels like the frenetic flourishes and flicks of a paintbrush as an artist enters the flow state.</p><p dir="ltr">Constance's story seems quite interesting but I'm reserving judgment until I see more of it--20 minutes just isn't enough time to get a grasp of the action-adventure game's narrative. In the game, you play as the titular heroine and explore a non-linear interconnected world that's been overtaken with danger. The Constance you're playing as is the figurative representation of the Constance in the real world, an artist. This game represents Constance's mental health journey with each of the six biomes emulating the different aspects of her psyche and personal history.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBni8IHL7pY" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nBni8IHL7pY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/celeste/" data-ref-id="5000-460241">Celeste</a> remains one of my favorite games of all time, and Constance's story feels like it gives off big Celeste energy. This is most clearly seen in Constance's mechanics, with both platforming segments and combat gauntlets standing in for figurative struggles. Using brush techniques--like sinking into the ground and becoming paint to slide under enemies, or shooting out paint to attack a far-away foe or bounce off a spike, for example--corrupts Constance. If you cool off, the corruption stops but if you use too many of the techniques in a row, Constance becomes corrupted and takes on a negative side effect until she has a chance to meditate at a checkpoint. Obviously, the pressures of burnout and the process of addressing it are more complex than that, but the mechanics capture the gist of the sensation.</p><p dir="ltr">In the same vein, Constance has this really cool death mechanic wherein every time she dies, you have the choice of returning to the last checkpoint at full health or continuing from exactly where you died with only 60% of your maximum health. Graciously, going for the latter over and over does not stack over multiple deaths, but it does make repeated efforts against a challenging boss or multiple failed attempts to get past an especially difficult platforming segment much harder. You're going at the challenge you just messed up with almost half your health gone, after all--that means you have to do better at dodging the enemy attacks or avoiding the chip damage of multiple falls off the map. It's not impossible, however, which makes it tempting--much as it's tempting to be tired or hurt and still maintain that everything is fine and you can just persevere through. Take a moment to catch your breath and work your way back up to the issue at hand fully rested and stress-free? Couldn't be me!</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4354061-ss_a078ed3ee6e59a5a336790fd40ae8c33a40bb052.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4354061" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4354061-ss_a078ed3ee6e59a5a336790fd40ae8c33a40bb052.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4354061"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4354061-ss_a078ed3ee6e59a5a336790fd40ae8c33a40bb052.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I'm curious to see how mechanics like these continue to impact the gameplay and affect the player's understanding of the story. I think it could be really cool, but again it's difficult to get a solid read on the full experience from such a short demo.</p><p dir="ltr">Mechanically, Constance is a strong game. There's that perfect level of pushback to Constance's strikes, delivering a sense of heft to each attack while encouraging the player to utilize hit-and-run tactics and quickly move across the screen like a paintbrush rapidly flicking across the canvas. And the movement upgrades I saw all contribute to that sense of frenetic movement. Constance clearly has some metroidvania inspirations, with the upgrade I unlocked in the demo even coming from the outreached palm of a Chozo Statue-esque construct. This upgrade was geared toward both movement and combat, letting me get to a previously unreachable place and overcome what were once unstoppable threats. I hope most of Constance's upgrades are in the same boat.</p><p dir="ltr">Constance is also a really pretty game. The 2D hand-drawn artstyle paints the biomes in all assortments of colors, save--at least of what I saw--purple, which is reserved for the protagonist and makes it easy to spot her as she's backflipping and dashing across the screen. The various NPCs are cute (though I wish they had the expressive garbles of Hollow Knight's characters) and from what I've seen of the environments, each possesses a character all its own.</p><p dir="ltr">All in all, I'm excited for Constance. The story seems interesting and the way the game ties combat and movement mechanics to burnout and perseverance is an intriguing idea. And even if the game doesn't sound as cute as I would like it to, it certainly matches my expectations when it comes to visuals--and for a game about a painter, that's the more important benchmark to hit anyway!</p><p dir="ltr">Constance is scheduled to launch for PC in Q4 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/peter-molyneux-masters-of-albion-gamescom<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday, as part of Gamescom Opening Night Live, the nothingburger-est of Geoff Keighley’s annual trio of too-long trailer extravaganzas, the host <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9ij15VNKMQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trotted out Peter Molyneux</a>. If you’re over 35, you likely remember him as the big talker behind <em>Dungeon Keeper</em>, <em>Black &amp; White</em>, <em>Fable</em> and regrettably, other games after the 1990s and early 2000s. If you’re not, you probably saw him on stage today and asked “Who?” Which really gets to the heart of the matter: Molyneux hasn’t been relevant in years. Why does the industry keep facilitating his attempts at a redemption arc?</p><p>For the uninitiated, Molyneux fell off precipitously following his heyday, in which he helped pioneer the god game genre. For his influence on countless modern games, he deserves to be recognized better among younger people than he is now, but that's a failure of institutional memory rather than a testament to the broader arc of Molyneux's career. The <em>Fable </em>series – though enjoyable on its own merits – was the beginning of a slide, with Molyneux breathlessly hyping up living, breathing worlds that would explore life, the passage of time, and politics like nothing before, only to deliver serviable action RPGs that let you fart on people.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, the 2010s saw him take this tendency to farcical levels with his own independent studio, 22 Cans, which released a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/curiosity-winner-once-promised-a-life-changing-pri/1100-6425241/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“life-changing” social experiment</a> that ended up being nothing more than a big cube for people to tap on (and which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-god-who-peter-molyneux-forgot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ended up leaving its winner high and dry</a>), a crowdfunded mobile god game called <em>Godus </em>that failed to deliver on features outlined in its campaign, and a spinoff called <em>Godus Wars </em>that never left early access and was eventually removed from sale on Steam. Molyneux became so infamous for ambitious-yet-substanceless ideas that a parody Twitter account, <a href="https://x.com/petermolydeux?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peter Molydeux</a>, inspired <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/molyjam/3015-7743/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a series of annual game jams</a> around the world.</p><p>Amid all this, Molyneux made himself the subject of multiple press-centric <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180521130332/https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/interviews/peter-molyneux-talks-regrets-and-whats-next-w474369" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">apology tours</a>, during which he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/interview-peter-molyneux-on-curiositys-failings-godus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shed tears</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peter-molyneux-interview-godus-reputation-kickstarter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dodged accusations</a> that he had knowingly taken advantage of fans. Then he <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/peter-molyneux-is-ready-to-disappoint-us-again-with-his-latest-game-a-blockchain-based-business-sim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released a Web3 game</a>. Players reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/peter-molyneuxs-nft-game-legacy-has-already-made-usd50m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spent over $50 million</a> on “Land NFTs” two years before the game, <em>Legacy</em>, came out, only for the NFT bubble to burst before it launched in 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>All of which brings us to the present. At Gamescom, Molyneux stood on stage flanked by a reverent Geoff Keighley and gave the world a glimpse at yet another game that promises to cherry pick all the best elements from his glory days while also somehow Revolutionizing The Genre(s). <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3165650/Masters_of_Albion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Masters of Albion</em></a>, which apparently <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/peter-molyneux-insists-his-new-game-isnt-set-in-the-world-of-fable-despite-being-called-masters-of-albion-gamescom-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t set in the same world as the Microsoft-owned <em>Fable </em>series</a> despite sharing the same setting name, looks fine – like a low-rent mashup of <em>Black &amp; White</em>, <em>Fable</em>, and<em> Manor Lords</em>. It also shares some clear DNA with the aforementioned Web3 game, including a similar city-building interface and the ability to “design anything,” including weapons, food, and mashups of the two like a bread sword, which is at least kind of funny.&nbsp;</p><p>But here’s the thing: Out of curiosity and a sense of journalistic duty, the two things that will most assuredly lead me to an early grave, I tried <em>Legacy </em>today, and the ability to customize and sell my own burger monstrosity – no buns, three olives on a toothpick, pickles placed precariously atop it, and a slab of cheese for good measure – did not stop the game from being a glacially slow, soulless slog clearly designed to funnel me into a real-money-based ecosystem. The experience felt, in all ways that mattered, as barebones as my bunless burger. I cannot begrudge Molyneux and company for trying to iterate on their own ideas, but maybe pick a better starting point.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Despite all of this, the Molyneux media machine is once again in full swing. Around the same time Molyneux did the 1,000th iteration of the same old song and dance on stage, sites like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/peter-molyneux-a-fallen-god-of-game-design-seeking-one-final-chance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eurogamer</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/peter-molyneux-insists-his-new-game-isnt-set-in-the-world-of-fable-despite-being-called-masters-of-albion-gamescom-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN</a>, and <a href="http://gamesindustry.biz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesIndustry.biz</a> dropped interviews centered around how the now 65-year-old game designer is once again seeking redemption, perhaps for the final time. These pieces, though skeptical in places, largely give Molyneux ample space to wax philosophical, to spellbind with high-minded talk of legacy, what makes a truly great game, and “creating something which is not quite like anything else that has existed.”&nbsp;</p><p>This has always been Molyneux’s great trick: For however much his design skills have atrophied, he remains a captivating interview. He speaks softly, but with conviction. He knows how to sound reflective, like he’s really, truly got it all figured out this time. In service of that, he loves <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/strategy/masters-of-albion-peter-molyneux-game-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a good self-deprecating joke</a> about the last time he had it all figured out. And he knows just how to tug at heartstrings. "What happened in the press was, for me, terrible," he told GI.biz of the period after <em>Godus</em>’ launch a decade ago. "I developed a whole load of stress-related conditions that are forever life-changing. ... I’ll be in my late 60s when this game is finished, and if I start another one, I'll be in my mid-70s. My life expectancy is measured in days rather than years because of my lifestyle. I smoke and drink and don’t sleep enough."</p><p>These are compelling threads to tug at, and Molyneux has always been a master of dangling them such that journalists can’t help but be tantalized. But focusing on Molyneux’s own emotional and physical fragility elides a more salient point: He garnered negative press because of his own actions, and even after that, the same press repeatedly helped him rehabilitate his image. He’s gotten more chances than just about anybody in this industry, and he has yet to demonstrate that he deserved them.&nbsp;</p><p>Even this latest round of interviews is illustrative: Both Keighly and journalists have parroted the line that <em>Masters of Albion</em> is entirely “self-funded,” except that Molyneux has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/peter-molyneux-a-fallen-god-of-game-design-seeking-one-final-chance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted</a> that much of the money came from <em>Legacy</em>’s in-game land sales, something which sure gives <em>Legacy</em>, only just released in October of last year, the appearance of a cash grab. This from a man who has spent the past decade and change alienating fans by taking their money and then, at best, failing to accurately predict how it would be used. Perhaps accountability should be the central focus of these stories from major sites, rather than the more sympathetic angle of Molyneux’s millionth run at redemption.</p><p>There’s also an argument to be made that said pieces – and Molyneux’s Gamescom ONL appearance – need not exist at all. Molyneux is a product of a bygone era of gaming, and his story has already been told more times than anybody can count. Those telling it now, the Keighleys of the world, are only doing so because Molyneux was a main character back when they were on the come up. They still, to some extent, see the myth and the legend, rather than the man. But Molyneux was never larger than life – just a little bigger than an industry in its infancy – and these days, he is decidedly small: someone whose actions have repeatedly squandered goodwill and whose words have failed to win support from a new generation. The dwindling few who remember him as more are all that he has left.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-sales-data-july-circana<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sales analysis firm Circana has released its US gaming industry sales data for July, and it looks like EA was right to revive its college football franchise (no pun intended).</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1826246890876535220" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the ever-reliable Mat Piscatella on X (formerly Twitter)</a>,&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>was July's best-selling premium game across both PC and Xbox Series X|S. It's also technically grabbed the number two spot;&nbsp;<em>EA Sports MVP Bundle</em>, which is in second place, contains both that game and&nbsp;<em>Madden NFL 25</em>.</p>
<p>In third place, it's&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, no doubt still buoyed by the release of June's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales">really rather successful&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC</a>. Still, no matter how well that DLC sold, it couldn't stop&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>from claiming the win.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-us-sales-data-july-2024.jpg?itok=_j9mLlpw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-us-sales-data-july-2024.jpg?itok=N1bnSu6x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>couldn't quite pip&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>to the post for July.</figcaption></figure><p>In fact, Piscatella's thread notes that&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>has already topped the year-to-date best-seller list, dislodging&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>from the top spot. Not bad at all, considering Circana's data cuts off on August 3rd, meaning&nbsp;EA's game had only been out for around two weeks at that point.</p>
<p>Rounding out the top five are&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/minecraft"><em>Minecraft</em></a>, both of which are pretty reliable sellers across the board. No surprises there.</p>
<p>As you'd imagine,&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>also tops both the PlayStation and Xbox premium charts. The game isn't available on Switch, so the number one spot for Nintendo's console was claimed by&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition">Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</a>&nbsp;</em>instead.</p>
<p>In terms of player engagement (i.e. monthly active users),&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>topped the PlayStation chart, while&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>dominated Xbox and&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>reigned supreme on Steam.</p>

            <p>Our James recently stormed off to Cologne after having<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/space-marine-2s-co-op-suggests-it-is-in-fact-jetpacks-that-make-the-dream-work"> one too many kills stolen by Edwin</a> in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/space-marine-2-shows-off-10-minutes-of-stomping-chainswording-and-a-chaos-tease-for-the-warhammer-40k-sequel-in-extended-gameplay">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>. “I’m never even going to look at another videogame again!”, he declared. Unfortunately for James, he accidentally walked straight into Gamescom. “I’m starting to think that there are a lot of video games” he informed us yesterday. Horrifying if true. Still, it does sound like he’s managing to have some fun there, mainly by hitting up Saber Interactive COO and former id Software co-owner Tim Willits for some top tips on how to avenge Edwin’s thieving ways.</p>
<p>Tips about kill-stealing aside, James found time to ask Willits about Space Marine 2's microtransactions, and whether there was any nervousness returning to a cult hit series… especially one a lot of people had almost given up on ever seeing again. “Even the “push forward” combat of the original was part of [id’s] inspiration when we created <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-2016">Doom 2016</a>,” answered Willits. “So for me personally, it’s this huge circle. It’s always intimidating working on a franchise that people love.” But, with the right team, technology, and vision he says, “it just comes together.”</p>

<p>Back in April, Saber Interactive CEO Matthew Karch <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/70-titles-are-doomed-to-go-the-way-of-the-dodo-says-saber-interactive-ceo">said that he felt the $70 game</a> was “going to go the way of the dodo. I think the market is going to shift to development which is not necessarily lower quality, but there's going to be an emphasis on trying to find ways to reduce costs.” Whether this means we should expect a bigger focus on monetisation in Saber’s games in the future, Willits is adamant that Space Marine 2 won’t make you feel “like you're getting poked."</p>
<p>“There are shifts and trends in the industry,” he said when asked about the game’s approach to microtransactions. “People don’t want to be sold horse armour anymore. I can say that because I worked at Bethesda. Our fans never thought we ripped them off in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-war-z">World War Z</a>. Focus are great. They kind of let us do what we want.” Space Marine 2’s additional purchases and updates will follow a similar model to World War Z, he says. “You buy a weapon pack. You buy a character pack.”</p>
<p>The actual tangibles here are a little bit muddied at the moment by one of those spreadsheet-requiring slew of editions you all know and love. Ok, deep breath. Currently available on Steam are the following editions of Space Marine 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>A “standard edition” for £55/€60/$60 (with the ‘Macragge’s Chosen’ DLC if you preorder)</li>
<li>A “gold edition” for £80/€90/$90 (Maccy Cheese DLC, 4 day early unlock, season pass)</li>
<li>An “ultra edition for £90/€100/$100 (All that, plus the “Ultramarines Champions Pack”</li>
</ul>
<p>Another deep breath. The Maccy Cheese DLC is some cosmetics. The “Ultramarines Champions Pack” is some more cosmetics. The season pass is “receive armour, weapon and Champion cosmetics from your favourite Space Marine chapters through four phases”</p>
<p>Additionally, Focus brand manager Sylvain Le Roux <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2/no-microtransactions">recently told PCGamesN</a> that “everything you’ll get [in the passes] is purely cosmetic. All of the gameplay additions, whether it’s new missions or new enemies, all of that will come for free to all players.”</p>
<p>So, not too bad at all then. I mean, expensive, yes. And I won’t even start on the early unlock. But there’s no gameplay being held hostage - it’s just a case of letting players decide whether the extra cosmetics are worth the investment. I am sympathetic to the argument that cosmetics are “gameplay” in a sense, but this sits ok with me. Let me know if there’s something I’m missing here, though.</p>
<p>We’ll have more Gamescom goodness soon enough, providing James doesn’t pass out from dehydration before he returns. Apparently it’s impossible to find water that isn’t sparkling out there. I quite like sparkling water, but then again, I also quite liked <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crackdown-3">Crackdown 3</a>. Spice Maureen 2 is out September 9th, and it’s anyone’s guess who will emerge victorious when the inevitable <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-pvp-multiplayer-video-certainly-has-that-old-timey-gears-of-war-energy">PVP blood match</a> between James and Edwin commences.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/08/21/xbox-series-x-s-new-console-options-pre-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> today, Xbox announced three new Xbox Series X console options will launch on October 15, 2024, including a 2TB Galaxy Black special edition.</p>



<p>The other two Xbox console additions include an all-digital Xbox Series X in “Robot White” with 1TB SSD, and a corresponding digital 1TB Xbox Series S in Robot White.</p>



<p>Today’s blog says that these options will also launch on October 29 in select countries after its initial release. It adds that fans can already pre-order the new console options today, though pre-orders in Mexico are “coming soon.”</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Beginning later today, players will be able to pre-order the Xbox Series S – 1TB in Robot White, Xbox Series X – 1TB Digital Edition in Robot White, and Xbox Series X – 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition: <a href="https://t.co/n23huaNBud">https://t.co/n23huaNBud</a></p>— Xbox Wire (@XboxWire) <a href="https://twitter.com/XboxWire/status/1826242853523128386?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Fans also have a look at pricing for the new Xbox Series X|S consoles coming in October. </p>



<p>According to the new product page for the Galaxy Black Special Edition, it will come with a $599.99 price tag. The all-digital Xbox Series X in Robot White will cost $449.99, while the new Series S in Robot White is going for $349.99.</p>



<p>Today’s announcement coincided with Xbox’s new Gamescom 2024 livestream, where Xbox is also showcasing a variety of upcoming titles.</p>



<p>In February 2024, Microsoft also teased a “unique” and powerful <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-next-gen-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next-gen Xbox console</a> is in the works. </p>



<p>Last May, a new claim surfaced suggesting that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-claim-suggests-next-xbox-console-will-launch-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next major Xbox console</a> will launch in late 2026.

<p>EA Sports College Football 25 was the best-selling game for July 2024, according to the the latest data <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1826246890876535220" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from Circana</a>. </p>



<p>The first college football game in 11 years was met with fanfare when it released for Deluxe Edition owners on July 15. In it’s first week alone, the game had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/college-football-25-had-over-5-million-players-in-its-first-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 5 million players</a>.  </p>



<p>“There was a feeling that we had something special based on the trailer views and interactions online, but the way it’s transitioned to actual sales and players has me lost for words,” Insider Gaming was told by a source <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inside-the-response-to-college-football-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">around the game’s launch</a>.</p>



<p>It gets better for EA Sports and College Football 25, though. The MVP Bundle that included both College Football 25 and Madden 25 was the second-best-selling title for July, meaning College Football held the top two spots for the month. </p>



<p>As far as the year goes, College Football 25 is also the top-selling game for 2024 as a whole. Up until now, Helldivers 2 had held that spot. The MVP Bundle also is a top seller for the year, coming in at number  5.</p>

                <p>One of the more interesting reveals from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamescom-opening-night-live-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5715/" data-ref-id="2900-5715">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a> this week was a trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deadpool-director-making-a-video-game-tv-series-and-its-not-what-you-think/1100-6525800/">Secret Level</a>, an upcoming anthology series built around several famous video games. Armored Core will be one of the games in the spotlight, and for a brief moment in the reveal trailer, it looks like that episode might star everyone's favorite assassin and motorcycle enthusiast, Keanu Reeves. In a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment, you can spot a CG version of someone who looks <em>a lot </em>like Reeves in the trailer, something that the official Armored Core X/Twitter account highlighted.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/armoredcore/status/1825978617781723177" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">A new ARMORED CORE saga awaits. Just one of fifteen epic stories from Secret Level, the new revolutionary gaming anthology series coming December 10 on Prime Video. <a href="https://t.co/SHm80ZWqwC" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/SHm80ZWqwC</a></p>  — ARMORED CORE (@armoredcore) <a href="https://twitter.com/armoredcore/status/1825978617781723177?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>We're not certain if he's back--in another video game-related project--as Reeves hasn't officially confirmed if he's involved with Secret Level, and the character in the trailer could be someone else who happens to have a passing resemblance to the actor. You'd also imagine that there'd be a bit more noise being made over landing The Matrix and John Wick star to appear in one of Secret Level's episodes, but for now, details on the series are locked up tighter than a pencil supply store when John Wick's in town.</p><p>Reeves has been fairly busy over the last couple of years, as between his feature film roles and cameos in SpongeBob Squarepants movies, he also provided the voice and likeness for Johnny Silverhand in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/" data-ref-id="5000-143160">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and its expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-review-the-songbird-sings/1900-6418116/" data-ref-id="1900-6418116">Phantom Liberty</a>. You'll hear him again in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-adds-keanu-reeves-as-voice-of-shadow/1100-6522667/" data-ref-id="1100-6522667">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> as he's voicing the ultimate lifeform in that movie, Shadow the Hedgehog. Meanwhile, you won't have too long to wait for Secret Level, as the series will land on Prime Video on December 10.</p><p>Developed by Deadpool director Tim Miller and his Blur studio, the show will feature a number of major game franchises like Mega Man, Sifu, and Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</p>

<p>"We run a business. It's definitely true inside of Microsoft that the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company. We get a level of support [from Microsoft] that is just amazing in what we're able to go do," Spencer said.</p><p>In terms of that support, Microsoft bankrolled the $75.4 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard--this was Microsoft's largest acquisition by purchase price--by far--in the company's history. </p><p>With that thinking in mind, Spencer said bringing Xbox games to competing platforms is "going to be a strategy that works for us" to achieve that. Spencer also said Xbox games coming to competing systems like PlayStation and Switch is an extension of the changing video game business landscape.</p><p>"As an industry right now, there is a lot of pressure on the industry. It's been growing for a long time, and now people are looking for ways to grow [more]... and for us, as fans and players of games, we just have to anticipate that there is going to be more change in how some of the traditional way that games were are built and distributed," the executive said. "That's going to change. That's going to change for all of us. But the end result has to be better games that more people can play. If we're not focused on that, I think we're focused on the wrong things."</p><p>Microsoft has so far released a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-plans-to-launch-these-four-games-on-rival-platforms/1100-6521266/" data-ref-id="1100-6521266">handful of its Xbox games on rival platforms</a>, including Sea of Thieves, Hi-Fi Rush, Pentiment, and Grounded. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will come next in 2025.</p>
