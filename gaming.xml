			<p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer mentioned Rare's Everwild game in an appearance <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q20AFtPXKSQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the 250th episode of the Xbox Era podcast</a>. During the 36-minute-long conversation, the executive named it among his most anticipated games (among those that have been announced) alongside State of Decay 3 and the next project from Double Fine.</p>
<p><em>I'll go back to what I said earlier. State of Decay is just one of the franchises I love, back from the original one, so that one stays on the board. I do think the work that Double Fine is doing and how Tim (Schafer) kind of solicits feedback from the team [is great]. And the other one I'll say, because I was recently out at Rare, it's nice to see the team with Everwild and the progress that they're making.</em></p>
<p><em>It has been a while. We've been able to give those teams time in what they're doing, which is good, and still have a portfolio like we have, which is a dream that Matt [Booty] and I have had for a long time, so it's finally good to be there. We can give those teams time. Next week, I'm gonna be up in Vancouver with The Coalition.</em></p>
<p>Everwild was <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-rare-new-ip-x019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> over five years ago, before COVID-19, during the X019 event. Over the years, though, it became clear that Rare didn't really have a clear picture of what they were doing yet. Development was <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-rebooted-from-scratch-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reportedly rebooted</a> in 2021 due to the game being <a href="https://wccftech.com/disco-elysium-obsidian-rpg-project-missouri-20220-everwild-real-mess/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">'a real mess'</a>.</p>
<p>A few months ago, Windows Central's Jez Corden - who's always well-informed on what's going internally at Xbox Game Studios - <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-is-reportedly-progressing-well-at-long-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the game had finally nailed the gameplay loop. The new statement from Spencer confirms this is true, so people can start looking forward to a reveal in the foreseeable future. Indeed, the British studio had already kind of <a href="https://wccftech.com/everwild-christmas-card-has-rare-fans-hyped-about-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> its fans with a nice Everwild themed Christmas card.</p>
<p>At any rate, the game may be shown again during the upcoming June Showcase, but don't expect it to launch this year. Microsoft already has a big lineup for 2025: following <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avowed</a> (out tomorrow, although Premium Edition owners can already play it), Compulsion Games is set to release <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-hands-on-preview-bottling-up-the-trauma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South of Midnight</a> next month, then id Software will follow with <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-is-the-biggest-and-best-game-weve-ever-made-says-id-story-is-out-of-the-codex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a> in May, and Fable <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-q4-2025-gears-of-war-e-day-before-that-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supposedly in the final quarter of the year</a>. That's not even counting Ninja Gaiden 4 (which is being published by Xbox Game Studios), the rumored launch of Gears of War: E-Day, and new stuff from Activision Blizzard, like the upcoming Call of Duty.</p>
<p>Everwild may instead be part of the 2026 lineup alongside Clockwork Revolution, Perfect Dark, and the next game from Double Fine, ensuring yet another potentially great year for Microsoft as a publisher. Indeed, it seems like all the money spent on acquisitions is finally paying off now that the developers have hit their stride as part of the Xbox family.</p>

            <p>One of video gaming's great urban fabulists, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> art director and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> visual designer Viktor Antonov, has died at the young age of 52. </p><!--more-->
<p>While there has yet to be a formal announcement from Antonov's family, several of his old colleagues have posted goodbye messages on social media. "I didn't want to say much till I felt it was confirmed, but I learned today that Viktor Antonov, our visionary art lead on HL2, has died," <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a> writer Marc Laidlaw wrote in an Instagram post passed on by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-2-and-dishonored-art-lead-viktor-antonov-dies-aged-just-52">Eurogamer</a>. "I don't have details. Just sadness. Brilliant and original. Made everything better."</p>
<p>"RIP Viktor Antonov," <a href="https://x.com/rafcolantonio/status/1891089643929542914">added</a> WolfEye Studios creative director and Arkane founder Raphael Colantonio on Twitter. "I wish I told you how much admiration I had for you but we get caught in our lives until a surprise lime this hits us. You were instrumental to the success of Arkane Studios and an inspiration to many of us, also a friend with whom I have many fond memories."</p>
<p>Born in Sofia, Bulgaria, Antonov started out in gaming as a map painter for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/redneck-rampage">Redneck Rampage</a> in 1997. He subsequently worked on art deco-inspired shooter Kingpin: Life Of Crime, before landing a reputation-making job at Valve in 2004. He was the principle mind behind Half-Life 2's City 17, a wintry expanse of Brutalist concrete and Combine panopticons, which continues to influence more pessimistic sci-fi game developers today. I'm confess, I'm more fond of his achievements as visual designer for Dishonored's oily brickwork labyrinth Dunwall.</p>
<p>Following the release of Dishonored, Antonov worked in more of a supporting role on several ZeniMax Media projects. He consulted on development of 2016's Doom reboot and 2017's Prey. He also worked on a number of cancelled games, including Arkane's hybrid FPS <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crossing">The Crossing</a> and Bethesda Game Studios Austin's multiplayer offering Battlecry. In 2022, Antonov co-founded Eschatology Entertainment to work on the mysterious Project DG, a game about a gunslinger exploring a world "on the verge of destruction".</p>
<p>Rest in peace.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>'s next "major patch" is here, introducing "1700 improvements and fixes to all aspects of the game: balance, locations, quests, blockers, crashes, performance, more A-Life 2.0 fixes, you name it".</p>
<p>The team thanked players for reporting their issues - "this work wouldn't have been possible without your feedback and comments on your personal experience with the Zone" - before detailing the fixes on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/579378232238800945">Steam</a>.</p>

<p>It follows a previous major patch from developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-receives-first-major-patch-including-a-life-fixes">which addressed over 1800 issues back in December</a>.</p>
<p>Audio, cutscenes and VO have been improved with almost 100 fixes, "each aimed to enhance your game experience". There have also been over 450+ improvements made to Stalker 2's regions and locations, 120+ to player guidance and settings, 30+ to interactable objects and zone experience, and 130 buffs to side missions and encounters. </p>
<p>A whopping 300 adjustments have been made to main story quests, too, including issues with a boss fight and disappearing NPCs.</p>
<p>50+ bugs have been squished in your player gear and state, and over 100 when it comes to optimisation and crashing.</p>
<p>You can also expect to see improved AI, better NPC shooting accuracy, boosted stealth, and improved mutant behaviour in combat.</p>
<p>"Thanks for staying with the Zone! As always, we will continue to listen to your feedback and comments, and share game updates as soon as possible," the team concluded. "If you spot an 'anomaly' that is not supposed to be in the game, please report it to our colleagues in Tech Support Hub. That will help us investigate potential issues faster."</p>
<p>At its launch in November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">Stalker 2</a> was criticised for its performance issues. However, in an interview with Eurogamer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/delaying-stalker-2-again-not-an-option-studio-says-team-worked-until-it-was-broken-by-marathon-development">GSC Game World's CEO Ievgen Grygorovych said delaying the game was not an option</a>.</p>
<p>"You're so tired that you would just die if you say let's run an additional marathon," Grygorovych said at the time. "We didn't have a chance to say let's do it more. We just had a chance of 'let's do until this moment - the release date - as much as we can'."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A team of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo">Diablo</a> speedrunners spent months searching the 1996 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s 2.2 billion valid randomly generated dungeon seeds to find the layout used in a stupidly lucky speedrun they suspected to be illegitimate, says a new report from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/the-diablo-hackers-that-debunked-a-record-speedrun/">Ars Technica's Kyle Orland</a>.</p>
<p>The three minute, 12 second sorcerer run by Maciej "Groobo" Maselewski was first uploaded to Speed Demos Archive in 2009. Watching it "feels like watching someone win the lottery," writes Orland, thanks to a seemingly random streak of entrance and exit stairways right next to each other, allowing for a rapid, safe descent through the dungeon. Groobo lucked out again on the ninth floor, nabbing the <a href="https://diablo.fandom.com/wiki/Naj%27s_Puzzler_(Diablo_I)">Naj's Puzzler</a> item needed for later teleporting exploits.</p>

<p>Beginning "in earnest last February", a team of tool assisted Diablo speedrunners started trying to recreate the run, using their own custom map generation tool built by "reverse-engineering a disassembled Diablo executable". From Ars:</p>
<blockquote><p>That tool can take any of the game's billions of possible random seeds and quickly determine the map layout, item distribution, and quest placement available in the generated save file. A scanner built on top of that tool can then quickly look through those generated dungeons for ones that might be optimal for speedrunning.</p></blockquote>
<p>The team's initial goal here was just to learn from Groobo's run, both for their own speedrunning and as a test case to make sure the scanner worked. The problem? The seed they were looking for didn't actually exist. Groobo had, in other words, made up the whole thing. "We just had a lot of curiosity and resentment that drove us to dig even deeper," a runner named Staphen told Ars. "Betrayal might be another way to describe it," added team member AJenbo. "To find out that this had been done illegitimately... and the person had both gotten and taken a lot of praise for their achievement."</p>
<p>From Ars:</p>
<blockquote><p>In their effort to find Groobo's storied run (or at least one that resembled it), the TAS team conducted a distributed search across the game's roughly 2.2 billion valid RNG seeds. Each of these seeds represents a different specific second on the system clock when a Diablo save file is created, ranging from between January 1, 1970, and December 31, 2038 (the only valid dates accepted by the game).</p></blockquote>
<p>After comparisons failed to turn up a re-creation of Groobo's dungeon containing the level 9 Naj's Puzzler drop, they began to search "impossible seeds" - "which could only be created by using save modification tools to force a creation date after the year 2038". They eventually found dungeons with the drop in the right place, using seeds for the years 2056 and 2074.</p>
<p>They also discovered that the original speedrun video had been spliced together from multiple different runs. "In the end we only found two levels that had come from the same run so at least 13 (probably 15) runs were spliced into one video, which is a lot for a game with just 16 levels,"  AJenbo told Ars.</p>
<p>Other evidence (some of it quite glaring in hindsight) began to pile up afterwards, but do read Ars Technica's full piece for that. Why go to all this trouble for a 27 year old speedrun? "It did harm," speedrunner Cecil told Ars. "Groobo's alleged cheating in 2009 completely stopped interest in speedrunning this category [of Diablo]. No one tried, no one could."</p>
<p>If that's all left you feeling exhausted at the lurking deception inherent in men's souls, Here's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stay-awhile-and-play-this-free-diablo-inspired-indie-as-the-mayor-of-tristram">free Diablo-inspired indie</a> where you play as the mayor of Tristam - an upstanding chap by all counts.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Mass Effect 2 in particular is often cited as one of the greatest action role-playing games ever made, and Wall’s soundtrack, which includes the rousing ‘Suicide Mission,’ is considered a series high-point by fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Wall failed to return for 2012’s Mass Effect 3, which came as a shock to fans. Now, in a new interview with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/feb/14/the-making-of-mass-effect-2-music-soundtrack" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a>, Wall discussed why, pointing to a falling out with then Mass Effect development chief Casey Hudson.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Casey was not particularly happy with me at the end,” Wall said. “But I’m so proud of that score. It got nominated for a Bafta, and it did really well … [even if] it didn’t go as well as Casey wanted.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Guardian suggested a “creative tension” between Wall and Hudson, but Wall remained vague. “Fallouts like that happen, it’s just part of the deal,” he added. “It’s one of the few times in my career that’s happened, and it was a tough time, but it is what it is.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wall did, however, go into a bit more detail on the challenges he and BioWare faced getting Mass Effect 2 out the door and Suicide Mission into the finished product, which may provide some insight into Wall and Hudson’s relationship at the end of the project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was the biggest mind-f***ing thing I’ve ever done in my entire life,” Wall said. “And there was no one available to walk me through it, because they were all freaking out trying to finish the game. I handed it in, and they had to do a lot of massaging on their end in order to get it to work, but they did it... and the result is still one of the best ending sequences to a game that I’ve ever played. It was worth all that effort.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After Mass Effect 2, Wall went on to make music for Call of Duty games, most recently composing the soundtrack for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a>. BioWare, meanwhile, is currently working on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mass-effect-next-chapter">next Mass Effect game</a> following the release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>.

		<p>Ubisoft has announced Rainbow Six Siege X, a big overhaul for the long-running online tactical shooter, which will be revealed in full at the Rainbow Six Siege X Showcase on 13th March&nbsp;at 5pm GMT.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rainbow Six Siege X Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X4vvBU-1CCY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“A new era is on the horizon for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a> – one that sets the stage for the years to come of tactical and unique gameplay,” the team writes in the announcement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The R6 team has been working tirelessly to bring to life the biggest transformation in the game’s history and its purpose is to reinforce Rainbow Six Siege’s position at the top of tactical first-person shooters by introducing new ways to play, deepened tactical gameplay, refined game feel and major upgrades all around.”</p>
<p>The teaser trailer could be seen to hint at a back to basics review of the game, focusing on the little scouting drone and explosive charges, but also giving little hints at new or improved gameplay. In particular, the helicopter hovering over a building implies a helicopter spawn and rappel, and of the special forces teams running along walls that they are tethered to – from my memory, this would be a quite significant speed up of the grappled movement. The chained explosions also suggest more interactivity through the environment.</p>

<p>And I say “from my memory” because it’s coming up on the 10 year anniversary of Rainbow Six Siege. The game launched in December 2015, reshaping the series from its roots as a single player or PvE co-op shooter first, to being multiplayer first. It featured destructible environments at its core, enabling players to reshape the levels, open up new firing angles and defensive or attacking positions.</p>
<p>While many still hanker for the a single player mode in the vein of R6 Vegas, R6 Siege proved to be a massive success for Ubisoft, gathering over 70 million players through its first five years, and becoming a staple of the genre thanks to the ‘games as a service’ approach of having regular seasonal updates that added new characters and maps to play. While remaining popular, the game has come in for criticism at times for how outlandish some of the new agents have become, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/28/rainbow-six-extraction-review-ps5-xbox-pc/">a zombie-ish spin-off proved to be…. less successful</a>.</p>
<p>10 years is a long, long time in video games, and keeping players engaged and active is no small feat. We look forward to seeing what Rainbow Six Siege X brings when it is revealed next month.</p>

            <p>
Rainbow Six Siege is getting its biggest overhaul ever, Ubisoft has announced, and looks set to be retitled as Rainbow Six Siege X.
</p>
<p>
This year marks the 10th anniversary of Ubisoft's ever-popular tactical shooter - the company's biggest and longest-running success of the last decade outside of Assassin's Creed. 
</p>
<p>
This weekend, Ubisoft revealed a teaser video for Rainbow Six Siege X, and described it as "the biggest transformation in the game's history" that was set to introduce "new ways to play, deepened tactical gameplay, and major upgrades all around!"

<p>
A full reveal will follow in March, on Thursday 13th at 5pm UK time, but there's a few things we can discern today. 
</p>
<p>
In a blog post, Ubisoft describes Rainbow Six Siege X as "a new era" for its game, "one that sets the stage for the years to come" that's designed to "reinforce Rainbow Six Siege's position at the top of tactical first-person shooters". 
</p>
<p>
So - a sequel, this is not.
</p>
<p>
Footage teasing next month's showcase simply features shots from the current Rainbow Six Siege, meanwhile. How different will the Rainbow Six Siege X actually look?
</p>
<p>
Fan feedback to the teaser has been positive, with many hoping that Ubisoft uses this update as an opportunity to strip back some of the many additions that have been added to Siege over the past 10 years - at least as an option, to allow fresh fans an easier route into the game.
</p>
<p>The announcement comes as Ubisoft seeks to double down on its strengths - including lots of Assassin's Creed - while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-pre-orders-solid-in-line-with-series-second-biggest-launch">the company continues to cut costs</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-new-venture-with-ubisoft-assets-report">court a potential sale</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> producer Ryozo Tsujimoto has acknowledged the importance of the PC platform, and why crossplay will be included in the game.</p>
<p>"Yeah, there are more players than ever playing on PC, including in Japan," Tsujimoto told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/monster-hunter-lead-producer-agrees-pc-gaming-is-key-for-japanese-games-there-are-more-players-than-ever-playing-on-pc-including-in-japan/">GamesRadar</a>, "so we definitely see room for the series to capture new players who haven't tried it before if that's their chosen platform."</p>
<p>Crossplay between PC and console players has been included in Monster Hunter Wilds so that "the choice is yours on which platform you want to play with, and then [you can just] go online and hunt with your friends".</p>

<p>This is also likely a reason Capcom released the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-players-can-test-their-machines-ahead-of-release-with-pc-benchmarking-tool">Monster Hunter Wilds PC benchmark tool</a>, so players can test their system ahead of release.</p>
<p>The huge audience for the game is apparent when looking at SteamDB. The beta for Monster Hunter Wilds reached a concurrent player peak of 463,798, while Monster Hunter World reached 334,684, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> reached 231,360.</p>
<p>For comparison, the beta test's peak is higher than the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/among-us">Among Us</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of GTA, Take-Two CEO boss Strauss Zelnick recently discussed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-pc-version-teased-by-take-two-boss-acknowledges-platforms-growing-importance">presumed PC release of GTA 6</a>, noting that historically "Rockstar has started with some platforms and then historically moved to other platforms".</p>
<p>"We have seen PC become a much more important part of what used to be a console business, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that trend continue," he added.</p>
<p>Square Enix is also working on an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">"aggressive" multiplatform strategy</a>, releasing its biggest games on PC following PS5 exclusivity, further highlighting the importance of PC for Japanese companies. Both Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth and Final Fantasy 16 are now available on PC.</p>
<p>In another interview, with <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/monster-hunter-wilds/new-weapon-type">PCGamesN</a>, Monster Hunter Wilds director Yuya Tokuda discussed the possibility of adding a fifteenth weapon type to the game.</p>
<p>"When we start development of games such as World and, recently, Wilds, we always consider whether or not this is the time to add another weapon type,” Tokuda said. "It's not off the table for any particular reason, it’s just that we never really decided that we wanted to for the recent titles."</p>
<p>After all the tweaks and changes made to the existing 14 weapons in Wilds, it's tough to find "a 15th weapon that would actually have a place in that lineup and feel equally as valid as the other weapon types while also not overlapping with them too much".</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is set for release on 28th February across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>
<p>Eurogamer's Jim Trinca went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-preview">hands-on with Monster Hunter Wilds</a> recently and while this series entry is more approachable, it still has its quirks.</p>
<p>"For the MonHun-curious consumer, I recommend caution," he wrote. "The FOMO is real here: Monster Hunter is just one of those things that inspires fandom envy. The people who love it do so vocally and passionately and with an infectious enthusiasm rarely seen elsewhere. But as much as Wilds is eager to roll over and present its tummy to you, it is still a Monster Hunter game, and therefore as marmitey as marmite games come."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We still don't have a firm console release date for Grand Theft Auto 6, but a game peripheral company has now stated it will make its later PC debut in early 2026.</p>
<p>The next entry in Rockstar's series is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-still-coming-this-autumn-confirms-take-two-despite-ongoing-delay-rumours">scheduled for consoles this autumn</a>. However, the developer along with publisher Take-Two are keeping things close to their chest when it comes to firm details, particularly on the PC front. Back in May, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-publisher-addresses-lack-of-pc-news-stating-rockstar-will-make-more-announcements-in-due-time">Take-Two said Rockstar would "make more announcements in due time"</a>, and then earlier this month it teased a GTA 6 PC release is on the cards but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-pc-version-teased-by-take-two-boss-acknowledges-platforms-growing-importance">the company tends not to "go across all platforms simultaneously"</a>.</p>
<p>Now, however, PC accessories company Corsair Gaming has suggested we could be seeing GTA 6 arriving on PC as soon as early next year.</p>

<p>Speaking during its latest financial results, Corsair Gaming's financial VP Ronald van Veen said:</p>
<p>"GTA 6 is probably the one everyone is talking about. And we'll get a glimpse of that, I think, later on in the year for console. My understanding now, it's going to come out in the fall [autumn] for console, and then early 2026 for PC" (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/gta6s-pc-release-date-is-early-2026-corsair-gaming-believes/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p>Should this prove true, this is a pretty speedy move to PC when you consider other Rockstar releases. Red Dead Redemption, for example, first launched all the way back in 2010 across PS3 and Xbox 360. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-red-dead-redemption-pc-tech-review">then arrived on PC last year</a>.</p>

<p>As for its console debut, Take-Two head Strauss Zelnick previously said he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-publisher-not-really-worried-about-xbox-series-s-performance">isn't worried about getting GTA 6 to work on Microsoft's lesser powered Xbox Series S console</a>.</p>
<p>Zelnick simply said the team would always "find a way to support platforms despite different levels of tech", in a bid to alleviate any concerns. "Our labels are really good at that," he said in November. "I'm not really worried."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-announced-with-graphical-audio-and-gameplay-improvements-showcase-set-for-march-13/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-rumored-to-be-announced-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared earlier this month</a>, Ubisoft confirmed during the Six Invitational eSports tournament that Rainbow Six Siege X is real. A full-fledged showcase will take place on March 13 at 10 AM PT / 7 PM CET via the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rainbow6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rainbow Six Siege Twitch channel</a>, though folks will also be able to attend this event in person in Atlanta, Georgia. For now, the developers said Rainbow Six Siege X will include graphics and sound upgrades, deeper tactical gameplay, and new ways to play the game. You can check out a brief video teaser below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rainbow Six Siege X Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X4vvBU-1CCY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, the live service of the regular Rainbow Six Siege goes on in the meantime. Year 10 kicks off shortly with the first season, called Operation Prep Phase. Again, just like in the leak, the season will introduce a new Operator called Rauora. Hailing from New Zealand, she joins the Attackers team and will be available at the start of the season with the new Battle Pass; two weeks later, she'll become unlockable with Renown or R6 Credits.</p>
<p>Rauora brings with her a powerful pair of primary weapons: the 417 designated sniper rifle or the M249 light machine gun. Her secondary weapon options include the GSH-18 9mm pistol or the new Reaper MK2 submachine gun. The Reaper is equipped with a red dot sight and an extended magazine, making Rauora very dangerous in close combat. Smoke grenades or breach charges round out her kit.</p>
<p>Arguably, what distinguishes her the most is the gadget called Deployable Omnilink Mesh (D.O.M.) Launcher. This is a bulletproof smart cover system that only works in doorways. When Rauora aims at a doorway, an on-screen icon indicates when she has a valid target and can fire the gadget. Once the projectile reaches the door, it attaches and deploys a bulletproof panel that extends all the way to the floor. This is unusual for Rainbow Six Siege, as there is usually room for drones to pass under barricades, but the smart cover panel can sense when a drone is nearby; it will then lift the panel slightly, allowing the drone to pass through before fully closing again.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rainbow Six Siege: Operation Prep Phase Operator Gameplay Gadget &amp; Starter Tips" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vea1SlpEvkc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With her bulletproof barriers, Rauora is able to block enemies' lines of sight and impede their movement, and she can use them relatively safely from a distance. But what if she and her allies want to get through? There's a rectangular trigger at the top of the panel that appears on either side of the door. The trigger will remain locked unless an Operator approaches, at which point it will unlock and open. If someone shoots the trigger, the panel door will open. If the door is open and you pull the trigger, it will close.</p>
<p>Both Attackers and Defenders can interact with the panel to open or close the barrier, but the attacking team has a few advantages. Firstly, when the panel is first deployed or has just closed, the trigger will lock out the defenders for a short time; their presence will not open it, only the Attackers' will. Second, the door moves much faster when triggered by an Attacker. These two tactical timing advantages give attackers the power to dictate the pace around the panels, hopefully catching their opponents off guard.</p>
<p>Whether you're walling off doors for cover as your team enters the building, closing off flanking routes as you advance in the field, or fortifying your defenses after the plant, Rauora's ability to act as a one-woman renovation team can have a profound effect on the flow of battle. Team her up with Ying or Fuze, and their plates can help you pack a real punch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rainbow Six Siege: Year 10 Cinematic Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mj99yIzCQpc?start=4&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>However, Ubisoft warned that the plates are bulletproof but not blastproof. Or Oryx-proof. They won't knock over a Castle barricade, and they won't work properly under the influence of Tubarão's Zoto Canister. Even Jäger's ADS can stop them before they get started, so be smart about how and when you use them.</p>
<p>Operation Prep Phase will be available to try next week ahead of the full launch scheduled for next month. As for Rainbow Six Siege X, there's no date yet, but the aforementioned leak said it would be released alongside the second season of Year 10.</p>

<p>The all-Brazilian FaZe Clan roster has stepped up in the grand final of the Six Invitational in Boston to hand Team BDS a decisive loss. With a 3 – 1 scoreline, the curtain came down over the $3 million tournament and FaZe Clan took centre stage to lift the iconic hammer. Team BDS had a solid run to reach the final, but ultimately failed to overcome FaZe Clan’s staying power.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-another-year-done">Another Year Done</h2>



<p>The Six Invitational was a monumental event, which is fast becoming the par for the course with this tournament. As one of the single-biggest esports events in the world, the Six Invitational awards a whopping $1 million to the victor, and nobody goes home empty-handed.</p>



<p>In Boston, in front of a sold-out crowd, FaZe Clan stormed to the top spot and secured that hefty cash prize.</p>



<p>FaZe Clan has competed at every Six Invitational since 2018, but this is the organisation’s first win. It follows a close second-place finish in 2024 when the team lost against w7m Esports in front of a packed crowd in Sao Paolo.</p>



<p>It was a dramatic couple of weeks in the run-up to the grand final. In the qualifying stages, emotions were running high, and M80 faced a fine and a two-year staff suspension when the team’s coach, Budega, exploded against DarkZero. Those scenes came shortly after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/m80-gunnar-team-liquid-six-invitational/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">M80’s Gunnar went on a rant</a> against all comers – then dropped out of the tournament a day later.</p>



<p>FaZe Clan’s finish against Team BDS came after a defiant run through the elimination bracket. It was an epic thing, with FaZe Clan being knocked into the lower bracket by Spacestation at the earliest opportunity.</p>



<p>From there, the team knuckled down and pushed forward, eliminating Team Liquid, Virtus, Falcons, <strong>Spacestation</strong>, Unwanted, and finally FURIA, which also hails from Brazil. It was one of the most incredible lower-bracket runs in esports history, and it ended with FaZe Clan securing the ultimate win over Team BDS and securing the $1 million prize.</p>



<p>That’s not bad at all.</p>



<p>Just before the grand final took place, Ubisoft jumped on stage to reveal Siege X – <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-siege-x-update-showcase/">find out more here</a>.</p>

<p>The CDL Major II qualifiers are in full flow after the competitive season resumed this past weekend, but it hasn’t been fun and games for all involved. In a twist of fate, OpTic Texas – last year’s Call of Duty Championship winner – failed to secure a single map against both Atlanta FaZe and Minnesota Rokkr just days after Pred returned to the starting lineup.</p>



<p>Pred temporarily departed the team late last year to deal with personal issues, and Huke stepped up to fill in for him. Following Huke’s dismissal from the roster, some fans are up in arms, as the change seems to have done more harm than good.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-the-result-you-wanted">Not The Result You Wanted</h2>



<p>To put it in a word, OpTic Texas was <strong>decimated </strong>this weekend by Atlanta FaZe and Minnesota Rokkr.</p>



<p>Atlanta FaZe is coming into the qualifiers hot off a win at Major I <strong>and </strong>the first CDL Minor, while OpTic Texas was nursing a sore spot after dropping out of the running at the recent Madrid Major. FaZe now has a relatively ridiculous record over OpTic Texas in the CDL era.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Minnesota Rokkr currently occupies sixth place in the overall standings and hasn’t clashed with OpTic Texas since June 2024. Coincidentally, Rokkr was able to hand OpTic Texas a loss back then, too.</p>



<p>Between these two fixtures, OpTic Texas failed to secure <strong>a single map win</strong>. On social media, the team was quick to express concerns:</p>



<div><article><p><span>Actually unacceptable from me. 

Feel terrible to everyone who supports me, gotta just be better. Simple as that, sucks but I’ve been here before. GGs Faze and MN.</span></p></article></div>







<p>Following the loss against Atlanta FaZe, a clip was captured showing OpTic Texas’ Dashy trying to snap his webcam in half. It has been a tough couple of weeks for the OpTic side, and we’re already a long way from the COD Champs win.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the Call of Duty League this weekend, LAT continued to lay the smackdown against all comers, wiping the Royal Ravens with a 3 – 0 scoreline and laying waste to the Vegas Falcons. The Falcons are still to grab a single win this season.</p>



<p>LAG M8 lost again, this time against Boston Breach. It started as a close match, with the opening Hardpoint coming down to just a two-point difference, but things quickly fell apart for LAG M8. Presently, the team sits in 11th place in the CDL standings with just two matches won to <strong>eight </strong>lost. </p>



<p>The Call of Duty League Major II qualifiers will continue this coming weekend, with all eyes resting firmly on the Major II tournament in Texas. It’s set to run between March 20 – 23.</p>

<p>Counter-Strike 2 has reached a new milestone today, setting a new standard for total players while still chasing the the all-time record for the series. The latest iteration of the Counter-Strike franchise reached its highest player peak ever.</p>



<p>Is CS2 perfect? No, but it couldn’t be further from “dead.”</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cs2-strengthens-its-hold-as-the-most-popular-game-on-steam">CS2 Strengthens Its Hold As The Most Popular Game on Steam</h2>



<p>On February 16, 2025, Counter-Strike 2 reached a concurrent player peak of 1,744,015 players, according to the trusted <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/730/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SteamDB database</a>. This occurred around 13:50 UTC: mid-to-late afternoon in Europe, night-time around Asia, and morning for the Americas. This number represents the most amount of players playing CS2 at once <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/counter-strike-2-reaches-highest-player-peak-after-shanghai-major/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since just a couple months ago in December 2024</a>.</p>



<p>Since December, CS2 has averaged over 900,000 players, according to SteamDB. As impressive as the peaks and averages have been recently, they’re still just a bit short of the all-time records set by CS:GO. May 2023 saw the highest player peak ever in Counter-Strike history at 1,818,773 players, as well as the highest average ever at over 1.11 million players. Those historic numbers can be attributed to the announcement of the CS2 limited test and the start of the final CS:GO Major, BLAST Paris.</p>



<p>The slight dip in CS2 player peaks and averages in January 2025 could be attributed to the break in the professional circuit following the Perfect World Shanghai Major. As the schedule has resumes with events like BLAST and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/vitality-stuns-spirit-3-0-in-grand-finals-of-iem-katowice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IEM Katowice</a> at the start of February, the player count swells once again. CS2 effectively owns the top spot on Steam’s player charts, as it has only been surpassed in active players in exceptionally rare circumstances.</p>



<p>While the game’s popularity and player base show zero signs of trailing off, there are still concerns that players want addressed. These range from the still-rampant cheating issue to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-launch-options/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">problems with FPS performance</a> to a lack of content such as operations or new modes. Still, outside of maybe League of Legends, it remains the most popular PC game in the world.</p>



<p>Will CS2 eventually beat the CS:GO player peak? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

                <p>During the championship weekend of the Six Invitational, Ubisoft has announced that it will be revealing a new era of Rainbow Six Siege on March 13 at the Siege X Showcase in Atlanta, Georgia. A new attacker operator named Rauora, who hails from New Zealand, will also join Rainbow Six Siege.</p><p>The teaser for the big upcoming Siege update describes it as the game's "biggest transformation" yet. This will include both graphical and audio improvements, as well as "deepened tactical gameplay," although no specifics were shared. Additionally, Ubisoft said there will be "new ways to play," but again didn't say if that would come in the form of new game modes or something else.</p><p>Rauora will be available to play at the start of the upcoming Year 10 Season 1 as part of the Operation Prep Phase battle pass, and will be unlockable with Renown or R6 credits after two weeks.</p><p>Rauora is equipped with the 417 designed marksman rifle or the M249 light machine gun as her primary weapon, and the GSH-18 9mm pistol or the new Reaper MK2 machine pistol as her secondary. The latter has a red dot sight and an extended magazine. Her special gadget is the Deployable Omnilink Mesh Launcher, or DOM. It's a smart bulletproof barrier that can only be used in doorways and reaches all the way to the ground. As a smart cover, DOM can sense when ally drones are nearby and will let them through by lifting itself up.</p><p>DOM also has a trigger at the top that can be opened by any operator through shooting it. While both attackers and defenders can open and close the barrier, the attacking side has more benefits. Defenders will be locked out for a short time when the barrier is first deployed or has just closed, and only an attacker's presence will open it again. It also opens up much faster when an attacker triggers it.</p><p>While Rauora's barriers are bulletproof, they are still susceptible to explosions. They also cannot remove Castle's reinforced barricades if it's already out or used while Tubarão's Zoto Canister is in effect. Jäger's ADS gadget can also take out DOM before it gets a chance to even deploy.</p><p>Rainbow Six Siege was released in 2015 and has been one of Ubisoft's premiere live-service games since. It's gotten a ton of support of the years, most recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rainbow-six-siege-finally-getting-full-cross-play-many-years-later/1100-6527826/" data-ref-id="1100-6527826">full cross-play</a> as well as stricter anti-cheat measures, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rainbow-six-siege-cheaters-will-now-be-kicked-and-perma-banned-instantly/1100-6529011/" data-ref-id="1100-6529011">cheaters being instantly perma-banned</a>.</p><p>Despite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-2-reveal-si-2025-rumour/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">rumors of a sequel</a>, Rainbow Six creator director Alexander Karpazis claimed that its a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rainbow-six-siege-can-last-forever-according-to-creative-director/1100-6521397/" data-ref-id="1100-6521397">game that can "last forever,"</a> which is good news for the nearly decade-old game. Separately, Ubisoft's executives said that they are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-doubles-down-on-open-world-and-live-service-games/1100-6529497/" data-ref-id="1100-6529497">doubling down on open-world and live-service games</a> going forward.</p>

<p>In a recent interview on the XboxEra Podcast, Phil Spencer got talking about the future of Xbox showcases like the Developer Direct. In one segment, the conversation turned to Xbox using those stages to reveal multi-platform games, presenting both the Nintendo and PlayStation logos in trailers and title splashes.</p>



<p>It’s not the typical operating model, as most of these events are usually reserved for platform-specific trailers and promos. Recently, Xbox bucked that trend, showing off the PlayStation logo to let consumers know that whatever game is being showcased will be available on platforms <strong>other than </strong>Xbox.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-honest-and-transparent">‘Honest and Transparent’</h2>



<p>On the most recent episode of <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/02/15/xboxera-interviews-phil-spencer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the XboxEra Podcast</a>, Phil Spencer spoke about the recent inclusion of PlayStation iconography in Xbox-backed showcases. In his words, that’s the set standard going forward, and players should expect to see more multi-platform imagery in trailers and broadcasts:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think it’s just being honest and transparent about where the games are showing, and we actually even had this discussion last year for the June showcase, and by the time we kind of made our decision, we couldn’t get all of the assets done and it felt weird to have some of them in and some of them out.</p>



<p>But I just want to be transparent with people – for shipping on Nintendo Switch, we’re gonna put that. For shipping on PlayStation, on Steam… People should know the storefronts where they can get our games, but I want people to be able to experience our Xbox community in our games and everything we have to offer, on every screen we can.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s all about openness and transparency, according to Spencer.</p>



<p>Recently, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-playstation-5/">Forza Horizon 5</a> will be zooming onto PlayStation platforms later this year. That follows a few titles that were once exclusive to Xbox making their way onto the platform. There have also been rumours that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hellblade-2-and-gears-of-war-are-also-reportedly-coming-to-playstation-this-year/">Gears and Halo</a> might head over to  PlayStation and Nintendo Switch at some point.</p>



<p>Do you want to see a much more open and seamless gaming network filled with cross-platform titles? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>Almost six years on from its debut, Xbox CEO of Gaming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> has confirmed that Rare's mysterious fantasy deer adventure Everwild is still in development.</p>
<p>Despite being first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rare-announces-everwild-its-next-big-new-ip">revealed in late 2019</a> with a gorgeous teaser, and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-new-everwild-trailer">shown again in summer 2020</a> with a slightly-more revealing trailer, we've heard very little about the game.</p>

<p>Talking to the XboxEra podcast, however, Spencer had good news for those who feared the game may have been quietly cancelled, revealing the team was making "progress".</p>
<p>"I was recently out at Rare. It's nice to see the team with Everwild and the progress that they're making," Spencer said, when asked reflect on what first-party games still in development he was most looking forward to (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/phil-spencer-provides-rare-update-on-missing-in-action-xbox-exclusive-everwild/">VGC</a>).</p>
<p>"It has been [a while]. And we've been able to give those teams time in what they're doing which is good and still have a portfolio like we have.</p>
<p>"It's like a dream that Matt [Booty] and I have had for a long time, so it's finally good to be there. We can give those teams time."</p>
<p>Earlier today we reported that in the same podcast, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-says-hes-stopped-trying-to-move-all-players-over-to-xbox">Spencer said he's "not trying to move [PS5 and PC players] all over to Xbox anymore"</a>, acknowledging that players are "all so invested in where our games are", all he wants to do now is "allow more people to play" Xbox games on other systems.</p>
<p>Spencer acknowledged that whilst selling games on competitor devices means Xbox only recoups 70 percent of the sale, that 70 percent still helps Xbox "build great portfolios".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>10:10 Games has initiated redundancies following the "complete commercial and critical failure" of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/funko-fusion">Funko Fusion</a>.</p>
<p>According to a report by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/1010-games-employees-offered-no-severance-laid-off-while-on-holiday-and-more/">Insider Gaming</a>, where sources shared their experiences under the promise of anonymity, the lukewarm reception to Funko Fusion meant the UK studio struggled to secure funding for addition projects, and some colleagues were informed that there "isn’t enough work to give the whole team".</p>

<p>Sources intimate no meaningful severance support has been made available, with only "the bare minimum" entitlement offered, as well as payment of unused holiday. However, this, some speculate, is why colleagues were pressured into using up all their leave ahead of the announcement.</p>
<p>Because of this, some colleagues were notified that their jobs were at risk whilst on leave. In some instances, these staff felt obliged to attend meetings about their future at the studio whilst on holiday, even if they were away in different timezones.</p>
<p>"Management seemed very keen to wrap up the process quickly, and despite saying that they were fully open to suggestions and feedback, none of it has been taken on board," said one source.</p>
<p>Whilst unconfirmed, it's thought around 20 people have been impacted by the cuts, bringing the estimated<a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2025"> number of developers who have lost their jobs across the games industry</a> to around 900 in 2025 alone.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>After 12 official matches as a team and only three during VCT Americas, NRG has benched Andrew “Verno” Maust and VALORANT coach Malkolm “bonkar” Rench. Following a strong performance at offseason events that resulted in high expectations, NRG has already made significant changes.</p>

<p>Roster changes to the NRG VALORANT roster had been rumored since the conclusion of Kickoff, but were confirmed by the organization today. NRG’s Chief Gaming Officer Jaime Cohenca <a href="https://x.com/bikeage/status/1891179079015285152" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">says</a> the benching is a result of a lack of cohesion that has been brewing for months.</p>



<p>“What I can say is that we put together a roster that was poised to contend for international championships but ultimately failed in terms of team cohesion,” Cohenca wrote on X. “Winning SEN City and SOOP [in the offseason] only delayed the effects of the issues brewing. The team no longer could function as constructed, so continuing with the current five players/head coach was not an option.”</p>



<p>“Given the nature of the VCT schedule, this break is pretty much the only window to make a roster move, so we are doing things now to be ready for when a Champs slot is on the line.”</p>

They will remain a part of NRG as we prepare for the remainder of the 2025 VCT season.</span></p></article></div>



<p>Long-time veterans of NRG in Sam “s0m” Oh, Pujan “FNS” Mehta, and Ethan “Ethan” Arnold will seemingly stay on the starting roster. Adam “mada” Pampuch, who joined the team during this past offseason, will also stay following an exceptional statistical performance at Kickoff. Some fans speculate that former coach Chetan “Chet” Singh could return when his suspension expires at the end of Masters Bangkok. Chet was suspended by Riot Games for streaming VODs deemed “confidential” on his personal channel.</p>



<p>NRG lost to Cloud9 and KRÜ at Kickoff, while managing to win against 100T in between those matches, but earned no points towards Champions qualification. Their season resumes when VCT Americas Stage 1 starts in late March.</p>
