		<p>Moonshot Games has announced a brand new team based shooter set in space, and it is called Wildgate. Wildgate will mix up space combat, looting, ship boarding, and a whole lot of first person shooting.

			<p>The first Title Update for Monster Hunter Wilds is rapidly approaching, with information on the upcoming update being revealed in the Monster Hunter Wilds showcase today. Title Update 1 will be arriving in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-was-february-2025s-best-selling-game-in-the-us-more-than-half-of-its-sales-came-from-steam/">critically acclaimed RPG</a> on April 4, 2025. This update will be adding a familiar face, as well as some new features and challenges for players to take on.</p>
<p>Last making an appearance in Monster Hunter Rise, the Bubble Fox Wyvern Mizutsune will be making a return and heading into the Forbidden Lands on April 4. Players will be able to unlock the mission by speaking with Kanya in the Scarlet Forest once they are Hunter Rank 21.</p>
<p>For a glimpse of what you can expect of this update on April 4, make sure to check out the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds - Free Title Update 1" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T6y-0sBUKGI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

Additionally, there will be a new Rey Dau Gamma armor set that players can forge as a reward.</p>
<p>Once players have reached Hunter Rank 50, there will also be a mission unlocked where players can hunt Zoh Shia again, where players will then be able to gather Zoh Shia parts for high-rank Hunter and Palico equipment.</p>

Once teams find it, they have to battle one another to extract. That can happen aboard spaceships or out in the void. But if a squad’s ship gets blown up, their journey will come to an abrupt end. It’s coming to PC and consoles sometime in 2025. </p><p>You can see where I’m getting the <em>Sea of Thieves </em>vibes from. The deep-dive trailer makes that even more apparent:</p><p>It’s an ambitious mashup of genres. <em>Wildgate</em> boasts “epic spaceship battles,” exploration through “cosmic storms,” plundering alien outposts for loot, and a unique cast of adventurers called Prospectors, each with their own arsenal of tools and abilities. The world and characters, which include a cat in a fish tank controlling a mech and a anthropomorphic goat warrior, are a bit all over the place, but I can see them growing on me if the gameplay loop is as fun as it sounds. </p><p>Whether <em>Wildgate</em> has the magic to put it over the top where so many other live-service multiplayer games have failed remains to be seen. Moonshot Games is helmed by some Blizzard vets who worked on <em>Hearthstone</em>, <em>StarCraft</em>, and other franchises, including producer Jason Chayes, designer Dustin Browder, and artist Ben Thompson. The team is part of Dreamhaven, the publishing label led by ex-Blizzard president Mike Morhaime. </p><p> “<em>Wildgate </em>rewards cooperation and tactical mastery in a way that realizes Dreamhaven’s goal to bring players together and help them create lasting memories,” Morhaime said in a press release. “Since every match of <em>Wildgate </em>plays differently, there’s tons for you and your friends to discover as you explore the Typhon Reach. Ship-vs-ship combat brings an element of chaos that makes for an especially fun time, and we’re looking forward to players experiencing it for themselves during the playtest.”</p><p>Today’s livestream also gave updates on Dreamhaven’s other partner projects. Secret Door’s tabletop-inspired RPG, <em>Sunderfolk</em>, will be $50 and is headed to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC on April 23. FuzzyBot’s <em>Lynked: Banner of the Spark</em>, a loot-based action-RPG cozy sim (yes, really), is headed out of Early Access for PS5, Xbox, and PC on May 22. Finally, Game River’s <em>Mechabellum</em>, a  tactical mech auto battler with shades of <em>Total Annihilation</em> that launched on PC last year, recently launched season 3 and is currently on sale. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Solo dev Wootus of Wootusart Industries has announced that the 2D shooter and strategy title War Rats: The Rat em Up will be available in Steam Early Access from April 22nd. In War Rats, you are a Rat commander that has to lead troops into a battle against the forces of TechnoRat. In this world rats are the only inhabitants.</p>
<p><iframe title="WAR RATS: The Rat em Up. Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DO7p18xH3po?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“As a solo dev, I would love to involve the players in shaping the game, especially when it comes to balancing. This kind of game can be very challenging for some players while for others it will be a breeze. I feel like Early Access would be a great place to get that balance right. I would also like people to be able to play the Singleplayer portion of the game without having to wait for Multiplayer to be finished”,</em>said Wootus.</p>
<p>War Rats battles are a mix of 2D action where you go and fight the enemy troops, and a base building as you command troops to construct things like turrets. You can also recruit more rat troops to face off against the enemy forces, as going alone will lead to absolute failure. The early access release will contain the full single player campaign as well as a skirmish mode that allows players to choose which map to fight in. The full release of War Rats, which is estimated to come out six months after the early access release, will contain co-op and PvP multiplayer. The additional modes include Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, and Conquest. There will also be more single player content including horde mode.</p>

			<p>Several years after its <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40000-darktide-gets-delayed-to-november-30th-on-pc-a-bit-later-on-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original debut on PC</a>, Warhammer 40K Darktide continues to be updated with big patches. Today's free update is called Nightmares &amp; Visions and adds a new wave-based activity, significant enhancements to the Havoc end-game mode (including four new mutators), an overhaul of the Ogryn talent tree, a timed special event, and more.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>New game activity - Mortis Trials:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Wave-based feature:</strong> upon reaching level 13, players will be able to mash through waves of enemies in visions induced by the ship’s Psyker, Sefoni. Each time they venture into the Psyker’s visions, they will be able to build new and exciting playstyles by selecting randomized abilities and buffs for the duration of the trial.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Choose Your Indulgence, Shape Your Playstyle –</strong> Before the battle begins, players select an Indulgence, each offering unique buffs that enhance combat styles. Pyrokinetic and Voltaic focus on elemental damage, Fulminator blends both, Death Dealer excels in close-quarters ranged and melee combat, and Colossus boosts survivability.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Trials of Endurance –</strong> Mortis Trials unfold in 12 escalating waves, with every third wave introducing an objective to complete. Success grants supplies and stronger buffs, culminating in a final gauntlet where players unleash their full potential.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Uncover lore and backstories -</strong> By overcoming the Mortis Trials, players will unlock memory echoes, granting them access to secret information on some of the main characters present on the Mourningstar.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Havoc mode gets a refresh -</strong> The end-game experience testing the resolve of the most seasoned operative reaches a new juncture with improvements and new daunting challenges.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Improvements:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Havoc Assignment Rank Overhaul -</strong> Fatshark made progression clearer and more rewarding for all players. Now, everyone who participates in a mission will rank up if they meet the new progression criteria, making group play more fulfilling.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Introducing Campaigns to Havoc -</strong> To keep gameplay fresh, Warhammer 40K Darktide will introduce a rotation system for mission pools and mutators in Havoc challenges, ensuring variety across play sessions. With the Nightmares &amp; Visions update, players will have their ranks reset to the nearest threshold based on the highest rank reached since the introduction of Havoc last year.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>New challenges -</strong> Fresh horrors are joining the fray with four new mutators added to Havoc:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Heinous Rituals -</strong> Heretics attempt to summon a new kind of Daemonhost, disrupt their rituals, or face the consequences.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>The Encroaching Garden -</strong> Specific enemies will heal their allies. If not promptly defeated, they will rapidly regenerate the ranks of the heretics.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Rampaging Enemies -</strong> Fallen enemies empower their allies with a surge of strength, making tactical planning crucial to avoid being overwhelmed.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Enraging Elites -</strong> Injured Elites will become enraged, increasing their attack and movement speed and giving them immunity to crowd control effects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Time-Limited Special Event “A Day At The Theatre” -</strong> Following the release of Nightmares &amp; Visions, Warhammer 40K Darktide will be hosting a special event focusing on playing Mortis Trials, taking place in the theatre of the mind of the ship’s Psyker.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><strong>Ogryn Talent Tree Rework -</strong> The Ogryn class is getting a Talent Tree overhaul, providing players with increased build opportunities.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The Ogryn talent tree has been revamped to expand viable melee builds, introduce stronger tank and support options, and improve ranged combat effectiveness. Melee builds are no longer locked into heavy attacks, with new talents supporting both light and heavy strikes. Tank-focused players now have more tools to define their play style, while ranged builds benefit from a reworked Burst Limiter Override, allowing for stronger explosive and sustained fire builds.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">The Ogryn's movement and survivability have also been improved. Dodge now staggers enemies, and new passives enhance damage resistance and coherency Toughness regeneration. Additional talents allow for hybrid play styles, rewarding players who mix melee and ranged combat. Overall, this rework aims to increase flexibility, making the Ogryn class feel more impactful and adaptable.</p>
</li>
</ul>

The free update is out now on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5.</p><p>Two new MK-Challenges, the game's shorter-form missions, debut as Stash the Contraband and Kidnap the Mistress. Like other missions in the game, these are contextualized as brainwashing exercises, as the seedy Murkoff corporation attempts to get you to bend to their will before they release you as a sleeper agent sent into the world to cause Cold War-era chaos.</p><p>A bonus page of high-end cosmetics has been added to last season's Catalog, the game's free battle pass system, while a whole new Catalog is out now, too. It includes several skins, including one that resembles the Zodiac Killer's famous get-up. It's just the latest creepy skin in this game which seems to pride itself on its depraved cosmetics.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465083-screenshot2025-03-25113613.png" data-ref-id="1300-4465083" data-ratio="0.56455696202532" data-width="790" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465083-screenshot2025-03-25113613.png" data-ref-id="1300-4465083"></a><figcaption>The new Outlast Trials Catalog (battle pass) is framed around the vigilante Amelia character currently trying to topple the villains of the story.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465083-screenshot2025-03-25113613.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465084-tot_steam_800x450_1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465085-screens2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465086-screens1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465087-catalog2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4465084,1300-4465085,1300-4465086,1300-4465087" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4465084-tot_steam_800x450_1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4465085-screens2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4465086-screens1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4465087-catalog2.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465084-tot_steam_800x450_1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465085-screens2.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465086-screens1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4465087-catalog2.png"></figure><p>The Outlast Trials is also celebrating its first anniversary, so there are even more free cosmetics, such as a nausea-inducing cake, to be unlocked by completing the first-anniversary challenges. Both the new Catalog and these anniversary cosmetics are limited-time offerings, with them disappearing from the game in about a month on April 22.</p><p>As for game fixes, several Rigs (equippable cooldown abilities) have been buffed. The Barricade Rig can now apply to more doors and windows, locking them and slowing enemy pursuit. The Bling Rig now deploys faster at three seconds for its upgraded version or four seconds for its base version--each figure comes down one second from before the patch. The newest Rig, the Jammer, can now open mannequin gates the likes of which can be found in the nursery map.</p><p>The easiest difficulty also got a little easier, too, as enemies inflict less damage and move slightly slower. However, if all this sounds quite generous, it's not without some other punishing changes; the hardest difficulty, Psychosurgery, now features "slightly faster" enemies, as well. The full patch notes are found below:</p><h2>The Outlast Trials 2.1 update: Bug fixes and updates</h2><ul><li>Barricade Rig: Can now be deployed in more doorways and window frames.</li><li>Blind Rig: Base deploy decreased to 4 seconds (was 5 seconds), the upgraded is now 3s (was 4s).</li><li>Jammer: Jammer can now open automatic mannequin gates.</li><li>The nearest Revive Syringe location is now displayed to teammates when someone from the team dies.</li><li>Replay Introduction now displays a confirmation popup before launching.</li><li>The “Introductory” Difficulty has been adjusted for enemies to inflict less damages and move slightly slower.</li><li>The “Psychosurgery” Difficulty has been adjusted to slightly increase enemy speed.</li><li>The “Stay Together” Variator has been removed from Escalation Therapy.</li><li>Using the “Regroup” quick chat action now places a regroup icon on the ground at the player’s location.</li><li>Programs: A new visual indication is displayed for Trials completed in other difficulties than the one that is currently selected on the Trial Board.</li><li>Posters: Posters are now ordered by type (Weekly Programs, Events, etc.)</li><li>Settings: Added a new option to toggle mouse smoothing.</li></ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/03/24/none-of-that-fomo-stuff-here-remedy-shares-new-details-on-control-multiplayer-spin-off<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><span><span>Remedy is a beloved developer in the gaming industry, responsible for creating surreal single-player experiences like Control and Alan Wake. However, its next game, FBC: Firebreak, is a multiplayer game, which prompted many questions from the studio's fans. To answer some of those questions, </span></span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohYTWzw0Uno"><span><span><span><span>Remedy debuted a new trailer</span></span></span></span></a><span><span> during the Future Games Show Spring Showcase and supplemented it with </span></span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rdE55zqOOc"><span><span><span><span>an additional trailer on its own page</span></span></span></span></a><span><span> and a </span></span><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/20/remedy-entertainment-reveals-altered-augments-for-fbc-firebreak/"><span><span><span><span>PS blog post</span></span></span></span></a><span><span>, written by community manager Julius Fondem.</span></span></p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4rdE55zqOOc" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p><span><span>Both trailers are gameplay-forward, showing off one of Firebreak's missions, known here as "Jobs," called Paper Chase. Since the game is set in the Federal Bureau of Control, mundane objects gain supernatural properties, which is both a boon and a bane to firebreakers. Paper Chase shows the hostile side of the two, as yellow sticky notes take over the surfaces of the map. It's the players' job to clear them off using bullets and explosives, while also gunning down the hordes of aggressive zombie-like monsters.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The second trailer, titled "Community First Look" features developer interviews that explain their creative approach to this game mode. "Is the idea something that could only happen in the Oldest House and that only Remedy as a developer would do?" development coordinator Jalmari Kunnari asks. "If the answer is yes to both of those questions, then it usually means we are on the right track."&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ohYTWzw0Uno" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p><span><span>The quote works as a catch-all explanation for pretty much everything we see in the trailers. Touch too many sticky notes and your character will become possessed by them, becoming a sticky note monstrosity of sorts. You can clean them off in the showers, but unless the heaters are on, you'll be cold and uncomfortable, losing movement speed as a result. If that wasn't wacky enough, the final boss is a sticky note colossus called "Sticky Ricky."</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Players are armed with plenty of tools to fight back with, however. Unlike the superpowered protagonists of other Remedy games, firebreakers are equipped with supernatural objects. Various weapons appear in the footage, but the PS Blog post focuses on Altered Augments, particularly unhinged additions to a Crisis Kit, which is a firebreaker's loadout. The Piggy Bank creates a deadly tornado of coins, the Teapot turns your ammo into boiling water, and the Garden Gnome summons a terrifying lightning storm (and haunts my dreams, though I think that's more of a personal problem). Notably, all three items also damage teammates, so you'll have to time your attacks carefully.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The community trailer ends with the reassurance that all post-launch content will be added in free updates, so there's no need to worry about game modes or weapons locked behind a paywall. "This isn’t a new hobby that you need to log onto every day for rewards," <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/20/remedy-entertainment-reveals-altered-augments-for-fbc-firebreak/">the PS Blog reads</a>. "None of that FOMO stuff here." We'll see for ourselves when the game launches this summer.</span></span></p>

      <div><p>Free League Publishing launched its Kickstarter campaign for <em>Alien RPG Evolved Edition</em> today. The campaign for the updated version of their officially licensed Alien TTRPG reached its initial funding goal within 15 minutes of it going live.</p>



<p>According to its Kickstarter page, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1192053011/alien-rpg-second-edition-and-rapture-protocol/description" rel="nofollow"><em>Alien RPG Evolved Edition</em></a> contains an updated core rulebook, a new starter set, a cinematic adventure boxed set, and a set of miniatures.</p>

The book will feature new items, spaceships, and locations from the recent feature film <em>Alien: Romulus</em>. In addition, it will contain improved and streamlined stealth mechanics, a solo mode, stress and panic rules, and even zero-gravity rules.</p>

<p>For aspiring collectors and early backers, the campaign has some extras. If you back the campaign within 48 hours, you will receive a crew patch of the USCSS Fidanza, the spaceship featured in the cinematic adventure <em>Rapture Protocol</em>, at no additional cost.Finally, there is a Kickstarter-exclusive Collectors Edition of the Core Rulebook.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor">Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</a> is, for the most part, a pretty unexceptional game that does most things pretty competently, though it does manage to slip into that coveted 7/10, imperfect but has something special about it to keep you thinking about it. I'm talking about its Nemesis system, a mechanic that means certain enemies you face off against remember you and your actions as they get stronger, maybe even calling out certain occasions where they killed you. It's a lovely bit of design that, as it turns out, kind of just exists to stop the second hand game market.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
How so? Well, former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/warner-bros">Warner Bros</a> Games exec Laura Fryer recently explained as such in a recent YouTube video of hers. According to Fryer, while working with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/monolith-productions">Monolith</a> she explained to them that a problem <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/rocksteady-studios">Rocksteady's</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/batman-arkham-asylum">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a> faced in terms of sales was that people were buying the game, playing it, returning it, which would then of course be sold second hand. This meant Rocksteady, and subsequently Warner Bros., weren't getting as much money as they'd like.

<p>
"They were only getting paid for the first copy sold," Fryer explained. "They lost millions of dollars." Sure, multiplayer games were growing in popularity at the time, but as Fryer put it, "How do we create a single-player game that is so compelling, that people keep the disc in their library forever?"
</p>
<p>
She went on to explain that Monolith's game engine couldn't really do a big open world like GTA, and they apparently weren't interested in multiplayer. So, they needed a hook. "And this thinking is what led to the Nemesis system, arguably one of the most creative and coolest game features in recent memory."
</p>
<p>
The Nemesis system is a great one, I put hours into Shadow of Mordor because of it despite not being all that much of a Lord of the Rings fan, but frustratingly it is patented until 2036, so you won't be seeing it in any other game any time soon. Especially because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-bros-close-monolith-creators-of-fear-condemned-shadow-of-mordor-and-wonder-woman">Warner Bros. closed Monolith last month</a>, cancelling its Wonder Woman game (which was set to feature the system) along with it. What a load of rubbish, if you ask me.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cd-projekt-red-hires-50-new-devs-to-work-on-witcher-4-and-other-projects.1144542/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-hires-50-new-devs-to-work-on-witcher-4-and-other-projects/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Over the past four months, Polish game developer CD Projekt Red has hired over 50 new employees to work on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdpr-wont-let-the-witcher-4-cyberpunk-2077/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Witcher 4</a> and other titles. The new entry in the iconic Witcher series is the only project currently in production, but CDPR has boosted the working numbers of almost all its other project departments.</p>



<h2 id="h-cdpr-has-been-increasing-the-size-of-almost-all-its-project-teams">CDPR Has Been Increasing the Size of Almost All its Project Teams</h2>



<p>CD Projekt Red <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/03/cd-projekt-group-presentation-fy-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> its earnings statement for the 2024 fiscal year today, highlighting the continuing success of Cyberpunk 2077 and the excitement built around The Witcher 4’s announcement. CDPR states that The Witcher 4 had the most watched trailer from The Game Awards’ slate of game premieres and had the most press coverage (measured in total article appearances and headlines).</p>



<p>Between the end of November (just a couple weeks before The Game Awards) and the end of this past February, CDPR brought on 57 new employees. 11 of those employees joined the already massive team working on The Witcher 4, increasing the total number to 411.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>However, the project that got the largest increase to its total size is the team working on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdpr-project-orion-2077-warm-up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Orion, the codename for Cyberpunk sequel</a> project. Over the last four months, that team increased by 20, growing from 64 to 84 employees. Prior to the start of this hiring wave, CDPR says they reached 30 million copies of Cyberpunk 2077 sold, and over 8 million copies sold of the critically acclaimed Phantom Liberty expansion.</p>



<p>Fans shouldn’t expect the Cyberpunk sequel, or realistically any major CDPR release, anytime soon. The Witcher 4 is still in production, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-witcher-multiplayer-game-has-development-rebooted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the multiplayer Witcher project known as Sirius</a> is still in pre-production, and the Witcher remake, the Cyberpunk sequel, and a new IP project codenamed Hadar are still in their concept phases. There are also some unannounced projects in the works, including one from Fool’s Theory, who are also working on the Witcher remake.</p>

<p>Moonshot Games, a studio under Dreamhaven, has revealed its brand new online multiplayer shooter Wildgate. Set to launch on Xbox Series, PlayStation 5, and PC later this year, Wildgate is a PvPvE crew-based first-person shooter that sees players travel into a vast area of space with the goal of capturing an ancient relic known as the Artifact.</p>



<p>The game features 20 player matches with five teams of four. Each team enters an area of space known as The Reach with a mission to capture the Artifact and make it through the Wildgate itself.</p>



<h6 id="h-preview-wildgate-could-be-the-multiplayer-game-of-the-year">PREVIEW: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/preview-wildgate-could-be-the-multiplayer-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wildgate Could Be The Multiplayer Game Of The Year</a></h6>



<p>Every match can take anywhere from 20 to 40-plus minutes to complete as you explore and fight through a map that features procedurally placed elements. You choose one of five available prospectors—each having different abilities and tools at their disposal—and board one of five ships that also have different specializations. From there, how you play is up to you and your crew. You can choose to look for the Artifact quickly and escape or build up your ship to destroy those also looking for the rare relic. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Ships can be upgraded throughout the match with new weapons, shields, and more to make it withstand the harsh elements of the Reach. You also can find new gear through various points of interest you encounter on your journey.</p>



<p>“Wildgate was designed for anyone that’s ever wanted to go on a daring space adventure alongside a fearless crew,” Moonshot Games studio head Jason Chayes said via release. “Players are invited to work together and confront evolving cosmic threats – whether they’re mysterious hazards of the Reach – or presented by rival Prospectors.”</p>



<p>As mentioned, Wildgate will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC in 2025. There are plans to hold multiple playtests for players to get their first look at the game ahead of release. The first such playtest will take place from April 10-14 with <a href="https://www.playwildgate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">signups open now</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/not-so-permadeath-blizzard-revives-hardcore-wow-characters-killed-by-ddos-attacks/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>"I don't feel comfortable dragging people through getting world buffs, flasks, and consumes etc., just to raid with the anxiety and probably the actuality of just being DDOS'd again and dying," sodapoppin wrote.</p>
<h2>Blizzard to the rescue?</h2>
<p>Sodapoppin allowed that OnlyFangs might continue "if we get a rollback [of the DDOS-related deaths] or I hear of some solid... DDOS protection" but added that they "don't see that happening." Last night, though, Blizzard surpassed sodapoppin's expectations and <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/in-response-to-the-ddos-attacks/2082423">changed its <em>Classic</em> Hardcore permadeath policy</a> to specifically deal with situations like this.</p>

<p>"Recently, we have experienced unprecedented distributed-denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks that impacted many Blizzard game services, including Hardcore realms, with the singular goal of disrupting players’ experiences," <em>WoW Classic</em> Associate Production Director Clay Stone <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/in-response-to-the-ddos-attacks/2082423">wrote in a public message</a>. "As we continue our work to further strengthen the resilience of <em>WoW</em> realms and our rapid response time, we’re taking steps to resurrect player-characters that were lost as a result of these attacks."</p>
<p>While Blizzard's general policy on Hardcore mode deaths hasn't changed, Stone writes that the recent deaths due to DDOS are different because they "are an intentionally malicious effort made by third-party bad actors, and we believe the severity and results of DDOS attacks specifically warrant a different response."</p>

<p>That's not entirely out of step with Blizzard's <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/23973734/rules-of-engagement-classic-hardcore-is-coming-to-world-of-warcraft">longstanding Hardcore Mode policies</a>, which specifically prohibit "deliberate action to hamper or significantly impede the ability of other players to enjoy the game" or "actions to deliberately cause the death of another player." But those policies were designed to punish various forms of in-game griefing, not for an anonymous botnet attacking the game servers themselves.</p>
<p>Now that DDOS-related deaths are no longer permanent, the griefers responsible for those attacks will hopefully have less motivation to take out all of Battle.net just to impact one <em>WoW</em> raid. But the appeal of disrupting specific scheduled streams will remain until Blizzard can find some way to protect its servers more effectively.</p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">At GDC 2025, I got a chance to play <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sunderfolk/" data-ref-id="5000-646962">Sunderfolk</a>, an upcoming cooperative turn-based tactical RPG adventure that lets you play a tabletop RPG with your friends without the need to set up any physical maps or learn a book of rules. Heck, you don't even all have to be in the same place, as the game is entirely controlled via players' cell phones. I had a lot of fun playing Sunderfolk, appreciating how its approachable structure and simple combat system made for a far easier set of mechanics to grasp in comparison to the likes of Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e, Pathfinder 2e, or Vampire: The Masquerade 5e. Plenty of friend groups who have always wanted to see what all the fuss is about when it comes to tabletop RPGs but simply don't have the time or money to jump into the hobby are going to find a lot to love with Sunderfolk.</p><p dir="ltr">In Sunderfolk, each player picks from one of six characters: the raven Arcanist is your traditional spellcaster, the bat Bard empowers and heals allies through song, the polar bear Berserker dominates the front line with a massive hammer, the goat Ranger outputs more damage the farther they are away from the action, the weasel Rogue dismantles foes from up close, and the salamander Pyromancer unleashes fiery explosions. These six characters have been tasked with defending the Arden, a peaceful town where anthropomorphic animals live together, from a growing shadowy corruption that is transforming previously manageable annoyances into monstrous threats.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4465045-ss_677b59b51ccda0d8096b8fc17fbc146863a6c881.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465045" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4465045-ss_677b59b51ccda0d8096b8fc17fbc146863a6c881.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465045"></a><figcaption>Sunderfolk's combat is played on a hexagonal grid.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4465045-ss_677b59b51ccda0d8096b8fc17fbc146863a6c881.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I opted for the Ranger, while two members of developer Secret Door played alongside me as the Bard and Berserker. Sunderfolk can be played alone (one player would just be controlling multiple characters, akin to Baldur's Gate 3), but most of my enjoyment came from strategizing with my teammates and trying to figure out how to best pair our unique abilities together to handle a combat situation. Up to four players can play at a time in Sunderfolk, and grabbing a group of three or four feels like the ideal way to play this game.</p><p dir="ltr">While the action happened on the TV in front of us, we each controlled our respective characters with our phones. Each character has their own deck of cards with unique abilities--the Ranger, for example, had a card that when played would release a piercing shot that could hit multiple targets in a line, while the Bard had a card that let them briefly enthral a target and move them to a different space on the hexagonal board. There's no turn order to Sunderfolk, allowing players to not only choose what they do on their turn but in what order. My teammates and I would have a brief back-and-forth to discuss our options, occasionally having someone cancel their turn in the midst of planning it out so that someone else could go first.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4465049-ss_68bf152aa51c88325453cccc619cace831494745.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465049" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4465049-ss_68bf152aa51c88325453cccc619cace831494745.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465049"></a><figcaption>You can play Sunderfolk virtually, but couch co-op feels like the ideal way to play.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4465049-ss_68bf152aa51c88325453cccc619cace831494745.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In the combat section I played, our objective was to defeat a bunch of bad guys who were being mutated into powerful monsters, with little timers above their heads letting us know how many turns were left before each of their transformations. The devs told me that Sunderfolk will have combat encounters with plenty of other types of objectives, like defending a point against waves of enemies. I can't speak to what these other objective types are like, but I'm curious to play them. Some of the characters have cards that felt really out of place in a scenario that was all about defeating enemies as quickly as possible--the Ranger had an option to stop an enemy from moving and then leapfrog away, for instance--and I wonder if those cards would have felt more satisfying to play when faced with a different type of objective.</p><p dir="ltr">Between missions, all the players return to the hub-like Arden, usually leveling up and unlocking new passive perks. It is in town where each player can unlock new cards and customize their deck, talk to NPCs to befriend and/or romance them, and use loot to buy upgrades to the town that can net party-wide perks. During this downtime, the action switches from the big screen to each player's individual phone, allowing people to do whatever they want (or for someone to go to the bathroom or grab a snack while others go work on their card deck or something).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4465048-ss_fa087879b02f7a10d89eb7f4054ddc08b0ce0416.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465048" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4465048-ss_fa087879b02f7a10d89eb7f4054ddc08b0ce0416.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465048"></a><figcaption>As you rebuild Arden, you and your friends can name parts of the town.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4465048-ss_fa087879b02f7a10d89eb7f4054ddc08b0ce0416.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">My favorite part of downtime is the option to name things. When our party finished funding repairs for a bridge, the player who put the most gold into the project got to name it, and then, on all of our phones, that name showed up whenever one of us visited the bridge. In addition, the NPCs would use that name when talking about the bridge. There were other fun examples of this, too, like an NPC asking the Bard to remind her what a specific thing was again, and then her using the name the dev typed in when my Ranger went to talk to her. It's a small narrative touch, but it allows you and your friends to not only build your group's version of Arden but craft stories for it too. This system of storytelling extends to other parts of the game as well. If one player romances an NPC, that will be reflected in conversations other players have with that NPC, for example, and that player will get a unique gameplay perk that relates to the romance shared between their character and that specific NPC--their connection is regularly reflected in the gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-tactical-rpg-has-a-cool-tabletop-game-master-feature-please-overlook-her-railroading-faux-pas/1100-6528484/" data-ref-id="1100-6528484">The story, action, and characters are all voiced by one actor: Anjali Bhimani</a>. From what I've heard so far, she does a remarkable job, adjusting her cadence, tone, and pitch to give all the major characters their own voice and then using her natural voice to narrate what's happening (even during combat!) and help nudge players in the right direction if they need it. This replicates the feeling of playing a tabletop RPG with a Game Master while ensuring no one at the table has to actually step up and be the one responsible for dictating what happens next and bringing the story to life. I like this choice, and after loving Amelia Tyler as the Dungeon Master in Baldur's Gate 3, I hope that this is just the natural storytelling tool for these types of games going forward. Game Masters do so much and are such a crucial part of the experience for certain tabletop RPGs, that now that I know what we've been missing all this time, I do not want to go back and play certain video games--I can feel the void in TTRPG video games that forgo that all-knowing, guiding voice.</p><p dir="ltr">All of this is to say that Sunderfolk was my favorite demo at GDC this year and is one of my most anticipated games for 2025. I can't wait to rope my friends into playing it with me in a few weeks when it launches for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, PC, and Switch on April 23.</p>

            <p>Dreamhaven has revealed a number of in-development projects at its showcase presented by The Game Awards, including the release date of its tabletop-inspired adventure Sunderfolk.</p>
<p>The company was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ex-blizzard-boss-details-new-company-dreamhaven">set up by ex-Blizzard boss Mike Morhaime</a> in 2020, known for his work on World of Warcraft, and includes other former staff across its two studios.</p>
<p>The biggest announcement was the 23rd April 2025 release date for Sunderfolk, from studio Secret Door, across Steam, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch.</p>

<p>While releasing across PC and console, players will use a mobile app instead of a controller to interact with the game. The aim is to replicate a tabletop experience but in a streamlined, approachable way.</p>
<p>"As longstanding tabletop gaming fans, we at Secret Door know all too well how difficult it can be to get new players together for a shared experience. Learning rules, perceived complexity, and setup times can create challenges for playing with our loved ones," said Chris Sigaty, studio head of Secret Door. "Our goal with Sunderfolk is to leverage modern technology to make game night something everyone can enjoy."</p>
<p>"At its core, Sunderfolk is about the joy of playing together - laughter, strategy, and making memories," added Morhaime. "Just like the tabletop games that inspired it, Sunderfolk creates lasting bonds between friends and family with each session."</p>
<p>I went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sunderfolk-from-former-world-of-warcraft-boss-is-streamlined-tabletop-dnd-by-way-of-final-fantasy-crystal-chronicles-and-some-is-hidden-on-your-mobile">hands-on with Sunderfolk at the Game Developers Conference</a> (GDC) and was impressed by its mix of public and private gameplay that rewards cooperation.</p>
<p>Dreamhaven's other studio, Moonshot Games, announced Wildgate, a crew-based first-person shooter set in space. With both games, Dreamhaven is ticking both the fantasy and sci-fi boxes and providing cooperative experiences.</p>
<p>As "Prospectors", players will explore space in search of ancient relics to extract, engaging in both tactical spaceship combat and on-foot firefights with a comedy tone. A preview playtest will take place from 10th-14th April ahead of a launch later in the year across Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>"Wildgate rewards cooperation and tactical mastery in a way that realises Dreamhaven's goal to bring players together and help them create lasting memories," said Morhaime. "Since every match of Wildgate plays differently, there's tonnes for you and your friends to discover as you explore the Typhon Reach. Ship-vs-ship combat brings an element of chaos that makes for an especially fun time, and we're looking forward to players experiencing it for themselves during the playtest."</p>

<p>Elsewhere, Dreamhaven is working with two other studios on support projects.</p>
<p>The first is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3159570/Lynked_Banner_of_the_Spark/">Lynked: Banner of the Spark</a> with developer FuzzyBot.
