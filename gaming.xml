Adopting techniques from one of five unique Masters, each battle presents a puzzle that must be solved using your mind as well as your fists.</p><p>Yu encounters many foes on his path to the capital, and he is always outnumbered, but he has a secret weapon: the Foresight, a meditative technique that allows him to mentally perceive fights over and over until he finds a sequence of movements that allows him to overcome the odds.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Once ready, our hero must fight in reality, where losing means starting everything over, but progress is permanent. Winning doesn’t always mean he will emerge from each encounter unscathed, but the further he travels, the stronger he will become.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Forewarned is Forearmed</strong> – The Foresight, a distinctive game mechanic that lets players experiment without consequences before fighting for real—and win or die trying. <em>Forestrike</em>‘s <a title="Genres > Roguelike [230 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/roguelike">roguelike game</a> loop generates unique runs and encounters every time, so adaptation and improvisation are crucial to progress.</li><li><strong>Visceral Kung Fu Combat</strong> – Always outnumbered, learn to dispatch mobs of brutal enemies with poise and efficiency using everything at your disposal. Upgrade and customize your movesets with techniques from your chosen Masters to help you outwit your opponents in fierce, puzzle-like battles.</li><li><strong>Handcrafted Fantasy</strong> – Journey through a visually striking fantasy world inhabited by unique characters, vicious enemies and magical revelations.

The Team Builder tools are <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/team-builder/landing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accessible via browser</a>, with custom teams available to be downloaded in-game. If you're not feeling particularly creative, you can also download creations made by your friends or other creators.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/18/cfb-25-team-builder-1721343740288.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The College Football 25 Team Builder lets you build your very own custom team.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Custom teams are compatible with College Football 25's Dynasty Mode, meaning you can create your own school and build them into a collegiate superpower like Michigan or Georgia. Up to 16 custom teams can be imported per dynasty, where they will replace an existing team of the commissioner's choice.</p><p>Team Builder was a heavily-requested feature by fans, who remembered it fondly from previous iterations of the NCAA franchise. EA responded by going as far as to hire one of its original architects, senior engineer Chris Markuck, who returned to help lead development on College Football 25's version of Team Builder.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>According to Circana's Player Engagement Tracker, on July 17th, EA Sports College Football ranked #3 in US daily active users on Xbox Series (behind only Call of Duty HQ and Fortnite) and 4th on PS5 (COD, Fortnite &amp; GTAV). </p><p>...and it's still just in early access. </p><p>Phew.</p></div>— Mat Piscatella (@MatPiscatella) <a href="https://twitter.com/MatPiscatella/status/1813973638275850649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 18, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Elsewhere, College Football 25 is off to a very strong start, ranking at #3 for US daily active users on Xbox and #4 on PS5. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25s-servers-are-getting-crushed-before-its-even-fully-released">EA servers were slammed</a> by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-is-off-to-a-strong-start-ahead-of-its-official-release">as many as 700,000 fans</a>, with more to come once it  leaves early access. Fan feedback has been mostly positive, though our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-review">current review-in-progress</a> is currently a bit more mixed on the experience.</p><p>"Right now, EA College Football 25 feels like a college quarterback who left school for the NFL too soon, got drafted way higher than he should have because a team was desperate, started under intense scrutiny from a fanbase and an owner who are tired of losing all the time, and then flamed out of the league because he just wasn’t ready for prime time," we wrote.</p><p>Stay tuned for our full review, and make sure to check our <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/college-football-25">complete guide to College Football 25</a>.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

Microsoft revealed last week that it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/9/24195312/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-increase-standard-subscription">increasing PC Game Pass and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate prices</a>, and planning to launch a new Game Pass Standard tier soon without day one access to first-party Xbox games.</p><p>The FTC calls this new Game Pass Standard tier a “degraded product,” because new Game Pass users won’t be able to sign up to the $10.99 Game Pass for Console, which includes day one game access.

            <p>
Paramount+ has officially cancelled its divisive live-action Halo television series, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paramount-releases-halo-tv-show-second-season-trailer">recently broadcast second season</a> set to be its last on the service.
</p>
<p>
Season 1 of Paramount+'s Halo series aired back in 2022, nearly a decade after the project was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spielberg-to-produce-a-halo-tv-show">first announced</a>. It launched to a mixed reception, however, drawing criticism for its writing, inconsistent tone, uneven plotting, and pacing. Halo fans also didn't love the decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paramounts-halo-reveals-master-chiefs-face">show Master Chief's face</a> just episodes in, or the decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-revealing-master-chiefs-face-the-halo-tv-series-has-now-shown-his-nude-bum">show his bum</a> after that. And by the time he was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cortana-just-watched-master-chief-have-sex">having sex in front of Cortana</a>, even Halo's co-creator <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-co-creator-marcus-lehto-shares-thoughts-on-divisive-tv-adaptation">admitted</a> he was "confused".
</p>
<p>
Despite these concerns, initial audience numbers were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-tv-show-sets-a-new-viewership-record-for-paramount">good</a>, and Paramount+ made the decision to forge ahead with a second season, albeit this time under the watch of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-tv-show-will-reportedly-lose-its-showrunner-after-season-one-is-over">new show runner</a>. And improvements were promised: Master Chief actor Pablo Schreiber (who also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-tv-show-star-says-master-chiefs-romantic-relationship-was-a-huge-mistake">wasn't a fan</a> of some of the first season's more controversial choices) <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-season-two-will-better-than-the-first-master-chief-actor-promises">said</a> there was "no question" Season 2 was "far stronger" ahead of its airing this February.

<p>
Unfortunately, it seems those promises weren't enough to get viewers back on board. Paramount+ has now <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/halo-canceled-paramount-plus-1236075994/">confirmed to Variety</a> that its Halo TV show is officially cancelled, saying it "will not move forward with a third season on the service".
</p>
<p>
However, it seems there's still a chance the show might live on elsewhere if creators Xbox, Amblin TV, and 343 Industries get their wish. Citing an "individual with knowledge of the situation", Variety says all three will now attempt to shop the series around to other outlets, so perhaps don't write the Halo TV show off quite yet.

            <p>
Mortal Kombat developer NetherRealm Studios has been hit by layoffs according to affected members of staff, with the majority of job losses said to be from its mobile team.
</p>
<p>
News of the layoffs first surfaced after NetherRealm quality assurance analyst Tony Lazzara <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tony-lazzara-83b00319_opentowork-activity-7219362131924672513-snus/">posted to LinkedIn</a>, writing, "Unfortunately, yesterday NetherRealm's mobile team was shut down. A ton of very talented people were put out of work."
</p>
<p>
"We had live services on multiple titles such as Mortal Kombat Mobile, Injustice 2, and Mortal Kombat Onslaught," Lazzara continued. "I was also affected."

Following Lazzara's post, a number of other NetherRealm employees have confirmed they were also affected by job cuts at the studio. "It hurts me to announce I’ve been laid off from NetherRealm Studios after about 10 years of working there," Elizabeth Ramirez <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/elizabeth-ramirez-nava-2b303317_it-hurts-me-to-announce-ive-been-laid-off-activity-7219209713945604096-VZZV/">wrote</a>. "I will be seeking new opportunities as an animator for games or film.
</p>
<p>
Software engineer Antonio De Francesco also added their voice to those confirming they were no longer employed by NetherRealm. "I am sad to share that I am looking for a new role," they <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7219144299609829378/">posted on LinkedIn</a>, "and would greatly appreciate your support."
</p>
<p>
NetherRealm has yet to publicly comment on reports of layoffs at the studio, so there's no official confirmation of how widespread the job losses might be. However, Insider-Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-developer-netherrealm-studios-hit-with-mass-layoffs/">claims</a> at least 50 members of staff have been impacted by the studio's cuts.
</p>
<p>
Word of lay offs at NetherRealm follows parent company Warner Bros. Discovery's admission it was bracing for a "tough year" back in February, after it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">revealed</a> sales of Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League had failed to meet its expectations. The cuts also appear to be a part of wider job losses at Warner Bros. Discovery, which <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/warner-bros-discovery-lays-off-1000-employees-finance-max-1236074169/">reportedly</a> laid off nearly 1000 employees this week.
</p>
<p>
2024 continues to be a devastating year for games industry employees, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far">over 10,000 people</a> having lost their jobs so far. That's compared to the 10,500 games industry workers who were laid off across the entirety of 2023.

			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro is still on track for 2024, according to information shared with developers earlier this week.</p>
<p>A new report posted today on<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-5-pro-2024-release/"> Insider Gaming</a> provides some clarification on <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-2024/">a tweet</a> shared by Tom Henderson yesterday, which seemed to hint at a possible 2025 release for the mid-generation refresh console by Sony. According to the insider, developers can submit their applications supporting the PlayStation 5 Pro to CertOps (Platform Certification &amp; Operations) on July 30th, a date that was finalized as far back as 18 months ago. Additionally, all applications for the PS5 on games that will be released after September 15th will be required to support the PS5 Pro. This information was shared with developers earlier this week, so it seems like the system is still on track to be released later this year, possibly in the second half of November 2024.</p>
<p>Despite all this, several sources are apprehensive about the PlayStation 5 Pro's release later this year due to the limited number of first-party games that will use its features. However, nothing in the documentation seen by Tom Henderson implies that the system has been delayed.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro has yet to be officially announced. We will update you on the system as soon as more information becomes available, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

The visual novel will follow a private investigator as they unravel the murder of a student who is said to have been slain by Emio. The original protagonist from The Missing Heir, Ayumi Tachibana, also appears to be a playable character for part of the game.</p><p>If you want to check out the previous games in the series, The Girl Who Stands Behind and The Missing Heir, consider picking up <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1848262376826990935%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Femio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club%2F1100-6525119%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Two-Case Collection</a> at Best Buy for $60.

The result is that only the Game Pass Ultimate subscription, which is now $20 a month, will include access to all Game Pass games. </p><p>“Microsoft’s price increases and product degradation—combined with Microsoft’s reduced investments in output and product quality via employee layoffs, see FTC’s February 7, 2024, Letter—are the hallmarks of a firm exercising market power post-merger,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24852374-24-07-18-ftc-letter-re-microsoft-game-pass-price-increases&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24852374-24-07-18-ftc-letter-re-microsoft-game-pass-price-increases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the FTC writes</a></span>. It also points to a statement Microsoft made in its filings during the trial last summer suggesting Game Pass wouldn’t get more expensive just because Activision Blizzard’s games were added to it. </p><p>“Here, the acquisition would benefit consumers by making [<em>Call of Duty</em>] available on Microsoft’s Game Pass on the day it is released on console (with no price increase for the service based on the acquisition),” the company wrote at the time.

It’s not clear when a final decision in the appeal will be issued, and it’s hard to fathom what the consequences would be if Microsoft ended up losing. It would no doubt be even messier and more confusing than its Game Pass overhaul. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Paramount has canceled the Halo TV series on Paramount+ after two seasons; it has been announced.</p>



<p>The announcement came earlier today (via <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/halo-canceled-paramount-plus-2-seasons-1235952581/?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Holly Reporter</a>), with Paramount+ offering a statement. “We are extremely proud of this ambitious series and would like to thank our partners at Xbox, 343 Industries and Amblin Television, along with showrunner and executive producer David Wiener, his fellow executive producers, the entire cast led by Pablo Schreiber as Master Chief and the amazing crew for all their outstanding work,” they said. “We wish everyone the best going forward.”</p>



<p>According to The Hollywood Reporter, its sources say that Xbox and 343 Industries will look to land the series at another outlet for a third season if possible.</p>



<p>“We deeply appreciate the millions of fans who propelled the&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>&nbsp;series to be a global success, and we remain committed to broadening the&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>&nbsp;universe in different ways in the future,” reads a statement from 343 Industries. “We are grateful to Amblin and Paramount for their partnership in bringing our expansive sci-fi universe to viewers around the world.”</p>



<p>The Halo TV Series was received as a mixed bag by those who watched the show. Season 1 was generally poorly due to the show moving away from its source material, while Season 2 improved ratings slightly.</p>



<p>It’s not entirely clear where Xbox and 343 Industries could take the Halo TV series next, but Amazon Prime could be a strong contender following the success of the platform with the Fallout TV series.</p>



<p>Where do you think Halo will go? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

            <p>
As Diablo 4's Vessel of Hatred expansion inches ever-closer, Blizzard has shared first gameplay and details for its new Spiritborn class during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjVUD8eLCFY">lengthy deep-dive livestream</a>.
</p>
<p>
In lore terms, the Spiritborn comes from the jungles of Sanctuary's Nahantu and is described as "an apex predator with a deep connection to the spirit realm". From a gameplay perspective, though, the Spiritborn is a dexterity focused class built around a spirit-infused martial arts move set - combining aspects of Muay Thai, taekwondo, karate, kickboxing, and boxing - that promises to make for Diablo 4's "fastest, most aggressive" class yet.
</p>
<p>
It has multiple gap-closers built into its basic attacks, several movement skills with "very high damage", plus various ways to upgrade its evades - and all its abilities are themed around four god-like Spirit Guardians that it summons during battle. There's a jaguar representing courage and ferocity; a massive centipede embodying balance and persistence; a giant eagle reflecting awareness and finesse, plus a gorilla that's a manifestation of protection and strength.

<p>
Breaking these down further, jaguar skills are all about speed and piling on constant pressure, and they generate a new stacking buff known as Ferocity through use. Ferocity increases the attack speed of all skills as it stacks, but also further enhances jaguar skills so they can be used more often.
</p>
<p>
The Ravager skill, for instance, has a passive effect that maintains Ferocity at a minimum level, but it can be activated to generate additional attacks when players hit something. Rushing Claw, meanwhile, is all about mobility, enabling the Spiritborn to dash and slash through targets over and over again, while the The Hunter is an ultimate skill that summons the jaguar onto the battlefield, destroying everything in the vicinity as it lands. This can even be upgraded for a chance to reset its cooldown after a kill to keep that kill streak growing. 
</p>
<p>
As for the gorilla, it offers a tankier skill set based around protection and defence. Its core mechanic is damage reduction through active blocking, all tied to the Resolve stacking buff, which reduces damage but falls off whenever a player is hit. Example skills include Crushing Hand, essentially two separate attacks that overlap in the middle and can smash enemies to bits, and Payback - which does increased damage the more something hits a player. Its ultimate brings in the gorilla itself, creating a large area on battlefield that grants protection while a player is in it, with the gorilla smashing enemies that stray inside.

<p>
Moving onto the giant eagle, its skills are all about freedom of movement, letting players tactically reposition themselves anywhere on the battlefield, increasing evade skills, even extend attacks into pseudo-ranged style moves. Soar, for instance, takes the Spiritborn up and out of battle for a second, then allows them to pick a descent position, amplifying damage to anything within it on landing. Then there's Razor Wings, essentially a boomerang-style throw attack, and The Seeker. This ultimate summons the eagle to a selected position, whereupon it'll charge up and unleash an upgradeable blast of energy. It's also the first ultimate with multiple charges, so it can be used back-to-back.
</p>
<p>
And finally, there's the centipede. This Spirit Guardian's skills are built around things like damage over time poisoning and crowd control, combined with sustaining elements such as the ability to leach life from enemies. Stinger, for instance, is a core skill that does a large amount of damage within a small area - but that damage also echoes out to poisoned enemies elsewhere on the battlefield. Scourge, meanwhile, adds fear, slow, and poison to enemies, and the Devourer ultimate summons the centipede to unleash a massive poison laser beam - which can be upgraded to instantly annihilate a poisoned enemy.
</p>
<p>
Notably, all these different skills can be mixed and matched for greater flexibility - although players can go down a single Spirit Guardian route if they'd prefer to specialise. This works through the new Spirit Hall class mechanic, enabling players to choose a starting Spirit Guardian as a primary bonus that'll boost all skills of that type, while also adding that spirit's tag to their entire skill kit for additional benefits. Later, it's possible to unlock three more bonuses so players can infuse more Spirit Guardian elements into their chosen playstyle.
</p>
<p>
And that's only the basics. Blizzard's deep-dive also showcases a few examples of Spiritborn itemisation, promising a large suite of legendaries and uniques for the new class - but you'll find a load of additional information in <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24107497/awaken-the-ferocity-of-a-new-class-spiritborn">the developer's accompanying news post</a>. Expect more details on Diablo 4's Vessel of Hatred expansion ahead of its launch on 8th October.

Rather than wait until September, those attending Gen Con 2024 can buy a copy of the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 Player Handbook early. Furthermore, the books sold are limited-run commemorative editions; a must-have for collectors.</p>

<p>According to an official press release, Wizards of the Coast will be providing 3,000 early copies of the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 Player Handbook to Gen Con 2024. This as part of their year-long celebration of the 50th anniversary of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, marking it as one of the oldest foundational fantasy TTRPGs ever.</p>

Each book will be embossed with the 50th-anniversary logo in gold foil, featuring a "Gen Con 2024" bookplate. This distinguishes these copies from other first-run copies while celebrating fifty years of history and stories around the table.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The energy at Gen Con is always electric. Being able to put copies of the 2024 Player’s Handbook, fresh from the printer, directly into players' hands on the floor of the convention is something truly special,” said Jess Lanzillo, VP of D&amp;D Franchise and Product at Wizards of the Coast. “We can't wait to see the excitement as our fans dive into the possibilities contained within!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are attending Gen Con 2024 and want to secure your copy of the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024 Player Handbook, </em>here's what you need to know. The books will be sold at the Lucas Oil Stadium, Northwest Concourse. They will be sold on August 1 between 3:00 PM - 6:00 PM EDT and August 2-4 between 9:00 AM - 12:00 PM EDT.</p>
<p>Each copy will be sold at an MSRP of $49.99 plus tax. At 7:00 AM EDT on each day, attendees can reserve an opportunity to pick up a copy. One simply needs to redeem a digital ticket for an event titled "D&amp;D 2024 <i>Player’s Handbook </i>Early Release Sale." Once it's secured, go to the line at the time and hours specified and wait to make your purchase.</p>
<p>Since only 3,000 copies are available, the books will be sold on a first come first serve basis.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/counter-strike-creator-correctly-holds-the-opinion-that-cs_siege-is-one-of-its-best-maps<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Everybody knows that Counter-Strike's asymmetric levels are its best. If only someone had told its millions of players. Counter-Strike creator Minh Le seems to agree with me at least, naming cs_siege as one of his favourites in a recent interview.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"CS_Siege, cs_facility, were some of my favourite maps," Le told <a href="https://spillhistorie.no/interview-with-counter-strike-creator-minh-le/">Spillhistorie.no</a> when asked about favourites from the old days. "I also really wanted to love cs_747 but I think having linear maps was really bad for gameplay."
</p>
<p>Siege was one of the OG Counter-Strike maps, added in the first release, beta 1.0, back in 1999. It was the only one of the original four maps to make it all the way to the final release. Counter-terrorists start outside near a bridge over a ravine, while terrorists are entrenched in an underground facility with the hostages. Long sight-lines make it a sniper's paradise; there are some brutal chokepoints that favour the terrorists; and in the original game, the hostages liked to get stuck in doorways a lot.
</p>
<p>All of these elements just made it better. It was tense, and it had a sense of narrative to it. I like the Counter-Strike levels that pit attackers against defenders and makes one team an underdog, rather than sending two teams of sharks swimming along a de_dust log flume.
</p>
<p>Not that I dislike Dust. Neither does Le, by the sounds of it. "I think de_dust took all of us by surprise," he says. "We never thought it was that special when we first playtested it, but we were pleasantly surprised to see it become the standard Counter-Strike map. The mapper who made de_dust was extremely intelligent and spent a lot of time tweaking the design of de_dust to make it fun and balanced."
</p>
<p>Dust doesn't need the love, however, and Siege absolutely does. It was never among the original mod's most popular maps, and though the now 25-year-old map made an appearance in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, it has yet to reappear in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>. Hopefully one day.</p>

SK Hynix is a South Korean DRAM manufacturer and is the world's second-largest memory chipmaker and the world's third-largest semiconductor company. They supply components for brands you've heard of, like Corsair and G.Skill.</p><p>The Platinum P41 is SK Hynix's highest end SSD. It boasts sustained read speeds of 7,000MB/s and sustained write speeds of 6,500MB/s. It also boasts random read speeds of 1.4 million IOPS and random write speeds of 1.3 million IOPS. In terms of reliability and stability, the SSDs have been tested and validated through 1,000 hours of stress testing with MTBF reaching 1.5 million hours or up to 1,200TB written. SK Hynix backs it all up with a 5 year warranty. Unlike most other SSDs, both the chips and the controller are manufactured in-house. The P41 Platinum uses an Aries controller with 176-layer TLC NAND flash chips. </p><p>Of course, in terms of real world performance, the vast majority of users won't be able to tell apart the speeds between the highest end PCI-E 4.0 SSDs. Some of these SSDs include the <a href="https://zdcs.link/qmmDw?object_uuid=43e7f0ce-d442-4faa-86d3-0655094f2079&amp;t=article" target="_blank">SK Hynix P41 Platinum</a>, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Z446D?object_uuid=43e7f0ce-d442-4faa-86d3-0655094f2079&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Samsung 990 Pro</a>, and the <a href="https://zdcs.link/X641Y?object_uuid=43e7f0ce-d442-4faa-86d3-0655094f2079&amp;t=article" target="_blank">WD Black SN850X</a>. Therefore, it all comes down to the price. At its current price point, the P41 Platinum isn't just one of the fastest drives on the market, it's also cheaper than any competitor that can come close to its performance.</p><h3>A great PS5 SSD, but you'll need to get a heatsink</h3><p>The SK Hynix P41 Platinum does not come equipped with a heatsink. That's because this SSD is catered to PC gamers looking to add storage to their desktop computer. Many motherboards come equipped with built-in SSD coolers and will only accept bare SSDs. It's generally harder to remove a heatsink than to apply a new one. If you plan to use this for your PS5, rest assured that' it is 100% compatible (in fact, it's overkill). Although some people have gotten away with an SSD with no heatsink, we recommend you install one for peace of mind.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn-review.931347/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>God killing has become a staple in games starring Kratos, Bayonetta, Terra Branford, and countless other characters. With action-RPG soulslike Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn, a new pair of god killers by the names of Nor and Enki joins their ranks. With a familiar tale about being wronged by the various gods of this world and becoming consumed by revenge, it never quite manages to reach the peaks of its peers, borrowing lots of elements from other genres without standing out in any of them. But while that keeps it from true greatness, Flintlock still continuously found ways to entertain me with flashy combat and swift movement across my 26-hour near-completionist run. </p><p>I was late to join the fan club that formed around developer A44’s previous game, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/12/12/ashen-review">Ashen</a>, after its debut back in 2018, but it quickly found its way into my list of favorite soulslikes once I did, thanks in part to how enjoyable it was to vanquish its big bosses with a co-op partner. Six years later A44 is back with Flintlock, and while it may look vastly different from Ashen, a lot of the same foundation can be felt in its combat, storytelling, and overall design. That’s not to say it’s exactly the same, as efforts were clearly focused toward making the combat more brutal and cinematic with some really cool finishers while also introducing new mechanics like an experience multiplier that enhances the usual risk-reward tension of soulslike games. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p>Nor begins as a competent and headstrong soldier looking for glory that I would definitely classify as the “look before you leap” type, while her partner Enki is an adorable yet powerful god who has secluded himself from the world. He has his own reasons for joining Nor after her journey becomes one of revenge, assisting her with both his magical abilities and wisdom about his realm, and his an energetic and humble curiosity when learning of things he’s missed makes his part of the story by far the highlight. Unfortunately, Nor’s vengeful tale does occasionally fall into various cliches, and (avoiding spoilers) the minimalist cutscenes that occur from the perspective of another NPC that travels with them as you go between locations often feel like they are missing parts of the story. The bond that develops between Nor and Enki across their journey isn’t groundbreaking stuff, but watching them was still enjoyable to the end and did leave me curious what could happen next if Flintlock were to get a sequel.  </p><p>You only get a small bit of exposition at the start before you’re thrown into the middle of a war against the undead, but besides a big moment with a larger than life foe near the end of the prologue, this setup failed to give me a reason to care about the war or the people that I was fighting for. That’s mainly due to nearly all the NPCs being either reluctant or outright dismissive of Nor’s presence. The earliest hours of Flintlock are a bit rough in general as you have limited combat options, which can make fights feel much shallower and had me worried that it might not expand enough to become interesting. Thankfully, that changes once you gain access to more weapons and a few upgrades on the skill tree, but it took a bit longer than I would have liked. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Combat is fast and flows extremely well, chaining attacks with easy.</p></div><p>Aside from the main characters, four NPCs join your camp and assist by offering various upgrades to your weapons – but apart from one quest chain involving a brother and sister in the group, they were pretty forgettable. It was one of those situations where you meet characters in the opening hour and then they disappear, only to need saving or assistance hours later. If they weren’t placed on the main path, I probably would have written them off as dead and not thought about them again. On the other hand, the various NPCs you’ll come across through sidequests are more memorable: There were two brothers running an arena I could enter, and a, uh… unique character that increased my maximum health potions, offered information, and provided alternate outfits after liberating a town. </p><p>Combat is fast and flows extremely well; attacks chain into each other with ease and you can really feel the impact with each hit of your axes, hammers, rifles, grenades, and magical abilities that come courtesy of Enki. Flintlock also offers various armor pieces for you to find that provide unique abilities, like detonating enemies after stacking curses, splitting grenades into two, or increasing your attack range. These armor options all have set bonuses, so you’re encouraged to stack at least two of them for an enhanced effect, and that system expands with more interesting choices later on. </p><p>Enki has the ability to curse enemies, which stuns them and offers Nor the opportunity for a very flashy move that will either rip off armor or straight-up execute them, depending on the type of enemy and its health. Enki can also be upgraded to restrain, knock down, distract, and attack on his own, to the point where he often felt a bit <em>too</em> strong even when I was playing on the hardest of the three difficulties. I mean, he is a god, so I guess it’s fair, but in later areas I could take out entire groups of certain enemies with only his attacks. (I pulled this off thanks to a creative build that detonated an enemy after stacking four buffs within 10 seconds.</p><p>Top that off with super moves like a storm that knocks enemies up or a beam that deals major damage and stun, and I almost felt bad for them. This ended up being a great way for me to farm experience (called Reputation), since – similar to Devil May Cry and Bayonetta – you earn a temporary experience multiplier that is built up by fighting without Nor getting hit, and it’s hard for her to take damage when Enki is doing all the work. While it was challenging to amass a giant multiplier during the early game, after picking up more abilities and weapons to swap between I found myself routinely going past 100%, with my top being around 170%. But until then, that system encouraged me to use different weapons and variations on my regular combos in a way I haven’t seen done in a soulslike before. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Sometimes Enki felt a bit <em>too </em>strong, clearing out entire groups alone.</p></div><p>There are some issues with the combo multiplier mechanic, though, and the main one is in enemy unpredictability. By that I don’t mean an attack that catches me off guard, causing me to miss a block or parry – those are par for the course across a decent variety of enemies, ranging from various undead creatures, knights with large shields or broadswords, large chocobo-shaped birds, spiders, and (of course) various gods. What’s troublesome is that there are a number of enemy attack animations that seemingly lock on to you, meaning that when dodging with either a standard dodge or by jumping away the enemy will swing around at a 90-180 degree angle and still hit me despite it looking like I should’ve gotten away. The good news is that I only saw this in fights with regular enemies rather than big bosses where it really would’ve been a problem. </p><p>You have three skill trees that improve your gun, magic, and melee damage, and their branches end up blending together as you approach the top of them. This structure allows you to bypass the lower upgrades on one tree if you want to prioritize certain upgrades over others, while still accessing its high-tier abilities eventually. I enjoyed this because I was able to fully spec into the magic tree early, which gave me the ability to have Enki suspend enemies in the air and, later on, provided a single self-revive that refreshed after resting. This was a godsend in the later boss fights, where one-shot kills aren’t uncommon – they’re avoidable and counterable, but accidents happen! After grabbing that skill at the top I simply bought the highest upgrades of the other trees before working my way back down to the cheaper options as I wanted them, instead of having to work my way up through ones I didn’t. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Flintlock’s tighter campaign length also means that nearly every path in the world leads to something impactful, and you can use Nor’s ability to double jump and air dash to find secrets like new weapons or health increases. There are also typically shortcuts to get you back to the main path quickly – these can either take the form of rest points you can fast travel to, or an interactable skull on a pedestal which activates energy rifts in the sky that Nor and Enki can fly to in quick succession. These rifts are flashy and versatile, and besides acting as shortcuts to return to your objective, they often offer a way for you to reach areas that would be otherwise inaccessible. They are probably one of my favorite mechanics in Flintlock as they are also placed to quickly get you back to a main boss or smaller boss-like enemies if you die. </p><p>Each open zone has a number of sidequests, with a majority of their objectives placed close to one another, making it easy to finish them all in quick succession and encouraging you to handle them as they pop up. There are a few exceptions to this rule: One quest had me scaling a mountain to find the daughter of an NPC who was unable to make the climb for their annual meetup, while another had me searching a mine for a worker that had gone missing. Many of the sidequests were simple yet enjoyable and often had twists, like a knight who offered to take his army and vacate their outpost if I defeated him in combat without using my gunpowder-based weapons – when I broke that rule during our duel, all bets were off. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3>Games where you kill God(s)</h3></p></div><p>Placed around the world are also various notes and signs that have a glow effect to let you know they can be collected, which are primarily in places you will visit when completing quests and offer varying degrees of insight into the world. There are also about 30 flags hanging across the first two zones that you can destroy for a Reputation reward, as well as a collectible when you’ve destroyed all of them in a zone. Compared to other RPGs, this relatively trim list of extras was a breath of fresh air since I didn’t have to worry about collecting hundreds of objects, baubles, or other collectibles, ultimately making me want to explore its world even more. </p><p>There is also a very fast and simple minigame called Sebo that is played by moving coins on a board to form a triangle within a limited number of turns while an opponent attempts to block you. These Tic-Tac-Toe-like matches rarely last more than two minutes each, and with every victory the amount of Reputation you earn increases, making strings of wins pay off bigtime. There is a bit of depth added as you progress in that boards and the starting locations of coins change, and new strategies form by finding special coins hidden in wells throughout the world that could offer the ability to swap coin locations, jump over coins, or form barricades to prevent movement. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>While the early hours are a bit rough, Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn is one of those soulslikes that only gets better as you get further in, unlocking more of the interesting skills that allow you to fully take advantage of its attack chains and XP multipliers. However, you’ll need to want to head off the beaten path to tackle sidequests, find optional fights, or interact with various NPCs to earn weapons and upgrades in order to get the most out of it. Thankfully, Flintlock respects your time while doing so with its use of shortcuts, fast travel, and other ways of making exploring fun and easy. It may have an abridged run time compared to other RPGs, but it makes good use of that time with interesting sidequests and an excellent minigame. Unfortunately, Flintlock’s story meanders a bit towards the middle and wastes a few opportunities that could have let its main characters shine, but this adventure did leave me interested to find out where Nor and Enki will go next. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/streets-of-rogue-2s-chaotic-open-world-sequel-delayed-from-august-until-october<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>It was just last month that we reported on Streets Of Rogue 2's early access release date, then planned <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/do-a-drive-by-shooting-from-the-back-of-a-bear-in-streets-of-rogue-2-this-summer">for the middle of August</a>. Alas, the streets of video game development are meaner than first thought, and its release date has now slipped until October 22nd.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The reason for the delay? "I, uh.... couldn't program quite fast enough," says developer Matt Dabrowski <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/512900/view/4354501493553620254">in the announcement</a>.
</p>
<p>"While SoR 2 has had a few more folks working on it than its predecessor, I’m still the sole programmer/designer of this thing. Compared with other disciplines, programmers are notoriously bad at predicting how long a given task will take. Now replace 'task' with 'entire Early Access-ready game,' and as you can probably imagine, guesstimating correctly gets a tad trickier." 
</p>
<p>Pushing the release date later will allow Dabrowski and co to run a "large-scale pre-release playtest", which will be free for anyone to join. That's pencilled into the schedule for sometime in late August or early September.
</p>
<p>I've spent a decent amount of time in the first Streets Of Rogue, getting up to co-op mischief with a pal. The sequel is aiming for a maximalist expansion of the same kind of systemic chaos, swapping levels of modest size for a procedurally generated open world containing cities, islands, forests, caves, and driveable vehicles you can use to smash the aforementioned to bits. Assuming I can still wreak havoc as a vampire or zombie, I'll be happy.</p>

            I confess that 2018's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-speed-freeks">Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks</a> is a corner of the grim dark far future with which I'm unfamiliar, but it turns out it's an Orky death rally. Its video game adaptation, meanwhile, is a free-to-play, multiplayer, with several team-based modes. It now has an Early Access release date: August 6th.

<p>Speed Freeks has several modes, including Kill Konvoy, in which two 8-player teams compete to speed along their teams Stompa and slow their enemy's. A stompa is what it sounds like. There's also Deff Rally, where teams of 8 drive and fight to capture points. I hope there's at least one mode that is about, y'know, normal racing, but it's unclear from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2078450/Warhammer_40000_Speed_Freeks/">Steam page</a> whether "Intense Racing" is a proper noun.
</p>
<p>There have been open alphas and open betas for the game already, but Speed Freeks will launch in Early Access and spend a few months there, launching in full later this year. The final version will add a "new map, new vehicle, new features and enhancements," and it'll still be free-to-play.
</p>
<p>If you're looking for an avenue of commerce here, I'm guessing it runs through the vehicle customisation. Kits, rims, tires, and of course paint jobs can all be modified, while real money can be spent on virtual currency you can exchange for in-game items. 
</p>
<p>Has there ever been a truly great game about vehicle combat? One where the combat involves projectile weapons, not playing bumper cars, I mean? I'd argue cars are an awkward steed to ride into battle, but what do I know. I prefer Split/Second to Blur, so I'm immediately thrown through the front windscreen of this discussion.</p>

There’s something about a wave going “whoosh” that makes my brain go “brr.” While you all studied the blade, I studied the cresting of waves in <em>Sea of Thieves</em>. While you all racked up killstreaks in <em>Call of Duty</em>, I was racking up laps in the swimming pool on top of that one building in <em>Uncharted 2</em>. You know the one. And now that <em>No Man’s Sky </em>is stepping up its water game, I’m about to be studying alien waters like it’s my goddamn job.</p><p>There’s something about the fact that the sea, in all its mystifying expansiveness, can be captured by games now. Due to that, <em>No Man’s Sky’s </em>once-placid waters have come to life, and its immense universe feels <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/no-man-sky-worlds-5-0-patch-art-graphics-ps5-sale-1851596991&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/no-man-sky-worlds-5-0-patch-art-graphics-ps5-sale-1851596991">even bigger and more vibrant now</a></span>. Thanks to its 5.0 update, oceans now sway more realistically and generate waves. They have reflections and react to your ship skidding just above the surface, as well as to weather. You can now land in water, which makes it all that easier to dive in and explore the depths of the ocean, which was the subject of a past update to <em>No Man’s Sky</em>.<br></p><p>I’ve been fascinated by video game water for as long as I can remember. Since the moment I first drowned in games like <em>Sly Cooper </em>or <em>Grand Theft Auto 3</em>, they’ve been a point of fascination. Maybe it’s because I was taken with the beach as a kid, and loved to swim, or more appropriately, loved to ride on my grandmother’s back and pretend I was swimming. Perhaps it felt odd that games couldn’t reflect this pastime I loved so much. Either way, I loved trying to swim in games, especially when bodies of water felt like a boundary that I wanted to push on.</p><p>These days, the ability to traverse water is far more commonplace in games. As such, the impetus behind water in games has shifted. Whereas they used to be a boundary to stop you from doing something that wasn’t technically possible, bodies of water are now vehicles for incredible technical showcases. They now exemplify what <em>is </em>possible.</p><p><em>No Man’s Sky </em>now feels real. Watching the waves be tugged on by storms makes it feel expressive. <em>No Man’s Sky </em>now houses a universe worth exploring if only to see how wave patterns vary depending on the environment and time of day. The ocean has now become another way to measure how unique and grand an experiment <em>No Man’s Sky </em>is, and folks, I think I hear its siren calls. If this is what we can expect from <em>Light No Fire</em>, which aims to simulate an entire world in vivid detail, I fear it may be over for me.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But for most players, tracking down and harvesting resources such as tin in <em>Once Human</em> may prove challenging and, unfortunately, confusing. </p><h2 id="h53101"><a id="need"></a>Why you need tin ore in Once Human</h2><p>Multiple crafting and construction recipes in the game require tin, with the most notable being Bronze Ingots. Bronze Ingots, in turn, are a necessary resource to craft various weapons, armor, and specific workbenches in the building menu.</p><p>And if you want to explore more of the world using a vehicle, you’ll need to find a way to refine and purify fuel for your cars and motorcycles. For a Fuel Refinery, you require Bronze Ingots.</p><p>It’s a never-ending cycle of resources converting into other resources for more valuable workbenches and production facilities.</p><p>So, where are the best places to find tin in <em>Once Human</em>? It’s time to take to the hills.</p><h2 id="h53102"><a id="find"></a>Where to find tin in Once Human<br></h2><figure id="" data-id="f1b312714dfec9ce9762f72557e2f936" data-recommend-id="image://f1b312714dfec9ce9762f72557e2f936" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A map shows the location of a specific area." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A map shows the location of a specific area." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Starry Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f1b312714dfec9ce9762f72557e2f936" data-recommend-id="image://f1b312714dfec9ce9762f72557e2f936" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A map shows the location of a specific area." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The best spot to farm tin in abundance in <em>Once Human</em> is in and around<strong> the region of Broken Delta, southwest of Deadsville</strong>. It’s the zone where you’ll find Meyer’s Market.</p><p>If you leave the main gate and head up the road over the bridge outside of Meyer’s Market, just near the train tracks to the northeast, you’ll find numerous tin ore nodes on a hillside.</p><figure id="" data-id="7c1a95eb0f83b051f31dc1d3fa45f14d" data-recommend-id="image://7c1a95eb0f83b051f31dc1d3fa45f14d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two mounds of Tin sit on the grass." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two mounds of Tin sit on the grass." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Insert a snarky mathematician’s voice: “That is one big pile of Tin”<br></figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Starry Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7c1a95eb0f83b051f31dc1d3fa45f14d" data-recommend-id="image://7c1a95eb0f83b051f31dc1d3fa45f14d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two mounds of Tin sit on the grass." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You won’t have to look too hard, though. The entire zone of Broken Delta is littered with tin ore nodes, especially if you look on hillsides, where they tend to spawn most frequently.</p><h2 id="h53103"><a id="farm"></a> How to farm tin ore (and get a copper pickaxe)<br></h2><p>But your initial pickaxe isn’t enough to farm tin ore in <em>Once Human</em>. You must upgrade it!</p><p><strong>For tin, you’ll need to secure a copper pickaxe</strong>, which stems from the Copper Pickaxes Memetics, under the Infrastructure technology tree. It’s an early-game tech, easily unlocked with a single Meme Point.</p><p>Once you unlock the technology, visit a Supplies Workbench. You’ll need the following materials to craft your first copper pickaxe:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>5 Log</li><li>7 Copper Ingot</li><li>2 Rawhide</li></ul><p>It’s relatively cheap for its overall efficiency and use cases. But importantly, it’ll have you prepared to get to work farming as much tin as you so desire.</p><hr><p>Tin is just one of the many resources in <em>Once Human</em> that appear unimportant until you realize the ore feeds into most other crafting mechanics in the game. As such, you’ll want an abundant supply back at your base!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
