The new remaster is set to update some of the textures, improve the lighting, and even add a new flashlight option, too. That all sounds good, and I’m excited to see yet another old <em>Star Wars</em> game brought to more modern platforms. However, seeing <em>Bounty Hunter </em>get the remaster treatment made me think about <em>Obi-Wan</em> on Xbox, a game that launched just a year before<em> Bounty Hunter </em>that’s still trapped on the original Xbox console over 20 years after its release. </p><p>In 2001, two years after the release of <em>Star Wars: The Phantom Menace</em>, Lucasarts released <em>Star Wars: Obi-Wan</em> as an exclusive game for the Xbox. This third-person action game starred, you guessed it, Obi-Wan Kenobi and was both a prequel to and retelling of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-episode-1-phantom-menace-25th-anniversary-1851489367&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-episode-1-phantom-menace-25th-anniversary-1851489367"><em>Phantom Menace</em> film</a></span>. </p><p>It’s not a great game, to be clear. But it featured some interesting ideas—like using the right stick for lightsaber combat—and offered a fun way to experience the first <em>Star Wars</em> prequel before<em> Attack of the Clones</em> hit theaters in 2002. Besides, it’s not like<em> Bounty Hunter</em> is an incredible video game, either. Yet it’s getting a new remaster (after being released on PS4 as a PS2 classic already), while <em>Obi-Wan </em>on Xbox is left behind. </p><h2 id="h3875"><a id=""></a>How to play Star Wars: Obi-Wan in 2024</h2><p><em>Star Wars: Obi-Wan</em> never got a PC port, was never released on PS2, and has never been updated to support backward compatibility on Xbox One or Series X/S. If you want to play Obi-Wan you have one good option and one bad option. </p><p>The good option: You go buy an OG Xbox and a copy of <em>Obi-Wan</em>. Set it up and there you go, you’re playing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Obi-Wan&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Obi-Wan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Star Wars: Obi-Wan</em></a></span>. Well, that’s assuming the Xbox you bought works properly and the copy of the game you got isn’t too damaged. (Luckily pre-owned copies of the game aren’t very expensive, so if you have to buy two of them it won’t break the bank.)</p><p>The bad option is emulation. I love emulating games! I’m not against it at all and I think fan-developed emulators are an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/so-called-pirates-are-doing-the-work-when-publishers-fa-1846533244&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/so-called-pirates-are-doing-the-work-when-publishers-fa-1846533244">important part of game preservation</a></span>. So when I say emulating <em>Obi-Wan</em> is bad, I want to be clear that it’s not because I’m against playing old games using third-party software. No, playing <em>Obi-Wan </em>on an Xbox emulator is bad because it sucks and is (as of this writing) not a great experience. </p><p>If you play on CXBX-Reloaded, a fan-made Xbox emulator, you might be able to make it through the game, but many players have reported crashes, graphical bugs, and other problems that spoil the experience. I’ve also tried to play Obi-Wan on XEMU, a different Xbox emulator, and had even worse luck—I couldn’t get past the second level. While some players have been able to tinker enough to get <em>Obi-Wan </em>running well on CXBX, it’s still not an ideal way to play the game. </p><h2 id="h3876"><a id=""></a>Help me Lucasfilm Games, you’re my only hope</h2><p>So now, here’s my plea: Someone at Lucasfilm Games, please contact Nightdive Studios, Aspyr, or another developer that’s good at reviving old games and pay them the money to bring <em>Star Wars: Obi-Wan </em>to more platforms. </p><p>Cleaned up and running at 60FPS, <em>Obi-Wan </em>would be a solid hit on consoles like the Switch. Plus the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-anakin-skywalker-hayden-christensen-ahsoka-1850403820&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-anakin-skywalker-hayden-christensen-ahsoka-1850403820"><em>Star Wars</em> prequels are currently experiencing a renaissance</a></span> among fans who grew up watching the films. Excitement for prequel-era content is at an all-time high in 2024 and I think a well-done <em>Obi-Wan</em> port or remaster would be a slam dunk. </p><p>And if that’s not possible, at the very least it would be nice to get the game ported to PC so fans can keep updating it and modding it easily for years to come. Or someone at Xbox flip the switch and make this thing backwards compatible on Xbox One and Series X/S consoles. I’d take that at this point! </p><p>But what I really want is a nice remaster. It would save a part of video game history and rescue a <em>Star Wars</em> game from being forgotten. It’s really a win-win situation and it’s about time Obi-Wan gets the remaster he deserves. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/developers-of-digital-ttrpg-fablecraft-announce-homebrew-tools</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/developers-of-digital-ttrpg-fablecraft-announce-homebrew-tools.916539/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/developers-of-digital-ttrpg-fablecraft-announce-homebrew-tools<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last year, developer Riftweaver announced <em>Fablecraft</em> will be coming to Early Access on Steam. It is sold as a virtual tabletop TTRPG set in an original fantasy world built into a VTT platform. Now, the developer has announced that <em>Fablecraft</em> homebrew tools are in development.</p>
<h2>The <em>Fablecraft</em> Homebrew Tool Announcement</h2>
<p>The announcement of <em>Fablecraft</em> homebrew tools came in an update post on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2176900/view/4254294498781880878">Steam page</a>. In the post, Riftweaver discussed the tools currently in development alongside quality-of-life improvements to the overall game experience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fablecraft-homebrew-music-preview.jpg?itok=-8OSCZs0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fablecraft-homebrew-music-preview.jpg?itok=YjHzWmS9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lot of bases being covered with this.</figcaption></figure><p>The post confirms the first of the <em>Fablecraft</em> homebrew tools will be homebrew music and soundscapes. As the name implies, this feature will allow GMs to upload custom music and sound effects to their game. This custom audio must be in MP3 format and can be up to 20 MB in size. Once uploaded, the tracks can be played from the Jukebox alongside official material.</p>
<p>Riftweaver also confirmed that homebrew battlemap support is coming. The post does mention this feature may not be available during <em>Fablecraft's</em> initial Early Access release, but it will be in active development. The tools will allow the upload of images, as well as walls, terrain, and measurement tools.</p>
<p>The post also hints the developers are working on tools to import battlemaps from third-party applications.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fablecraft-homebrew-battlemap-preview.jpg?itok=fArYvi3a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fablecraft-homebrew-battlemap-preview.jpg?itok=CI9163kz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Needs more gelatinous cubes, but its progress.</figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, the post discusses quality-of-life improvements coming to <em>Fablecraft's</em> Turn Tracker. It's a minor UX change for combat. When it's your turn and you don't immediately act, the tracker and your player token will flash; letting you know it is your turn to move. The tracker will also flash if the GM has paused combat.</p>
<p>Finally, the new update lets players scroll through the initiative order in the Turn Tracker. Just use your mouse wheel to see where you stand each round.</p>
<p><em>Fablecraft</em> will be available on Steam Early Access sometime this summer.</p>

It’s got us thinking, who are the best characters in each <em>Dragon Age</em> game? Rather than creating an unwieldy list of 30+ characters spanning the entire series thus far, we decided to break them up between games.

One will die in the opening with almost no ceremony, The other will get sidelined around ten hours in. Bethany, Hawke’s mage sister, easily gets the worst hand out of the two. She gets dragged away by the Circle in one route, becomes a Grey Warden in another, or she dies. Carver, Hawke’s warrior brother, has a similar setup, but he at least has some autonomy and drama in his branching paths. Bethany, meanwhile, is pretty much dragged through the story, with BioWare separating or killing every member of a family in a game ostensibly about familial ties.

Sure, he’s got his own storyline, struggling between whether or not he wants to be the ruler of Starkhaven as the brutal murder of his family has left him  the only living heir. But beyond that, he mostly sways in the background of the main plot, being unwaveringly devout to the church and casting judgment upon others. His biggest contributions are his companion quest, which gives returning companion Leliana a chance to appear, and when he threatens to level the entirety of the city of Kirkwall if you don’t kill a terrorist. Which like, good for standing on your principles, king. But I barely know you. You’re the tagalong friend who awkwardly weighs in from the outskirts of the circle as everyone else is chatting. Go away!<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7e3980cbab0068453bec41315ed4c647" data-recommend-id="image://7e3980cbab0068453bec41315ed4c647" data-format="jpg" data-width="1360" data-height="768" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Carver stands next to Meredith." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Carver stands next to Meredith." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Dragon Age Wiki</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7e3980cbab0068453bec41315ed4c647" data-recommend-id="image://7e3980cbab0068453bec41315ed4c647" data-format="jpg" data-width="1360" data-height="768" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Carver stands next to Meredith." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Carver suffers from most of the same problems Bethany does, but his equivalent to her Circle route is what gives him the upper hand. If you choose to leave him behind on the Deep Roads expedition in <em>Dragon Age 2</em>’s first act, he will choose to join the church’s mage-oppressive military outfit, the Templars. He does this as an act of defiance against his older sibling and it plays into the tension developed throughout the first chunk of the game. After that, he is gone for most of the game much like Bethany, only showing up during climactic moments like a glorified cameo. It’s a shame.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7c3a5a26abd413efa5d3a0c6e71edb03" data-recommend-id="image://7c3a5a26abd413efa5d3a0c6e71edb03" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Anders stands in front of Karl with his eyes glowing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Anders stands in front of Karl with his eyes glowing." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Dragon Age Wiki</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7c3a5a26abd413efa5d3a0c6e71edb03" data-recommend-id="image://7c3a5a26abd413efa5d3a0c6e71edb03" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Anders stands in front of Karl with his eyes glowing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The only returning companion from <em>Dragon Age: Origins </em>is inarguably the most impactful in <em>Dragon Age 2</em>. Anders is a far cry from the wisecracking apostate we met in the <em>Awakening </em>expansion—he’s now a tortured radical after being possessed by the spirit of Justice. He becomes a healer in the city of Kirkwall, growing more and more fanatical as the game goes on and he watches injustice unfold against the mages. Eventually, whether by his own fanaticism or the spirit’s influence, Anders blows up the Kirkwall Chantry, sparking a mage rebellion that changes the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe forever.</p><p>All of that makes him a compelling but divisive character. People love Anders for his tragic angst as much as others hate him for being a terrorist. In most versions of his story, I fall into the former camp. But Anders’ rivalry path, in which you can convince him to turn on and murder the mages he just sought to free, remains one of the most baffling and cowardly decisions BioWare has ever made with the <em>Dragon Age </em>franchise. It technically works within the game’s friendship and rivalry system, in which you can have a friendly or adversarial relationship with your party that can challenge their worldview, but it’s also such an irresponsible moment that is, sadly, par for the course with how <em>Dragon Age </em>tends to “both sides” issues of oppression. As the face of this conflict in <em>Dragon Age</em>, Anders inevitably has to bear the baggage of a series that has never wanted to take a side and failed to make a case for both arguments. And it undermines him and the story of <em>Dragon Age 2</em> in the end.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d367db14a335aad6455a598f6fac6a51" data-recommend-id="image://d367db14a335aad6455a598f6fac6a51" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Varric stands with his titties out in the Hanged Man." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Varric stands with his titties out in the Hanged Man." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Dragon Age Wiki</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d367db14a335aad6455a598f6fac6a51" data-recommend-id="image://d367db14a335aad6455a598f6fac6a51" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Varric stands with his titties out in the Hanged Man." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Good ol’ Varric Tethras’ debut established him as a fan favorite and acted as a springboard for him to be one of the longest-running characters in BioWare’s fantasy series. The dwarven storyteller starts out as a humble businessman looking for a business partner only to get dragged into unprecedented times as the city of Kirkwall becomes a center point for worldwide change. Varric’s ties to the city run deep, but as he becomes estranged with his family, he finds a new one in Hawke and the others. In the end, he’s left alone as the others flee the city, and he stays behind to tell their story to anyone who will listen. It’s funny to think about how what he has to deal with here is like child’s play compared to the places he would go in <em>Inquisition </em>and will go in <em>The Veilguard</em>. But his greatness has small beginnings, and he’s only become greater since we met him as Hawke in <em>Dragon Age 2</em>.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="08bfbe9dcfcd9b923ffc599d1ae301e8" data-recommend-id="image://08bfbe9dcfcd9b923ffc599d1ae301e8" data-format="jpg" data-width="900" data-height="506" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Fenris strikes an enemy down with his sword.

He’s been made into a living weapon at the behest of his mage master, and lost his family, memory, and almost all of his sense of self before escaping to Kirkwall. It’s only natural he’s dismissive and untrusting of mages. If you press him on this, he comes to see the issues with lumping every mage into the same pile as the slavers he knew in Tevinter. Fenris is one of the best examples of how <em>Dragon Age 2</em>’s friendships and rivalries can diverge in life-altering ways, and the delicious angst that comes with romancing him as rival mage Hawke is unmatched. He operates on an extreme in a game that sometimes has trouble dealing with the nuances of the conflict it centers on, but his relationship is most rewarding when you try to help him see the gray in between the black and white.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ca570dcd0d3638367c8443472bdf1472" data-recommend-id="image://ca570dcd0d3638367c8443472bdf1472" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aveline holds her sword with a distressed expression." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aveline holds her sword with a distressed expression." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Dragon Age Wiki</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ca570dcd0d3638367c8443472bdf1472" data-recommend-id="image://ca570dcd0d3638367c8443472bdf1472" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aveline holds her sword with a distressed expression." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Kirkwall’s Captain of the Guard is probably the most grounded of <em>Dragon Age 2</em>’s companions. She’s not a radical mage, a swash-buckling pirate on the lookout for her next adventure, or a blood mage consorting with a demon. Aveline’s just a woman trying to get by and comfortably sleep at night. She starts as a member of the City Guard before her sense of honesty kicks in and she uncovers corruption in her ranks, leading to her ascending to the role of Captain. But even as she climbs the ladder of city defense, her story doesn’t escalate in scale, instead staying endearing and lowkey. Some of the most memorable moments in <em>Dragon Age 2</em> are the quiet ones away from all the political strife, and Aveline’s painfully awkward attempt at courting her husband-to-be remains an incredible sequence that perfectly pulls off how even the strongest among us can be as vulnerable and clumsy as anyone else. She is a woman of multitudes, the beating heart of Hawke’s team, and a shining beacon for the idea of using what time you have in this life to do right by others.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e068ed121e2d35cfc97f1ee9fa14b562" data-recommend-id="image://e068ed121e2d35cfc97f1ee9fa14b562" data-format="jpg" data-width="3200" data-height="1800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Isabela holds a dagger in bed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Isabela holds a dagger in bed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Dragon Age Wiki</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e068ed121e2d35cfc97f1ee9fa14b562" data-recommend-id="image://e068ed121e2d35cfc97f1ee9fa14b562" data-format="jpg" data-width="3200" data-height="1800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Isabela holds a dagger in bed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Conversely, Isabela starts out as a scheming pirate who is so cool you want to be like her when you grow up. The rogue is cunning, promiscuous, and a bit brash, but she is also one of the series’ best-written companions.

Then you have to fight for her life (or give her up, if you’re a bastard) and it’s all very romantic. While Isabela is technically an optional companion in <em>Dragon Age 2</em>, her actions play a big part in the setup for the political turmoil happening in Kirkwall. When she’s not there, her absence is felt, and when she is there, she makes sure everyone knows she’s the star of the show. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="91fa709745775ff1d0e3dfaebb5cae32" data-recommend-id="image://91fa709745775ff1d0e3dfaebb5cae32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1366" data-height="768" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Merrill sits at a table with candles lit and a book in front of her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Merrill sits at a table with candles lit and a book in front of her." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Dragon Age Wiki</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="91fa709745775ff1d0e3dfaebb5cae32" data-recommend-id="image://91fa709745775ff1d0e3dfaebb5cae32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1366" data-height="768" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Merrill sits at a table with candles lit and a book in front of her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Across BioWare’s catalog, there probably isn’t a character with more emotional range than Merrill, the Dalish blood mage. When Hawke first meets her, she seems young and innocent, but it becomes clear she’s viewed in contempt by her elven clan. It becomes clear shortly after that she has been working with a demon and using the much-reviled blood magic. Even as she casts spells that would be taboo elsewhere in the world, she is still somehow one of the most light-hearted and humorous characters in the entire series. Merrill is the sweetest character in Hawke’s crew, even as she is berated by just about everyone else for her “crimes” of using blood magic. Though it would be easy to make her come off like an abused puppy, she is steadfast in her decisions, as she believes she can use this magic for the good of the Dalish people by restoring a piece of their history.</p><p>Merrill’s conviction leads her and those around her down devastating paths, and her story is one of the most frustratingly complex situations Hawke deals with in their story because every decision and outcome feels painful for everyone involved. Ultimately there is no happy ending for someone who consorts with demons, nor for people who distrusted her so much that they couldn’t let her face the consequences. But Merrill is subversive, tragic, and somehow, still a joy to know.</p><hr><p><em>Dragon Age 2</em> was always the most divisive game in BioWare’s fantasy series, but <em>The Veilguard </em>seems to draw pretty heavily from it. It has an action-oriented approach, brings back <em>DA2</em>’s three-route dialogue system, and slims down the party. Overall, it looks like it’s learning some of the right lessons from the 2011 RPG. We’ll see if its characters live up to this merry band of misfits when <em>The Veilguard </em>launches this fall.<br></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you’re a fan of eSports, there’s nothing quite like the frantic, chaotic gameplay witnessed during a Call of Duty League Championship. A handful of top-tier teams go head-to-head for the crown, but only one can win the championship. Here are what teams we’ll see at the Call of Duty League Championship 2024!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-teams-are-playing-in-the-call-of-duty-league-championship">What Teams Are Playing in the Call of Duty League Championship?</h2>



<p>Currently, there are eight pro eSports teams participating in the Call of Duty League Championship 2024, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Faze</li>



<li>Heretics</li>



<li>Subliners</li>



<li>Surge</li>



<li>Ultra</li>



<li>Thieves</li>



<li>Optic</li>



<li>Guerrillas</li>
</ul>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>We should note that Subliners, hailing from New York, previously won the Call of Duty League 2024 Major 4, making them a top contender and leading choice for this recent Championship tournament.</p>

<h2 id="h-where-to-watch-call-of-duty-league-championships">Where to Watch Call of Duty League Championships</h2>



<p>Being eSports, of course, this is a rather exclusive event. You can’t just watch the entire match live on YouTube or Twitch—at least not straight away. If you want to see the action live as it unfolds, you must first the <a href="https://callofdutyleague.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty League website</a>, where you can purchase tickets to watch the Championship Weekend 2024 as it happens.</p>



<p>From the official tournament website, you can purchase tickets to watch the entire match live from the Credit Union of Texas Events Center in Allen, Texas. There will also be a number of watch parties where you can watch the event live from the comfort of your home.</p>



<p>Of course, the official Call of Duty YouTube channel often co-streams the entire event. It’s much easier and more accessible that way!</p>

<p>While you watch eSports on one screen, why not play <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-the-first-descendant-multiplayer-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Descendant multiplayer</a> on the other?

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree DLC Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">When Shadow of the Erdtree launched last month, the mod wasn't available because much of the game had changed. Yui needed to ensure that the mod would be the latest build of the game. Now, co-op saves made with the mod can be taken into the expansion, and for the first time ever, it now supports invasions. Players can even fight the Evergaol bosses together now.</p><p dir="ltr">The same moderator shared another message on behalf of Yui on how the new Scadutree Fragment won't affect those using the mod.</p><p dir="ltr">"The DLC has added many new mechanics, interesting edge cases and underlying code changes⁠--some of which would seem mundane to the player⁠--but have required new solutions for them to work correctly," The moderator said. "Fortunately, the Scadutree Fragments and Revered Spirit Ashes are very much localized and do not require any special synchronization."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510" rel="nofollow ">Click here</a> to download the seamless co-op mod. However, it is worth mentioning that even though the mod is live, it still has some issues, including not carrying important files. If that happens, users may have to redownload it from<a href="https://github.com/LukeYui/EldenRingSeamlessCoopRelease/releases/tag/v1.7.2" rel="nofollow "> Yui's Github page</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">For more Elden Ring news, check out<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/george-r-r-martin-offers-cheeky-response-to-elden-ring-film-rumors/1100-6524609/"> our story detailing George R.R.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grab-3-months-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-for-under-35-at-woot.916500/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/deals/2024/7/1/24190165/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-pc-deal-sale-woot<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="pIwII5">For existing <a href="https://www.polygon.com/best-games/22372750/best-game-pass-games-xbox">Xbox Game Pass subscribers</a> and newcomers alike, Woot has a deal that will get you over 20% off the usual price. Now through the end of the month — or “until sold out,” per Woot’s page — you can pick up <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836599-13142092?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fdigital-code-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836599-13142092?sid=___pl__p_23954206__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026url=https://electronics.woot.com/offers/digital-code-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-1&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:64,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;sid&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;sid&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23954206__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://electronics.woot.com/offers/digital-code-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-1&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> for $34.49 (23% off the $44.99 list price) or one month for $11.79 (saving 21% off the usual $14.99 price). </p>
<p id="iF5O14">If you wanted to stock up for a full year (ie. buying four three-month codes) that’d set you back around $138, which in turns saves around $42 from the usual price. Put another way, that’s buying 12 months of Game Pass Ultimate for the cost of nine months. Note that there’s a limit of 24 codes per customer, so for those that want to go <em>all out</em>, you can enjoy a discounted Game Pass membership from now until July 2030. Maybe that’s overkill, but we’re not ones to judge.</p>

<p id="a9LhQf">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is the top tier of Microsoft’s games subscription service, which allows you unlimited access to a very, very large catalog of games on both Xbox and Windows PC, as well as discounts on titles you want to add to your permanent collection. The Ultimate tier also offers EA Play membership for a selection of that publishers’ catalog, including trials of select games for up to 10 hours each, and access to Xbox Cloud Gaming — perfect for when you’d rather just jump into a game without waiting for a download. Also great if you’d rather play on a not-Xbox device, including mobile and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24187316/xbox-amazon-fire-tv-partnership">(soon) a Fire TV stick</a>.</p>

Looking ahead, you can also check out our recap of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24172090/microsoft-xbox-showcase-june-2024-announcement-reveal">everything announced at the Xbox showcase at Summer Game Fest 2024</a> (Spoiler: Lots of “day one on Game Pass” titles, including <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24174798/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-cod-direct"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24171213/doom-dark-ages-microsoft-xbox-games-showcase-sequel"><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></a>).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/let-me-solo-her-beats-erdtree-final-boss<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Holy crap, my fingers are actually trembling"</h2></div><section><p>The Elden Ring community's favorite folk hero, Let Me Solo Her, has finally completed the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, after a streaming marathon spanning multiple days during which he struggled repeatedly against the DLC's final boss.</p><p><strong>Warning: Spoilers for the ending of Shadow of the Erdtree follow below!</strong></p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Final boss is kicking my butt rn <a href="https://t.co/nf4htyip9T" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/nf4htyip9T</a></p>— Let me solo her (@TsuboiKlein) <a href="https://twitter.com/TsuboiKlein/status/1806845328932454784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 29, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Tsuboi Klein, also known as Let Me Solo Her, has been steadily working his way through the new Elden Ring DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree with the rest of us. Just yesterday, he finally crossed the finish line, defeating Promised Consort Radahn <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHhR8K2g3No" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">live on stream</a> after something in the vicinity of 74 attempts. Despite being thought of as something of an Elden Ring expert, Let Me Solo Her really struggled with the second coming of Radahn, only defeating him after several hours of attempts spaced out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsn2dDyfVUA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over two days</a>. </p><p>"Holy crap, my fingers are actually trembling right now," he said upon victory. "I'm shaking."</p><p>Let Me Solo Her rose to notoriety by offering his summon sign to players struggling to beat the most difficult boss in the base game, Malenia. Wearing nothing more than a pot on his head, Let Me Solo Her has defeated Malenia hundreds of times now on behalf of others. While it might be natural to expect him to breeze through the DLC with skills like that, it's worth noting that Let Me Solo Her got so good at Malenia by practicing her fight <em>a lot</em>. It took him over 200 attempts just to beat her the first time. So it's only natural he'd get good at Radahn with practice, too. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>So is Let Me Solo Her going to master Radahn and help others defeat him now? Probably not just yet. Let Me Solo Her acknowledged at the end of his stream that he had somewhat beelined his way to Radahn and hadn't finished a lot of the other DLC boss fights, so he wants to go back and wrap things up first. He also wants to enjoy the DLC a bit off-stream, too, just for himself. Additionally, he's already been <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-rings-let-me-solo-her-is-now-let-me-solo-him-with-dire-consequences-for-messmer-the-impaler">spending his time helping others beat Messmer</a>, another story-required boss fight that many are struggling with. He's even technically rebranded as "Let Me Solo Him" just for that fight. Let Me Solo Her will continue to assist other players with Messmer for a bit longer, he says, before moving on to helping people with Radahn.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I BEAT THE FINAL BOSS LET'S GOOOOOOOOOO <a href="https://t.co/XUxVmAUitB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/XUxVmAUitB</a></p>— Let me solo her (@TsuboiKlein) <a href="https://twitter.com/TsuboiKlein/status/1807193376594534652?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 29, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>We <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/let-me-solo-her-elden-ring-community-hero">interviewed Let Me Solo Her</a> two years ago during the height of his fame, and can confirm that he's delightful not just in battle against Malenia and Radahn, but also to speak with. And we <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-hero-let-me-solo-erdtree-dlc-reaction-malenia">caught up with him again</a> ahead of the release of Shadow of the Erdtree to hear his plans for exploring the Land of Shadow.

According to Monaghan, while he played some games from time to time as a kid, it wasn’t something he cared much about, instead preferred to play outside or act on stage. But then he moved to Los Angeles in 2002,3 and a faithful conversation with fellow <em>Lord of the Rings</em> star Elijah Wood changed everything.  </p><p>“I said to my friend Elijah Wood, it sounds like I’m terribly name-dropping right now, I said I’m going to go buy a DVD player, you want to come with me,” said Monaghan. “And Elijah’s like, you should buy PlayStation 2. So I was like all right fine,  but I’m just only going to watch <em>The Sopranos</em> on it and I’m only going to watch this and that and <em>Oz </em>and all these kinds of things. He’s like fine.”</p><p> But then a friend of his brought over a copy of <em>Grand Theft Auto 3</em>, Rockstar’s incredibly popular and controversial open-world action game set in Liberty City. And according to Monaghan, he could not “believe that games” had got this advanced. <br></p><p> “I love little things about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-3-rockstar-games-jak-ii-simpsons-hit-and-run-1851217338&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-3-rockstar-games-jak-ii-simpsons-hit-and-run-1851217338"><em>GTA 3</em></a></span><em>, </em>like you can steal any car as opposed to there are certain cars that show you that they’re stealable,” explained the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> actor. “I got really good or I felt like I got really good at driving. You get to that point where everything starts to go really fast. I kind of enjoyed that. But I think [<em>GTA 3 </em>on PS2] was the big turnaround for me where I was like, oh I didn’t realize that games have now got to this point.” </p><p>“The leap was just extraordinary and you know the soundtrack is incredible. All the options were incredible,” said Monaghan. The actor further explained that since then he now includes games as part of his entertainment options alongside movies and TV shows. </p><p>As for the most recent entry in the franchise, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-v-the-kotaku-review-1324730770&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-v-the-kotaku-review-1324730770">2013's <em>GTA V</em></a></span>, Monaghan has played the game and enjoyed it, even if he felt like Michael—one of the three main playable characters in that installment—was a bit “obnoxious.” He also sometimes enjoyed playing as Trevor, but admitted that he sometimes felt “dirty” after stepping into the lunatic’s shoes, saying he felt like he “needed a shower” afterward. </p><p>As for his all-time favorite gaming experience, it’s not <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-iii-made-just-vibing-in-its-world-incredible-1847929103&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-iii-made-just-vibing-in-its-world-incredible-1847929103"><em>GTA 3</em></a></span><em> </em>but instead <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-the-kotaku-review-5860518&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-the-kotaku-review-5860518">The <em>Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.</em></a></span> According to Monaghan, he put around 350 hours into the massive open-world RPG on PS3.

That's extremely evident in the character creator, where players begin their journey in Veilguard. It's easily the best character creator in series history and possibly the most robust I've ever seen in a video game. From hundreds of sliders and options to customize your player-controlled Rook to the ability to pick pronouns separate from gender and more, this character creator speaks directly to the inclusivity of Veilguard – <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/06/13/a-deep-dive-into-dragon-age-the-veilguards-expansive-character-creator">read about my in-depth look at the character creator here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But that feeling doesn't end in the character creator. It also extends to the world – ice mage and private detective companion Neve Gallus has a prosthetic leg, for example – and in the way you can play Veilguard.&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>Before starting the game proper, a playstyle screen allows players to customize various options affecting how Veilguard plays. Here, you can select difficulty, or playstyle as BioWare calls it, with options like "Storyteller" for those interested more in the story versus the combat, "Adventurer" for an experience that seemingly balances story and combat, and a difficulty called Nightmare – there might be more, but this is all I see during my demo. At any point during Veilguard, you can change the game's difficulty unless you select Nightmare, which is the hardest of difficulties. That's a permanent selection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There's another difficulty option called Unbound, though, allowing players to customize their gameplay experience to their liking. You can adjust how wayfinding helps you in-game; there's aim assistance and even an auto-aim option. You can adjust combat timing to make parrying easier or harder, with a balanced, forgiving, and a third harder option. You can change how much damage your enemies do to you, and how much damage you do to enemies by adjusting their health. There's also an option to adjust enemy pressure. And, if you're not interested in death-related setbacks, there's a no-death option you can turn on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"[None of these options] are a cheat," Busche tells me. "It's an option to make sure players of all abilities can show up."&nbsp;</p>

<p>She also says players can look forward to similar accessibility and approachability options you might expect, though I'm unable to pour through Veilguard's other options to confirm exactly what's there.&nbsp;</p>

But this curiosity may turn to confusion when trying to decide between the extremely generous, no-cost <em>Free Trial </em>and the paid <em>Starter Edition</em>, which will run you $20. The <em>Free Trial</em> and <em>Starter Edition</em> of <em>FF14 </em>are two different products with several distinctions. And while the <em>Starter Edition </em>is the full version of the game with zero restrictions, there is one major drawback to purchasing it: <strong>The </strong><em><strong>Starter Edition</strong></em><strong> requires a subscription to play after 30 days.</strong> Notably, the <em>Free Trial</em> does not.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195519" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="148" data-playlist="195519,196626,195371" data-current="195519"><div><p>I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21013.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>This guide will help you weigh the pros and cons of each version and will discuss why the <em>Free Trial</em> is the way to go for brand new players.</p><h2 id="h3770"><a id=""></a></h2><h2 id="h3771"><a id="startedition101"></a>What comes with the $20 <em>FF14 Starter Edition</em>?</h2><p>For $19.99, <em>Final Fantasy 14: Starter Edition</em> includes the base game, 2013’s <em>A Realm Reborn</em>, and the first two expansions, 2015’s <em>Heavensward </em>and 2017’s <em>Stormblood.</em> This version lets you level your character up to level 70. That might seem like a no-brainer, but there is a major caveat: <strong>The </strong><em><strong>Starter Edition</strong></em><strong> only allows 30 days of play time</strong>.

So, whether it takes you one month or one year, you won’t have to spend anything until you complete the 2017 <em>Stormblood</em> expansion or hit the level cap of 70. Given the beefy content provided, you stand to save quite a bit of money going this route, all to play through the same game. Once you purchase the <em>Starter Edition your </em>account is locked out of the free trial, and into a subscription.</p><p>And if you’re on Xbox, you have an additional cost-saving benefit to choosing the free trial. Game Pass Core, which Xbox requires to play online, is needed for the paid version of <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>. However, those on the<em> Free Trial </em>bypass the Game Pass requirement and do not need any service or subscription. Since Game Pass Core starts at a monthly rate of $9.99,<em> Free Trial </em>users on Xbox are potentially saving almost $25 per month.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-xbox-open-beta-beginners-guide-1851274862&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-xbox-open-beta-beginners-guide-1851274862">A <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> Beginner’s Guide For Xbox</a></span></p><p>The <em>Free Trial</em> does have some limitations, however. These mostly concern social aspects of the game. <em>Free Trial</em> players can not join Free Companies,<em>FFXIV’s</em> versions of guilds. <strong>They also can not create a party, but are able to join one if they are sent an invite from a player who is on a paid version</strong>. The <em>Free Trial</em> also restricts trading with other players as well as sending in-game letters or participating in PVP or Ultimate Raids.

Well, if you have completed everything the <em>Free Trial </em>has to offer, and are ready to move on to the <em>Shadowbringers</em> expansion, you will need a paid version of the game (ie: the <em>Starter Edition</em>) and the new <em>Dawntrail</em> expansion. Every <em>FFXIV </em>expansion<em> </em>includes all the previous releases. With <em>Shadowbringers </em>and <em>Endwalker</em> now removed from digital storefronts, purchasing <em>Dawntrail </em>is the correct (and only way) to get caught up on the game.</p><p><em>Final Fantasy 14 </em>is one of the most popular MMOs of all time, and for good reason. Between its engrossing story, rewarding character building, and challenging dungeons, there is plenty of content to sink your teeth into. The heart of this experience is available for free as long as you avoid purchasing the<em> Starter Edition</em>. New users need to be aware of this before they even download the game. Once an account gets linked to a paid version like the <em>Starter Edition</em>, it is locked out of the free trial forever (much like this poor writer’s account).</p><p><em>FFXIV </em>players will have plenty of months where they will be paying to fuel their new and exciting hobby. So the longer those payments can be delayed, the better.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Gaming on PC opens a world of new possibilities, with players not only able to alter and change the game but also how they play it. Elden Ring, a highly acclaimed action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware, is one of the best examples of players using alt controllers to play the game, with people beating bloodthirsty bosses with a dance pad, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-streamer-brainwaves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brain waves</a>, morse code, and so much more. Interestingly, a player recently beat Shadow of the Erdtree’s final boss with just a saxophone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are living under a rock, you may have missed that some players have had a terrible time with Shadow of the Erdtree, thanks to its incredibly challenging gameplay. This accomplishment is even more commendable as beating the Elden Ring expansion’s final boss is no easy feat. </p>



<p>The man who was able to accomplish this feat is Dr. Doot, a player known for his unique approach to gaming challenges and his love for the saxophone. He has already completed a <a href="https://x.com/DrDeComposing/status/1775115963043807269" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">no-hit run on Elden Ring </a>with the same instrument.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Everyone was telling me how utterly impossible the Final Boss of Shadow of the Erdtree was going to be. Outrageous moveset, impossible dodges, etc</p><p>…</p><p>It only took me a dozen attempts on the saxophone.</p><p>THE WORLD'S FIRST (afaik) ALT CONTROLLER DLC RUN HAS BEEN DOOTED!🎷 <a href="https://t.co/nUzPmfgsNx">pic.twitter.com/nUzPmfgsNx</a></p></div>— Dr. Doot 🎷 (@DrDeComposing) <a href="https://twitter.com/DrDeComposing/status/1807715780345364850?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 1, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>If you see the video embedded above, Dr. Doot’s weapon of choice was an attacking shield, The Carian Thrusting Shield specifically. You can see how Doot uses a bunch of notes on the saxophone to parry each of Radahn’s attacks until he is finally able to vanquish him, and it is a sight to behold. </p>



<p>Doot also provided some data on the shield he used to beat Shadow of the Erdtree’s final boss. Doot scaled The Carian Thrusting Shield’s STR stat by making it heavy and used Deflect Tear along with a Guard Counter Boost talisman to make the weapon “an absolute powerhouse of a tank”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shadow of the Erdtree launched on Friday, June 21 and sold<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> 5 million copies </a>within the first three days. </p>

<p>One of the most anticipated movies of 2024 is scheduled to release this month, and it seems Call of Duty might be looking to capitalize on that hype. Deadpool and Wolverine hit theatres on July 26, and we will see the action heroes descending in Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, Warzone and Warzone Mobile.</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://dotesports.com/call-of-duty/news/cod-dataminers-think-theyve-found-evidence-of-a-mw3-deadpool-wolverine-collab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dot Esports</a>, a user called <a href="https://x.com/crashfty/status/1806747826413539737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Crashfty</a> recently posted some peculiar videos on X (formerly Twitter) reminiscent of our beloved Merc with a mouth. The videos showcase new finisher moves for Call of Duty, with stock models enacting the scenes. Interestingly, the depicted scenes show a person killing off another in a very goofy and jovial manner, something that Deadpool is very good at. On the other hand, Wolverine hasn’t been hinted at in any of the scenes.</p>

<p>Marvel collaborations are a no-brainer for games, and Fortnite is the biggest example. Moreover, the potential Deadpool and Wolverine collaboration is a significant event, as it not only sees Hugh Jackman return to put the super suit back on but will potentially help with the revival of the recently degrading Marvel Cinematic Universe. Call of Duty’s next seasonal update seems like the best window to introduce this collaboration, as it begins around the same time as the movie’s release date on July 24.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Call of Duty’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-dutys-fallout-update-goes-live-tomorrow/">Fallout update</a> went live last week. What do you think about Deadpool and Wolverine arriving in Call of Duty games? Let us know in the comments.</p>

  <p id="yugZzI">If you’re in the States, then this week is July Fourth. If you’re not in the States, then this week is just July 4 — congrats to all who get to mark the day however they are, wherever they are! No surprise, but: I think we should all celebrate by watching TV. Particularly if you’re in for anime, there’s a <em>lot</em> of premieres this week on Crunchyroll, meaning you can roll right through the long (or regular!) weekend with a blitz of new programs. </p>
<p id="Dkcuag">Here’s the best new TV premieres (and just a <em>few</em> of the anime previews) this week. </p>

<p id="IlizaR"><em>Prodigy</em> has survived cancellation (read: was in production for season 2 when it got axed by Paramount) and has jumped over to a new network (read: was subsequently picked up by Netflix). That means that if you liked what <em>Prodigy</em> was putting down in season 1, you will probably like it when it makes its way to Netflix. </p>

<p id="SkYi8h"><strong>Genre: </strong>Docuseries, sports drama<br><strong>Release date: </strong>July 2<br><strong>Cast: </strong>The players and staff of the New York Giants</p>
<p id="enGoPW">The New York Giants are entering their 100th season. It’s quite an accomplishment, but they (like all NFL teams) won’t settle for anything less than a Super Bowl slot. Will they get it? Who’s to say — but now we can at least watch what they’re saying during the offseason. </p>

<p id="nsCPWJ"><strong>Genre: </strong>Sci-fi action<br><strong>Release date: </strong>July 5, with one episode<br><strong>Studio: </strong>A-1 Pictures</p>
<p id="ffOrD3">Fans of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/12/12/16754720/nier-automata-best-games-2017"><em>Nier: Automata</em></a>, rejoice: The gorgeous anime adaptation of the hit game is finally making its return this summer with a second season following the first’s protracted and troubled development. Hopefully A-1 Pictures has ironed out all the details for this new season so we won’t be waiting <em>weeks</em> or even <em>months</em> between episodes.</p>
<p id="iNmSxy">The second “cour” (the term for a production block of anime averaging between 10 and 14 episodes) will pick up immediately after the first, with 9S having learned the shocking truth behind Project YoRHa after defeating the alien robots Adam and Eve alongside 2B. We’ll have to wait until July 5 to see just how much <em>Nier: Automata Ver1.1a</em> will diverge from the story of the original game. <em>—Toussaint Egan</em></p>

<p id="8GKeWq"><strong>Genre: </strong>Fantasy action<br><strong>Release date: </strong>July 7, with one episode<br><strong>Studio: </strong>The Answer Studio</p>
<p id="SL7UF5">There’s a (in-universe) six-year gap between seasons here, and while we’ll be following up with Bam, Rachel, and the rest of the season 1 crew — along with their rankings! — season 2 is also bringing in some new protagonists. Meet Wangnan and Jyu, who are a little more advanced in the tower’s levels than we’ve seen so far. Time to find out what new challenges this mysterious tower can bring!</p>

<p id="4YATsO"><strong>Genre: </strong>Slice-of-life comedy<br><strong>Release date: </strong>July 7, with one episode<br><strong>Studio: </strong>Wit Studio</p>
<p id="mhc8St">Based on the 2019 manga by Oshioshio, <em>My Deer Friend Nokotan</em> is a comedy that centers on the misadventures of Torako Koshi, a former “yankee” (see: delinquent) girl trying to keep up her appearance as a ideal student at her new high school. That becomes significantly more difficult after she saves Noko Shikanoko, a self-described “deer-girl hybrid” who begins to follow Torako around and get up to all sorts of shenanigans.</p>
<p id="jDdkAQ">The trailer looks ridiculous, with realistic CG depictions of deer juxtaposed with Noko’s chibi-like appearance. There’s even a cute callback to the ending of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/25/21265521/nausicaa-of-the-valley-of-the-wind-studio-ghibli-movie-watch-meaning-manga">1984’s <em>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</em></a>, with Noko being lifted above a marching herd of deer while surrounded by an aura of light. We’ll see how the actual series holds up when it premieres this weekend. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="IEjowk"><strong>Genre: </strong>Fantasy action<br><strong>Release date: </strong>July 7, with one episode<br><strong>Studio: </strong>Actas, Bandai Namco Pictures</p>
<p id="sCovAx">Based on the fantasy adventure manga by author Fujino Ōmori and illustrator Toshi Aoi, <em>Wistoria: Wand and Sword</em> centers on Will Serfort, a young student who enrolls at a prestigious magic academy with hopes of achieving his dream of becoming one of the most powerful magic users in the world. However, much like <em>My Hero Academia</em>’s Izuku Midoriya or <em>Solo Leveling</em>’s Sung Jin-woo, Will has a critical roadblock: He can’t cast even the simplest of spells to save his own life! </p>
<p id="qm3ivW">That’s not gonna stop him, though, as he descends into the dungeons beneath the school to slay vicious monsters as an alternate way to earn academic credits. He’s like <em>Naruto</em>’s Rock Lee, only instead of being terrifyingly proficient in taijutsu, he’s an absolute beast when it comes to sword fighting.</p>
<p id="HqwaBK">I’m not familiar with the source material myself, but I am intrigued by the fact that Tatsuya Yoshihara, who previously worked as the action director on 2022’s <em>Chainsaw Man</em> and the chief director on the final season of <em>Black Clover</em>, is the director on <em>Wistoria: Wand and Sword</em>. Which means, at the very least, audiences can expect some exquisite action sequences. <em>—TE</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-season-1-patch-notes-released/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Ahead of its launch on July 2, <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/xdefiant/news/39Z5ARUSNbU1QcQD0yhthI/y1s10-patch-notes">Ubisoft has released</a> the full patch notes for Season 1 of XDefiant. This new season features a new game mode in Capture the Flag, additional factions, maps, weapons, and more.</p>



<p>There’s a lot going into the first season of the game. You can check out everything for yourself below.</p>



<h6>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-players-launch/">Ubisoft Confirms XDefiant has had 11 Million Players Since Launch</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-full-xdefiant-season-1-patch-notes">Full XDefiant Season 1 Patch Notes</h2>



<h3>Gameplay</h3>



<ul>
<li>Changed the expiration timing of activated Boosters so their lifespan counts down only during match time, when you’re actually playing, rather than all the time, like when you’re folding laundry or whatever.</li>



<li>Lowered the XP threshold for each Battle Pass tier to give Battle Pass progression a little more pep.</li>



<li>Tuned Match Bonus XP rewards:&nbsp;MVP and Victory went from 2,000 to 1,000 XP.&nbsp;Draw went from 1,000 to 500.&nbsp;Completion doubled from 2,000 to 4,000 to encourage player&nbsp;stick-to-itiveness.</li>



<li>Answered a community ask to add a headshot icon to the Killfeed because it feels good to rub it in.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Factions</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added the GSK faction and their no-nonsense announcer: HQ.
<ul>
<li>These elite Team Rainbow operators from Germany’s Border Protection Command&nbsp;specialize in crowd control and securing territory.&nbsp;They can deploy electrified barbed wire for area denial, counter incoming enemy devices with their Active Defense System, and dazzle multiple foes with flash charges mounted on their G52-Tactical Shield ultra.&nbsp;Call them&nbsp;Grenzschutzkommando because it’s fun and also accurate.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Increased the cooldown of Echelon’s Intel Suit from 30 to 40 seconds.</li>



<li>Tuned the cooldown of the Phantoms’ Mag Barrier from 30 to 40 seconds. Mag Barrier hit points were also reduced from 500 to 400.</li>



<li>The Phantoms’ AEGIS now takes damage from EMP grenades (lob six to put it out of commission).</li>



<li>DedSec Hijack cooldown decreased from 28 seconds (plus the remaining duration of&nbsp; the hacked skill) to 20 seconds (plus the remaining duration of&nbsp; the hacked skill).
<ul>
<li>For example, let’s say a Mag Barrier has 7 seconds left and gets hacked: The cooldown becomes 20 plus 7 seconds. Failed Hijack cooldown, meanwhile, decreases from 8 to 5 seconds.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>DedSec’s Spiderbot cooldown increased from 25 to 40 seconds.</li>



<li>Adjusted Spiderbot behavior so multiple Spiderbots won’t attempt to hug the same face, nor will Spiderbots continue to ignore faces they’ve hugged multiple recent times. Some give and take from the Spiderbot kingdom.</li>



<li>Decreased the cooldown of Libertad’s BioVida Boost from 25 to 20 seconds.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Fixed Libertad’s Medico Supremo so it will no longer disappear after the deploying player respawns as a different faction.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Maps</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added the new Clubhouse map, a two-story hangout popular with international operators. Ideal for firefights in the short- to mid-range. Home to game modes Domination, Occupy, Hot Shot, and the new CTF.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Game Modes</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added Capture the Flag, hereafter referred to as CTF. For the uninitiated: You take the enemy’s flag from their base and bring it back to your own, while protecting your team’s flag. CTF is available on a variety of maps.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Weapons</h3>



<ul>
<li>Improved the hit flinch penalty incurred when being shot with a sniper rifle equipped.<p>These changes are intended to refine the behavior of hit flinch, prevent instances where the camera would move off the target with the first hit and back onto the target with the second, and improve the experience for players sensitive to wild camera movements. Here’s the nitty-gritty:
</p><ul>
<li>The speed of the hit flinch camera transition has been increased by 25 percent.</li>



<li>The camera will now always kick upward rather than up or down at random.</li>



<li>The amount the camera will kick left or right has been increased by 3 times.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Added the L115 sniper rifle, which is not quite as heavy as the TAC-50 and has faster handling, although it deals slightly less damage and is not as effective at penetrating cover.</li>



<li>Added the LVOA-C,&nbsp;a snazzy customized rifle similar to the M4A1. It has a much faster rate of fire than the M4A1, but with that comes more recoil and less range. It also has slightly longer reload and equip times.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Added the Sawed Off secondary weapon.&nbsp;This close-range version of the double-barreled shotgun packs a big boom for its size. Imagine carrying a primary weapon in your secondary slot and that’s this.</li>



<li>Added new Mastery skins: Titanium Violet (unlocked at Weapon Level 300), Titanium Azure (unlocked at 350), and Titanium Prisma (unlocked at 400).&nbsp;</li>



<li>Fixed weapons and optics shake in first-person view while using ADS.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Devices</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added a new and improved visual effect for the flash grenade (replacing the previous effect, which was…intense). The new effect is less retina-searing but still appropriately disorientating.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Removed an exploit where players could respawn with multiple devices after fiddling with the “Copy Loadout” option in the lobby, so nice try.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Social</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added the Creator Code program, which allows players to choose a creator to receive commissions from their XCoin purchases at no additional cost. Choose “Support a Creator” from the store to see a list of eligible creators.</li>



<li>Players were able to create a party with enemy players and voice chat during matches despite being on opposing teams, which seemed shady so that’s fixed.</li>



<li>Disabled whispers in text chat.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Audio</h3>



<ul>
<li>Tweaked the mix of in-game voices and sound effects for volume and clarity.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>



<ul>
<li>Players who participated in the Closed Beta were supposed to keep Kersey’s Dungaree skin. They didn’t but now they do.</li>



<li>Fixed Challenge-tracking issues with Ubisoft Connect.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Graphical and audio fixes, various.</li>



<li>Additional crash fixes.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr">The Season 4 battle pass ends on July 24, meaning that's likely the start of Season 5 and would make for a very well-timed crossover if the leaks are true, as the new Deadpool &amp; Wolverine movie releases in theaters on July 26.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty has introduced several major IP event crossovers in the last few years, including the recent collaborations with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-collab-arrives-in-call-of-duty-mw3-and-warzone-this-week/1100-6524372/">Fallout</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/warzone-modern-warfare-iii-official-gundam-mobile-suit-bundles-gameplay-trailer/2300-6464213/">Gundam</a>, Dune, and The Walking Dead, so another major collaboration wouldn't be surprising.</p><p dir="ltr">We'll likely learn more about upcoming bundles and potential crossover events closer to Season 5's release. Activision is also hosting the Call of Duty: Next event on August 28 to reveal new details and showcase live gameplay of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-beta-and-more-leak-ahead-of-xbox-showcase/1100-6524072/">Black Ops 6</a> multiplayer.</p>

<p><em>Editor’s note: this piece contains spoilers for </em>Final Fantasy IX</p>



<p>In 2000, venerated RPG developer Square kicked off the new year with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-impressions-from-square-millennium/1100-2460029/">a big announcement:</a> <em>Final Fantasy</em> was going back to its roots. After two games featuring high-tech weaponry, corrupt megacorporations, and sci-fi boarding schools, the beloved franchise was finally returning to the European fairy tale aesthetic of its foundational 8- and 16-bit titles.</p>



<p>And, sure enough, when <em>Final Fantasy IX </em>came out, all the classic elements were there. The game takes place in a steampunk-tinged fantasy world and features a cast of whimsical characters. Elemental crystals, the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series’ recurring McGuffin, were back. So were moogles, dwarves, and — most importantly — black mages.</p>



<figure>

</figure>



<p>Nothing showed Square’s commitment to <em>Final Fantasy IX</em>‘s back-to-basics approach more than Vivi Ornitier. After all, black mages have been part of <em>Final Fantasy</em> since the beginning and still serve as the de facto symbol of the series’ earliest days. In <em>Final Fantasy</em>, <em>Final Fantasy III</em>, and <em>Final Fantasy V</em>, the black mage is one of a few classes (or “jobs”) you can assign to your characters, trading their physical strength for the ability to cast powerful spells. In <em>Final Fantasy II and Final Fantasy IV</em>, black mages live in their own city, Mysidia; during the first few minutes of <em>IV</em>, the protagonist slaughters Mysidia’s robed residents and steals their crystal.</p>



<p>Vivi even looks like the black mages of old, big head and all. The mages’ shadowy faces and glowing eyes might have been <a href="https://na.finalfantasy.com/topics/176">byproducts of the Nintendo Entertainment System’s limited palette</a>, but their design is evocative and instantly memorable. It’s no wonder that they became <em>Final Fantasy</em>‘s first major mascots.</p>



<p>But neither Vivi nor <em>Final Fantasy IX </em>are exactly what they seem. In an unusual move, Square unveiled <em>Final Fantasy IX </em>alongside its two sequels. <em>Final Fantasy X</em>, due out a year later, was the franchise’s first installment on the then-brand-new PlayStation 2, and featured a new combat system, more realistic graphics, and a world inspired by Southeast Asia. <em>Final Fantasy XI </em>was an MMORPG in the vein of <em>Ultima Online </em>and <em>EverQuest</em>, with gameplay to match. The 2001 feature film <em>Final Fantasy: Spirits Within</em> told an alien invasion story.</p>



<p>In other words, <em>Final Fantasy IX</em> wasn’t a revival. It was a eulogy for <em>Final Fantasy</em>‘s classic era, and Vivi was there to help us say goodbye.</p>



<p>Endings — and what comes afterwards — are baked into <em>Final Fantasy IX</em>‘s premise. “Following the death of my mother, I went through some things that made me think about death,” franchise creator and <em>Final Fantasy IX </em>producer Hironobu Sakaguchi said, according to Third Editions’ <em>The Legend of Final Fantasy IX.</em> “In the end, I told myself that this sort of thing is really not so unusual. In spite of the sadness it brings, life goes on.”</p>



<p>It’s probably not an accident that Sakaguchi uses Vivi, <em>Final Fantasy IX</em>‘s most direct link to the franchise’s earlier installments, to express this theme, and the mage’s arc serves as a potent metaphor for the fate of the original Final Fantasy games. Initially, Vivi is clumsy, naïve, and ignorant about his true nature, but he means well and tries hard. As the adventure continues, he learns that he’s actually a <em>product</em>, one of hundreds of black mages produced on an assembly line for use in war. Even worse, Vivi was born with a built-in expiration date. After about a year of puttering around, he discovers, black mages simply stop working.&nbsp;</p>



<figure>
<figcaption><em>captured via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Lacry">Lacry</a></em></figcaption>
</figure>



<p>Vivi spends the rest of <em>Final Fantasy IX </em>making peace with his impending demise. He succeeds, but time catches up with him anyway. During <em>Final Fantasy IX’s </em>epilogue, Vivi is the only cast member who’s absent. He is not, however, forgotten; a message written by mage before his death plays over the final scenes. “Life doesn’t last forever,” it says. “Even if you say goodbye, you’ll always be in our hearts … Farewell. My memories will be part of the sky.”</p>



<p>Unlike Vivi, <em>Final Fantasy</em> didn’t die after <em>Final Fantasy IX</em>, but it did change radically. Nobuo Uematsu is no longer the series’ sole (or even primary) composer. Sakaguchi is long gone. The Active Time Battle system, which powered <em>Final Fantasy IV </em>through <em>IX</em>‘s turn-based combat, has been retired.</p>



<p>And yet, like Vivi’s memory, those original titles’ influence remains. The first six <em>Final Fantasy</em> games have been remastered, remade, and re-released numerous times. They continue to provide a barometer for <em>Final Fantasy</em>‘s overall vibe, while the creatures, mechanics, and tropes they introduced — including black mages — have been remixed and reinterpreted repeatedly in later installments. Even when a <em>Final Fantasy</em> title tries something radically new, it still feels comfortable, thanks to the foundation those old games established.</p>



<p><em>Final Fantasy IX</em> foresaw this eventuality, of course. While Vivi doesn’t make it to the epilogue, a group of young black mages who claim to be his sons do. The message is clear: Vivi will be missed, but his death isn’t sad, exactly. His time was simply up; now, seeing how his descendants pick up his legacy will be its own, unique source of joy. You can say the exact same thing about classic <em>Final Fantasy</em>.</p>

			<p>As the ninth console generation approaches its fourth year, one question remained unanswered: how does Sony's PS5 console often outperform Microsoft's Xbox Series X, which is more powerful on paper?&nbsp;A few notable examples include <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-4-demo-performance-ps5-runs-better-xbox-series-x-better-vrr-rt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Resident Evil 4</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/cod-black-ops-cold-war-performance-mode-ps5-better-ray-tracing-xsx-better/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-runs-better-on-ps5-than-xbox-series-x/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grand Theft Auto V</a> following the next-generation update.</p>
<p>As a reminder, both PS5 and Xbox Series X are powered by custom AMD hardware featuring Zen 2 and RDNA 2 CPU/GPU architectures. Microsoft's console has an eight-core CPU clocked at 3.8 GHz (3.6 GHz with simultaneous multithreading enabled), a GPU powered by 52 Compute Units clocked at 1.825 GHz for an estimated 12.16 TeraFLOPS of computing power, and 16GB of GDDR6 SDRAM with a split design (10GB with 320-bit bus and 560 GB/s bandwidth and 6 GB with 192-bit bus and 336 GB/s bandwidth).</p>
<p>On the other hand, PS5 has an eight-core CPU with variable frequency that is capped at 3.5 GHz, a GPU powered by 36 Compute Units with variable frequency up to 2.23 GHz for an estimated TeraFLOPS peak of 10.13, and 16GB of GDDR6 SDRAM with a 256-bit bus and 448 GB/s bandwidth.</p>
<p>Well, today, Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQIBknDAj4g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published a new DF Direct weekly episode</a> in which they attempted to share a more or less final take on the subject. John Linneman mentioned hearing from developers that the shader compiler and the API itself are faster on the PlayStation 5 side.</p>
<p><em>One of the big ones that we've heard referenced multiple times now is the shader compiler on the PS5 side is just extremely fast and optimized. It gets pretty complex, but it makes better use of the actual silicon in a way that allows the PS5 to speedier performance. That seems to be a huge thing. Obviously, Microsoft wouldn't be sleeping on that, they're clearly putting in the work on that, but so is Sony, and developers just seem to prefer Sony's implementation for this. Along those same lines, the PS5's main API also seems to be quite fast, faster than what Microsoft's doing with DirectX.</em></p>
<p>The DirectX topic is interesting, as it is mentioned that Microsoft's choice to provide an API that works fairly seamlessly between PC and Xbox consoles may prove to be a slight penalty in how low-level it is on the console side.</p>
<p>That's not the whole story. According to Alex Battaglia, Unreal Engine 5-powered games generally benefit from the Xbox Series X's higher count of Compute Units. However, other engines may well be more performant on PS5 due to its higher clock rate.</p>
<p>There's more to consider, anyway, as Microsoft's console has the advantage when it comes to variable refresh rate (VRR) implementation. For example, while FromSoftware's Elden Ring runs faster on Sony's console, the Xbox Series X provides a smoother and more stable experience. Ultimately, though, the differences between the two consoles are relatively minor in most games, providing a comparable experience.</p>

The battle begins with the Master tearing through several seemingly faceless Jedi, each of whom I’m sure each have their own dense backstories. Even amidst the spectacular all-versus-one action, the lack of intimacy we feel with these unknown Jedi left me feeling like an opportunity had been missed for us to feel more. As each Jedi fell, I would have loved for for their deaths to feel more impactful. All it would’ve taken was a simple meal scene like the goop dinner in the first <em>Matrix</em> movie in which Neo meets the crew of the ship that saved him.<br></p><p>Sprinkled between lightsaber martial arts combos, we have actual story progression. We’re in this fight to see Osha reunite with/arrest her twin sister Mae, both played by Amandla Stenberg. Amidst the battle, the Jedi tell Osha to get to safety, escorted by injured Jedi Knight Yord. Meanwhile, acolyte Mae attempts to evade her former dark Master unsuccessfully, and she sends a psychic distress signal to Osha. Osha tells Yord they have to go back or everyone will die. Osha gets the bright idea to use her pocket-droid’s flashlight to attract a swarm of umbramoths (giant, lethal moths) that surround them in the trees to use against the dark Master, and she and Yord run back to battle.</p><p>Yord lunges at the dark Master and hits his mask, but that doesn’t stop his adversary from slaying the best Jedi fighter, Padawan Jecki Lon (Dafne María Keen Fernández). Finally, we see the face of the Master. No doubt like many fans, up to this point I’d been wondering who the master is. Is it one of Osha and Mae’s mothers? Is it a former Jedi, perhaps the teacher of Master Sol (Lee Jung-jae)? Nope. It’s Qimir (Manny Jacinto). And now the volume on the episode turns down.</p><p>Manny is a great actor who’s performed well in previous episodes, but he feels  miscast in this moment. His reveal underwhelms, and the strength and mystery of the character is now gone. We learn of Qimir’s motivation—to be free—and the authenticity of a villain feels lost. This is not Vader. This is just a bad guy.</p><figure id="" data-id="e0d92967e4fc20101f5ba521fa5ddd6f" data-recommend-id="image://e0d92967e4fc20101f5ba521fa5ddd6f" data-format="jpg" data-width="2857" data-height="1608" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Manny Jacinto in a scene from The Acolyte." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Manny Jacinto in a scene from The Acolyte." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lucasfilm</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e0d92967e4fc20101f5ba521fa5ddd6f" data-recommend-id="image://e0d92967e4fc20101f5ba521fa5ddd6f" data-format="jpg" data-width="2857" data-height="1608" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Manny Jacinto in a scene from The Acolyte." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Again, we feel the missed opportunities for character development, with the lack of time we’ve had to get to know Qimir up to this point sapping this development of its power. Yes, there are fan theories suggesting that more revelations await, but the narrative we’ve been fed up to this point isn’t potent enough to support this reveal in the here and now. But back to the episode’s highlight: Qimir kills Yord, cementing this scene as having some of the best deaths in any <em>Star Wars</em> battle.<br></p><p>As last Jedi standing Sol fights Qimir, Osha and Mae have gone through their back-and-forth of stun gunning (Osha shot Mae, but she woke up), and Osha sacrifices her droid (that we should care more about, but don’t) by sticking it on Qimir’s back. He’s attacked by the umbramoths and flown into the trees above. Mae awakens to stun-gun Sol, and she has a moment alone with Osha. Mae gives Osha a speech about how the Jedi brainwashed her and how they both need to believe in their sisterly bond. Mae hugs Osha, but Osha puts Mae in an arm lock. Then she delivers some dialogue about doing what she came to do: arrest her sister for murdering Jedi and burning their homeland. </p><p>One of my pet peeves is arm locking and dialogue, followed by reversing an arm lock and delivering more dialogue, which happens in this scene. Another example of the series being riddled with unnecessary tropes that take away from its built-in uniqueness. Mae ends up knocking Osha out cold, then lightsabers her hair and swaps clothing to impersonate her sister. This leads to Mae leaving the planet with the awakened Sol, and Osha being discovered by Qimir, who has defeated the swarm of umbramoths. Hopefully this leads to the truth being revealed behind what the Jedi did to destroy Mae and Osha’s home.</p><p><em>The Acolyte</em>’s fifth episode is the most exciting yet in terms of pacing and action. However, it also highlights how more focus on character development would allow us to understand how these individuals interact with the world and would convey emotional weight when characters die or return, or droid friends are lost. We don’t get enough intimate time with these characters for them to feel real, and I hope this changes with future episodes.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/379647/564546/9358?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Fthe-acolyte%2F39RAA0bOYXQ0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/379647/564546/9358?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Fthe-acolyte%2F39RAA0bOYXQ0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Acolyte</em></a></span><em> </em>is available to stream now on Disney+. </p><p>.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's not a new game or a remake of the classic titles, but something is better than nothing.</p><p>An official collaboration between Crystal Dynamics and Bit Bot Media, the Soul Reaver graphic novel will reveal more info about Raziel's past, his days as a Sarafan warrior, and how he came to serve under Kain as a vampire. The book will be written by Joshua Viola (True Believer) and Angie Hodapp (Shadow Atlas), with art by Juan Samu (Star Wars), letters by Jeremiah Lambert, and covers by Dave Rapoza and Aaron Lovett.</p><p>"In college, I created a Soul Reaver poster for a class project, never imagining I would one day officially contribute to the franchise," Viola said in a statement (via <a href="https://za.ign.com/legacy-of-kain-defiance/197058/news/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-returns-in-new-prequel-graphic-novel" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>). "Even today, Raziel graces my tattoo sleeve--a testament to my deep connection with this universe. Fans can expect a project infused with that same passion. Working directly with creatives from Crystal Dynamics and reuniting with former collaborators makes this a truly special endeavor."</p><p>The Soul Reaver graphic novel will launch on Kickstarter later this year, and anyone interested can <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/call_to_action/ec6d71d7-3906-45d4-aaab-40fc1a372416/landing?preview_mode=true" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">sign up on BackerKit</a> to be informed when the crowdfunding campaign goes live.</p><p>Beyond this upcoming journey back to Nosgoth, things seem quiet for the Legacy of Kain franchise currently.
