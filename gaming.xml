<p>The former developers of Little Nightmares are now working on a game that merges twin stick Shooters with Metroidvanias. End of Abyss is being developed by Section 9 Interactive Studios and published by Epic Games. While it is yet another in a long line of Metroidvania-style games, it also promises to shake up the formula with twin-stick shooter controls.</p>



<p>Section 9 is a Swedish game development studio whose founders, Marcus and Matthews Ottvall, have a history of working on hit games, including Little Nightmares and Little Big Planet on the PlayStation Vita. Now, they’re excited to begin revealing their unique take on what a Metroidvania can be.</p>







<h2 id="h-section-9-co-founders-discuss-inspiration-for-end-of-abyss">Section 9 Co-Founders Discuss Inspiration For End of Abyss</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/horror/former-little-nightmares-devs-end-of-abyss-is-a-satisfyingly-creepy-blend-of-top-down-twin-stick-shooter-and-metroidvania-exploration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Speaking with Games Radar+</a>, Marcus discussed that the initial plans for End of Abyss called for a cartoony action game. However, they later explored a top-down Metroidvania, leading to a darker atmosphere.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The game started out as a bit of a cartoony action game, a kind of top-down twin stick shooter with some adventure elements. Player movement was quicker back then and with fast dodges to avoid enemy attacks. During development, we talked about how there really weren’t that many top-down Metroidvania games, and we wanted to explore that idea. We started leaning towards a more serious tone. We discussed sci-fi anime and classic horror movie inspirations, and began forming a darker atmosphere, and horror elements were introduced, shifting the game toward slower-paced gameplay.”</p>
</blockquote>

</p></figure>







<p>Marcus did not want to disclose too much about the game’s story and characters, but his brother, Mattias Otvall, spoke about the game’s scanner tool and how it was designed to stand out in a crowded genre.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“It’s a tool that we created for making the exploration more manageable and enjoyable. Scanning your environment and creatures also provides a bit of extra information about the world around you and may even help you find some secrets. Metroidvania games can get disorienting at times, so the scanner helps you to mark points of interest on your map so you can have an easier time finding where to go later on.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As of yet, there’s no release date for the forthcoming game. Still, it is expected to be released in 2026 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series consoles, and PC via the Epic Games Store.</p>

            <p>
I think as long as you make a new year's update post before the incredibly arbitrary date of January 13th, you're still able to do so without me thinking "come on, it's almost February", which is exactly what EA did with their <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/future-of-the-sims">new years Sims update post</a>. Perhaps reassuringly, after word came last year of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">EA's concerning acquisition</a>, the post opens by doubling down on what the team has previously said regarding <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-eas-buyout-and-creator-exodus-the-sims-team-wants-you-to-know-their-values-and-commitment-remain-the-same">staying committed to their values</a> (those values <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/the-values-that-shape-the-sims">including inclusivity</a> is welcome though I wish they'd be more explicit about who is being included). But the post also, sort of, goes into what's next for the series.
</p>
<p>
Top of the order of importance is potentially the fact that Project Rene, i.e. not-Sims 5 with an emphasis on multiplayer, is now being described as a "mobile-first" game. The post is explicit about it not being "the successor to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>," noting it is an "experience from any future deep, single player life simulation experience." But its future on PC, or any other platform, is now up in the air.
</p>
<p>
One thing the post does make clear is the studio's commitment to single-player games, even if Project Rene is meant to be more collaborative. "Single-player PC and console experiences will always be a part of our future, with more than half of our global development team dedicated to The Sims 4 and the next evolution," the post explains, though what about that last bit, the next evolution? "More news in the coming months!" Very helpful, thanks.
</p>
<p>
We already know there's not going to be a Sims 5, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/there-shall-be-no-sims-5-you-insolent-fools-only-a-sims-universe">at least last time I checked anyway</a>, so this evolution is limited in its potential. Perhaps a big refresh for The Sims 4? It certainly could do with one, given it's over a decade old now. We'll find out in those theoretically coming months!

            <p>Surprise! We finally have a release date and a subtitle - "Broken Things" -  for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/poppy-playtime">Poppy Playtime</a> 5: 18th February, 2026. The console release for Chapter 5 will reportedly "follow in the months ahead".</p>
<p>To celebrate the news, developer Mob Entertainment shared a new terrifying cinematic teaser (which is very heavy on the red-brown stuff), and shows off the gigantic Experiment 1006, AKA The Prototype.</p>
<p>You can check it out below:</p>

<p>"Deep within the vacant halls of the Playtime Co. lab, The Prototype stalks its unfinished work… the tattered, lifeless remains of toys that once were. Broken things," the blurb teases.</p>
<p>"In Poppy Playtime: Chapter 5 - Broken Things, players must prepare to face off against the deadly puppetmaster behind the horrifying events of Playtime Co’s dark past. Solve devious puzzles and overcome dangerous obstacles as the true rotten heart at the center of Playtime Co. draws nearer."</p>
<p>You can expect "stomach-churning terror" in a new area of the factory, new "tortured denizens", puzzles, deadly environmental obstacles, and new GrabPack tools.</p>
<p>It's been a long wait for fans. The prior chapter, called Poppy Playtime Chapter 4, predictably enough, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-chapter-4-release-announced-for-pc">arrived on PC back in January last year</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-chapter-4-coming-to-consoles-this-month">on consoles over the summer</a>.</p>
<p>In May of last year, the studio announced that a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-the-cult-horror-game-is-getting-a-film-adaptation">Poppy Playtime film adaptation was in the works</a> with Legendary Entertainment and Angry Films.</p>
<p>"When we first started this journey, we followed our passion and created a series of games and brands with the purpose of inspiring and entertaining. We've always dreamed big and are thrilled to have created something that has captured the hearts of tens of millions around the world," Mob Entertainment co-founders Zach Belanger and Seth Belanger said at the time. "This movie deal is a great logical next step in the growth of our transmedia entertainment company."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders First-Person Works Surprisingly Well in New Clip]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-first-person-works-well-new-clip/</link>
            <guid>1402591</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders is a third-person extraction adventure game and has been since Embark Studios concocted the concept several years ago. That hasn’t stopped fans worldwide from wondering how the game would fare as a <strong>first-person </strong>shooter. Now, they’re one step closer to seeing what that would look like.</p>



<p>In a new clip uploaded on social media and circulated online, one user manipulated ARC Raiders via dev console commands, a function that has now been <strong>patched out </strong>by Embark Studios. By forcing a first-person perspective, this user allowed us to see what the post-apocalyptic shooter would look like if it <strong>weren’t </strong>a third-person game.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-in-first-person-is-kind-of-trippy">ARC Raiders in First Person is Kind of Trippy</h2>



<p>ARC Raiders is a phenomenal, award-winning extraction adventure title <strong>exclusively </strong>available as a third-person game. That’s absolutely fine, as it works and beats the norm where the <strong>first-person perspective </strong>is king in the extraction space.</p>



<p>However, a new three-minute clip uploaded to social media and shared online showcases a forced first-person perspective in ARC Raiders. It admittedly is a little janky because it’s an exploit and a manipulation effort more than anything else, but it shows the potential of what might have been:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>FIRST PERSON in ARC Raiders 😮</p><p>A Reddit user managed to force FPP camera using dev console commands. Even without dedicated animations, seeing the world from this perspective looks incredibly immersive. <a href="https://t.co/mJB6sHA57I">pic.twitter.com/mJB6sHA57I</a></p></div>— ARC Raiders Alerts (@ArcRaiderAlerts) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArcRaiderAlerts/status/2010011248922853451?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Earlier today, Embark Studios published a hotfix to address this very issue. It was found that PC players were exploiting hidden dev console commands to boost their FOV and disable some of the game’s environmental mechanics, like fog. This resulted in them having hugely advantageous edges over the competition, especially those playing on PlayStation and Xbox.</p>



<p>This exploit is what led to the forced first-person perspective you see in the clip above.</p>



<p>The reception was mixed on social media, with many claiming that it should <strong>never </strong>have some kind of PUBG-influenced switchable mode between first- and third-person, while others suggested it looks much more immersive in first-person.</p>







<p>What do you think? Does ARC Raiders work as a first-person shooter, or should it stay forever locked to third-person? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <p>EA has stressed to its community that "the values of The Sims are unchanged" as we head into 2026.</p>
<p>At the end of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-shareholders-approve-saudi-arabian-buyout-leaving-only-the-us-government-able-to-block-the-deal">EA shareholders approved</a> the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law"> proposed $55bn acquisition</a> of the video game giant by Saudi Arabia and private equity firms, leaving only the US government in the way of what would be the largest corporate buyout in history. The acquisition, first announced back in September, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-almost-entirely-owned-by-saudi-arabia-sale">would leave EA 93.4 percent owned by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund</a>, a government wealth fund used to build infrastructure, attract businesses to Saudi Arabia, and more.</p>
<p>As news about the acquisition spread, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-creators-quit-ea-partnerships-amid-buyout-concerns">a number of prolific The Sims content creators "removed themselves" from the EA Creator Network</a>, claiming the game's inclusive community is at odds with the well-documented conservative and anti-LGBTQIA+ values of EA's buyers, which include the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud and Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.</p>

<p>The Sims team, however, wrote on its blog yesterday (9th January) that the values that have always shaped The Sims "are unchanged", adding: "The Sims has always been more than a game. It’s a canvas for life in all its unpredictable forms…the chaotic moments, the tiny joys, the big dreams, every identity, every version of you. And, thanks to you, The Sims has grown into something bigger than we ever imagined: a living world bursting with creativity, expression, humour, chaos, and heart.</p>
<p>"Our Sims team's creative control, guided by our values of inclusivity, choice, creativity, community, and play, has not changed. These values inspire the decisions we make each and every day as we plan for today, tomorrow, and the future."</p>
<p>Following this pledge, the team opened up on the future of the franchise, saying it's "building a family of new Sims experiences across PC, console, and mobile", and will put "single-player life simulation experiences" at the heart of its work, confirming singleplayer games will "always be a part" of the games' future.</p><p>As for "Project Rene?" Thanks to your feedback, that has evolved into a "social, collaborative, mobile-first life-sim game", but is "not the successor to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> and is a separate experience from any future deep, single player life simulation experience". Playtesting for The Sims Lab continues, with the team assuring players that "these tests are works in progress with experimental game features, concept imagery, naming conventions (The Sims Labs: Life Together, The Sims Labs: Town Stories) and ideas in motion. Some concepts evolve and sometimes an experiment won’t move forward at all".</p>
<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-a-replacement-seemingly-waiting-in-the-wings-ea-announces-the-sims-mobile-is-shutting-down-in-january">EA is shutting down The Sims Mobile</a> after seven years, with servers going offline - and all content becoming unplayable - on 20th January. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sims-mobile">The Sims Mobile</a> launched for iOS and Android in 2017, delivering a free-to-play Sims-style experience broadly similar to that of the main series.</p>
<p>From this month, however, EA announced there would be no further content updates or events for The Sims Mobile, and the publisher has now confirmed the game's imminent closure, sharing a detailed timeline for its shutdown. While EA hasn't given a reason for The Sims Mobile's shutdown, it's likely in order to clear the way for its new mobile game, currently being referred to as The Sims Labs: Town Stories.</p>

            <p>
Hear ye, hear ye, another extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> is almost upon us, this time the smaller but still quite bold in scope Sand: Raiders of Sophie. Last time I personally heard of this game it was just called Sand, which doesn't sound great for that whole search engine thing, though I'm not entirely convinced by the subtitle. Anyway, this extraction shooter is set in an alternate 1910 where you get to roam the desert in a steampunky fortress with legs, and it's got a release month!
</p>
<p>
That release month isn't too far away either, being March, though a month is all you're getting right now as there's no specific date in sight. The perils of game development, I would guess. For those that haven't heard of Sand before, it's a PvPvE extraction shooter where you build large, mobile buildings called Tramplers, a sort of 20th century version of the titular castle from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/howl">Howl</a>'s Moving Castle. You then operate these Tramplers, driving them around so to speak, taking down other players' creations with various weapons you may have attached.

<p>
On the ground level, you as essentially a regular Joe will trawl the "once-resource-rich world of Sophie," all so that you can "uncover hidden riches in the barren wastelands, rectify historical injustices," and lay claim to what you believe is rightfully yours (what that is, I can't tell you). 
</p><p>
There's shooting, there's things to find and extract, there's not-zombies to keep you on your toes when other players aren't about. All of it looks fairly par for the course, the real selling point here are the Tramplers, at least from an outside perspective. If any of this takes your fancy, you can wishlist Sand: Raiders of Sophie right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1431300/SAND_Raiders_of_Sophie/">here</a>.

<p>Nintendo has denied claims that generative AI was used in promotional images for their new “My Mario” toy line.</p>



<p>Nintendo announced on Thursday, January 8, 2025, that its My Mario products would launch in the United States on February 19. On social media, they advertised the lineup with pictures of parents playing with their children and several products from the new line. Some who saw the images raised concerns that the company was using generative AI in its marketing, citing the way adults’ hands appear in some of the photos.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-nintendo-and-campaign-actress-deny-gen-ai-usage">Nintendo And Campaign Actress Deny Gen AI Usage</h2>



<p>One of the models, Brittoni O’myah Sinclair, even commented on Nintendo’s Instagram post to deny using generative AI in the campaign. Now, Nintendo has commented on the matter, telling Insider Gaming that no generative AI was used in the campaign.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The topic of generative AI continues to become more prominent in gaming as Gen AI tools become more commonplace and accessible. Recently, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indie-game-awards-disqualifies-clair-obscur-expedition-33-gen-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stripped of its wins </a>at The Indie Game Awards due to the use of generative AI. Also, Larian Studios, the developers of Divinity, recently said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-devs-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-for-concept-art/">they would not use Gen AI</a> tools for concept art or dialogue.</p>

            <guid>1402540</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We’re entering the hallowed ground of the Top 10, the territory of listicles across countless topics, as we search for our very <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/most-wanted-2026">most desired games of 2026</a>.&nbsp;This batch of games has some galactic and not so galactic racing, a bit of revolution in the air, a much wanted sequel, and an experience that might leave you shaken but not stirred.</p>
<h2>10 – Star Wars: Galactic Racer</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p>In a galaxy far, far away an Empire has fallen and a New Republic is forming. However, this is a time of great upheaval and uncertainty, which means there is space for some sci-fi motor racing. A spiritual successor to Star Wars: Episode I: Racer,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-galactic-racer">Star Wars: Galactic Racer</a> introduces us to the undergroung Galactic League, where racers from different backgrounds and disciplines come together to prove who the best pilot is in the galaxy. Podracer Sebulba is just one of those characters.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Wars: Galactic Racer™ - Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RiavNl4qxWY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There is also a new character called Shade, and that is who players embody. Shade is a racer starting at the bottom who has two goals; glory and revenge. Glory in becoming the best racer in the league, and revenge against rival Kestar who wants to run the league in his own way. Racing just makes up one part of Star Wars Galactic Racer, as players will have to navigate alliances and rivalries with other racers to come out on top. There will be race tracks across familiar planets as well as new ones being added to the Star Wars universe.</p>

<h2>9 – &nbsp;Clockwork Revolution</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC – TBA</em></p>
<p>inXile Entertainment has steadily built itself up as a studio that can deliver fun and interesting RPGs, from The Bard’s Tale series, through Torment: Tides of Numenera and most recently Wasteland 3 each showing depth in ideas and execution. But since their acquisition by Microsoft they’ve been able to push on towards full AAA territory. Clockwork Revolution is the time-bending RPG coming out of this ambition, and it’s high on our list following <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/08/clockwork-revolution-gets-a-time-bending-crime-filled-gameplay-reveal/">a great looking gameplay reveal</a> that showcased fun gameplay, comedy, and a world that can be changed by player actions.</p>
<p><iframe title="Clockwork Revolution | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l421zRNnivo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Clockwork Revolution is set in the year 1895 in the steam powered city of Avalon where humans and clockwork people live and work together side by side. It is also a world filled with criminals and a powerful ruling class that can time travel to craft Avalon in their image. Unfortunately for them, your character has also found a way to time travel and shape the city to their own ends. We know the main character is a scoundrel who appears they will do anything to get ahead. The character creation alone is integrated into the game as someone giving the police a description of you after you have robbed them.</p>
<h2>8 – Forza Horizon 6</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC (and possibly PS5) – 2026</em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/forza-horizon-6-is-heading-to-japan-in-2026/">announcement for Forza Horizon 6</a> had some of its impact taken away after the Forza Horizon social media accounts posted the teaser ahead of the official reveal at Tokyo Game Show. The teaser pans across items from different parts of the world before settling on a Japanese license plate and a white Neko figure. It then pans up to show Mount Fuji, confirming Forza Horizon 6 will be taking place in Japan.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Forza Horizon 6 - Official Teaser Trailer | Tokyo Game Show 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lwlw0ChiSR0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Not much is known about Forza Horizon 6 right now, beyond the fact that it will carry on in the traditions of the open world series. Seasons will be returning, and the map will have be landmark-filled approximation of Japan, including Mount Fuji, Tokyo, and rural areas. This map is being developed with Japanese consultants so more is shown of the country than just the touristy bits. Expect to see an awful lot more of this game, and likely a release date announcement during the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/08/xbox-developer-direct-announced-will-feature-fable-and-forza-horizon-6/">Developer_Direct stream on 22nd January</a>.</p>
<h2>7 – 007: First Light</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, NSW2, PC – 27th May 2026</em></p>
<p>While we still wait on the news on who will be the next James Bond for the films, we don’t have to wait much longer for IO Interactive’s take on the most famous of spies, even if the game has been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/23/007-first-light-delayed-release-date-may-2026/">delayed to May</a>. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/007-first-light">007: First Light</a> is IO Interactive’s most ambitious games, taking on the mantle of crafting a new Bond story while using lessons learned from its highly acclaimed Hitman games.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="007 First Light – Gameplay Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DpP_WXrDArQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Bond is not yet the globe trotting super spy we all know, but a young agent still earning his reputation and having to work as part of a team. The mission is to take down 009 who has gone rogue, using MI6’s own tactics against them. Bond is a loose cannon who will do things his own way to get the job done, even if it doesn’t please others in the organisation. The game will feature spycraft, shootouts, and driving ( a first for IO Interactive) with each taking inspiration from the 007 books and movies.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/03/007-first-light-preview-how-io-are-crafting-a-new-kind-of-bond-game/">read more about the game in our very own preview</a>.</p>
<h2>6 – Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/23/warhammer-40k-boltgun-review/">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a> was heralded as a great return to form for the boomer shooter form, getting critical acclaim and commercial success. Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2 has already got high expectations placed upon its shoulders, and what we know of it so far seems to promise a lot more action without sacrificing much of what made Boltgun great.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="New Character Reveal Trailer | Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/43jjsBVarPg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2 gives us two protagonists to play as, Sternguard Veteran Malum Caedo and Sister of Battle, Nyra Veyrath. Each has their own playstyle so you can try new ways of taking on enemies as you travel through a hive city and mangrove swamps. The story will also have a branching narrative with each choice taking you to different levels, meaning you may have to play through a few times to see everything. On top of that there are new enemy units to engage in combat with including Bloodletters ,Juggernauts and other new enemies from different factions. Boltgun 2 is going to be a bigger and louder experience than its predecessor, but we will have to wait and see if it is better.</p>

<p><em>That’s it for today, and we’re going to take a day off tomorrow to catch our breath and then blitz through out top five with daily posts. What’s going to come out on top?</em></p>

            <p>
Last year, after a bit of a wait, Silent Hill was released, and with it came some changes to the series. The combat was a lot more actiony, the format for multiple endings was drastically different, but the most obvious change was its setting. We're not in Silent Hill anymore, Toto! We're in Ebisugaoka, Japan, also a fictional town, though clearly not a fictional country. And that's because Silent Hill, the place, is now also Silent Hill, the "phenomenon."
</p>
<p>
Writer of the game Ryukishi07 recently shared in an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/53254">Famitsu</a> (ta for the translations, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/silent-hill/silent-hill-is-not-just-the-name-of-a-place-it-is-a-phenomenon-silent-hill-f-writer-doubles-down-on-theory-from-a-short-message-that-had-the-fanbase-divided/">GamesRadar</a>) that he felt unsure of why <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> would be set in Japan. "I discussed a lot of things with series producer [Motoi] Okamoto in a meeting after I received the request [to write Silent Hill f,]" Ryukishi07 shared. 
</p>
<p>
"Like 'Why is it set in Japan?' and 'What exactly is Silent Hill?'" But it was while speaking with Okamoto that the pair "came to the conclusion that Silent Hill is not just the name of a place, it is a phenomenon. Looking back I think I was able to create a pretty satisfying base for the story and world from this."
</p>
<p>
You might remember that such a thing was even referenced in The Short Message, which quite literally makes mention of a "Silent Hill phenomenon." I'm certainly not opposed to the series taking a more anthological approach, I even think that's what it should be doing. But I have to say that putting a name to it feels a bit too much like showing your hand. Revel in the mystery, in the unknown, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a>! It's more fun that way.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, weirdly revealing choice or not, I do actually think Silent Hill f is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-review">quite good</a>, and worth a pop yourself if you haven't given it a chance already.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> developer Kinetic Games reckons 2026 will be "one of the biggest [years] in the game's history" as it moves towards the full release of the game.</p>
<p>The team says we can expect to see "more immersive animations" added to the early access ghosthunting game, such as physically seeing your character model turn on your EMF Reader, opening and closing doors, and picking up or dropping equipment.</p>
<p>This is on top of new death and revive animations, and the delayed Player Character Update, which is now coming anytime between now and March 2026.</p>

<p>"We’ve created brand new character models, improved animations and fine-tuned how it feels to play Phasmophobia," the team explains. "Our overall aim is to create the most immersive experience we can, and we believe our current player character models and animations can snap (pun intended) you out of the game with a disjointed arm there, a bendy back here. With these changes, our characters will move with more realism and present a more life-like experience for players. This update is a key part of our road to Phasmophobia 1.0, creating the most immersive experience possible."</p>
<p>This was initially set to launch before the end of 2025, but unfortunately, the team "weren't able to meet that date – but for good reason".</p> <div>

<p>"As we saw with Chronicle earlier this year, giving the update more breathing room to evolve pays off," Kinetic adds. "So while there’s a little longer to wait, we’re excited to share that we’ll be launching the Player Character Update in Q1 2026."</p><p>And in line with the reworked <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobias-long-awaited-bleasdale-farmhouse-redesign-is-coming-next-week-heres-whats-new">farmhouses</a> - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobias-new-nells-diner-map-gets-a-release-date-and-will-be-an-example-of-how-the-team-want-all-maps-to-feel-going-forward">all-new Nell's Diner</a>, of course - Tanglewood is getting a makeover, too. Acutely aware that some players are very apprehensive about seeing their favourite level changed, the team promises it will "provide a similar experience to the one Ghost Hunters know and love to this day while still feeling fresh and exciting".</p>
<p>Interestingly, for players that enjoy piecing together environmental clues and storytelling, "a mystery lies behind 6 Tanglewood Drive that's just waiting to be uncovered".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-studio-kinetic-moves-into-indie-publishing">Kinetic Games recently announced it's branching out into indie game publishing</a> with Kinetic Publishing.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="fba9872ff7aaf"><a title="Virtual Boy" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fba9872ff7aaf/virtual-boy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>As someone who witnessed its initial release, I’m delightfully baffled that Nintendo is resurrecting the Virtual Boy. We aren't just getting a passing mention or a trophy in a <strong>Smash Bros.</strong> game; we’re getting a full-blown revival, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/virtual_boy_-_nintendo_classics">a dedicated NSO app</a>, a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/virtual-boy-for-nintendo-switch-2-120829/">$100 authentic replica peripheral</a>, and a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/virtual-boy-cardboard-model-for-nintendo-switch-2-120828/">$25 cardboard cutout</a> for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_labo_toy-con_04_vr_kit">Labo</a> diehards.</p>
<p>All this for the console that married Game Boy visuals with <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/tags/vectrex">Vectrex</a>-style wireframes, stuffed them into a View-Master shell, and doused the whole package in a colour palette straight out of a 19th-century darkroom.</p>
<p>Yeah, <em>that</em> Virtual Boy.</p>
<p>For 30 years, Nintendo’s first rule of Virtual Boy was "You do not talk about Virtual Boy," yet here we are in 2026, and Nintendo is embracing the most eccentric chapter in their storied history. I’m dumbfounded, but honestly, I’m here for it.</p>
<h2><strong>1995: Rose-Coloured Glasses</strong></h2>
<p>For most, the Virtual Boy is more meme than memory - particularly for European gamers who missed it entirely. When it launched, I was a video game columnist for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_County_Journal">Journal-American</a>, right in the heart of Nintendo of America's backyard: the Seattle Eastside. My journalistic credentials earned me an early look at the Virtual Boy, plus day one copies of the console and all four launch titles.</p>
<figure data-uuid="5cc0157273dc1"><a title="Virtual Boy" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5cc0157273dc1/virtual-boy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nathan Lockard</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>My August 18, 1995 article covered the launch, and I was surprisingly optimistic, as evidenced by my headline “Nintendo’s 3-D gaming system first step in the right direction”. I saw potential in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/marios_tennis">Mario’s Tennis</a> and the wireframe wonder, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/red_alarm">Red Alarm</a>, and I even theorised that if games kept coming out, the Virtual Boy would become as much of a household name as the Game Boy.</p>
<p>I was half right. It became a household name alright, just not for the reasons Nintendo’s marketing team had hoped.</p>
<h2><strong>A Silly Seven Months</strong></h2>
<p>By any measure, the Virtual Boy had a rough life. With only <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/browse?system=virtualboy&amp;sort=title">22 games worldwide</a> and fewer than 800,000 units sold, its owners belonged to one of the most exclusive clubs in gaming history.</p>
<p>The VB’s sales were so poor that in 1996, a little more than a year post-launch, my younger brother won an award at Sears for selling a single system. By that point, moving <em>one</em> unit was the retail equivalent of selling dirt to a desert dweller.</p>
<p>Frustration was palpable even within Nintendo’s inner circles. I remember visiting the offices of Golin/Harris, Nintendo’s marketing consultants, and hearing them complain that major magazines like Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) couldn’t be bothered to review Virtual Boy games.</p>
<p>EGM ignored it, but Nintendo’s Tripod made an appearance in my other writing gig at the time, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-2-1_Contact#Magazine">3-2-1 Contact</a> magazine. My colleague, Rusel, wrote reviews for the entire Virtual Boy launch lineup, while I had the more enviable task of reviewing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> on the SNES. I must’ve drawn the long straw that month.</p>

<h2><strong>The Trade I Won, and then Lost</strong></h2>
<p>The Virtual Boy came and went quickly, but I wound up with a complete set of Nintendo-published VB games. Apparently, Golin/Harris and the Big N were eager to partner with any journalist willing to peer into the red abyss.</p>
<p>Roughly a decade later, I traded my dusty VB collection for a sweet haul of SNES RPGs, including both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/breath_of_fire">Breath of Fire</a><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/breath_of_fire_ii">s</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/lufia_and_the_fortress_of_doom">Lufia 1</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/lufia_ii_rise_of_the_sinistrals">2</a>, and every Square Enix RPG I didn’t already own.</p>
<p>I felt great about the trade at the time, but looking at prices now, yeah, I probably lost out in the long run. I undoubtedly won in the gameplay department, but with complete-in-box Virtual Boys selling for almost $1000, I clearly missed an investment opportunity.</p>
<figure data-uuid="7033ec41895fe"><a title="Virtual Boy" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7033ec41895fe/virtual-boy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Some old E3 press kits (which I sadly no longer have) with pages on unreleased VB games <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound_High!">Bound High</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Hopper">Dragon Hopper</a></strong> — <em><span></span> Image: Nathan Lockard</em></figcaption></figure>
<h2><strong>2026: Nintendo Owns the Meme</strong></h2>
<p>My personal journey with the VB concluded decades ago, but Nintendo seemed to exile their red spectacles for even longer. So, why the sudden comeback? And why now? I have two theories - one practical, and one cheeky.</p>
<p>First, it’s hard not to see this as a nod to <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/02/3ds-virtual-boy-emulation-gives-you-3d-without-the-headaches">last year’s release of Red Viper</a>, the impressive fan-made Virtual Boy emulator for Nintendo 3DS. After the homebrew community showcased an appetite for VB emulation, Nintendo may have taken the old proverb to heart: the best time to plant a tree (or re-release a tripod-mounted console) was 20 years ago; the second-best time is today (or February 17th 2026).</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/retro/related-articles:152750 @ 1768072099 -->
<p>My second theory may be cheeky, but is perhaps more likely. This revival could simply be corporate self-deprecation. Nintendo is finally cool enough to celebrate a misstep failure while simultaneously revelling in the Switch’s success. It reminds me of <a href="https://ew.com/catwoman-halle-berry-razzies-speech-exclusive-8680946">Halle Berry personally accepting her Razzie</a> for <strong>Catwoman</strong>, holding an Oscar in one hand and the Razzie in the other, proudly declaring that if you can't be a good loser, you don't deserve to be a good winner.</p>

<h2><strong>What’s Next?</strong></h2>
<p>Whatever the reason, the 30-year era of Nintendo pretending the Virtual Boy didn't exist is officially over. Nintendo is actively marketing a library of games that the 1995 media complex avoided reviewing, and I’m not sure what to believe anymore.</p>
<p>If the Virtual Boy can rise from the grave in 2026, then seemingly nothing is off the table. Who knows? Perhaps an official <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/mother_3">Mother 3</a> translation or a Zelda CDi All-Stars collection is right around the corner. At this point, nothing would surprise me.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout 1st Removed From Player Accounts After Being ‘Mistakenly Available’ For 18 Months]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-1st-removed-from-player-accounts/</link>
            <guid>1402501</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve never played Fallout 76, Bethesda Game Studios’ post-apocalyptic MMORPG, you’d be excused for having no idea what ‘Fallout 1st’ is. It’s the game’s premium and entirely optional subscription service that unlocks a wealth of bonuses, boosts, and advantages for subscribers, and historically, some have dubbed it a ‘pay-to-win’ service.</p>



<p>In recent social circles, news surfaced regarding the Fallout 1st subscription service, and it wasn’t good. It was claimed by some Japanese users that Bethesda Game Studios suddenly stripped them of their paid subscriptions without warning because the service <strong>wasn’t supposed to be available to Xbox users in Japan in the first place</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-76-subscriptions-stripped-from-japanese-gamers">Fallout 76 Subscriptions Stripped from Japanese Gamers</h2>



<p>Fallout 76 is a premium service that the most dedicated users pay a monthly (or yearly) fee to uphold. It unlocks various benefits, such as free monthly ‘Atoms’, exclusive cosmetics, fancy base-building items, handy storage containers, and the ability to <strong>host private servers</strong>.</p>



<p>If you’re anyone who is sinking time into Fallout 76, you should at least <strong>consider </strong>Fallout 1st, as the quality-of-life improvements it offers for the nearly decade-old MMORPG are insane.</p>



<p>However, certain users <strong>can’t </strong>take advantage of those bonuses as of a few days ago.</p>



<p>On social media, Japanese users started complaining that Bethesda Game Studios had stripped them of their Fallout 1st subscriptions without so much as a warning. In one post on Medium, a user explained that contacting Bethesda or Xbox’s support channels resulted in a stock message being offered:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Fallout 1st is not officially offered for Xbox in Japan. There was a period when it was mistakenly available.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As the story goes, Fallout 1st <strong><span>rarely</span> worked properly </strong>in Japan, for whatever reason. Suddenly, in April 2024, it popped up on the Japanese Xbox Store and <strong>stayed</strong>. Users could run their subscriptions without any issues, and it was a bountiful time to be a Fallout 76 fan within the territory of Japan.</p>



<p>Then, ‘around New Year’s Eve’, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/1q83g4h/japanese_xbox_user_fallout_1st_subscription_was/?utm_source=syndication&amp;pubDate=20260109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">players started explaining</a> that their subscriptions had been stripped from their accounts without any warning. If you <strong>have </strong>Fallout 1st, play for hundreds of hours, and then <strong>lose </strong>Fallout 1st, it can have a pretty dire knock on your experience, especially when it comes to storage of junk, ammunition, healing items, and so on.</p>



<p>On Reddit, one user explained the situation quite nicely:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>playing this game without fallout 1st is such a nightmare, and japanese are one of the biggest population contributor in xbox oce/sea region server, if the region lose them it will be kinda dead</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was reported that PlayStation 5 and Steam-based users <strong>have no issue </strong>running their Fallout 1st subscriptions in Japan.</p>



<p>As detailed <a href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/newsjp/fallout-76-20260106-399011/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Automaton</a>, a Japanese outlet, no official explanation has been offered by Bethesda Game Studios or Microsoft to explain why the service was a) suddenly made available, and b) removed from the grasp of Japanese users without warning.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[I replaced Windows with Linux and everything’s going great]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/tech/858910/linux-diary-gaming-desktop</link>
            <guid>1402489</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Greetings from the year of Linux on my desktop.</p><p>In November, I got fed up and said <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/823337/switching-linux-gaming-desktop-cachyos">screw it, I’m installing Linux</a>. Since that article was published, I have dealt with one minor catastrophe after another. None of that has anything to do with Linux, mind you. It just meant I didn’t install it on my desktop until Sunday evening.</p><p>My goal here is to see how far I can get using Linux as my main OS <em>without</em> spending a ton of time futzing with it — or even much time researching beforehand. I am not looking for more high-maintenance hobbies at this stage. I want to see if Linux is a wingable alternative to Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/821948/microsoft-windows-11-ai-agents-taskbar-integration">increasingly annoying OS</a>.</p><p>Honestly? So far it’s been fine. Many things I expected to be difficult — like getting my Nvidia graphics card working properly — were perfectly straightforward. A few things I thought would be simple weren’t. And I’ve run into one very funny issue with a gaming mouse that <em>only</em> works in games. But I’ve been able to use my Linux setup for work this week, I played exactly one video game, and I even printed something from my accursed printer.</p><div><p id="day-one"><h2>Day one</h2></p></div><p>I picked <a href="https://cachyos.org/">CachyOS</a> rather than a better-known distro like Ubuntu because it’s optimized for modern hardware, and I had heard that it’s easy to install and set up for gaming, which is one of the reasons I’d stuck with Windows for this long. After backing up my Windows image sometime in December (close enough), I follow the <a href="https://wiki.cachyos.org/installation/installation_on_root/">installation instructions in the Cachy wiki</a> and download the <a href="https://cachyos.org/">CachyOS</a> live image to a <a href="https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html">Ventoy</a> USB drive, plug it into my PC, reboot into the BIOS to disable Secure Boot, reboot again into the Ventoy bootloader, and launch the CachyOS disk image.</p><p>First challenge: My mouse buttons don’t work. I can move the cursor, but can’t click on anything. I try plugging in a mouse (without unplugging the first one), same deal. Not a major issue; I can get around fine with just the keyboard. Maybe this is just an issue with the live image.</p><p>I launch the installer and am thrust into analysis paralysis. An operating system needs lots of little pieces to work — stuff you don’t even think of as individual components if you use Mac or Windows. How do you boot into the OS? What runs the desktop environment? How are windows drawn? What’s the file system? Where do you get software updates? In Mac and Windows, all those decisions are made for you. But Linux is fundamentally different: The core of the OS is the kernel, and everything else is kind of up to you. A distro is just somebody’s idea of what pieces to use. Some, like <a href="https://system76.com/pop/?srsltid=AfmBOoqaheiCcxLI9c_91oVN7uwiR6EIckpvCR9HWEN3781ua9N_u3E3">Pop_OS!</a> and <a href="https://linuxmint.com/">Mint</a>, aim for simplicity and make all those choices for you (though you can still change them if you want). But Cachy is based on <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch</a>, a notoriously DIY distro, and before I do anything else, I have to pick one of four bootloaders. I pick Limine, for reasons I can’t recall.</p><p>Next, I need to figure out where to install it. On the recommendation of Will Smith from the <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2888221/check-out-pcworlds-new-linux-podcast.html"><em>Dual Boot Diaries</em> podcast</a> — from whom the “an operating system is a bunch of pieces” thing above is largely cribbed — I install Cachy on a different physical drive from Windows, since Windows updates tend not to care if they overwrite other bootloaders.</p><p>I have a 4TB storage drive with just over a terabyte of data on it, so I shrink that partition down to 2TB using the installer’s manual partitioning interface, then (following the guide) make a 2GB boot partition and a root partition using the btrfs file system. The guide says it needs at least 20GB, so I go big and make it 100GB. This will cause a minor problem later.</p><p>Next, I have to pick <a href="https://wiki.cachyos.org/installation/desktop_environments/">one of <em>thirteen</em> different desktop environments</a>. This is too many options. KDE and Gnome seem to be the best-supported for gaming, so I pick KDE. I could rabbit-hole on this, but I don’t.</p><p>And then I just have to pick a username and password and name the computer. After some thought, I go with Maggie, after my in-laws’ cat, who half the family calls Linux. She doesn’t answer to either name.</p><p>Installation takes six minutes. I reboot the computer, and it loads into the Limine bootloader, which has also found my Windows install, so I can choose between Cachy and Windows.</p><p>Then I’m on the Cachy desktop, and my mouse buttons <em>still</em> aren’t working. Swapping USB ports doesn’t do anything. Plugging in my trackball doesn’t fix it either. I finally try <em>unplugging</em> the mouse, which makes the trackball work normally. My gaming mouse is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2010/07/overkill-as-art-ars-reviews-the-cyborg-rat-7/">an ancient Mad Catz Cyborg RAT 7</a>; it turns out this is a <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Mad_Catz_Mouse">known issue</a>. I defer editing configuration files for now and just keep the mouse unplugged.</p><div><p id="stuff-that-works"><h2><strong>Stuff that works</strong></h2></p></div><p>That weird mouse aside, all of the hardware I’ve tried so far has just worked. Cachy automatically installed the correct GPU drivers; my monitor, speakers, and Logitech webcam work fine with no effort. Even my printer prints, with only a tweak to my firewall settings.</p><p>There are lots of ways to install apps on Linux. Sometimes you can just download them from a company’s website, or you get them from your distro’s official repositories, or GitHub, or wherever. There’s no official app store for Linux, but there are at least three projects aiming to provide universal Linux apps: Flatpak, AppImage, and Snap. Neat! Commence hodgepodging.</p><p>I grab Chromium, Discord, Slack, and Audacity using the “Install Apps” button on Cachy’s welcome screen. Slack I get from the Arch User Repository. Twenty minutes later, I try to install 1Password from the same location, but the repository is down. I pick up my kid from a playdate and try again. It works.</p><div><p id="whats-missing"><h2><strong>What’s missing</strong></h2></p></div><p>I prefer the Arc browser, which doesn’t have a Linux build, but there are plenty of browsers. Firefox and Chromium will do. I can’t find official apps for Airtable (which I use for work), Spotify, or Apple Music, but they all work fine in the browser in the short term, and I’ll revisit this later.</p><div><p id="shall-we-play-a-game"><h2><strong>Shall we play a game?</strong></h2></p></div><p>Cachy has a one-click gaming package install that includes the Proton compatibility layer, Steam, and <a href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/">Heroic</a> (a launcher for Epic, GOG, and Amazon). I figure I ought to try <em>one</em> game. Then I remember that my root partition is only 100GB. I reboot back into the Cachy live image and use the Parted utility to increase it to 1TB, then make a second btrfs partition in the remaining space. I reboot, log into Epic and GOG, and start downloading <em>The Outer Worlds</em>, a game from 2019 I’ve been playing a bit lately. It runs fine with Proton, and I can even sync my saves from the cloud. I play it for a few minutes with my trackball, remember I hate gaming on a trackball, and plug my gaming mouse back in. It works fine as long as I’m in the game, but outside the game, mouse clicks stop working again. It makes sense — the bug is on the desktop, not in games — but it’s very funny to have a gaming mouse that <em>only</em> works for gaming.</p><div><p id="the-children-yearn-for-the-mines"><h2><strong>The children yearn for the mines</strong></h2></p></div><p>The biggest issue I’ve had so far is <em>Minecraft: Bedrock Edition</em>. For some reason, Microsoft hasn’t prioritized making a Linux version of Bedrock. Java Edition works fine in Linux, but I play <em>Minecraft</em> with my kids, and they’re on Bedrock Edition on their iPads. There’s supposed to be a way to run the Android app with <a href="https://flathub.org/en/apps/io.mrarm.mcpelauncher">MCPE Launcher</a>, but I couldn’t get it to work. There’s also a project to get the Windows version running on Proton, which will be my next step.</p><div><p id="stuff-i-havent-tried-yet"><h2><strong>Stuff I haven’t tried yet</strong></h2></p></div><p>I hear good things about <a href="https://github.com/boltgolt/howdy?tab=readme-ov-file">howdy</a>, a Linux equivalent to Windows Hello face authentication, but I haven’t installed it yet. I hear the <a href="https://zen-browser.app/">Zen</a> browser is a good Arc alternative. I also haven’t gotten my cloud storage synced, configured git so I can compile programs from scratch, figured out a backup strategy, or tried much other hardware beyond what’s currently plugged into my computer. There’s a command-line Spotify player I want to try. I’ve only scratched the surface.</p><div><p>I did take the time to install a KDE Plasma <a href="https://store.kde.org/p/2136378">theme that makes it look like Windows XP,</a> though. Just because.</p></div><div><p id="regret-level-none"><h2><strong>Regret level: none</strong></h2></p></div><p>I’m well aware this is the honeymoon phase. And using Linux for less than a week isn’t exactly a flex. Many people use Linux. And I haven’t even tried doing anything particularly difficult, or playing a game that came out this decade. But so far it’s been a much easier transition than expected, and a quieter experience overall. My OS isn’t trying to change my browser or search engine to make some shareholder happy somewhere. It’s not nudging me to try some bullshit AI feature.</p><p>Will I go crawling back to macOS or Windows the first time I have to edit a batch of photos? Possibly! I’ll definitely boot back into Windows — or pull out a Chromebook — to play <em>Minecraft</em> with my kids, if I can’t get it running on Linux. And I don’t think I’ll ever be able to use Linux exclusively; my job as a reviews editor means I have to stay familiar with as many operating systems as possible. (This is a good way to drive yourself nuts.)</p><p>I’m sure I’ll run into plenty of fun problems soon enough. But the first few days have been great.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Mzk1"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Nathan Edwards</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/858910/linux-diary-gaming-desktop]]></content:encoded>

		<p>EpicTellers Entertainment has announced that those who have backed Starfinder: Afterlight with the closed beta access option will be able to play some of the early parts of the game in February. If you are interested in getting in on the closed beta, you can still back Starfinder: Afterlight on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/epictellers/starfinder-afterlight?ref=33q47w&amp;utm_source=steam&amp;utm_campaign=closedbeta&amp;utm_medium=steamnews&amp;utm_content=devpost">Kickstarter</a> which will grant access. Additionally, EpicTellers Entertainment has stated it is aiming to launch Starfinder: Afterlight’s early access in Q2 or Q3 this year.</p>

<p>Those who get to play the Starfinder: Afterlight closed beta will have the opportunity to experience the opening 45-60 minutes of Act 1’s gameplay, three pre-made character builds to try including Human Soldier, Vesk Envoy, and Shirren Operative, and to explore the Entertainment District of Hivemarket on Akiton. This opening section will also give players their first interactions with Preach, Sterling,&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Larva, which will contain full voice acting. Additional details about the closed beta are going to be announced closer to the time of release.</p>
<p>At full release, Starfinder Afterlight will have between 40 to 60 hours of gameplay, with multiple difficulty settings available for those who want everything from experiencing the story to challenging combat. There will be a full voice cast and Eduardo de la Iglesia is composing the soundtrack, and Starfinder Afterlight will also support mods. The game itself is a &nbsp;CRPG based on the Paizo’s sci-fi and fantasy tabletop RPG.</p>

<p>According to Alinea Analytics analyst Rhys Elliott, that means the four-year-old port has generated an estimated $300 million (£223m) for IP owner Microsoft.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, we learned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-developer-direct-showcase-january-2026">Microsoft has announced another Developer Direct, set to take place on the 22nd January</a>. It'll feature Fable and Beast of Reincarnation, as well as a "deep dive" into <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>, with a focus on gameplay and reveals of new features.</p>
<p>Forza Horizon 6 will be set in Japan, as revealed by Microsoft at this year's Tokyo Game Show. Not only that, it will be the biggest and "most full" of any map in the series so far.
</p>
<p>"This map that we've created for Japan, or Horizon's version of Japan, is big, but also dense," art director Don Arceta recently said. "There's always something around the corner for you to discover and see." What's more, the map will include Tokyo too - "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-6-will-integrate-japanese-culture-into-the-most-full-series-location-so-far">the biggest city that we've done in a Horizon game yet</a>."

            <guid>1402462</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Stevie Bonifield is a news writer here at </em>The Verge<em> and, they say, “I cover a little bit of just about everything, from the FCC to AI shopping tools to Linux.” Before joining our news team, they wrote weekend news for </em>PC Gamer <em>and did reviews, news, features, and guides for </em>Laptop Mag<em>, along with some stories for </em>Tom’s Guide, IGN, TechRadar<em>, and </em>XDA<em>. “I’ve been reading (and watching) </em>The Verge<em> since I was in high school,“ they add, ”so it’s pretty exciting to be part of the team now.“ </em></p><p><em>Outside of writing, Stevie says “I also love gaming, reading, and TTRPGs (tabletop roleplaying games). As you’ll probably be able to tell from my workspace, I’m kind of a total nerd.” </em></p><p><strong>Let’s begin with the basics. Where is your work space located?</strong></p><p>My desk and work space are in my bedroom. I share my apartment with a roommate, so we both work from our bedrooms so we don’t distract each other during the day. I don’t really mind not having a separate office — it means I only have to worry about decorating and managing one space instead of two. I recently moved to New Jersey from Pittsburgh, PA, so I’m still getting everything set up here.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>A VIVO adjustable desk, together with a Haworth Breck chair, makes working more comfortable.</em></figcaption></p></div><p><strong>Could you tell us about your desk and your chair?</strong></p><div><p>I’m using a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073K1JSW7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">VIVO 3-stage adjustable desk</a> with a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WQ117GP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">VIVO 60-inch desktop</a> and a <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D1025X1701640%26xs%3D1%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fstore.haworth.com%252Fproducts%252Fbreck-office-chair" rel="sponsored">Haworth Breck</a> chair. I got both when I moved last month, so I haven’t been using them for long, but I like them so far.</p></div><p>This is actually a standing desk, which I’ve never used before. I got it so I could have my desk height pretty low — I’m on the shorter side and most desks are too high for me. This one goes all the way down to 24 inches, lower than even I need, which is really nice. The option to use it as a standing desk is a cool perk, even though that isn’t what I bought it for. My cable management under the desk still needs some cleaning up, but I’m working on it! I have a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CV9P2FR5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">VIVO clamp-on cable management net</a> containing most of it for now.</p><p>I like the Haworth Breck so far, but it’s a pretty basic chair. Like my desk, a big part of why I got this one is its height range. It’s extremely difficult for me to find decent desk chairs that go as low as I need them to (<em>without</em> requiring a footrest). This one has a minimum seat height of around 15 inches and has adjustable seat depth, both of which I’ve really appreciated. That said, I wish it had a headrest.</p><p><strong>Tell us about the various tech devices you’re using. </strong></p><p>My setup is a little crazy because I have three different computers running to my two monitors.</p><div id=":R1j1djeab96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>A gaming PC with unfortunate issues.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>This desk side device lets laptops hang off the side of the desk.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>My gaming PC lives on the floor under my desk. It’s currently temporarily out of commission because I’m having a hardware issue. Unfortunately, my RAM seems to be on the fritz, which is pretty bad timing considering the current <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/839506/ram-shortage-price-increases-pc-gaming-smartphones">RAM pricing nightmare</a>. Most of it is still working, though! It has an AMD Ryzen 7 7700X CPU, an AMD Radeon RX 6600 GPU, an Asus ROG Strix B650-A motherboard, and a pair of 16GB Corsair Vengeance DDR5 RAM sticks (which apparently need to be replaced, after less than a year of use).</p><p>That’s also my Linux PC — it’s currently running Fedora 41 with the Cinnamon desktop environment, but I’m updating to Fedora 43 soon and planning to switch to the KDE Plasma desktop environment.</p><p>Hanging off the side of my desk are my work and personal laptops, both the M4 MacBook Air. My laptops are only connected to my left monitor, which is a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZTBVKKW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">27-inch 1440p Viewsonic Omni (VX2728J-2K)</a>. My gaming PC is connected to both monitors. I mainly play games on the right monitor since it has better color accuracy. It’s a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CV24GQ9W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">27-inch 1440p Asus ROG Strix gaming monitor (XG27ACS)</a>.</p><p>Neither one of my monitors is anything fancy, but both are good enough for my needs. Between the two, I would probably recommend the ROG one more, although I’m not a huge fan of the buttons being located on the back since I need those to swap input modes so I can switch to my Mac. When I’m working during the day I usually have my work laptop running on the left monitor and my Linux PC on the right monitor. My keyboard and mouse I chose specifically because they make it easy to jump between all my devices.</p><div id=":R1k9djeab96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>The Nuphy Halo75 V2 with Nuphy’s Mint switches.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>This mouse is Stevie’s favorite right now.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>I’ve reviewed quite a few keyboards, so it’s a little ironic that the one I’m using now I actually haven’t reviewed. It’s the <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/nuphy-Mechancial-Swappable-Bluetooth-Raspberry/dp/B0D5Q5XYLV?sr=8-2&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Nuphy Halo75 V2</a> with Nuphy’s Mint switches. It sounds and feels great, works really smoothly with macOS, and I can jump between my laptops and PC with a quick keyboard shortcut. The battery life could be a bit better, but admittedly I leave the RGB on, so that’s probably not helping. Overall, though, I really like the design and sound quality on the Halo75 — it’s one of the only keyboards I’ve tried that I’m happy with out-of-the-box without making any DIY customizations.</p><p>My mouse is actually one of my favorite devices right now. I’ve tested some great gaming mice, but this one is my personal daily driver and not one I reviewed. It’s the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22403511/razer-orochi-v2-wireless-gaming-mouse-battery-life-custom-price-features">Razer Orochi V2</a>, and I got it on sale for $35 on Amazon earlier this year. It’s nothing fancy, but the size and feel are perfect for me. Most gaming mice feel kind of enormous in my hand, but I swear Razer designed the Orochi for my palm specifically. Like my keyboard, it’s also able to jump between a Bluetooth connection and a 2.4GHz dongle. Despite the budget-friendly price, it’s a great mouse.</p><p>Underneath that I’m currently using a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09GWBBPXK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Matrix Blizzard mousepad</a>. I got it on Amazon, but unfortunately, I think it’s sold out now. I wanted something with a little bit of a design going on, but not anything too detailed or distracting. This design just about perfectly fit what I was looking for. I wish it was a tad thicker, but it’s more interesting than a plain black mousepad, and that’s good enough for me.</p><p>I have two controllers on my desk, a <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Gaming-Controller-Headsets-Console/dp/B0F1HTGDTL?sr=8-2&amp;tag=theverge02-20">standard Xbox controller</a> for my Mac and the <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Xbox-One-X-S-Windows/dp/B09C13DWYL?sr=1-1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">wired Razer Wolverine V2</a> for my gaming PC. I don’t normally like wired controllers, but I really love the Wolverine. The clicky buttons on Razer controllers are so satisfying to me, and they tend to offer consistently good performance in my experience. My favorite mobile controller is also from Razer, the <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Gaming-Controller-Android-iPhone-Smartphone/dp/B0CXGMPLWK?sr=1-1&amp;ufe=app_do:amzn1.fos.9fe8cbfa-bf43-43d1-a707-3f4e65a4b666&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Kishi Ultra</a>.</p><p>My preferred headphones are my <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Translation-Headphones-High-Fidelity/dp/B0FQFB8FMG?sr=1-3&amp;tag=theverge02-20">AirPods Pro 3</a>. The ANC and spatial audio is fantastic for watching shows and movies on my laptop (and helps me focus when I’m working). I don’t like wearing earbuds all the time, though, so I also keep a basic pair of on-ear Sony headphones around, the <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-CH520-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone/dp/B0BS1QB15L?sr=1-2&amp;tag=theverge02-20">WH-CH250</a>. The audio quality on these isn’t particularly impressive, but they’re super affordable.</p><p>Last, but certainly not least, I also have a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Seiren-Chroma-Microphone-Mute/dp/B0CT7D7JVR?sr=8-2&amp;ufe=app_do:amzn1.fos.9fe8cbfa-bf43-43d1-a707-3f4e65a4b666&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Razer Seiren V3 Chroma</a> mic off to the side of my desk on a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B091TL554W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">clamp-on mic arm</a> I got on Amazon. I’ve been using the Seiren for a couple years now for gaming and playing <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> with my online group. The audio quality could be a bit better, but it’s a significant improvement over most built-in headphone mics, and I’ve never had any bugs or issues with it. Notably, it works on Linux for me without needing any tweaks or work-arounds.</p><p><strong>That is a great laptop holder you have at the side of your desk. What is it?</strong></p><p>I just got that when I moved last month, and it’s one of my favorite additions to my desk setup. It’s a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CQX3WTB8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">double-decker laptop mount</a> I got for around $30 on Amazon and just clamps onto the side of my desk (no screws necessary!).</p><p>I wanted to free up some desk space, and this lets me keep both of my laptops nearby and out of the way at the same time. I also used a command strip to stick a USB-C hub to the back of the laptop tray, so I can quickly hop between my personal and work laptops on my external monitor by just moving over the USB-C cable and charging cable.</p><p><strong>Great wall decorations. Tell us a bit about your Elmville map and what surrounds it.</strong></p><p>This is the wall across from my desk that people see when I have my webcam on, so I put all my coolest stuff on it. I’m a huge fan of <a href="https://watch.dropout.tv/dimension-20"><em>Dimension 20</em></a> on Dropout, so I immediately picked up one of those Elmville maps when they released them. For those who haven’t checked out <em>Dimension 20</em> yet, Elmville is the main setting for <em>Fantasy High</em>, one of the best shows Dropout has to offer, in my humble opinion.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>There is a lot of really cool stuff up on the wall across from the desk.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The smaller horizontal picture below the map is actually a page from Dropout’s 2025 <em>Dimension 20</em> calendar that I got at their Madison Square Garden show last January. It’s a scene from season 2 of <em>Fantasy High</em>, and I just thought the artist did such a great job with it that it deserved to be framed. Off to the right above that one is a print I got from an art convention. It’s not from any show or movie as far as I know; the design just resonated with me.</p><p>The two smaller prints above the map are also from art conventions and were made by the same artist, <a href="https://www.1000deaddraculas.com/">Natasha Tara Petrović</a>. The purple one is some cool Mothman art — I have a soft spot for cryptids and spooky stuff. The blue one is a <em>Dark Souls</em> print that makes the game look <em>way</em> cozier than it is.</p><p>And last but not least, I’ve got some <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B83GQKR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Nanoleaf Elements</a> tiles lighting up that wall. These are the first smart lights I’ve ever bought, and they’re pretty cool, especially with the more mellow wood look. I have them set to shift colors and brightness throughout the day.</p><p><strong>You’re obviously into <em>Star Wars</em> and other science fiction / fantasy worlds, judging from the toys over your bookcase and the figures on that little shelf. Are you a serious fan or do you just like the genre?</strong></p><p>I am a huge <em>Star Wars</em> fan. One of my earliest memories is watching <em>The Phantom Menace</em> on VHS, and I’ve loved the franchise ever since. Obi-Wan is my favorite character, which I’m noticing is a bit obvious in my work space.</p><p>The lightsaber above my bookcase is Obi-Wan’s from<em> The Phantom Menace</em>. I’ve had it since probably kindergarten or first grade, so it’s a little beat up. And next to that I’ve got a special edition Obi-Wan Funko Pop. Then above my desk I have a Lego model of Obi-Wan’s Jedi starfighter from <em>Attack of the Clones</em>.</p><p>On the shelf below that I’ve managed to squeeze in the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> series minifigures I’ve collected (I’m a few shy of the full collection). These shelves ended up being way smaller than expected, so I’m planning to add more so things aren’t quite so cramped. I thought Lego did a great job with these <em>D&amp;D</em> minifigures, though, and would love to see them do more <em>D&amp;D</em> sets. My personal favorite from this series is the dragonborn paladin.</p><div id=":R1ppdjeab96:"><div><div><p><figcaption><em> Obi-Wan’s lightsaber from </em>The Phantom Menace <em>along with some Funko Pops.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>A Lego model of Obi-Wan’s Jedi starfighter.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><div><div><p><figcaption><em>A collection of </em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons<em> series minifigures.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>And finally, the rock collection.</em></figcaption></p></div></div></div><p>The other Funko Pop next to Obi-Wan is Vi from <em>Arcane</em>, which is a truly phenomenal show and a personal favorite of mine. I’m not much of a Funko Pop person, but I’ll get them from time to time if it’s a character I really like.</p><p>I guess I would say I’m a serious sci-fi and fantasy fan, although I tend to connect with specific series or books and stick with those. To go back to the <em>Star Wars</em> example, on one of the lower shelves in my bookcase, I have most of the old <em>Jedi Apprentice</em> books. They’ve gotten pretty hard to find, but I loved them as a kid, so I’m trying to collect them all again.</p><p>On the fantasy side of things, I love epic fantasy like <em>Lord of the Rings</em>, but also like some YA books, especially <em>The Hunger Games</em> and <em>Percy Jackson</em>. At the moment, I’m reading <em>The Name of the Wind</em> by Patrick Rothfuss and <em>Brigands &amp; Breadknives</em> by Travis Baldree, which is the third book in his <em>Legends &amp; Lattes</em> series. Both are great, although they have drastically different tones.</p><p><strong>You also have a rock collection!</strong></p><p>I do! Much like a goldfish, it has grown to fill the size of its container, and now it can grow no more. I’ve always had an interest in geology and have had some of the rocks and minerals in that case since I was a kid.</p><p>I have a bunch of quartz, a geode, some copper, chalcopyrite, amazonite, dravite, moissanite, a sliver of obsidian, a lump of basalt, some feldspar and sedimentary rocks, and a bunch of smaller tumbled stones. There’s also a chunk of petrified wood in the back that I found in a streambed. My favorites are the chunk of amber in the front and the bismuth above it — I love how bismuth crystals get that neat geometric shape.</p><p><strong>Anything else I missed that you’d like to add?</strong></p><p>While I don’t use it for work, my <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.kobobooks.com%2Fproducts%2Fkobo-clara-bw" rel="sponsored">Kobo Clara BW e-reader</a> is almost always on my desk. My bookcases are pretty much full (and a bit small — I’m planning to replace them eventually), so I’ve been reading more ebooks over the past year or so.</p><p>I switched from a Kindle to a Kobo several months ago and have been loving the Kobo. The display and user experience on the Clara are better than their Kindle counterparts in my experience, and you have more freedom to add books from outside Kobo’s store and back up everything in your library on other devices. My Kobo is in my everyday carry now, although in hindsight, I wish I’d gotten one with a color display.</p><p><em>Photography by Stevie Bonifield</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6ODAzMzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Stevie Bonifield</span></span></span></li><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzA3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Barbara Krasnoff</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/850479/desk-pc-keyboard-razer-kobo]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1402459</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://play.date/games/diora/"><em>Diora</em></a> might be the most ambitious game I’ve played on the Playdate. It’s all about perspective: You turn the handheld’s crank to rotate your viewpoint of the bite-size 3D landscapes, which lets you peek around corners to find solutions to various puzzles. On a device with a 1-bit, black-and-white display, the miniature worlds feel miraculous, like little dioramas you can spin around in your hands. But the most impressive part is the puzzles that will have you twisting your brain as much as the crank.</p><p>In <em>Diora</em> you play a “network technician” traveling to various locations across a city, fixing up machinery in the wake of a strange accident. Repairing things is easy; all you have to do is reach the computer at the end of each level. Getting there is the hard part.</p><p><em>Diora</em> starts out relatively simple. You hit switches to open up gates or push platforms to create pathways. What makes these familiar puzzles interesting, though, is how <em>Diora</em> plays with your viewpoint. You have to constantly shift where you’re looking to find the right way forward. This can turn even seemingly simple challenges into real brain-scratchers. Each level also steadily ratchets up the intensity. Most have you exploring multi-level structures where the first few floors introduce a concept before hitting you with something more complex.</p><p>It’s reminiscent of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24317107/monument-valley-3-netflix-launch-ustwo-games-interview"><em>Monument Valley</em></a> or <em>Fez</em>, though <em>Diora</em> is different in a few key ways. For one, the architecture (mostly) isn’t filled with M.C. Escher-inspired impossibilities, but instead buildings and structures rooted in reality. And whereas <em>Monument Valley</em> is an almost serene experience, <em>Diora</em> can get <em>really</em> hard. I found myself stuck on more than one occasion, as many of the solutions involve making decisions in a very precise order. There’s no hint system to help you out, which can be frustrating, but <em>Diora</em> does at least have a checkpoint system that means you won’t be replaying huge chunks of the game after making a mistake.</p><p>This game is also a good sign that, a few years after launch, developers are really pushing the edges of what the Playdate is capable of. There aren’t many 3D titles on the handheld, and <em>Diora</em> has a sort of grittiness that both fits the Playdate’s aesthetic and lends the game a surprisingly chill postapocalyptic vibe. <em>Diora</em> even has a built-in level editor so you can create your own puzzles.</p><p>Not long ago I wrote that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/811497/playdate-puzzle-game-reviews-lexgrid-togglebot-what-time-is-it">one of the Playdate’s strengths was its steadily growing library of puzzle games</a>. They suit the device perfectly: experiences you can play in short bursts when you’re on the go, but also lose yourself in when you’re traveling or otherwise killing time. <em>Diora</em> is right near the top of the list of games I’d recommend; it’s technically impressive, but more importantly, it’s a puzzler that forces your brain to see things in different ways.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/859675/diora-review-playdate-monument-valley]]></content:encoded>

			<p>British developer <strong>Playground Games</strong> will be the absolute star of the <strong>Xbox Developer Direct 2026</strong>, with the first in-depth look at the long-awaited <strong>Fable</strong> reboot and the proper reveal of <strong>Forza Horizon 6</strong>, a sequel to a massively successful game that is estimated to have been played by over 50 million users. Sure, there's also Game Freak's Beast of Reincarnation and even a <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-features-secret-fourth-game-says-insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored 'secret' fourth game</a>, but those two games are going to be the centerpiece of the showcase due to air on <strong>January 22</strong>.</p>



<p>Officially, both Fable and Forza Horizon 6 are only announced for <strong>PC</strong> and <strong>Xbox Series S|X</strong>. However, given <strong>Microsoft</strong>'s multiplatform policy, they are almost certainly coming to other platforms, starting with <strong>Sony's PlayStation 5</strong> console. Forza Horizon 5 launched in April 2025 on PS5 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-best-selling-game-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">performed extremely well there</a>, after all, which is why some users were surprised when the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-is-coming-to-pc-xbox-consoles-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got announced only for Microsoft's traditional platforms</a> a few months ago.</p>



<p>A few hours ago, speaking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jph13-tKWcY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the latest episode (#154) of the VGC podcast</a>, Andy Robinson shared why that might be the case. According to his sources at Playground, Forza Horizon 6 simply wasn't ready to launch on PS5 right away, but Fable very well might. </p>



<p><em>Fable's day and date. That's what I've been told. Those are the sort of details where insiders misstep, right? Those are the sorts of details that can be changed a week before or a day before. The other stuff is kind of like a bit more set in stone. Yes, it's coming to PlayStation 5. I'd expect it to be day and date because I know they've been targeting PS5 for a while. </em></p>



<p><em>[as for] Forza Horizon 6, I mean, I don't know the full story of Forza, but the explanation I was told by someone who was there was, like, it just wasn't ready. I don't know how true that is, because I mean, it's going to be absolutely massive, but that game would be absolutely massive if it's launching on everything day one, right? You'd kind of think that's a bit of a hindrance for them. I mean, even Xbox stalwarts are starting to drift away from playing on the console now. It'll have a humongous PC launch, but PS5 I mean, look at like Indiana Jones: The Great Circle. It did so well when it came out on PS5 afterwards. I imagine they'll do their best to get that out as soon as they can.</em></p>



<p>It is indeed surprising, but Playground wouldn't want to delay the launch of FH6 just to wait for the PS5 version to be ready. After all, there's now evidence that even the very late launch of FH5 resonated strongly with the PlayStation community; a few months shouldn't be a problem. On the other hand, launching Fable immediately on all major platforms should enhance the game's visibility.</p>



<p>Neither game has a specific release window yet, but that should change at the aforementioned Xbox Developer Direct 2026. Currently, though, it is believed that Playground will start off with Forza Horizon 6 somewhere in Q2, while Fable will probably debut later in the year (although likely still before GTA 6, if at all possible).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342952/best-runs-of-agdq-2025-speedrunning-charity-twitch">Games Done Quick</a>, the biannual charity speedrunning event currently going on right now, not only helps organizations like the Prevent Cancer Foundation and Doctors Without Borders — it helps indie games get noticed, too. Indie game developers face an incredible uphill battle not only getting their projects funded, completed, and launched, but discovered as well. Events like GDQ can be a boon to developers, exposing tens of thousands of viewers to little-known games like <em>Bat to the Heavens</em>, <em>Small Saga</em>, and more.</p><p>“It was extremely exciting,” said Ceroro, developer of <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3044100%2FBat_to_the_Heavens%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Bat to the Heavens</em></a>, a platformer in which the character must ascend to the heavens using a bat because she cannot jump. <em>Bat to the Heavens</em> is Ceroro’s first official game and was released in 2024. It was featured during Awesome Games Done Quick 2026 and late last year at <a href="https://horaro.org/rtaij/rtaijw2025">RTA in Japan</a>. Ceroro said that while her game has been generally successful, getting on GDQ gave it a big boost. “Right after the AGDQ run, there was a large burst in sales and wishlists I haven’t seen since I initially released the game!” she said.</p><p>Solo developer Darya Noghani said <a href="https://smallsaga.com/"><em>Small Saga</em></a>, her turn-based RPG about a mouse who wants to kill god, got a nice uptick in attention after being featured at GDQ as well. “A number of streamers played the game on Twitch, several commenters recommended the game on platforms like Bluesky, and there was a nice uptick in sales,” they said.</p><p>But the attention of getting your game run at a GDQ event can come with a price. “You’re in a state of apprehension,” said Noghani. Speedrunners extensively exploit glitches and develop techniques to skip large chunks of gameplay, which might show viewers a less-than-ideal version of the game. “Runners are pushing the game to break in particular ways, and you know this is adjacent to the game just crashing and ruining the run.”</p><p>But Noghani also said that the <em>Small Saga </em>run was relatively glitch-free: “I’ll take that as a win.”</p><p>Sometimes a runner breaking a game is what the developer had in mind. “Exploits and glitches are something that taps into the nature of game design,” Ceroro said. While the <em>Bat to the Heavens </em>run also didn’t make extensive use of glitches, “A lot of the extreme movement and techniques used in the run are pretty much within bounds of the intended design,” she said.</p><p>Ceroro’s also not worried that watching a speedrun of <em>Bat to the Heavens</em> will spoil the game for potential new players. “The speedrun for <em>Bat to the Heavens</em> went by too fast to actually get a good understanding of everything or how the game actually feels, so it’ll be a shock to new players,” she said.</p><p>Thanks to GDQ, new players are coming. But while all the developers I spoke to were pleased with the newfound attention and increased sales, they also said the personal achievement of getting their game run at GDQ was just as important.</p><p>“It’s been exciting,” said Noghani. “Because GDQ is genuinely well-loved by both players and developers, not just for its charitable causes, but because of the efforts they’ve taken to cultivate an uplifting community.”</p><p>GDQ is much beloved in the online gaming community. Over the years, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/7/23341082/awesome-games-done-quick-2023-online-event-florida-ron-desantis">event runners have implemented a top-down approach</a> to diversity and inclusion, hosting <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/site/blackinaflash">several</a> <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/site/framefatales">smaller events</a> focused on highlighting streamers from marginalized backgrounds. GDQ has also fostered a community where saying “trans rights” elicits the same kind of enthusiastic response that an OSU alum would get <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2180057762412949">shouting “O-H”</a> in a crowded Columbus bar.</p><p>“In the development community, it’s a giant moment,” said Xalavier Nelson Jr., creative director at <em>Space Warlord Organ Trading Simulator </em>developer Strange Scaffold, which has had <a href="https://youtu.be/PevqoNW1ktg?si=VPZCw0Pze-wnE6Up">its games featured in GDQ events</a>. “I got about as many congratulations for appearing on Games Done Quick as I have for getting married. It’s that much of a touchstone — and that positive of an overall event and community.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/859891/awesome-games-done-quick-2026-indie-games-small-saga]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The online multiplayer mech base building and looter SAND: Raiders of Sophie is going to be releasing in March for PC, with <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10010847/">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/games/store/sand-raiders-of-sophie/9ng0ffht5mcb">Xbox Series XS</a> versions available to wishlist now too. Publisher tinyBuild and developer Hologryph announced the news with a brand new trailer that showcases different elements of SAND: Raiders of Sophie’s gameplay, including the mech base building, combat between the mechs, and looting areas in a procedurally generated map.</p>
<p><iframe title="SAND: Raiders Of Sophie | Release Month Reveal | Explosive Multiplayer Mech Action" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W0bcDA5y3yQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>SAND: Raiders of Sophie is set in an alternate 1910s where players can search for resources amongst the ruins of Sophie, and to settle scores. This can be done alone but the emphasis is on squad play, where players team up to build their walking bases known as Tramplers. These walking bases are a mix of a central base, a vehicle to help navigate the world, and a weapons platform that can engage in battle with other Tramplers. How Tramplers are constructed is up to the players with each one being fully customisable, so they can have their own layouts and looks.</p>
<p>Exploration is not limited to moving the Trampler from place to place. Players can walk around the world on foot and engage in PvPvE battles, taking on players from different Tramplers as well as the undead original inhabitants of Sophie. A price and exact date is yet to be confirmed for SAND: Raiders of Sophie, but at least we know it is not too far away.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Review: Fire Emblem: Path Of Radiance (GameCube) - Aged & Easier Than You're Used To, But Still A Winner]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/gamecube/fire-emblem-path-of-radiance</link>
            <guid>1402420</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161437/large.jpg"></a></figure><p>Did you know that the Japanese version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/fire_emblem_path_of_radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a> has a 'Maniac' difficulty mode? You did? And did you know that this mode sort of fixes my biggest problem with the game? You did? Can I do the review anyway? Thanks.</p>
<p>Jumping back into Path of Radiance, the first home console FE, for the first time since all the way back at Christmas 2005 (I got <strong>Goblet of Fire</strong> underwear, thanks for asking), my one complaint from 20 years ago remains an issue: it's all a little bit too easy, most especially if you're a big fan who's been hoovering up the newer stuff and becoming a strategy master in the meantime. Veterans may find even the toughest of the three available difficulty options — appropriately titled 'Difficult' — too sedate for their tastes.</p>
<p>But let's park that one specific point for a moment, because as important as it may be, it doesn't manage to derail what's still a fantastic slice of vintage <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/fire_emblem">Fire Emblem</a> goodness. Path of Radiance tells one of the series' strongest stories, you see. In fact, it's a story so strong (no spoilers ahead, I promise) that, regardless of how the combat may have aged over two decades, no matter how much sharper, more detailed and intricate the newer games are, this one still delivers a lot to love.</p>
<figure><a title="Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161432/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Path of Radiance is one of two FE games (the 'Tellius Duology' if you're down with the lingo) set on the continent of Tellius, with the other being its immediate follow-up on Wii, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/fire_emblem_radiant_dawn">Radiant Dawn</a>. So, upon locking into this one, you're all set for a doubleheader of epic proportions to disappear into. Which, let's face it, is exactly what everyone could be doing with right about now. *points at now*</p>
<p>Taking control of Ike, a member of the Greil Mercenaries, your job in Tellius as you join the action is to defend the borders of Crimea, a region of humans, against attacks and incursions from neighbouring Gallia, which is full of monsters. Because of course it is. Before long, things go quite spectacularly south, with the Crimean capital falling to invaders, and Ike and company spiralling into an arduous journey of revenge and justice-seeking. That's where we come in.</p>
<p>I won't detail anything further in terms of the story but it's fairly clear that, as the first Fire Emblem to feature voice acting (and 3D character models, maps, and battle locations) they went all-in, and as a result we get a banging narrative to jump into alongside battles that, whilst absolutely a little slow and cumbersome looking back from further down the series line, still provide the goods that series stalwarts thirst for.</p>
<figure><a title="Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161435/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>This is, after all, an entry that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-fire-emblem-games-of-all-time?page=2">consistently ranks highly in best-of lists</a>, and once you dig in, regardless of all the time that's passed, you'll find it sinks its hooks in fast. It's one of those timeless, classic numbers you hear old people (me) banging on about. Furthermore, and it's an important detail in the grand scheme of things, once you've played through this wondrous thing, you're all set up, fully locked and loaded, to dive into Radiant Dawn, which is another cracker, though one which is unfortunately exclusive to Wii at the time of writing.</p>
<p>So, you've got a great story here (one that will likely lead you into playing the next part), it still looks and plays really nicely, and the combat? Even when a Fire Emblem game has got a little long in the tooth, that core turn-based strategy goodness sings.</p>
<p>The face-offs here stick to the series formula of a rock-paper-scissors weapons triangle at the heart of the action. So, axes over lances, swords over axes, lances over swords - you know the score. Path of Radiance then adds slick 3D battle sequences to the action. Okay, so they were slicker back in 2005, but luckily you can turn off these extended animations for clashes, making for quicker fights all around. Indeed, once you've switched these off, it's hard to tell the game is really that old at all, given how great the text menu avatars and scenery all look. Even the rumble support is on point.</p>
<figure><a title="Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161429/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Path of Radiance also brings Luguz enemies to the table - transforming, lycanthropic foes who will shape-shift throughout battles into other forms such as birds or even dragons. It makes for encounters which feel elevated from the run-of-the-mill stuff of the time. They still feel strategically whip-smart, and are then further enhanced by a cool Bonus XP system that rewards efficiency (in turn pushing you to up your game and engage with all of your options) and, of course, permadeath. Oh, sweet permadeath, how you infuse everything with a touch more excitement and meaning. And tears.</p>
<p>And, really, excitement and meaning (and tears) are what you're getting. Over the course of 40ish hours, this one still has the power to razzle-dazzle with its magical melding of strategy and a story that adds drama where it needs it, whilst also introducing a plethora of entertaining friends and foes.</p>
<p>It might not be the latest or greatest Fire Emblem, then, but Path of Radiance is certainly well up there, and now that we've got it so easily to hand via NSO on Switch 2, it's really hard to criticise its gentle ageing all that harshly. Get over the fact it's not quite as feature-complete as your <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fire_emblem_engage">Engages</a> or your <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fire_emblem_three_houses">Three Houses</a>, and you'll soon find yourself all wrapped up in an adventure that's sucked me in all over again.</p>
<figure><a title="Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161426/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>Now. Where can I find a copy of Radiant Dawn that isn't more expensive than a holiday?</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance still has the power to pleasantly surprise, bringing strategically satisfying battles in the signature series style, alongside a story that packs in plenty of fun characters and big moments across its running time. Yes, it's aged a bit, the 3D battle cutaways (which you can switch off) are a bit naff two decades on, and it's not as swish as the newer entries, but that's all to be expected.</p>
<p>Look past a little dust and time-weathered rough edges, and there's a wonderful time to be had here that leads you right into an equally excellent sequel.</p></section>

<p>Over the past week, a rumour about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> getting a "surprise" DLC expansion popped up online after Polish Noble Securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski mentioned how he was expecting a "paid add-on" for the game to be released as early as March 2026.</p>
<p>This was reportedly backed up by a Polish leaker known as 'Borys Nieśpielak', who claimed Fool's Theory (the Polish development team behind the upcoming remake of the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2022/10/the-witcher-remake-announced-rebuilt-in-unreal-engine-5">first Witcher game</a>) was involved in this new content (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-witcher-3-is-reportedly-getting-a-surprise-new-expansion-this-year/">via VGC</a>).</p><div><figure data-videoid="U0vFWbkMXWk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U0vFWbkMXWk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytU0vFWbkMXWk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/U0vFWbkMXWk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U0vFWbkMXWk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402be5jzgkoq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Now, in another development, <a href="https://pl.ign.com/wiedzmin-3/69405/news/wiedzmin-3-nowe-dlc-zabierze-nas-na-pustynie-ujawniamy-nasze-informacje-sprzed-lat-i-rzucamy-nowe-sw">IGN Poland has added fuel to the fire</a>, claiming it first heard about a new expansion for Witcher 3 years ago, but didn't publish anything as it was unable to corroborate this information. Here's what the Polish website was apparently told at the time, according to PC Gamer. Keep in mind there has been no official confirmation about a new expansion or what content it might include.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"IGN Poland said its source at the time claimed the new expansion would take players to the far-off desert of Zerrikania, which is mentioned in passing at a few points in The Witcher games. Zerrikania is also different enough from The Witcher kingdoms we already know that it could be a place where, for instance, Ciri could successfully undergo the Trial of the Grasses"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One other factor supposedly fueling this rumour is the news CD Projekt needs to generate around $277 million by the end of 2026 to achieve an "incentive program target". It's a goal one investor believes would be "extremely" tough without any new content this year (with the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/witcher_4">Witcher 4</a> not expected to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-confirms-the-witcher-4-not-releasing-in-2026-new-trilogy-sticking-to-6-year-plan/">release anytime soon</a>), so a DLC for the existing title could definitely help the company reach its target.</p>
<p>Chrzanowski also recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-expansion-rumours-analyst-100-percent-certain-cd-projekt-red-will-release-significant-new-content-this-year">told Eurogamer</a> that CD Projekt Red was still short of its goal, with just "five quarters remaining", which "implies the need for something significantly larger than just another update or a version for a niche platform".</p>
<p>We'll try not to get too ahead of ourselves here, but If this expansion is the real deal, it would no doubt be the prime opportunity for CD Projekt Red to consider a Switch 2 Edition of The Witcher 3. And it's already proven what it's capable of on Nintendo's new hybrid system with its excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> port.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[GameStop Is Reportedly Shutting Down Hundreds of US Stores as Its CEO Might Get $35 Billion ‘Long-Term’ Bonus]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/gamestop-reportedly-shutting-down-hundreds-us-stores/</link>
            <guid>1402390</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>GameStop</strong>, the largest retailer dedicated to videogames, is reportedly <strong>shutting down hundreds of stores in the United States</strong>. </p>



<p>The reports started appearing on social media and were quickly conflated into one very long list on the '<a href="https://gsclosing.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameStop Closing List'</a> blog, which reckons there are at least <strong>410 GameStop stores confirmed to be closing</strong> and another 11 reported but as of yet unconfirmed.</p>



<p>This is only the latest round of closures for the retailer headquartered in Grapevine, Texas. In the annual 10-K SEC filing <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000162828025014731/gme-20250201.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">issued in February 2025</a>, the company stated:</p>



<p><em>We have also initiated a comprehensive store portfolio optimization review which involves identifying stores for closure based on many factors, including an evaluation of current market conditions and individual store performance. This review, among other things, resulted in the closure of 590 stores in the United States in fiscal 2024. While this review is ongoing and a specific set of stores has not been identified for closure, we anticipate closing a significant number of additional stores in fiscal 2025.</em></p>



<p>The employees being let go are understandably furious, especially since the latest wave of cuts occurred shortly after another SEC filing was issued this Wednesday, January 7, when GameStop <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638026000004/pressrelease-rclti.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> a massive performance-based stock option for its current CEO, <strong>Ryan Cohen</strong>. Cohen, who assumed the role on September 28, 2023, is the largest individual shareholder and stands to gain up to <strong>$35 billion</strong> (yes, you read that right), albeit with a massive caveat: the company’s market capitalization would have to grow to $100 billion and the company would need to achieve $10 billion in Cumulative Performance EBITDA.</p>



<p>Considering that GameStop's current market <span>capitalization as of yesterday's closing was&nbsp;<strong>$9.51 billion</strong>, Cohen would have to somehow stage a 10-fold market capitalization</span> growth to receive his full bonus. Granted, there is a precedent: in January 2021, a short squeeze <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-shares-soar-70-as-short-sellers-account-hacked-children-harassed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">caused the company's stock to </a><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/gamestop-shares-soar-70-as-short-sellers-account-hacked-children-harassed/" target="_blank">surge significantly</a>, briefly reaching an</span> astounding pre-market value of <strong>$500 per share</strong> on January 28, almost thirty times the share's valuation earlier that month. Even then, though, the market cap only reached $33.7 billion, still quite far from that $100 billion threshold required by Cohen's bonus. And with the constant shift toward digital games, it's hard to imagine how the company could achieve such a high valuation. </p>



<p>There are, however, nine vesting tranches, the first of which is definitely more achievable for the executive.</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Tranche</strong></td><td><strong>% of Award</strong></td><td><strong>Market Cap Hurdle</strong></td><td><strong>Cumulative Performance EBITDA Hurdle</strong></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>10%</td><td>$20 Billion</td><td>$2.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>10%</td><td>$30 Billion</td><td>$3.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>10%</td><td>$40 Billion</td><td>$4.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>10%</td><td>$50 Billion</td><td>$5.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>10%</td><td>$60 Billion</td><td>$6.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>10%</td><td>$70 Billion</td><td>$7.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>10%</td><td>$80 Billion</td><td>$8.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>15%</td><td>$90 Billion</td><td>$9.0 Billion</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>15%</td><td>$100 Billion</td><td>$10.0 Billion</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>By the way, GameStop is also restructuring its operations in other countries. They sold their Italian operations, closed down in Germany, Ireland, Switzerland, and Austria, and shared their intent to sell the Canadian branch. Now, <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/business/583322/eb-games-proposes-closing-all-new-zealand-stores" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to RNZ</a>, they might be looking to close in New Zealand, too, although the proposal is apparently 'not final'. They currently have 38 stores there.</p>
