		<p>Cosmoscouts and Indie.io have announced that the sci-fi FPS Moon Mystery is coming to consoles nearly a year after it released for PC. Publisher indie.io has stated that Moon Mystery will be available from September 18th on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, with the game being priced at $19.99. It is available to pre-order on the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/moon-mystery/9pjlncrlb5md?utm_medium=email&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9RGF96TX3QgOR86Ssu2NQTh5sMunwkVmpezqfDQkN6WAjniHFgH3Jtml8MLlhgFyPf3aEYuzAL-j0zIsBXz7873fcr2w&amp;_hsmi=379566986&amp;utm_content=379566986&amp;utm_source=hs_email">Microsoft store now</a>, and available to wishlist on the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10015507">PlayStation Store</a>.</p>

<p>In Moon Mystery you play as Sam, an astrobiologist who is alone on the Moon aside from AI assistant TOBY. Sam becomes stranded on the Moon after all contact with Earth is lost, prompting him to find out the cause of the issue. It soon turns out that Sam is not alone on the lunar surface, so needs to run, gun, explore, and use his head to solve puzzles to get out of this predicament. The Moon is not the only location that Sam will end up exploring, as he travels to alien planets and an orbital city.</p>
<p>We did not review Moon Mystery, but the game is currently sitting on mixed reviews on Steam, though recent user reviews are a bit more positive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-is-fine-but-digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-is-one-1839230688"><em>Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth</em></a> was sneakily one of the best RPGs of 2016. Almost a decade later, its long-awaited successor is mounting another lowkey coup in a genre that’s only gotten more competitive in the years since. <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> plays like a very traditional turn-based role-playing game in all of my favorite ways while bringing multiple generational leaps’ worth of technical upgrades to a spin-off series whose last entries were built for PS Vita. It feels like the <em>Persona</em>-style glow-up many <em>Pokémon</em> fans have been waiting for.</p> <p>At PAX West last week I had the chance to play over 90 minutes of <em>Digimon Story: Time</em> <em>Stranger</em>, which comes to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 3, and the latest Bandai Namco-published creature fighter from veteran RPG maker Media Vision did not disappoint. Things already seemed good coming out of a <a href="https://kotaku.com/digmon-story-time-stranger-preview-pokemon-pc-ps5-xbox-1851784677">Summer Game Fest demo</a> earlier this summer and a deeper dive only firmed up the sense that the game, first announced eight years ago, can meet the increasing expectations surrounding <em>Digimon Story</em>‘s return.</p> <p>The latest session let me play the start of the game before later shifting to a much more advanced segment over a dozen hours into the adventure. You play as a secret agent working for the ADAMAS organization investigating ominous anomalies in Tokyo that seem to be linked to social upheaval. The <em>Digimon Story</em> games have always had an emphasis on compelling conversations and background intrigue, which <em>Cyber Sleuth</em> took to the next level with a narrative that felt like more than just a means to an end of raising virtual pets.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000624121" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624121"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624121">Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>What I played of <em>Time Stranger</em> continues that with English voice acting and more polished cinematic animations, coupled with an unusually stellar soundtrack. Are there extremely goofy moments too? Absolutely. I’ve already witnessed half a dozen snippets that I can’t wait to send to folks in the group chat who have not interacted with <em>Digimon</em> since it debuted in the West on Fox Kids back in 1999. Watching familiar RPG tropes reenacted by absurd-looking creatures that speak like humans is an acquired taste, but <em>Time Stranger</em> does an admirable job.</p> <p>Eerie anime vibes established, my early tutorial section eventually transitioned to a later stretch set in the Digimon world’s colorful seaside Abyss Area which felt oddly reminiscent of<em> Chrono Cross</em>‘ tropical archipelago. Here, <em>Time Stranger</em>‘s bread and butter took center stage: fighting, collecting, and growing your Digimon. There’s the combat triangle between Data, Virus, and Vaccine type Digimon, elemental weaknesses, and a swapping system that lets you use different Digimon on the fly if your current team doesn’t have the right build.</p>

 <p>Building meter during battle also lets you unleash an ultimate attack to deal extra damage or buff your team. It’s a nimble set of mechanics that helps turn-based battles shine, forcing you to think about what you’re doing and adapt on the fly without getting bogged down in too much minutiae. It’s definitely old-school but more satisfying than just mashing the same set of attacks over and over again. If things do start to get repetitive, a fast-forward button helps bypass the boring bits. Defeat a Digimon enough times and you get a 100 percent scan rate to create your own, or you can wait for a 200 percent scan rate to get an even stronger version of it.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000624122" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624122"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624122">Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure> <p>Outside of combat, the main focus remains on Digivolving and De-Digivolving your pals. The first makes them more powerful while the second makes them weaker again in the short term to raise their long-term potential. Aiding this convoluted process is the DigiFarm system which lets you tweak the new personalities of your Digimon to change which stats grow the fastest. Certain personalities are also required to Digivolve or De-Digivolve specific Digimon along with player rank and relationship status. Consumable items and training sessions let you speed up this process too.</p>

 <p>There’s also an entire character skill tree full of perks that provide extra bonuses to your team depending on a Digimon’s specific relationship with you and their personality type, though I didn’t get to see how these systems feel over the long haul. Do they feel balanced? Do they get tedious? Is it too streamlined or too convoluted? But I certainly came away with the impression that <em>Time Stranger</em> has a great foundation to work with.</p> <p>Will it hold up over a 40-50 hour adventure? Is it well paced? Does the story end up going somewhere cool even if you’re not a dyed-in-the-wool <em>Digimon</em> sicko? Only the full, finished game can answer those questions. So far, however, the successor to <em>Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth</em> continues to look like it’s making smart choices and pushing the series forward. It could easily be overshadowed next month by <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> but it doesn’t deserve to be. <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> should be on every RPG fan’s radar, whether they’ve been keeping up with the franchise or not.</p>

"So that journey for B.J., even during those first few weeks at id, when we mapped out New Order, we still had the plan for, at least, that character.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silksong%E2%80%99s-most-popular-mods-are-all-about-making-the-game-easier.1291866/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/hollow-knight-silksong"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em></a>is out. Did you know that? You probably pieced that together. After seven years of waiting, Team Cherry’s long-awaited 2D action-platformer is here and kicking people’s asses. But on PC, thousands of players are using mods to help them overcome the challenging game.</p> <p><em>Silksong</em> released late last week on Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, and PC after nearly a decade of waiting. And first reactions to the sequel are almost entirely positive, with fans loving the small tweaks to the<em> Hollow Knight</em> formula and the larger size of its world. Plus, that $20 price tag is nice in an era when everything is more expensive than ever. And <em>Silksong</em>, like <em>Hollow Knight</em>, isn’t the easiest game in the world. Many players are even claiming that <em>Silksong</em> is harder than the OG. <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-difficulty-hard-damage-criticism-2000624031">This has led to a lot of discourse on the internet about how hard it is or isn’t, and about game difficulty in general</a>. But if you’re playing on PC, there’s a solution: Just mod <em>Silksong</em> and make it easier.</p> <p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/hollowknightsilksong?modSort=popular">If we hop over to <em>Silksong’s</em> mods hub over at <em>NexusMods</em></a>, a popular PC modding site, you can see there are already 60+ mods available for the recently released platformer. And many of the most popular mods available for the game make it much easier to play. The most popular mods for <em>Silksong</em> include one that adds health meters to enemies, another one that stops enemies from doing double damage to the player, and one that shows the player’s position on the map at all times. All of these mods have over 15,000 downloads. An automapping mod has 9,000 downloads. Another free PC mod that increases how much damage players deal to enemies has over 7,000 downloads.</p>

 <p>In fact, the only mod more popular than all of these mods that make <em>Silksong</em> easier is the mod needed to run any of these other creations. That mod, “BepInEx 5 with Configuration Manager,” has over 28,000 downloads as of September 8. That’s a lot of downloads for a game that’s barely been out a week. Of course, not all the mods for <em>Silksong</em> are about making it easier. But those mods, like one that adds ultrawide support and a death counter, only have a few hundred downloads or fewer.</p> <p>It seems that the people coming to <em>NexusMods</em> for <em>Silksong</em> mods mostly have one goal in mind: Make the game less challenging. I expect reactions to this will vary a lot, but personally, I land on the side of “If folks want to make a game easier or harder with mods, and it doesn’t ruin it for other people, then whatever.” But I’ve been on the web long enough to know that ain’t a universal take.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-54-lost-clickwheel-ipod-games-have-now-been-preserved-for-posterity.1291860/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Last year, we reported on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/ipod-fans-evade-apples-drm-to-preserve-54-lost-clickwheel-era-games/">the efforts of classic iPod fans to preserve playable copies of the downloadable clickwheel games</a> that Apple sold for a brief period in the late '00s. The community was working to get around <a href="http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/728B5C4B-0A35-40BE-A2E7-E5464C68B80A.html">Apple's onerous FairPlay DRM</a> by having people who still owned original copies of those (now unavailable) games sync their accounts to a single iTunes installation <a href="https://github.com/Olsro/ipodclickwheelgamespreservationproject/tree/main">via a coordinated Virtual Machine</a>. That "master library" would then be able to provide playable copies of those games to any number of iPods in perpetuity.</p>
<p>At the time, the community was still searching for iPod owners with syncable copies of the last few titles needed for their library. With <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/1nb9kvx/comment/nd2dozi/">today's addition of <em>Real Soccer 2009</em></a> to the project, though, all 54 official iPod clickwheel games are now available together in an easily accessible format for what is likely the first time.</p>
<h2>All at once, then slowly</h2>
<p>GitHub user Olsro, the originator of <a href="https://github.com/Olsro/ipodclickwheelgamespreservationproject/tree/main">the iPod Clickwheel Games Preservation Project</a>, tells Ars that he lucked into contact with three people who had large iPod game libraries in the first month or so after the project's launch last October. That includes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thatnostalgicnerd">one YouTuber</a> who had purchased and maintained copies of 39 distinct games, even repurchasing some of the upgraded versions Apple sold separately for later iPod models.</p>
<p>Ars' <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/ipod-fans-evade-apples-drm-to-preserve-54-lost-clickwheel-era-games/">story on the project</a> shook out a few more iPod owners with syncable iPod game libraries, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/1giaocx/release_3_ipod_clickwheel_games_lode_runner_star/">subsequent</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/1gk4imk/release_5_new_ipod_clickwheel_games_bubble_bash/">updates</a> in the following days left just a handful of titles unpreserved. But that's when the project stalled, Olsro said, with months wasted on false leads and technical issues that hampered the effort to get a complete library.</p>
<p>"I've put a lot of time into coaching people that [had problems] transferring the files and authorizing the account once with me on the [Virtual Machine]," Olsro told Ars. "But I kept motivation to continue coaching anyone else coming to me (by mail/Discord) and making regular posts to increase awareness until I could find finally someone that could, this time, go with me through all the steps of the preservation process," he <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/comments/1nb9kvx/comment/nd2dozi">added on Reddit</a>.</p>

<p>Getting working access to the final unpreserved game, <em>Real Soccer 2009</em>, was "especially cursed," Olsro tells Ars. "Multiple [people] came to me during this summer and all attempts failed until a new one from yesterday," he said. "I even had a situation when someone had an iPod Nano 5G with a playable copy of <em>Real Soccer</em>, but the drive was appearing empty in the Windows Explorer. He tried recovery tools &amp; the iPod NAND just corrupted itself, asking for recovery..."</p>

                <p>Former Bethesda executive Pete Hines has opened up on some of the predictions people made about Bethesda games over the years, and why he stuck to his guns when others doubted him.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/features/24-years-bethesda-with-pete-hines" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dbltap</a>, Hines said people questioned if The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind would even work as an Xbox exclusive, or if The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim could find success with its release date--November 11, 2011--being so close to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (November 8, 2011).</p><p>"'Oh, Skyrim can't survive going up against Call of Duty. Same window. Everybody's gonna play Call of Duty. Nobody's gonna buy your game,'" Hines recalls hearing.</p><p>For his part, Hines said he understands Call of Duty is a huge brand, but he believed Bethesda had a "better game" with Skyrim and wasn't afraid to spend marketing dollars on it.</p><p>"I will go up against those guys. I will spend [marketing money] against those guys. I will never spend anywhere near as much and I can still win," he recalled.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-selling-games-of-each-of-the-past-25-years-in-the-us/2900-5031/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5031">Both games succeeded in 2011</a>, with Modern Warfare 3 finishing as the No. 1 best-selling game and Skyrim coming in second for the year in the US. Skyrim has gone on to sell more than 60 million copies, making it one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#1" data-ref-id="2900-4814">best-selling games of all time</a>. A final sales number for Modern Warfare 3 is unknown, although Skyrim did benefit from numerous ports to other platforms over the years. </p><p>Another line Hines heard was that Bethesda should avoid releasing The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion in the spring (it launched in March 2006) because "nobody releases games in the spring." But in the end, Hines said, "We did just fine." The game is still enjoying success to this day, thanks to the 2025 remaster, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6281">2025's No. 2 best-selling game in the US.</a></p><p>Challenging preconceived notions and finding success was "what made it so fun," Hines said about his time at Bethesda. "I think we were better at it than anybody else in terms of what we were able to do, when you look at the awards we won, the players we brought in, and how we went about doing it right. I wanted to be a part of a company where if anybody peeks into a window to see how we're doing this, I feel okay about it," he said.</p><p>Hines left Bethesda after Microsoft acquired its parent company, ZeniMax. Hines is now retired, but he's continued to share his opinions, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-bethesda-boss-pete-hines-has-strong-words-about-subscription-services-in-gaming/1100-6534511/" data-ref-id="1100-6534511">how he feels about Xbox Game Pass. </a></p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/prey-2-human-head-studios-gameplay-footage-leak/">gameplay and concept footage</a> of what would've been the sequel to Human Head Studios' 2006 game Prey leaked online, published on YouTube across multiple videos from a channel listed under '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@davidhalsted2611">David Halsted</a>.' Today, that same channel no longer has any of the Prey 2 videos it previously had publicly listed, and instead, more gameplay footage appeared on an old <a href="https://forums.duke4.net/topic/12181-leaked-prey-1995/page__pid__385337#entry385337">Duke4 thread</a>, spotted by New Blood Interactive's <a href="https://x.com/DaveOshry/status/1964840297889997048">Dave Oshry</a>.</p>



<p>The original post includes an Imgur link, though following it at the time of this writing is fruitless, sense the page no longer appears. Oshry, however, compiled the footage and put it together in a nearly five-minute-long video that shows a very solid-looking slice of what Human Head Studios was cooking up with Prey 2.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The footage shows that Human Head Studios was building something that, if it had made it to release, would've been compared to CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077, since it appears to be well ahead of its time with the kind of sci-fi world and setting it would have featured.</p>



<p>Interestingly, this is actually the third time in the last week that Human Head Studios' Prey has come up. In a <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/features/24-years-bethesda-with-pete-hines">recent interview</a> with former Bethesda executive Pete Hines, besides Hines taking the time to comment <a href="https://wccftech.com/subscription-services-arent-rewarding-content-makers/">on subscription services and Microsoft's Xbox Game Pass</a>, he also talked about the struggle he faced when it came time to decide what Arkane Austin would work on next, and how he lost in the battle for its name. </p>



<p>"<em>Don't even get me started on that</em>," Hines said in regard to Arkane Austin naming its 2017 game Prey. "<em>I definitely pissed some people off internally over that because I fought so hard against using that name. I'm the head of the spear, but I had a lot of people across my team – brand, PR and community – and we feel like we're burdening it with a name where we spend more time explaining why it's called Prey than we do talking about the game. I regret that I lost that battle. But nobody on this planet could have put more of a good faith effort into changing minds on that. My whole point was, look how much time we spend talking about what the game is versus why it's called this and like, that is wasted energy. That is wasted excitement. We could be turning that into something positive.</em>"</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see if more Prey 2 footage is published, or if an unreleased build of what Human Head Studios had appears online. For now, we can only watch and wonder at what might've been if Human Head's story had gone differently.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Best Buy is liquidating its warehouse with a big clearance sale on an oddball assortment of <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-limited-run-physical-digital-capcom-1851602842">Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch physical games</a>. However, to find deals worth potentially grabbing, you’ll have to dig through some gunk and a lot of sports games from a year ago to find some good games worth adding to your collection.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1964929126176866311">As spotted by the internet’s favorite deals guru, Wario64,</a> Best Buy is currently holding <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?browsedCategory=pcmcat1487698928729&amp;id=pcat17071&amp;loc=1719813&amp;qp=currentoffers_facet%3DCurrent+Deals%7EClearance%5Esoldout_facet%3DAvailability%7EExclude+Out+of+Stock+Items&amp;ref=388&amp;sp=Price-Low-To-High&amp;st=categoryid%24pcmcat1487698928729">a large video game clearance sale online and in stores</a> around the country. Is this more evidence that Best Buy, like other retailers, <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-buy-dvd-blu-ray-games-sales-stop-2024-1851136668">is looking to exit the physical video game space</a> and just fill stores up with more cellphones, old Funko Pops, and fridges? Perhaps, but regardless of why these games are on sale, they are cheaper than normal, and you get a physical copy, too. You can add these to your library or even pass down a copy of <em>Watch Dogs Legion</em> or <em>Diablo IV</em> to your grandkids.</p> <p>Anyway, we dug through the junk to find some of the best games and biggest deals currently available via the Best Buy clearance sale. Keep in mind these might sell out at any time so this list might be out of date by the time you see it. Also, many games are only on sale on a specific platform, which we have listed below next to the usual price and the new sale price.</p> <ul> <li><em>Watch Dogs Legion</em> – Xbox – $8 ($15)</li> <li><em>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands Next Level Edition</em> – Xbox – $10 ($20)</li> <li><em>Redfall</em> – Xbox – $10 ($70)</li> <li><em>Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</em> – Xbox – $10 ($20)</li> <li><em>Midnight Suns Enhanced Edition</em> – Xbox – $12 ($20)</li> <li><em>Deathloop</em> – PS5 – $13 ($60)</li> <li><em>Sponge SquarePants A Patrick Star Game</em> – $16 ($20)</li> <li><em>Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged</em> – Xbox – $18 ($30)</li> <li><em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> – PS4 – $18 ($30)</li> <li><em>Diablo IV</em> – PS5 – $25 ($70)</li> <li><em>Core Keeper</em> – PS4 – $18 ($30)</li> <li><em>The Smurfs Village Party</em> – PS5 – $21 ($40)</li> <li><em>Super Bomberman R 2</em> – PS5 – $24 ($30)</li> <li><em>Samba de Amigo: Party Central</em> – Switch – $24 ($40)</li> <li><em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em> – Xbox – $26 ($50)</li> <li><em>Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII: Reunion</em> – Xbox – $30 ($50)</li> <li><em>NFS Unbound</em> – Xbox – $30 ($50)</li> <li><em>Neon White</em> – PS5 – $32 ($40)</li> <li><em>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</em> – Xbox – $31 ($70)</li> </ul> <p>And yeah, <em>Redfall</em> wasn’t a great game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-redfall-offline-update-4-arkane-austin-1851484821">but it got an offline mode not that long ago</a> and is easily worth $10 if you are hankering for a vampire-themed RPG shooter this Halloween season.</p>

The Intel Core i7-14700 CPU has a max turbo frequency of 5.4GHz with 20 cores, 28 threads, and a 28MB L2 cache. Although one generation old, the i7-14700 is still an excellent relevant CPU for both gaming and producitivity use.

It performs neck-and-neck with the RTX 4080 Super and marginalizes the RTX 5080, which is only about 10%-15% faster but costs 33% more. Like all Blackwell cards, the RTX 5070 Ti supports <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dlss-4-explained-everything-you-need-to-know-about-nvidias-latest-ai-upscaling-tech">DLSS 4 with multi-frame generation</a>.  This GPU is capable of high framerates in nearly all games, even at 4K resolution. If you plan on using this card for AI, the RTX 5070 Ti may be a better value since it has the same amount of VRAM as the RTX 5080.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

                <p>Battlefield 2042’s recently released “Road to Battlefield 6” battle pass has proven to be a popular addition. Given it offers multiple cosmetic items for the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a>, a boost in active players makes sense. And with a more active community now playing the game, EA has announced that a <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1965067993185972329" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">small hotfix update</a> is coming tomorrow, September 9.</p><p>The main issue seemed to be based on progression. Some of the weekly missions involving the M1 Garand, for instance, weren’t tracking correctly in All Out Warfare. Some players also felt that the grind to unlock the free cosmetics was a bit much. This has led to a Tier Skip function--a feature that, depending on who you’re talking to, presents its own set of issues--allowing players to pay to advance through the ranks. The hotfix also addresses some weapon/gadget balancing, fixed a Playercard issue, and updated the Team Deathmatch playlist.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>CD Projekt RED is hard at work on multiple projects at this very moment, including its highly anticipated Cyberpunk 2077 sequel. We still have a while until it's ready for release, as we learned earlier this year, the project <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2-is-in-pre-production-phantom-liberty-has-sold-10-million-units-the-witcher-3-60-million/">has only entered pre-production</a>, and we still have plenty of questions about what the sequel will look like, though if Keanu Reeves gets his way, we can count on at least one familiar face in the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel.</p>



<p>While speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/johnny-silverhand-actor-keanu-reeves-says-he-absolutely-wants-to-be-in-cyberpunk-2">IGN</a> and promoting his new film, Good Fortune, Keanu Reeves confirmed that he would "<em>absolutely</em>" return to play Johnny Silverhand in the coming sequel.</p>



<p>"<em>Absolutely. I'd love to play Johnny Silverhand again</em>," Reeves said. Of course, for anyone who's played Cyberpunk 2077, there are doubts as to how Silverhand could make a return at all, but there's always the chance we see Reeves step back into the role in a flashback scene or something similar.</p>



<p>The last time we heard about the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel was when Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith spoke about what he saw on his last visit to CDPR, calling the new location they were developing "<em></em><em>like Chicago gone wrong.'</em>"</p>



<p>It would be nice to hear more soon, but the reality is we likely won't get any major details about the coming sequel until CD Projekt RED is through with <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-take-some-cues-sapkowski-latest-book/">The Witcher 4</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Warhammer 40,000 Drukhari Codex Brings Long-Awaited Update]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-warhammer-40000-drukhari-codex-brings-long-awaited-update</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-warhammer-40-000-drukhari-codex-brings-long-awaited-update.1291779/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has announced its new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a> Drukhari codex. This codex provides new rules and updates to an army that has been starved of support for a while. It also introduces new units for that army.</p>

<h2>The <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Drukhari Codex Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/5jk5xmlb/lady-malys-stands-tall-over-the-new-codex-drukhari/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community</a> post, Games Workshop gave a preview of the <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Drukhari Codex. The first major draw is the introduction of a new named unit. Lady Malys, the Archon of the Poisoned Tongue, as the name implies, brings swift and deadly swordplay to the battlefield alongside deadly poison. Poison that improves not just Malys' lethality, but the effectiveness of units under her.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-40000-drukhari-codex-lady-malys-miniature.jpg?itok=ivSS0Wb9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-40000-drukhari-codex-lady-malys-miniature.jpg?itok=WcZy0n8K 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Alongside Lady Malys are new customizable archon miniatures. These miniatures will have new wargear options and alternate heads and bodies. These new archons will be featured in the new Realspace Raiders Battleforce box, which will contain a new archon, 10 Wyches, 10 Kabalite Warriors, 5 Hellions, 5 Scourges, 5 Incubi, and a Venom transport.</p>

<p>As for the quality-of-life improvements in the <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Drukhari Codex, a few are highlighted. The book contains rules on five new detachments and a new Power from Pain army rule, which aligns with the Drukhari's sadomasochistic methods. The army rule will add new pain abilities to every unit's datasheet, which can be activated by spending pain points.</p>

<p>In addition, one of the new detachments features the body horror constructs known as the Haemonculi. The aptly named Coven of Agonies detachment includes a Talos, Cronos, 10 Wracks, and a Haemonculus unit, all dedicated to dangerous close-quarters combat.</p>

<p>The announcement of this new codex is a huge relief to Drukhari players since the army hasn't been updated since the announcement of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/warhammer-40k-guide" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em> Tenth Edition</a> back in the Summer of 2023. That is more than two years of new substantive updates or changes.</p>

The game has sold millions of copies, with fans praising the sequel for its no-nonsense gameplay, satisfying action, and impressive graphics. "Space Marine 2 is a fantastic sequel that builds on its predecessor in every way, bombarding you with an overwhelming enemy and chaotic action that makes you feel like a small part of a much larger war," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/1900-6418276/">Richard Wakeling wrote in GameSpot's review</a>.</p><p>Since launch, developer Saber Interactive has frequently updated the game with patches and new content, like the addition of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/space-marine-2s-new-siege-mode-unleashes-endless-waves-of-enemies/1100-6532761/">new Horde mode</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/space-marine-2-just-became-a-whole-lot-more-modder-friendly/1100-6531452/">better mod support</a>.

The feature was first added in Battlefield 1 and its sequel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-v/" data-ref-id="5000-482208">Battlefield V</a>, but was not included in 2021's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-2042/" data-ref-id="5000-532981">Battlefield 2042</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the video clip, Ter-Lee-Comedy also posted a before-and-after comparison screenshot of a pristine weapon as shown in the Battlefield 6 open beta compared to one covered in grime from a more recent playtest.</p><p dir="ltr">The difference is substantial, with the dirt-covered weapon looking to be caked in mud. While the buildup of mud and dirt on weapons is purely cosmetic and doesn't affect gameplay, it's still a popular visual feature that many players have said help battles feel more immersive. However, it's worth nothing that just because the feature is in a playtest doesn't guarantee it will be in Battlefield 6 at launch.</p><p dir="ltr">Combined with the greater destructibility of Battlefield 6's buildings and environments (something that players found lacking in Battlefield 2042), the latest installment of the franchise looks to be bringing back what fans loved from past Battlefield games.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/charting-stars-spaceships-that-inspired-magics-edge-of-eternities</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/charting-the-stars-the-spaceships-that-inspired-magic%E2%80%99s-edge-of-eternities.1291752/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We've been having a ton of fun with the latest <i>Magic: The Gathering</i>&nbsp;set, <em>Edge of Eternities</em>, and I've been especially enjoying the new Spacecraft card type, which sees massive ships, stealthy fighters, and powerful stations enter the game. This got me thinking about how the set's been influenced by sci-fi and pop-culture, so I reached out to Andrew Brown, a Game Design Architect from Wizards of the Coast who worked on the set, to learn more.</p>

<p>To begin our conversation, I wanted to know how Andrew's favorite sci-fi ships shaped the design for Spacecraft in <em>Edge of Eternities.&nbsp;</em>"This has&nbsp;to be the Eternity Elevator," Brown explains. "The infinite elevator has been a staple of many IPs and porting it into&nbsp;the vastness of&nbsp;space&nbsp;is charming to me. I&nbsp;can’t&nbsp;help but think of what kind of music they play in the elevator that lasts forever."</p>

<p>I really like the Eternity Elevator, and agree with Andrew that I've always found that idea of an Elevator from Earth to a space station or the moon really thought-provoking, especially when used as a focal point to the story ala&nbsp;<em>The Fountains of Paradise</em>&nbsp;by Arthur C. Clarke or&nbsp;<em>Old Man's War</em>&nbsp;by John Scalzi. Heck, there's even the Umbilicus used to exchange inventions with the Mads in&nbsp;<em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em>!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/edge-of-eternities-spaceships-elevator.jpg?itok=YNmbAm58 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/edge-of-eternities-spaceships-elevator.jpg?itok=qQLUlSb8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Next I wanted to know from Andrew which spaceship he thought would make the best Commander if it were a Magic card,&nbsp; What would its mechanics be? Deftly avoiding naming other IP's, Brown still provides a truly thought-provoking answer. "For me," he says, "it&nbsp;has to&nbsp;be the International Space Station.&nbsp;I am a sucker for 5 color commander decks and to me that captures the exact flavor of it.&nbsp;People from all over the world banding together to search the final frontier is poetic and full of hope."</p>

<p>I like the idea of the ISS as a Commander,&nbsp; which feels like it would have Convoke to help get that message of universal cooperation through. Maybe we need a set of real-world spaceships in a future Secret Lair. I mean, <em>Assassin's Creed</em> got <a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/ACR/en-us/193/leonardo-da-vinci" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Leonardo da Vinci</a>, why can't we get Apollo 11?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/iss-nasa.jpeg?itok=Xd7auU5w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/iss-nasa.jpeg?itok=XDBcUxrI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The International Space Station. Image: NASA</figcaption></figure><p>Many spaceships in pop culture seem to take on a life and personality of their own (sometimes literally, in the case of <em>Alien</em>, <em>2001</em>, and many more). So I wanted to know from Andrew, which&nbsp;<em>EoE</em>&nbsp;Spacecraft, in his opinion, has the biggest personality of the set?&nbsp;</p>

<p>"<a href="https://gatherer.wizards.com/EOE/en-us/238/dawnsire-sunstar-dreadnought" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dawnsire, Sunstar Dreadnought</a> easily has the most personality," Brown answers. "It knows&nbsp;it's&nbsp;the&nbsp;biggest,&nbsp;baddest&nbsp;and strongest around. No need&nbsp;to&nbsp;tell&nbsp;anyone!&nbsp;They know.&nbsp;20/20? Check. 100 damage? Check.

        <p>They are "hurting a lot of people", observes Hines</p>

            <p>
Former Bethesda marketing chief Pete Hines has been chatting about the ups and downs of videogame subscription platforms, such as Microsoft's Game Pass service, GeForce Now and whatever the hell Ubisoft are calling theirs at the minute. Subisoftscription? UbiPassPlus? Answers on a postcard.</p>
<p>Hines is broadly of the opinion that subscription platforms are failing many of the developers who sign up to publish through them, though he cautions that his experience is out-of-date - he retired from Bethesda in October 2023.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
In his time at Bethesda under Microsoft, Hines helped Bethesda bring <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/redfall">Redfall</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hi-fi-rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a> to Xbox Game Pass. He seems to regret this. "I'm not working in any of these companies anymore, and so I don't assume that everything I knew while I was in the industry still holds true today," Hines told <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/features/24-years-bethesda-with-pete-hines?trk=public_post_comment-text">DBLTAP</a> this month. "At the same time, I'm involved enough to know I saw what I considered to be some short sighted decision making several years ago, and it seems to be bearing out the way I said. 
</p>
<p>
"Subscriptions have become the new four letter word, right? You can't buy a product anymore. When you talk about a subscription that relies on content, if you don't figure out how to balance the needs of the service and the people running the service with the people who are providing the content - without which your subscription is worth jack shit - then you have a real problem. 
</p><p>
"You need to properly acknowledge, compensate and recognize what it takes to create that content and not just make a game, but make a product," Hines went on. "That tension is hurting a lot of people, including the content creators themselves, because they're fitting into an ecosystem that is not properly valuing and rewarding what they're making." 
</p>
<p>
Hines didn't go into proper specifics, so it's left to me, a no-nothing figures-averse jackass, to scrabble together what relevant insights I can in the closing seconds of this awful Monday. 
</p>
<p>
The battle lines for whether game subscription services are The Industry's second coming or the work of the Devil (why not both, etc) are pretty well-drawn at this point. Anecdotally, at least, subscription models appear to make people less willing to spend money on individual new games. They indisputably grant more power to platform holders and storefronts. 
</p>
<p>
Platform holders such as Microsoft have often contended that the relationship between the New Hotness of subscription and the olde worlde approach of owning (a license to play) a game is complementary. They suggest that a healthy subscription business will spill over into separate purchases down the line - for example, people buying games that are no longer part of the subscription library.</p><p>Without wishing to portray myself as a comprehensive researcher - see "no-nothing jackass", above - I have come across <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167811625000187#s0145">one study of Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus</a> that appears to bear elements of the latter argument out, showing that in contrast to the music or movie and TV industry, these subscription services have not "substantially cannibalized existing revenue streams". 
</p>
<p>
Still, that's treating the income from games on those platforms as a block. Individual developers have reported different returns from adding their games to subscription platforms. Posting on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7369880832481660928?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7369880832481660928%2C7369898365943218176%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287369898365943218176%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7369880832481660928%29">LinkedIn</a> this week in response to Hines's comments above, former Xbox Game Studios vice-president Shannon Loftis suggested that games often suffer for appearing on Game Pass, unless they include a bunch of ways to make money after release. "While [Game Pass] can claim a few victories with games that otherwise would have sunk beneath the waves (Human Fall Flat, e.g.)," she wrote, "the majority of game adoption on Gap comes at the expense of retail revenue, unless the game is engineered from the ground up for post-release monetization."
</p>
<p>
The other question is whether subscription models are really worth it for the platform holders themselves, given that historically, subscription models have tended to rely on undercharging at first, then belatedly raising the price and making your money back once you've got the audience hooked.</p>
<p>In July, Microsoft reported $5 billion in revenue from Game Pass over the past year. Sources <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1941918116218638368">have told</a> Chris Dring, formerly of GamesIndustry.biz, that "Xbox Game Pass is profitable, even when you factor in the lost sales for its first-party teams". It doesn't appear profitable enough, however, going by Microsoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">recent mass layoffs</a>, but then again, it feels like Microsoft could  pioneer a way to literally grow money on trees right now and still find cause to punt a hundred QA testers into the sea.
</p><p>
I don't have a Game Pass subscription myself, partly because I'm trying to support <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-culture-of-intimidation-retaliation-and-oppression-how-microsofts-gaza-stance-fuelled-an-industry-spanning-boycott">the BDS campaign against Microsoft</a>. In general, I don't like subscription models because it feels like paying rent, and thereby teaches me to think of playing games as even more of a value-extraction exercise. I feel pressured to download and play a load of games to maximise the return on my investment, and then I start to loathe myself, because somebody poured heart and soul into e.g. that cottagecore feline frisbee simulator, and here I am shovelling it down to meet quota. How are you getting on with such things?

              <p>Have we hit peak licensed Lego set? Maybe. The brick builder toy maker has been releasing more and more elaborate sets based on famous franchises at higher and higher prices. The new Lego Death Star <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-death-star-1000-most-expensive-set-star-wars-size-release-date-2000623168">will be $1,000</a>. What fools would pay that much for plastic? But now Lego has teased an upcoming <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> set that’s probably the Enterprise-D and now <a href="https://youtu.be/nF-SR2UwGQ8?si=EEuRI0PGtYYUfzYw">I am that fool</a>.</p> <p>That’s because on Monday, Lego teased a new collaboration with <em>Star Trek</em> that saw Patrick Stewart’s Captain Jean-Luc Picard beamed into the Enterprise-D as a Lego figurine. Every nostalgic licensed cash-in seems silly until they finally find the one you can’t live without. A <em>Star Trek: TNG</em> Enterprise is about as close to that for me as you can get. I’m not saying I would make poor choices with my family’s finances to make whatever this set is show up on my doorstop at some point, but I’m not saying I wouldn’t either.</p>   <p>While an Enterprise-D Lego set seems like a sure bet with this tease out there, leaks from last month have only fueled fan speculation. Based on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/comments/1mfzqbr/icons_10356_star_trek_uss_enterprise_d_via_4chan/">a 4chan leak</a> of the images, which may or may not be accurate but certainly looked convincing, the set will be 3600 pieces and ship November 28 for $400. Fans will get the Enterprise plus mini-figures of Picard, Riker, Worf, Geordi, Data, Dr. Crusher, Wesley Crusher, Troi, and Guinan.</p>   <p>The Enterprise-D is the only toy model I ever put together and it’s the only Lego set I’d ever consider spending $400 on. But it’s not the only <em>Star Trek</em> set I’d get out my wallet for. A Klingon Bird of Prey? A Romulan Warbird? Don’t get me started on the Borg Cube. I would, in time, buy and build them all. The best part? Because it’s Lego I can create my very own three-nacelle Enterprise from the <em>TNG</em> series finale “All Good Things.” Fine. You win Lego. Make it so!</p>

              <p>A sketchy home Wi-Fi system will drive you nuts in so many ways. Streaming fails, sudden lag fits during an intense gaming session, and those awful dead spots that somehow seem to move around the house — they all mean your home network is outdated or just too weak to give you a strong signal throughout the house.</p>
<p>A mesh Wi-Fi network is the answer — one hardwired mothership and two wireless beacons render your old router and extenders moot and give you a powerful, consistent signal everywhere. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3961/">Right now Amazon is running a great $140 sale on the TP-Link Deco X55 AX3000 Wi-Fi 6 mesh system</a>, which blankets up to 6,500 square feet in a signal strong enough to banish those dead spots and eliminate those laggy streaming and gaming sessions.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3961/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Lose the Boosters</h2>
<p>Wi-Fi boosters and wall-outlet range extenders were the best weapons against Wi-Fi dead spots and weak signals for years, but even at their best they only gave you marginal relief. As both Wi-Fi and the devices that rely on Wi-Fi evolved, those boosters and extenders fell way behind the times, and the mesh network stepped up to take on the fight.</p>
<p>TP-Link was one of the early adopters of mesh technology, and this is one of their better systems at an exceptional price. Each one of the 3 units has three Gigabit ports if you want or need to hardwire, and the easy-to-install network supports up to 150 devices to ensure you’re not experiencing web traffic jams when everyone logs in at the same time. The difference you’ll immediately experience is huge&nbsp; — speeds of up to 3,000Mbps, with TP-Link’s AI-Driven Smart Mesh technology that learns your network environment and user behaviors and adjusts on the fly to optimize your signal.</p>



<h2>Bigger and Safer</h2>
<p>The 6,500 square foot range of the TP-Link Deco X55 network is enough to cover most homes and often backyards or garages in a powerful signal. But if your home or property outstretch that coverage, adding another TP-Link Deco beacon is an inexpensive and amazingly easy solution — just plug it in and the network immediately adds it, and your signal and coverage grow.</p>
<p>The TP-Link Deco X55 mesh network is also sure to upgrade your home internet security, with a real-time network scanner that automatically detects threats, robust and easy to operate parental controls, and for an extra $6 per month or $55 per year you can install TP-Link’s HomeShield Pro service for DDoS attack prevention, advanced parental controls, and more.</p>
<p>The TP-Link Deco X55 mesh network and Deco app will take you from unboxing to a massive upgrade to your home Wi-Fi network in next to no time, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3961/">this Amazon deal that brings you the 3-pack set for just $140 is a 30% drop from the usual $200 price.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <p>If you peered into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-borderlands-4-celestial-empire-building-and-the-first-big-dune-awakening-dlc">Edwin's maw</a> this morning, you might have seen that Trainatic's out today, September 8th. Well, having now given its demo a go, I can waft away a bit more of the billowing steam of mystery for those standing on the platform who're considering boarding.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>There's a thing you'll say very quickly once you fire up either the demo or full version of this train-builder from developer Ryan Forrester, whose previous works include idle frog collector <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/croakoloco-is-not-an-idle-game-because-simply-being-around-frogs-is-a-powerfully-worthwhile-activity">Croakoloco</a> and cleaning sim <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2113490/Mess_Quest/?curator_clanid=43192431">Mess Quest</a>. It's the following: 'Oh crikey, my train's stopped already.'</p>
<p>You see, while the aim of the game is to build a train that can chug along for ages, the loco you start with runs out of fuel when it's barely left the station. That's ok, though. You've got a machine gun perched on the single car behind your engine, and you can use it to shoot some trees during your next trip. This, as well as just running over trees which are perched too close to the tracks (though that understandably damages your loco), is how you gather resources to upgrade the train.</p>
<p>With fuel being the limiting factor on journey length early doors, I invested in improvements to both capacity and efficiency for that off the bat. Soon, with help from an upgrade that let me add an extra car to my train, beginning the process of <strong>enlengthening</strong>, I had a fuel support carriage which would replenish a bit of fuel whenever I shot a tree with my gun.</p>

<p>From there, I began to upgrade the likes of my loco's speed, its firepower, and its storage capacity. Some of the numbers assigned to these upgrades seemed a bit nebulous in terms of how exactly they corresponded to my loco's performance on the tracks, but I didn't much mind that given Trainatic's relatively chill approach to things. As a result of what's a bit of a grindy start, though everything's simple and quick enough that it doesn't drag, I started going on journeys that felt a bit less like brief jaunts down the road. That's when I saw it.</p><p>A pinkish purple orb, spinning its way across the dark and earthy terrain of the woodland surrounding the tracks. Back at the station, a line from my faceless trainmaster, speculating about some strange power that could be linked to the neon interloper. Hmmm.</p>
<p>While I've unlocked automatic acceleration to go alongside the automatic trigger finger Trainatic offers, it's not enough of an idler that I'll be able to pursue this orbnigma while doing something far less important in another tab. So, my full attention will have to be on the train building, the task of taping together a Thomas the tank teeming with tech to ponder those damn orbs.</p>
<p>So far, the game's steadily constructing what almost feels like a stripped-back rail roguelike, and one that's worth at least hopping on for a free test ride. If you fancy doing so, you can find both the demo and full version of Trainatic on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3208560/Trainatic/">Steam</a>, with the latter costing £3.99/$4.79/€4.71 as of writing, thanks to an offer running until September 22nd.</p>

              <p>When <i>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</i> got its fancy new remaster earlier this year, fans of Bethesda’s open-world RPGs, myself included, were <a href="https://kotaku.com/oblivion-remaster-elder-scrolls-eso-glitch-meme-1851777557">elated at the return of this vintage classic</a>.</p> <p>Sadly, the enthusiasm wasn’t made to last. As seems befitting of its origins as a Bethesda-developed game, <i>Oblivion Remastered</i> is plagued by bugs and crashes on PC, especially following its 1.2 update which has ticked off enough players to see its Recent Reviews status on Steam sink to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2623190/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Remastered/#app_reviews_hash">the dreaded pale orange “Mixed” designation</a>. Recent reviews cite quizzical issues with performance across the board, crashes, unfair difficulty scaling, and frustration with Unreal Engine 5, a sentiment only becoming more and more common.</p> <p>“I stopped counting the crashes,” <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/sansidee/recommended/2623190/">reads one review</a> taking aim at crashes encountered whenever trying to sleep or skip time in the game. “I really want to recommend this game,” <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198011033991/recommended/2623190/">starts another</a>, “but I can’t due to technical issues and performance.” The same review cites the “few and far in between” patches the game has received, and the recent 1.2 update certainly hasn’t helped. “Started playing at launch with mods,” <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/HangukMoon/recommended/2623190/">writes another reviewer</a>, “and the game was perfectly fine to me. Came back this week and can’t for the life of me find out how to fix the “gpu crash dump triggered” crash.”</p> <p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Sweatbandz/recommended/2623190/">Frustration over performance</a> is certainly one of the louder sentiments among Steam reviewers, especially with the remaster exhibiting the well-known stuttering issues seen in other Unreal Engine 5 games. But as <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197981796923/recommended/2623190/">another reviewer points out</a>, not all the issues are unique to the new version. “Old 2006 <i>Oblivion</i> bugs have been faithfully ported over to the 2025 remaster,” they write. “I was shocked to find issues, look them up online for [a] workaround, and [saw] these were the exact same bugs from the 2006 game.”</p> <p>Speaking for myself, the wildly inconsistent framerate and stuttering have definitely meant that I’ve spent considerably less time with the gorgeous remake of Bethesda’s 2006 open-world RPG than I was hoping to. Bummer!</p>
