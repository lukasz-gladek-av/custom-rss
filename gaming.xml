            <p>
Look, I'm sorry, but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/unbeatable">Unbeatable</a> has the best hook of any game ever. As the headline notes, this is a game where music is illegal, and you do crimes. It's a rhythm game, no less, which it couldn't really be anything else but that, right? I've been waiting for it for about four years now, since the Kickstarter launched, and unfortunately it's still not quite ready yet. However! As of today, the next best thing is here: a demo.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
"A demo? Doesn't Unbeatable already have one of those?" I hear you ask. Yes, it's had a couple in fact, but this one's a proper one, the kind that actually lets you play a vertical slice of the game so you can really get a feel for it. Earlier demos were mostly about trying out the game's rhythm mechanics, whereas this one, which was paired with yet another incredibly sharp new trailer, lets you roam around a bit. There is some rhythm gaming to be done of course, just not only to songs.

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwKFOZeJukA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
There's a couple places in the demo where you can just jam out to the sound of the beat of the world, making improvised songs to the beat of a vending machine, or the sound of seagulls. You'll also make and hang-up posters to plaster across police recruitment flyers, and, oh, you do fight cops too, because they suck (and again, music is illegal, you do crimes, etc.). There's a baseball minigame for heaven's sake! I'm not sure if I need to explain much more how compelling this demo is.
</p>
<p>
But I will anyway, because the cherry on top is that there's a Y2K as hell arcade mode now too, completely focused on the rhythm game side of it all, which I'm infinitely obsessed with already. Who knew games could look this good!
</p>
<p>
It's a really comprehensive demo that, if I weren't already positioning this as my future game of the year, would absolutely convince me to pick it up at launch. No go, be away with you, commit a felony to some sick tunes, that's an order, here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240620/UNBEATABLE/">Steam page</a> to make things easier for you.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/17/legion-presents-a-new-trailer-of-covenants-dark-fantasy-fps-soulslike/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Legion Studios has released a new trailer for Covenant, a first-person dark fantasy combat game, coming from a team of former AAA game developers.</p>
<p><iframe title="COVENANT - Official Galaxies Showcase Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GpuDEWCyoVg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Covenant casts you as a warrior angel, coming down to exact martial arts vengeance on those who stand in your way, creatures from fallen empires that remain.</p>
<p>Here’s a snippet of blurb:</p>
<p><i>Experience Creation through the eyes of the last living messenger – a warrior angel sent to carry out the will of the Composers. The oldest of your kind, Malach, has fallen to the abyss – leaving in his wake a trail of destruction. You must follow in the footsteps of his final days in order to uncover the nature of his fall – and in doing so, reveal the slumbering forces hidden within Creation.</i></p>

<p>Featuring an interconnected Soulslike world that is punctuated by major boss battles, the hook here is that you’re playing in first person, using different fighting stances, spells and weapons in battle. Adaptability is key here, where different stances completely overhaul your fighting style, down to the way that you jump and kick, which is mixed with the variety of weapons available to you. These can, similar to Bloodborne, be used in a 1-hand and 2-hand form, making you more powerful but less mobile.</p>
<p>Player progression comes from crafting and applying upgrades in ring slots, while weapons are upgraded, spells grow stronger and new stances are discovered.</p>
<p>It’s an interesting sounding game with a mix of Soulslike and first person quite a distinctive one. We’re keen to see how this comes together.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/the-pitt-mel-langdon-shipping-fanfiction-fandom<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Pitt </em>is a masterpiece of television, and I’ve been enraptured by it all season. It’s a medical drama with the structure of <em>24</em>, where each episode takes place over the course of one hour in an emergency room in Pittsburgh, often ending on a twist or a cliffhanger. One thing the show pointedly doesn’t have is romance. The fandom is making up for that in spades, even if the biggest ship so far is definitely not going to happen on screen.</p><p>When I talk to people about shipping, I feel like I have to first offer a series of caveats (and sit through a bunch of jokes I’ve already heard about boats—so funny and original!). Shipping does owe its name, at least, to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150612183642/http://gizmodo.com/on-delphi-chatting-with-cc-and-on-aol-prodigy-since-s-1702639116" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the <em>X-Files</em> fandom</a>, where fans were clearly 100% correct about the scorching tension between the two lead actors. But its actual origins as a fan activity come from <em>Star Trek</em>, where the women creating zines about <a href="https://fanlore.org/wiki/Slash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kirk and Spock</a> falling for each other must have known that this wouldn’t ever happen on screen.</p><p>In recent years, most people unfamiliar with fandom make the assumption that shipping two characters falls under the <em>X-Files</em> category: something you really want to see happen on screen. To be fair, shippers of this kind who make shipping a crusade have sometimes performed obnoxious antics. In one infamous example, a shipper in the <em>Voltron</em> fandom attempted to blackmail the studio that made the show with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20171030125146/https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/voltron-legendary-defender-fan-blackmails-studio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the threat of releasing footage they claimed to have stolen</a> unless they made their chosen relationship canon. Studio Mir didn’t respond to the threat, and eventually the shipper gave up.</p><p>If that’s the only introduction one has to shipping, then well, you probably think everyone who is into this is a freak. But shipping is simply a very normal human activity: imagining things. When people say they hate fandom or hate shipping, it always makes me a little sad. Imagining things is fun, and what people imagine fictional characters doing in their heads cannot hurt you.</p><p>In the case of <em>The Pitt</em>, it is totally unsurprising to me that fans ship the characters on the show. They are all professional actors, and even in their scrubs they’re all really hot. Noah Wyle as the bearded, angst-ridden Dr. Robby is a bona fide heartthrob—and yes, <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-pitt-hbo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he <em>does</em> have a slightly homoerotic friendship with another old man</a>. But the most popular ship by far is between the sweet, probably autistic Dr. Mel King and her mentor, the hotheaded Dr. Frank Langdon. Of the 641 fanfics about <em>The Pitt</em> on Archive of our Own, 120 of them are fics that<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works?commit=Sort+and+Filter&amp;work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=hits&amp;work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=&amp;work_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&amp;work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&amp;work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&amp;work_search%5Bwords_from%5D=&amp;work_search%5Bwords_to%5D=&amp;work_search%5Bdate_from%5D=&amp;work_search%5Bdate_to%5D=&amp;work_search%5Bquery%5D=&amp;work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&amp;tag_id=The+Pitt+%28TV%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> romantically pair these two together</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Shipping these two has faced some pushback from the fandom, especially because the actors that play Dr. Mel and Dr. Langdon don’t seem very interested in portraying a romance on screen. Taylor Dearden, who plays Dr. Mel, <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/the-pitts-patrick-ball-finds-fans-shipping-mel-and-langdon-strange/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told Us Weekly that she thinks Mel is asexual</a>.</p><p>“I think Mel is asexual,” she said. “I don't think that's part of how Mel would think — especially at work. She's a hyper professional.”</p><p>Patrick Ball, who plays Dr. Langdon, agrees with his co-star, describing the relationship between the two characters as platonic.</p><p>“I think that has to do with the fact that audiences have been trained by most medical dramas for love affairs more than it has to do with me and Mel,” he also told Us Weekly.</p><p>It’s true that <em>The Pitt</em> isn’t the kind of medical soap opera like <em>Grey’s Anatomy</em>, where the doctors never seem to do any doctor-ing. It’s a very focused show trying to portray a realistic look at what it’s like to practice medicine in our current era. This has not stopped the ship’s popularity at all—and why should it? I have to believe that everyone who was a diehard Team Jacob fan in the midst of <em>Twilight</em>’s popularity probably understood that wasn’t going to happen. But people liked exploring the ideas, taking ownership of the text within their own fan communities by expressing themselves with fanart and fanfiction.</p><p>Shipping is more about fans and their expression than the actual show itself. If you’re a budding writer, sometimes it’s easier to explore ideas in a fictional universe that already exists, that you don’t have to make up from wholecloth. Besides, the chemistry between Mel and Langdon <em>is</em> real, even if the actors see it as platonic. Dr. Mel could also be asexual but still experience romantic attraction. Langdon and Mel’s relationship is the kind that could possibly bloom into romance in a different kind of show. She's kind, gentle and tries to always see the best in everyone; he’s a cynic and a huge fuckup who thinks the worst of himself at all times but secretly has a big heart. On <em>Grey’s Anatomy</em>, this storyline would practically write itself. Writing fanfiction is about exploring that possibility space, especially when you know the show itself would never go there.</p><p>The next season of <em>The Pitt</em> will apparently take place after <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/the-pitt-season-2-langdon-dana?srsltid=AfmBOopHsjToBqq7TK6KqT0Eng1BkzHhVOSV7ZHs5Hiwmc7ecoYFAQwC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Langdon returns from a stint in rehab</a>, and I’m sure that Dr. Mel will be there to support him—just as friends. In the meantime, I’ll be exploring the places their relationship <em>could</em> have gone in my imagination.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/otk-asmongold-mizkif-twitch-youtube-sponsors-controversy-report"><h3>How OTK Lost Its Way</h3></a><p>OTK was meant to be an org for and by some of the world's biggest streamers, but thanks to egos, whims, and controversies, it's proven to be anything but a sure bet

		<p>Announced during the inaugural Galaxies Showcase, VOID Interactive has confirmed that their tactical FPS Ready or Note is coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S this summer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ready or Not – Console Reveal Trailer (PS5/Xbox Series X)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jW3zr1Jn5bM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set in the fictional city of Los Sueños, a surge of crime across the city has led to the LSPD leaning more and more heavily on its SWAT teams to respond to everything from active bomb threats to suspects that have barricaded themselves in and hostage situations. Throughout the game, you need to employ authentic SWAT tactics, making use of equipment that SWAT teams utilise in the field, and with player customisation including armour, weapons, apparel and more.</p>
<p>At launch on console, Ready or Not will feature all the previous content released for PC, as well as some brand new levels in the Stories from Los Sueños free DLC update that is launching alongside the console version. This means that the game will have 20 missions that can be played solo or with online co-op for up to five players – and with full cross-play, you can join up with PC players as well.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the Deluxe Edition will also bundle in the additional DLC season pass, with six levels already released in the Home Invasion DLC and Dark Waters DLC, and an unannounced DLC 3 also coming.</p>

<p>Ready or Not will sell for $49.99 / £44.99 / €49.99 with the base game, while a Day One Edition will bundle in an M32A1 Grenade launcher, MK-V Pistol and 590M Shotgun (these will be added free for PC owners of the game). The Deluxe Edition is $69.99 / £59.99 / €69.99/ £59.99, including the DLC pass and pre-order bonuses.</p>
<p>Seen as a spiritual success to the classic SWAT series, Ready or Not has been a big hit on PC, having first gone through Steam Early Access in 2021 and leading up to its full release in 2023. That hasn’t been without controversy, in part to the depiction of scenarios where you can easily draw parallels to real world events. This is always a difficult line that tactical shooter developers have to toe, though it’s worth noting that you are unambiguously playing as the good guys when compared to, say, the wanton, cartoonish violence of the Payday series, where your player criminals get barely a slap on the wrist for killing bystanders.</p>

Earlier this month <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/blizzard">Blizzard</a> outlined their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-4s-2025-roadmap-outlines-upcoming-seasons-tweaks-and-ugh-collabs">plans</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> across 2025 that, notably, teased the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game would be getting a few collabs. They didn't mention what said collabs would be, just that they exist, to which I said "ugh", because, well, ugh, why does everything have to have collabs these days? The annoying thing is that Blizzard kind of nailed it with the first one, which just so happens to be with the iconic dark fantasy series <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/berserk">Berserk</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Yes, the same Berserk that is essentially half the reason we have <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>, why Cloud has his giant buster sword, and why the dark knight role exists in Final Fantasy as a whole. The official Diablo Twitter (or Ex, or whatever) shared an animated teaser showing a very bald and bearded man wearing Berserk protagonist Guts' armour, swinging around his iconic sword too, but it didn't show off all that much more than that. My guess is that it'll be a cosmetic you can unlock at the very least, but perhaps there'll be some gameplay ramifications too.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>
I'll still never be sold on collabs like these in games, they just feel like a cheap way to get people excited about Brand or Intellectual Property in a way that feels disingenuous. At the very least, Blizzard wasn't lying when they said that the collabs will feature "universes that complement its dark themes."
</p>
<p>
There's also no word on when the collab might be arriving in game, but it should be coming by July, as it's a part of the game's upcoming eighth season, Belial's Return. That kicks off April 29th, so you've got plenty of time to watch the beautiful original anime (and subsequently fulfill your destiny of complaining that the only animated follow-up it got were mediocre 3D efforts), and not so much time to read the original manga. Still worth a shot, I suppose.

By the end of the season, it’s revealed that the package delivery is just one piece in a plan to produce the deadly car combat tournament that made the <em>Twisted Metal </em>video games famous. We also find out that his long-lost sister Dollface (Tiana Okoye), who we’ll find out is named Krista in the second season, is the leader of a group of female vigilantes known as the Dolls.

Mr. Grimm, one of only three characters to appear in every <em>Twisted Metal</em> game, will debut as the soul-stealing biker in the second season, and will be portrayed by Richard de Klerk. In addition to him, fans can expect the second season to introduce arguably the most recognizable character from the <em>Twisted Metal</em> games, the half-man, half-murder vehicle Axel, appearing in War Wheel form. Axel is famously known as the muscular man who rides around with two gigantic wheels on his arms. <em>Twisted Metal </em>showrunner Michael Jonathan Smith explained Axel was missing from the first season because they hadn’t yet figured out how to bring him to the live-action screen.</p><p> “How do you do a character that is literally a giant muscular man stuck between two gigantic wheels? You look at the design and you say, ‘How?’ And then after you ask why. And I think it was a challenge. Absolutely.” </p><p>Smith assures us that Axel will appear in the second season in a rig that looks more makeshift than futuristic, noting that this is a “1.0 version of Axel” that’s still being worked on by whoever created Axel in the show. As long as he’s rolling around causing mayhem with the rest of the contestants in the live-action <em>Twisted Metal </em>battle royale, we’ll be happy murder voyeurs when July 31 comes around. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A release date has yet to be announced. <span id="more-959489"></span></p><p>Here are the latest details:</p><blockquote><p><strong>What is Freeflow Gun Fu?</strong></p><p>Today’s trailer showcases <em>SPINE</em>‘s Freeflow Gun Fu combat in which the protagonist, Redline, moves from enemy to enemy, parrying and disarming them, and turning their own weapons against them in seamless combos. Players can creatively use the physical environment against Redline’s opponents – crushing enemies against surfaces, throwing them from ledges, and fighting back with makeshift melee weapons for truly cinematic combat sequences that are different every time.</p><p>“Freeflow Gun Fu combat means constant tactical awareness—both of your enemies and of the surroundings in which you fight,” said <em>SPINE</em> director Dmitry Pimenov. “For us, everything comes back to that cinematic experience, while always giving players complete control. We want to make players feel like both the star and the director of their own action movie, rewarding them with opportunities for creative takedowns by mastering the combo system and the environment, and showcasing their combos with dynamic camera angles to immerse them in the action.”</p><p><strong>Hardcore Mode</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The trailer also includes the first tease of <em>SPINE</em>‘s Hardcore mode. <em>SPINE</em>‘s cinematic twist on “no-hit” gameplay sees Redline wear sunglasses which will only remain intact if the player makes it through the game untouched by enemy attacks.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the new trailer below.

                <p>During this week's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-nintendo-direct-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/1100-6530837/" data-ref-id="1100-6530837">Mario Kart World-focused livestream</a>, Nintendo reiterated an important fact about the Switch 2 console bundle that comes with the game: It will only be available until Fall 2025. Nintendo originally announced the bundle's limited availability during the Switch 2 Direct earlier this month, but with preorder delays and controversy around game prices, this key detail has flown a bit under the radar.</p><p>Nintendo hasn't announced a firm cutoff date for the launch bundle, but the Fall 2025 stopping point for manufacturing could mean the bundle won't be on store shelves this holiday season. Granted, it's very possible that it will be a challenge to find the Switch 2, bundle or not, on store shelves in the US this year. Stock availability concerns have only increased in recent weeks due to the Trump administration's new tariffs.</p><p>Outside of reconfirming the limited availability for the bundle, Nintendo's 15-minute Mario Kart World livestream stayed clear of the Switch 2 console itself. We still don't know <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">when console preorders will be available in the US and Canada</a>, but Nintendo unveiled several exciting details about Mario Kart World, including the return of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battle-mode-is-back-in-mario-kart-world-two-minigames-confirmed/1100-6530930/" data-ref-id="1100-6530930">Battle Mode</a> and an in-depth look at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-how-eating-meals-and-unlocking-costumes-works/1100-6530926/" data-ref-id="1100-6530926">new costume and meal systems</a>.</p><p>Mario Kart World launches exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5, the same day as the console.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/void-interactives-ready-or-not-coming-to-consoles-in-summer-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>VOID Interactive's tactical FPS Ready or Not will be arriving on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles sometime this coming summer 2025, the studio announced on Thursday.</p>
<p>Ready or Not puts you in the boots of modern-day SWAT teams sent into hostile situations where you are trying not to pull the trigger as often as possible, and take culprits alive by following proper rules of engagement. Running in with your guns blazing is a fast track to mission failure, which is where the tactical side of Ready or Not's gameplay comes in.</p>
<p>First released in Early Access in December 2021, Ready or Not launched its full 1.0 version two years later in <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-launches-out-of-early-access-adding-lots-of-missions-and-content/">December 2023</a>. Now, a little more than a year after that launch, it is nearly ready to make its console debut.</p>
<p>A new trailer for Ready or Not was shown during the Galaxies Showcase 2025 event, which you can see below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ready or Not – Console Reveal Trailer (PS5/Xbox Series X)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jW3zr1Jn5bM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>VOID Interactive has been on a long journey with Ready or Not, first announcing the game back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/tactical-fps-ready-or-not-swat/">2017</a>. It's also had its fair share of issues along the way, like being temporarily removed from Steam due to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-or-not-was-temporarily-removed-from-steam-due-to-trademark-infringement/">trademark infringement</a> and the controversy surrounding a level in the game depicting a <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-top-selling-game-ready-or-not-has-its-devs-commenting-on-planned-school-shooting-level/">bomb threat at a school</a>, which prompted a <a href="https://x.com/VOIDInteractive/status/1474203773878816778">statement</a> from the development team.</p>
<p>Neither issue has stopped Ready or Not from achieving a 'Very Positive' rating on Steam across 180,000+ user reviews. It'll be interesting to see how console players take to it, and anyone interested can rush to their device to wishlist the game now.</p>

We've known Penguin was in the game since its reveal last week, but today's Direct decided to feature this blue cutie in a very meme-specific way...by repeatedly throwing him off cliffs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This happened not once, but <em>twice</em> during the Direct, as fans have pointed out on social media. On one occasion, Penguin simply misjudges a curve and sails neatly off over an icy landscape:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Even Nintendo is deliberately dropping blue penguins off of icy ledges.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarioKartWorld?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MarioKartWorld</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarioKartWorldDirect?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MarioKartWorldDirect</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Nintendo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Nintendo</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Switch2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Switch2</a> <a href="https://t.co/0eMsUE24Jz" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/0eMsUE24Jz</a></p>— Jonathan Leung (@VGMaps) <a href="https://twitter.com/VGMaps/status/1912876504939180190?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 17, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">But in a second, even more on the nose move, a Penguin in Free Roam drives straight off a cliff into the sea below while music from Super Mario 64 toodles away in the background:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">29 years later and we still chucking penguins off of cliffs like in Mario 64<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarioKartWorld?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#MarioKartWorld</a> <a href="https://t.co/7klPg5rZkM" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/7klPg5rZkM</a></p>— 🔥FireShadow64🔥(DROP THE PRICE) (@FireShadow64) <a href="https://twitter.com/FireShadow64/status/1912862828089770470?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 17, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">If you're confused as to why this is noteworthy, allow me to draw your attention to a long-standing community meme of Penguin from Super Mario 64. In Super Mario 64, players discovered years ago that it was possible to collect a Power Star from Mother Penguin by returning Baby Penguin to her, then to take Baby Penguin after the star appears and take them away again...or even drop them off a cliff:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This bit has been memed into fame for over a decade by the Mario community, so it's extremely funny to see Nintendo acknowledge it even if it's in a somewhat subtle, plausible-deniability kind of way. Is this a horrendous thing to do? Society still hasn't come down cleanly on one side or another of the Penguin-cliff debate. At least Mario Kart World gives Penguin a nice little water vehicle so they can just keep going once they've landed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's Mario Kart Nintendo Direct wasn't exactly the font of new information many were hoping it would be, but we still got word on some interesting new stuff: more new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-direct-reveals-new-and-returning-courses-even-more-characters">characters, courses</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-coolest-new-features-explained-items-tricks-food-modes-and-more">items, and features</a>, as well as a close look (courtesy of Penguin and others) of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-free-roam-mode-is-an-open-world-road-trip-you-can-take-with-friends">new open world Free Roam</a> mode, which will let players drive around anywhere in the world without restraint.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-direct-everything-announced-for-the-switch-2-launch-title">everything announced right here</a>.

During <a title="Genres > Rhythm [175 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rhythm">rhythm game</a>play, you only need two buttons: a button for up and a button for down.

The other half is trying to keep up with ours.</p><p>The pink-haired girl is Beat, and she is you, and you have a lot of things to worry about. The cops are everywhere, and they are mad at you for what feels like no good reason. Though it doesn’t help your case that you keep making friends with people that the cops are mad at for slightly better reasons. But what do I know?</p><p>Talk to people, help them out (or don’t, I’m not your mom!), play huge concerts, and punch cops. And then run away from the cops you punched. Also there are monsters or something. Not sure what’s going on there?!?!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>All of this culminates in massive setpieces where everything is at stake. The music got you here. It’ll get you through it.</p><p><em>UNBEATABLE</em>‘s full arcade mode is an entire game by itself with its own progression system and a full online component. There’s modifiers, tons of songs (with more to come!) and a whole challenge board to beat, with things to do that range from as simple as “beat a song on easy mode” to, one may presume, something as complicated as “solve an ancient riddle while skateboarding.” That’s not a real example.</p></blockquote><p><em>UNBEATABLE</em> is due out for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2240620/view/511829843667583107?snr=1_5_9_" target="_blank">Steam</a> in 2025.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Demo Launch Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="UNBEATABLE: GAMEPLAY TRAILER 2.0" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XwKFOZeJukA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There are rumors of skins based on <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1905672098158129199" rel="nofollow ">C-3PO</a>, <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1905431434577195237" rel="nofollow ">Qui-Gon Jinn</a>, <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1905679942827769960" rel="nofollow ">Palpatine</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/blortzen/status/1912010808965452245" rel="nofollow ">General Grievous</a>, but those seem to be more like guesswork than true leaks, and it's also not clear, if the rumors are true, whether these would be in the battle pass or in the shop.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Lego_Fortnite_Star_Wars_updates_in_Chapter_6_Season_3">Lego Fortnite Star Wars updates in Chapter 6 Season 3</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4478348-fortnitelegopasschewbacca.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4478348" data-ratio="0.56016597510373" data-width="1928" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4478348-fortnitelegopasschewbacca.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4478348"></a><figcaption>Last summer's Lego Pass featuring Chewbacca</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4478348-fortnitelegopasschewbacca.jpg"></figure><p>We haven't had any leaks about Star Wars-themed Lego Fortnite updates, <em>but</em> the current Lego Pass also ends on May 2. If Star Wars season is indeed arriving in battle royale that day, it stands to reason the same thing will happen in Lego Fortnite Odyssey. Last year's Lego Pass (pictured above) included a Chewbacca skin and ushered in a major Star Wars storyline, and so it seems safe to assume that the next Lego Pass will include another Star Wars person, and that the Galactic Civil War will once again intrude upon your Lego Fortnite islands.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/drunkards-druggies-delinquents-pre-orders-now-open<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pre-orders are now live for <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1183ce14-1675-44b1-af00-4d7855d7f06c" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/chris-prynoski-talks-drunkards-druggies-and-delinquents-how-420-joke-became" rel="nofollow"><em>Drunkards, Druggies, &amp; Delinquents</em></a>. This light RPG experience is the tabletop game debut for Titmouse, the animation studio behind many beloved mature animated shows spanning both character dramas and crass comedies.</p>



<p>In an official press release, Titmouse announced pre-orders went live for <em>Drunkards, Druggies, &amp; Delinquents</em> as part of the company celebrating their 25th anniversary. Copies of the game will begin shipping in late August ahead of a Fall 2025 retail release.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/drunkards-druggies-delinquents-box-artwork.jpg?itok=MFEHnCka 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/drunkards-druggies-delinquents-box-artwork.jpg?itok=rrkF4i18 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The game was originally pitched as an April Fools Day gag, but became a passion project for Titmouse starting in 2023. The lead creators are company Founder Chris Prynoski and Chief Creative Officer Antonio Canobbio. The game is designed for 3-8 adult players and a single game can last roughly 1-3 hours.</p>

<p><em>Drunkards, Druggies, &amp; Delinquents</em> is a blend of a light TTRPG, fantasy quest, party game, and collaborative trainwreck. Players take on the roles of unpredictable anti-heroes taking on increasingly absurd quests, leading to wild improvisation and escalating hilarity. The character classes include the Beerbarian, Weed Wraith, the Whiskey Wizard, and the Druid of the Flower.</p>

<p>The focus of the game isn't on strategy or victory, but on improv. Yes, you can get equipment for your character, and you do roll dice to resolve challenges. The twist is that if your character gets hurt, you have to drink or partake in whatever substance you have on hand. If you want a cleaner experience, these explicit prompts can be swapped out for drinking soda or doing dares.</p>

<p>This explicit style of game is in keeping with Titmouse's body of work. They are an award-winning animation studio whose work includes Mike Judge's <em>Beavis &amp; Butthead</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/star-trek-lower-decks-buffer-time-card-game-about-doing-starfleet-menial-tasks" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em></a>, Adult Swim's <em>The Venture Bros</em>, and Critical Role's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/legend-of-vox-machina-season-4-confirmed-by-critical-role-and-prime-video-ahead-of-s3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em></a>.</p>

        <p>And a couple of Shin Megami Tensei games to boot, too</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/armored-core-vi-fires-of-rubicon">Armored</a> Core is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/fromsoftware">FromSoftware</a> series that absolutely rips, and has done since its debut way back on the PS1. Technically us PC players only recently were graced with the ability to play something from the series with the release of Armored Core 6, but soon we'll have a couple more to mess around with. The only caveat is that it would be helpful if you could speak Japanese, as they're not getting an English language release.
</p>

<p>
You see, back in the early 2000s, Japan had some pretty advanced phones, some of which had cameras built in, internet access, GPS, and yes, even games. Some of them had whole ports of classic Final Fantasys, and there's even a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> spinoff that's exclusive to one of these phones (which is, legally speaking, unplayable to this day despite supposedly being canon). Amongst the numerous other series that got early mobile spinoffs - I'm talking <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a>, Monster Hunter, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/katamari-damacy">Katamari Damacy</a>, Persona - Armored Core also received a few entries too.

<p>
And, as announced by developer G-Mode, Armored Core Mobile Mission and its sequel Mobile Mission 2 are coming to Steam. The first one's actually due out soon, on April 30th, and you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3633410/GMODE_ARMORED_CORE_MOBILE_MISSION/">wishlist it on Steam</a>, but the second one doesn't have a release date just yet. Mobile mission is a top down shooter, but you can still customise your mech, and the second one actually lets you walk around its levels too. Honestly, really impressive stuff for the time.
</p>
<p>
Not only that, there's a couple of Shin Megami Tensei ports on the way too, if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a> are more your thing. The first of them, Tokyo Requiem, was a completely original game for Japanese phones, whereas <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/20xx">20XX</a> was a prequel to Shin Megami Tensei 2. Neither have release dates just yet, but the latter is available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3652460/GMODE_20XX/">wishlist on Steam</a> too.
</p>
<p>
Again, none of this will be playable in English, but I really love the work that G-Mode is putting into these releases. Their whole shtick is porting old Japanese phone games, not an easy feat given that some of them were exclusive to certain networks, so I'm chuffed to see them playable on modern hardware. Good motivation to finally start those Japanese lessons I reckon!

around in 2025. In a post on <a href="https://x.com/Rebelzize/status/1912137244036522179" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X</a>, they said "the real remake is the friends we made along the way." They then clarified their stance.</p><p dir="ltr">"To be clear this changes nothing for me," Rebelzize <a href="https://x.com/Rebelzize/status/1912175393148199140" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>, in reference to the official Oblivion Remastered also likely releasing this year. "This always was a passion project and still is until the end. For the community it's a win-win as you get twice the amount of Oblivion this year. All love and no hate towards the people who made the official remaster."</p><p dir="ltr">Despite both the official remaster and the mod both effectively being remakes of Oblivion, their approaches look to be quite different. Skyblivion not only remakes Oblivion in Skyrim's engine while looking to keep Oblivion's original look and gameplay intact, but will also add new content in the form of quests, monsters, and expanded cities. It will also feature new music, a reimagined lockpicking minigame, and an overhaul of the game's UI.</p><p dir="ltr">While Oblivion Remastered still hasn't been officially announced, details gleaned from the leaks already show some significant changes, such as a more desaturated look and potential changes to the game's combat. Those two things alone will set it apart from Skyblivion.</p><p dir="ltr">If nothing else, players will at least have some choice when it comes to which version of Oblivion to play later this year. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-wait-for-elder-scrolls-6-just-reached-a-sad-milestone/1100-6528679/" data-ref-id="1100-6528679">the wait for The Elder Scrolls VI will likely continue to be a very long one</a>.</p>
