            <p>Tenjutsu is an all-new roguelike action game from the designer of Dead Cells.</p>
<p>While we didn't get a release date when Devolver Digital made the reveal, we did get to see some gameplay courtesy of a comprehensive, if brief, announcement trailer, which you can see below:</p>

<p>"Step into the shoes of a renegade yakuza hellbent on defying her former associates and loosening their grip on the Secret Garden City in this fast and fluid rogue-jutsu from Sébastien Benard, the designer of Dead Cells," teases the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1363940/Tenjutsu/">Steam</a> description.</p>
<p>Tenjutsu blends "roguelike mechanics with intensely fast melee combat and demanding tactical precision" in which you'll get to "wield the brutal brawling systems as if each encounter could be your last and master a diverse arsenal of weapons, upgrades, and techniques to break the crushing hold the syndicates come to maintain".</p>
<p>"Tenjutsu is born from a Ludum Dare game jam and the ashes of Dead Cells, despite my desire NOT to make another rogue. Guess what, I'm doing another one," says creator Benard.</p>
<p>"To sum it up, Tenjutsu is what John Wick or Jackie Chan would have been if they were a combat roguelite. An action-packed melee combat system, where you face multiple enemies simultaneously, filled with split-second battle opportunities.</p>
<p>"My idea was to make the combat way more dynamic than in Dead Cells by adding opportunities, combat space management, and crowd control to create true 'one vs. many' situations."</p>
<p>Benard adds that the game will boast "tons of unique weapons, loot, upgrades, and bosses" and allows players to have "control of their path" so you can tackle bosses in whatever order best suits you.</p>
<p>"There’s so much more to talk about – the city evolutions, the enemies, the progression system! – but... no, today is not the time... yet," Benard teased.</p>
<p>Last year, Dead Cells developers Motion Twin <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-cells-is-getting-a-ten-episode-animated-series-next-year">revealed</a> its acclaimed rogue-like action-platformer was being turned into a 10-episode animated series, and a first proper trailer has now been shared ahead of its arrival later this month.</p>
<p>Dead Cells: Immortalis (as it's titled in France) has been produced in conjunction with French anime streaming service ADN, and its 10 seven-minute-long episodes will air there on 19th June. An English version and worldwide release is due later this year.</p>

<p>The Black Ops 6 pre-order pages have gone online on the PlayStation and Xbox stores, revealing that the game will release on October 25, 2024.</p>



<p>The Vault Edition of Black Ops 6 includes;</p>



<ul>
<li>Cross Gen Bundle of Call of Duty®: Black Ops 6 </li>



<li>Hunters vs. Hunted Operator Pack</li>



<li>4 Operator Skins: Adler, Park, Brutus and Klaus </li>



<li>Mastercraft Collection </li>



<li>5 Mastercraft Weapons </li>



<li>BlackCell (1 Season)*** – Includes: Battle Pass, 20 Tier Skips, 1,100 CP and more</li>



<li>GobbleGum Pack for Zombies </li>



<li>12 GobbleGums of high rarities </li>
</ul>



<p>The price of the Vault edition is $100.</p>



<p>The Standard Edition of Black Ops 6 includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Cross Gen Bundle of Call of Duty®: Black Ops 6 </li>



<li>Open Beta Early Access</li>



<li>Woods operator pack</li>
</ul>



<p>The PlayStation store has also listed that the Vault Edition for Black Ops 6 will launch on October 17th, 2024, which is one week earlier than the standard edition.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear on what gamesmodes the Vault Edition will include for early release, but to be in line with past entries, it could be Campaign.</p>



<p>The official description reads,<br></p>



<p>“Developed by Treyarch and Raven, Black Ops 6 is a spy action thriller set in the early 90s, a period of transition and upheaval in global politics, characterized by the end of the Cold War and the rise of the United States as a single superpower. With a mind-bending narrative, and unbound by the rules of engagement, this is signature Black Ops. </p>



<p>The Black Ops 6 Campaign provides dynamic moment-to-moment gameplay that includes a variety of play spaces with blockbuster set pieces and action-packed moments, high-stakes heists, and cloak-and-dagger spy activity. </p>



<p>In a best-in-class Multiplayer experience, players will test their skills across 16 new maps at launch, including 12 core 6v6 maps and 4 Strike maps that can be played 2v2 or 6v6. </p>



<p>Black Ops 6 also marks the epic return of Round-Based Zombies, the fan-favorite mode where players will take down hordes of the undead in two brand-new maps at launch. Post-launch, players can look forward to even more exciting maps and groundbreaking experiences dropping into both Multiplayer and Zombies.”</p>

<p dir="ltr">When asked about why now was the best time for Fatal Fury to return, Oda remarked that he wanted to bring the series back sooner, before then mentioning that the idea stems from a larger initiative to bring back franchises represented in The King Of Fighters.</p><p dir="ltr">"KOF has become our all-star game, and it was the only series that was really alive for a long time," Oda said via a translator. "The origin of KOF, of course, is all of the other games it brings together, so I want to go through and bring all of these other original IP back as much as possible."</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of KoF, Oda also confirmed that more downloadable fighters will be coming to The King Of Fighters XV, though specific details on how many and release timing are still in discussions.</p><p dir="ltr">Fatal Fury: City Of The Wolves releases in early 2025 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/10-best-vampire-video-games/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=10-best-vampire-video-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="274" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/10-best-zombie-games-of-all-time-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zombies</a> may rule the world of media monsters nowadays, but Vampires have been a mainstay ever since Dracula — the person, not the book. They’ve been the inspiration for great movies, some great guilty pleasure literature, and some of the best video games ever made. </p> <p data-characters="75" data-current-count="75" data-injectable="false">Let’s take a look at the best vampire-themed video games of all time.</p> <figure data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Konami</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</h2> <p data-characters="171" data-current-count="546" data-injectable="true">While competition sure is fierce, I believe <em>Symphony of the Night</em> to be not just one of the best vampire games ever made, but also the greatest Metroidvania in existence. </p>
 <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false"><em>Symphony of the Night</em> has the glorious idea of beginning with a small gameplay segment from <em>Rondo Of Blood,</em> the previous game in the series<em>,</em> before showing you all the improvements brought about by the new game. I think that’s how all <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/top-video-game-sequels-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">great sequels</a> should begin, as the transition makes it impossible for you to ignore all the work put into the game. </p> <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="665" data-injectable="true">The scenery, the moves, the animations themselves, the enemies, the soundtrack. Even though it’s a 2D title, <em>Sotn</em> looks so good that it always has me feeling like it’s pushing the original PlayStation to its limits — not to worry, though, as it ran ultra smooth at all times even way back then.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="El Paso, Elsewhere - Official Draculae Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wl8e8I9IwnY?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">El Paso, Elsewhere</h2> <p data-characters="559" data-current-count="859" data-injectable="true">Do you miss the <em>Max Payne</em> video games and the <em>Blade </em>movies? Then <em>El Paso, Elsewhere</em> is the game you want to play right <em>now</em>. You can expect pretty much the same gameplay from the classic <em>Ma</em>x Payne games — and even the trippiness of those wild dream levels. Everything gets even better when you throw vampires and werewolves into the mix, and <em>El Paso, Elsewhere</em> is no different. Above all, <em>El Paso’s</em> greatest triumph is its ability to prove that you can bring the flavor of classic games to newer times without having everything be a remaster or remake.</p>
 <p data-characters="112" data-current-count="112" data-injectable="false">You should really give <em>El Paso</em> a try, or at least wait with great anticipation for <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/vampire-trauma-tale-el-paso-elsewhere-is-getting-a-film-adaptation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its upcoming film adaptation.</a></p> <figure data-current-count="412" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image by Konami</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Castlevania: Lords Of Shadow</h2> <p data-characters="176" data-current-count="176" data-injectable="false">Forcing an extra dimension into a game that works so well in 2d can be a mistake — as proven by the not-so-great <em>Castlevania 64</em>, but <em>Lords Of Shadow</em> more than pulled it off. </p> <p data-characters="223" data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false">Drawing more inspiration from titles such as the <em>God Of War</em> trilogy and <em>Devil May Cry</em> was an ace choice as <em>Castlevania</em> was reborn as yet another excellent 3d action-adventure title capable of rivaling the best of them all. </p>  <figure data-current-count="699" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via GOG</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Blood Omen: Legacy Of Kain</h2> <p data-characters="417" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="true">Please don’t let the great power of the cover art’s dated art throw you off. <em>Blood Omen</em> likely surprised many upon its release as it completely changed everyone’s perceptions of what you could do with vampires. Instead of a total bloodbath, you get a partial bloodbath where most of the gameplay involves using your wits to understand what powers you need to make use of to advance in your campaign.</p>
 <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">Also, If you grew up playing <em>Blood Omen</em>, then you probably got filled with a sense of bewilderment when you first heard someone complaining that video games had bad writing. Amy Hennig’s first of many great works in the video game scene told a beautifully original tale of death, and also introduced one of the coolest vampires of all media, the titular Kain.</p> <figure data-current-count="665" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Vampire Survivors</h2> <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">Fans of vampire media usually want bloody, edgy, sexy stuff, but sometimes they just want to relax. <em>Vampire Survivors</em> provides lovers of vampire stuff the exact type of relaxation that they want, which is naturally by giving them the chance to obliterate countless hordes of vampiric beasts. </p> <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="571" data-injectable="true">It’s pretty simple in nature, but it’s way more challenging than someone unacquainted with the genre would expect — but also way more fun. This is the one that all modern vampires play in their coffin when taking a break from all the vampire drama in their unlives.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Stunlock Studios</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">V Rising</h2> <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="685" data-injectable="true">Down to its very title, <em>V Rising</em> seems like a game made for people who wanted <em>Valheim</em> but with vampires. The good news is that the vampire-themed survival horror provides just as much fun as <em>Valheim</em> does, but it’s its very own beast. Whereas <em>Valheim</em> allows players to build their own Viking village, <em>V Rising</em> invites them to build their own vampire castle. How can you beat that?</p>
 <p data-characters="160" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false">Consider giving this one a chance if you happen to belong to a coterie of vampires who want to test their survival skills in a hostile but very fun environment.</p> <figure data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines</h2> <p data-characters="146" data-current-count="146" data-injectable="false">As far as getting to experience the life of a vampire in a world that a vampire would enjoy, we’re yet to see a game that beats <em>Bloodlines.</em> </p> <p data-characters="421" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true">Please ignore all the reviews from the time of its release because, yeah, it did come out in a very rough shape, but that doesn’t tell its whole story. Though it came out pretty much unfinished, the plot and the heart were always there, so fans spent years pumping blood into this true undead gem to bring it back to life and turn it into the very playable masterpiece that it is today (if you get the GOG version).</p>
 <p data-characters="178" data-current-count="178" data-injectable="false">Here’s hoping that the long-in-development <em>Bloodlines</em> <em>2</em> comes out — even if not in a great shape — because the community is both ready and very thirsty for its arrival.</p> <figure data-current-count="478" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via PlayStation</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Bloodrayne </h2> <p data-characters="243" data-current-count="243" data-injectable="false">In all honesty, whatever game you pick in the <em>Bloodrayne</em> series will likely pale in comparison to every other game on this list in terms of story and character depth, but it does feature some fun gameplay and is not without its secret weapons.</p> <p data-characters="204" data-current-count="447" data-injectable="true">It was far from a groundbreaking game when it came out, but it featured some incredibly bloody action, and the whole thing is naturally very elevated by inviting players to kill as many Nazis as they can.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via CD Projekt</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-the-witcher-3-blood-and-wine" data-injectable="false">The Witcher 3: Blood and Wine </h2> <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="556" data-injectable="true">Ok, this might be cheating because it’s a DLC but a) anyone who’s played it knows that it’s long and sweet enough to earn its place here and b) you’re now too deep into this list to close the tab without checking out the last entry.</p>
 <p data-characters="226" data-current-count="226" data-injectable="false">Both the <em>Hearts of Stone</em> and the <em>Blood and Wine</em> DLCs could be full games in their own right because of the depth of the story that they tell. Still, unlike <em>Hearts of Stone</em>, <em>Blood and Wine</em> also has the scope of an entire game. </p> <p data-characters="307" data-current-count="533" data-injectable="true">It takes players on a massive detour from <em>Wild Hunt’s</em> main quest by having them stay on a gorgeous land inspired by southern France. Then, the party is either crashed or made even more fun when Geralt has to dive deep into a vampire conspiracy. It’s as fun, magical, and sexy as you can imagine.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Crystal Dynamics</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Legacy Of Kain: Soul Reaver</h2> <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="597" data-injectable="true">If you want a really original take on the vampire mythos, you can do no better than the game that introduced Raziel. <em>Soul Reaver</em> takes place after Crystal Dynamics<em> </em>decided to make the bad ending of <em>Blood Omen</em> the canon one — just so you know the amount of courage that went into making this one.</p>
 <p data-characters="208" data-current-count="208" data-injectable="false">The gameplay leap made from the original <em>Blood Omen</em> to <em>Soul Reaver</em> is comparable to what happened with the <em>GTA </em>series with the jump to 3d with <em>GTA 3</em>, and the leap in story presentation went even beyond that. </p> <p data-characters="307" data-current-count="515" data-injectable="false"><em>Soul Reaver</em> was both the closest you could get to a <em>Zelda</em> game on the original PlayStation, as well as a better in-console alternative to the <em>Tomb Raider </em>series. Even though it features a few too many box-based puzzles, it’s still one of the best and most engrossing action-adventure titles ever made.</p>

<p data-characters="193" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Undoubtedly the most looked-forward <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuthering Waves</a></em> character at launch, Yinlin did justice to her fame by setting herself apart as the game’s best Electro-sub DPS and offensive support. </p> <p data-characters="301" data-current-count="301" data-injectable="false">But although able to excel both on and off the field given her high damage and buffs, she will still need a tailor-made build to truly take control of the strings of battle. Here’s the best Yinlin sub-DPS build in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, as well as how to build her as a main DPS for those interested. </p> <h2 id="h-the-best-weapons-for-sub-and-main-dps-yinlin-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">The best weapons for Sub and Main DPS Yinlin in Wuthering Waves</h2> <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="556" data-injectable="true">No matter if you plan on building her as a sub or main DPS, the best weapon for Yinlin in<em> Wuthering Waves </em>is her signature rectifier <strong>Stringmaster</strong>. The 5-star is by far the best in the game, given its ability to offer a 36% Crit Rate increase at level 90. </p>
 <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false">When using the weapon, Yinlin will also receive a 12% all DMG boost and will be able to get an up to 24% increase in ATK by performing her Resonance Skill multiple times. Stringmaster will also provide a permanent 12% ATK boost while she is off the field, thus reinforcing her main role as a sub-DPS. All values are related to the weapon at Rank 1.</p> <figure data-current-count="648" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="455" data-current-count="455" data-injectable="true">If you don’t plan on getting her weapon or fail to do so, the best pick for Yinlin is the also 5-star Cosmic Ripples. The weapon will provide both a large amount of attack and a 12.8% Energy Regen boost. The rectifier also allows you to increase Yinlin’s Basic Attack DMG by up to 16% by hitting enemies with her normals. Those who reach Union level 45 can get Cosmic Ripples for free by selecting it as their 5-star Weapon Supply Chest pick. </p>
 <h3 id="h-best-4-star-weapons-for-yinlin" data-injectable="false">Best 4-star weapons for Yinlin</h3> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="355" data-injectable="false">Thanks to its Crit Rate substat, the best 4-star weapon for both sub and main DPS Yinlin is the BP-exclusive Augment. If you don’t want to purchase the premium battle pass, Jinzhou Keeper will be my main pick. When equipped, the weapon will offer a heavy ATK value and allow you to get an extra 8% ATK and 10% HP by using your Resonance Skill (R1). </p> <p data-characters="119" data-current-count="474" data-injectable="true">To recap, here’s an overview of the best weapons for Yinlin, as well as the best 3-star pick for her as an extra:</p>
 <figure data-found-rows="5" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Weapon Name</th><th data-align="center">Rarity</th><th data-align="center">Main Substat</th><th data-align="center">Overview of its Passives at R1</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Stringmaster (Best in slot)</td><td data-align="center">5-star</td><td data-align="center">Crit Rate</td><td data-align="center">Offers a 12% all-DMG buff and the ability to get a 24% increase in ATK by using your Resonance Skill twice. When off the field, you will get a 12% ATK increase. </td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"> Cosmic Ripples</td><td data-align="center">5-star</td><td data-align="center">ATK</td><td data-align="center">Offers a 12.8% ER buff and the ability to increase your Basic Attack DMG by 3.2% per hit scored. You can get a maximum of 16% DMG from the buff. The stacks can be triggered once every 0.5 seconds. </td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Augment (Battle Pass exclusive)</td><td data-align="center">4-star</td><td data-align="center">Crit Rate</td><td data-align="center">Allows you to get a 15% ATK buff after performing your Resonance Liberation. The buff will last for 15 seconds. </td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Jinzhou Keeper</td><td data-align="center">4-star</td><td data-align="center">ATK</td><td data-align="center">Increases your ATK and DEF by 8 and 10% after performing your Resonance Skill. The buffs will last for 15 seconds. </td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Guardian Rectifier</td><td data-align="center">3-star</td><td data-align="center">ATK</td><td data-align="center">Offers a 12% increase in both Basic and Heavy Attack DMG.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <h2 id="h-best-sonata-and-echoes-for-yinlin" data-injectable="false">Best Sonata and Echoes for Yinlin</h2> <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="364" data-injectable="false">Both a 5-echo<strong> Void Thunder</strong> and a 5-echo <strong>Moonlit Clouds</strong> can be considered as the best Sonata for Yinlin, as while the former will boost her damage, the latter will offer valuable team-focused buffs. When using her as a sub-DPS, I recommend using Moonlit Clouds. Using Void Thunder is vital for the main DPS role. You can check out an overview of both Sonatas below:</p> <figure data-found-rows="2" data-current-count="744" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Sonata</th><th data-align="center">Effects</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Moonlit Clouds</strong></td><td data-align="center">2-Echo: Energy Regen +10%<br>5-Echo: Your Outro skill will also increase the ATK of the resonator taking the field by 22.5%.</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center"><strong>Void Thunder</strong></td><td data-align="center">2-Echo: Electro DMG Bonus +10%<br>5-Echo: You will get a 15% increase in Electro DMG Bonus after using Basic Attacks or your Resonance Skill. Maximum of 2 stacks. Each stack lasts 15 seconds.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="376" data-injectable="false">Thanks to its ability to allow Yinlin to boost the damage of the character taking the field by 12%, using Impermanence Heron as your main echo is a must for those going with Moonlit Clouds. For those going with Void Thunder, Thundering Mephis is my main pick. No matter your Sonata of choice, pair your Overlord pick with two Epic and Common echoes in a 4-3-3-1-1 formation. </p> <h3 id="h-best-stats-and-substats" data-injectable="false">Best stats and substats</h3> <figure data-current-count="676" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="412" data-current-count="412" data-injectable="true">Go with Crit Rate as the main stat for your main echo. You can change it to Crit DMG if using Stringmaster, as you will be able to easily hit the 60% Crit Rate threshold with only substats. To further maximize her damage, always go with two pairs of Electro DMG Bonus and ATK for the remaining echoes. No matter how you are building Yinlin, prioritize Crit Rate, Crit DMG, ATK, and ER when looking for substats. </p>
 <h2 id="h-best-teams-for-sub-dps-yinlin-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">Best Teams for Sub-DPS Yinlin in Wuthering Waves</h2> <p data-characters="465" data-current-count="465" data-injectable="true">Thanks to her ability to offer a 20% Electro and 25% Resonance Liberation DMG buff with her Outro Skill, Yinlin feels at home on teams featuring an Electro DPS like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-calcharo-build-in-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-compositions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Calcharo</a>. I dare to say that she and the leader of the Ghost Hounds are a match made in heaven, as her buffs feel tailor-made for his kit. Yinlin’s high damage will also allow you to only put Calcharo in the field once his Liberation is ready, thus further maximizing the party’s damage. </p>
 <h3 id="h-best-teams-for-main-dps-yinlin" data-injectable="false">Best teams for Main DPS Yinlin</h3> <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false">For those building her as a main DPS, I recommend using either <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-sanhua-build-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sanhua</a> for her Basic DMG buff or <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-mortefi-build-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-comp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortefi</a> for his Heavy Attack one. Going with Taoki can also work thanks to her ability to massively boost Yinlin’s Resonance Skill DMG. Using Yinlin as a main DPS is recommended for all who don’t have Calcharo, as he is the game’s only true-to-form Electro main DPS. </p> <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="669" data-injectable="false">Lastly, go with<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-verina-build-in-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-compositions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Verina</a> as the final piece in both our sub and main DPS teams. As the best healer in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, she will offer both survivability and many game-changing buffs. Verina can also revive one character per 10 minutes while at RS0. If you don’t have her, use <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-baizhi-build-wuthering-waves-weapons-echoes-and-team-comp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Baizhi</a>. </p>

<p>The indie fishing adventure will, ahem, "lure players back in" with new fish, new boat upgrades and gadgets, and a brand-new storyline.</p>

<p>Playable at any time in your Dredge adventure, The Iron Rig sees you join the Ironhaven Corporation to "collect resources to build a formidable base of operations, unlocking new tiers of equipment, abilities, gadgets, and consumables". And as part of the adventure, you'll get to "revisit every area from the base game with renewed purpose".</p>
<p>"As the drilling operation on the rig intensifies, something stirs in the primordial depths," Black Salt teases. "A dark liquid begins to seep into familiar and once-safe areas of the game, transforming them into perilous zones. Players must carefully assess the impact of this mysterious substance on local fish species, unveiling peculiar specimens from the abyssal depths as they go about adding more than 50 new fish to the game’s encyclopaedia.</p>
<p>"The Iron Rig expansion adds a new tier of fishing equipment, as well as new characters to interact with, new hazards to overcome, and new world events and lore to uncover."</p>
<p>The DLC will sell for £11.99/€11.99/$11.99, but mega fans can pick up the new DLC as part of the upcoming Dredge Collector's Edition, which is now available to pre-order.</p>
<p>As well as containing the base game and all DLCs, you'll get "exclusive" artwork and reversible inlay, a Sign of Ruin talisman replica, poster, map, and "a complete compendium of all fish and their aberrant variants".</p>
<p>You'll also get a message in a bottle from the developer, and a doubloon of your own. The special edition will be available in the USA, Europe, and Australasia and priced at £99.99/€99.99/$99.99.</p>
<p>You can pre-order from the <a href="https://www.dredge.game/the-iron-rig">official website</a>, although right now, it's seemingly only available for players in France, Germany, and Spain.</p>

<p>Don't forget that Dredge is now playable without the dread courtesy of a passive mode that lets you take to the high seas without fear of the denizens of the deep. Last May, the team confirmed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dredges-forthcoming-passive-mode-will-let-you-bob-about-without-the-hassle-of-monster-attacks">a free update now ensures "monsters that usually attack fishing boats will no longer be aggressive"</a> for those who prefer a less strenuous day on the water, as well as a fancy new photo mode.</p>
<p>And did you know that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cosmic-horror-fishing-game-dredge-gets-film-adaptation">a Dredge film adaptation is on the way</a>? Developer Black Salt Games is partnering on a film adaptation with production company Story Kitchen, which was launched in 2020 by Sonic the Hedgehog film producer Dmitri M. Johnson and other film industry veterans.</p>

  <p id="8qOn6i"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24168682/scavengers-reign-netflix-sci-fi-show"><em>Scavengers Reign</em></a> is an animated sci-fi show like no other. Where so many sci-fi shows are drilling down into characters through bits and multiversal hijinks, <em>Scavengers Reign</em> moves with gradual ferocity, constantly pulling back to remind us these characters are just one small speck <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23923003/scavengers-reign-tv-show-short-review-max">in the wider, weird world of Vesta</a> — a singular world they are decidedly stuck in. The flora and fauna of the alien planet are at once indifferent to their presence and a constant threat, always squelching and globbing and growing around them with untamed abandon. </p>
<p id="ODxlMN">That neat and fearsome world, for all its distinctiveness, does evoke other works. As co-creator Joe Bennett tells Polygon, the goal was always to not mirror those influences so much as let them inform something weird and new. “[They] were almost kind of subconscious,” Bennett says. “You’re going to be influenced by it no matter what, so we try to make a conscious effort to [separate] — we’ve been drawing like that our whole lives.” </p>
<p id="L2lJZn">Still, the names he cites are a great place to head if you’re eager for a season 2 of <em>Scavengers Reign</em> and itching for more like it. Here are some other works Bennett said provided some fodder for the look and feel of <em>Scavengers Reign</em>. </p>

<p id="lywuLq">It’s no surprise that the GOAT, Hayao Miyazaki, is someone Bennett says inspired the vibes of <em>Scavengers Reign.</em> The anime legend has <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23574291/james-cameron-avatar-war-nature-hayao-miyazaki">long woven themes of environmentalism</a> into his work, and, like some of the aliens on Vesta, isn’t always so fond of humanity. Miyazaki’s landscapes background his stories — shifting and breathing with a heartbeat of their own, chock-full of vivid colors and whimsical details — and seem totally in keeping with the feel of the series. </p>
<p id="KZEieg">Still, it’s the way <em>Scavengers Reign</em> challenges us to rethink our relationship with nature as something beyond a friend-or-adversary binary that feels the most relevant to Miyazaki’s influence on the show. Movies like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/25/21265521/nausicaa-of-the-valley-of-the-wind-studio-ghibli-movie-watch-meaning-manga"><em>Nausicaä</em></a> or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/27/21271782/princess-mononoke-hayao-miyazaki-best-studio-ghibli-movies-themes"><em>Princess Mononoke</em></a> encourage the same impulse that <em>Scavengers</em> does, asking the viewer to understand themselves as just one small part of the larger ecosystem around them. —<em>Zosha Millman</em></p>

<p id="pXF80j">The works of French comics artist Jean Giraud are imaginative and expansive, and quite often surreal. Like <em>Scavengers Reign</em>, his fantastical worlds volley between high levels of minute detail and gloriously vast big pictures. If you’re not familiar with his comics work — like <em>Blueberry</em>, <em>Mœbius</em>,<em> </em>or <em>Arzach</em> — you might still have encountered his work in other ways: He contributed storyboards and concept designs for films like <em>Alien</em>,<em> Tron</em>, and <em>The Fifth Element. </em>Meanwhile, Ridley Scott called him a key influence on the look of <em>Blade Runner</em>, while Miyazaki (a good friend of Giraud’s) was sad he encountered <em>Azrach</em> after already developing his own style, so he couldn’t use Giraud’s influence to enrich his work more. (<a href="http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/interviews/miyazaki_moebious.html">Still, he adds</a>: “Even today, I think it has an awesome sense of space. I directed <em>Nausicaä</em> under Mœbius’<em> </em>influence.”) —<em>ZM</em></p>

<p id="0z9tqc">The late king of anime psychological thrillers, Kon’s small but wildly influential oeuvre is a cornerstone for artists that look to marry the nigh-limitless potential of animation with hauntingly real and human thematic weight. While all of his works are worth exploring (or revisiting!), the two that feel most relevant to <em>Scavengers Reign</em> are <em>Paprika</em>, a bright and colorful work about the hunt for a dream terrorist invading the subconscious of people while they sleep, and his only TV series, <em>Paranoia Agent</em>, which follows the memetic horror that spins out of a single act of violence. Both, like <em>Scavengers</em>, are thoughtful explorations of what happens when delicate ecosystems are tarnished by base human impulses, and the ways we consistently warp the world around us into a grotesque reflection of ourselves. —<em>Joshua Rivera</em></p>

<p id="FDcOcB">While <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24003287/masaaki-yuasa-interview-5-films-boxed-set">Masaaki Yuasa’s vast and varied work in film and television</a> is just as rich and full of ideas as others on this list, you’ll see most of his influence in the limitless approach to imagining what the world of Vesta looks like. <em>Scavengers Reign</em> certainly has more <em>rules</em> it abides by, but it shares a spirit of wild whimsy, where every new creation is a misunderstood friend or the most horrifying thing you’ve ever met. Those looking to dive in have two avenues: Those that vibe with the visual head trip of <em>Scavengers Reign</em> should check out his early series <em>Kaiba</em> or <em>The Tatami Galaxy</em>,<em> </em>as well as his feature debut, <em>Mind Game</em>. If, however, the more wrenching emotional beats and memorably animated violence are what you want more of, try <em>Devilman Crybaby</em> (perhaps the most devastating show you can watch) or the bleak <em>Japan Sinks: 2020</em>. —<em>JR</em></p>

<p id="bIB1YD"><em>Fantastic Planet </em>is the kind of film that imprints itself on everyone who watches it. René Laloux’s cult-hit magnum opus remains a touchpoint for lovers of weird and wonderful science fiction, introducing viewers to the strange planet Ygam and hardly bothering to explain anything on it. You can see it reflected <em>Scavengers Reign</em>’s fixation on depicting Vesta’s food chain, and its characters’ terrible unfamiliarity with it. Both key into one of the genre’s brightest appeals: the terrible yet enlightening feeling that comes with contemplating your smallness in the universe, and the hubris of thinking any of it ought to make sense to you. —<em>JR</em></p>

<p id="LoB2Dd">Not all of the inspirations Bennett cites are animated. In fact, what he calls a “massive” influence came from the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@primitivetechnology9550">Primitive Technology</a>, where John Plant builds tools and structures completely out of materials found in the wild. (Plant has specified that it’s a hobby, as he does live in a modern house and eat modern food in Queensland.) The procedural and ASMR nature of the channel is what spoke to Bennett the most. </p>
<p id="r1vQAc">“You kind of see every process as he’s going through — up to like, for instance, if he’s like, building a hut, and then he gets to the point where he’s making the house, he’s making tiles. And so he grabs the mud, and he’s like, shaping the mud. He’s got to build the mold, so that’s like taking a piece of bamboo and opening it up, and he makes the wet mud. But then he’s like, <em>I gotta burn it. I’m gonna make a kiln to do that</em>,” Barnett says. “The process is <em>crazy</em>. By the time you’ve finished watching it, it’s so satisfying; it really feels great. </p>
<p id="AU46OH">“And you’re hearing just the sound of nature. There’s no added ingredients. It’s just so stripped-down basic.” —<em>ZM</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-edward-weevil-really-whitebeard%E2%80%99s-son-in-one-piece.895170/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/is-edward-weevil-really-whitebeards-son-in-one-piece/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=is-edward-weevil-really-whitebeards-son-in-one-piece<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="237" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>One Piece </em>isn’t a stranger to mysterious characters, especially since the series <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/10-mysteries-in-one-piece-that-still-have-no-clear-answers/">still holds <em>a lot </em>of secrets</a> despite being on its final arc. But even for its standard, one character stands out — the former Warlord Edward Weevil.</p> <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="246" data-injectable="false">I’m not exaggerating when I say Weevil came out of nowhere. He made his debut post-time skip, claiming to be Whitebeard’s son, and all the proof he has to support his claim is his slight likeness to the former Warlord and an old hag. </p> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="545" data-injectable="true">Despite the absurdity of his case, the World Government seemed to have bought into his narrative. After all, Weevil made his debut as a Warlord, a position offered only to the most notorious of pirates. The question, now, is whether Weevil is actually who he claims to be. Here’s what I think.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Toei Animation YouTube</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-edward-weevil-is-likely-not-whitebeard-s-son" data-injectable="false">Edward Weevil is likely not Whitebeard’s son</h2> <p data-characters="234" data-current-count="534" data-injectable="true">Weevil’s lineage is yet to be officially proven or disproven, but there are a lot of clues to speculate with. The primary telling point in this whole head-scratcher is the old hag who latches on Weevil like a leech, Miss Buckin.</p>
 <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">It has been revealed that Miss Buckin isn’t just some greedy old lady. She is actually Miss Buckingham Stussy and actually possesses a notable pirating history. She was a former member of both the infamous Rocks Pirates and the genius organization MADS. Both of these are important to finding out Weevil’s true identity.</p> <p data-characters="487" data-current-count="819" data-injectable="true">Whitebeard himself was a former member of Rocks Pirates, making him Miss Buckin’s former crewmate. Given Miss Buckin’s claims of being Whitebeard’s lover, it’s not that difficult to deduce that she at least has some interest in the former Warlord. And given their history, it’s not impossible something happened between the two. The only thing refuting this possibility is Marco’s denial, claiming Whitebeard didn’t have any biological children.</p>
 <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="402" data-injectable="true">Since Miss Buckin only had the gal to reveal Weevil’s supposed lineage after Whitebeard’s death, it’s highly probable there’s some catch to it. After all, hiding Weevil’s existence from Whitebeard, who could have easily acknowledged or denied their claim, makes Miss Buckin very suspicious. That’s where Miss Buckin’s second affiliation, MADS, comes into play.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via ONE PIECE Official YouTube</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-edward-weevil-may-be-whitebeard-s-clone" data-injectable="false">Edward Weevil may be Whitebeard’s clone</h2> <p data-characters="420" data-current-count="720" data-injectable="true">Miss Buckin herself claims that there is one person who can prove their claim. That person is Dr. Vegapunk. The members of MADS are known geniuses, with each member specializing in a certain field. And Miss Buckin’s research may be on cloning. After all, Cipher Pol’s Stussy turns out to be Miss Buckingham Stussy’s clone. As such, Weevil may not be Whitebeard’s son but Whitebeard’s clone.</p>
 <p data-characters="391" data-current-count="391" data-injectable="false">Assuming this theory is correct, the notable differences between Stussy and Weevil lead to further speculation. Stussy easily passes as a typical human being, possibly a younger version of Miss Buckingham Stussy. Weevil, on the other hand, only has Whitebeard’s unusually big mustache and blonde hair going for him. Plus, he has those suspicious stitches around his neck and left arm. </p> <p data-characters="398" data-current-count="789" data-injectable="true">What I’m trying to say is that Stussy is a perfect clone, while Weevil may have experienced some hiccups. Weevil may possibly be a prototype clone, existing before Stussy or Miss Buckin worked on Weevil without Vegapunk’s genius. After all, Vegapunk is known to perfect the other MADS members’ lifeworks like Caesar’s artificial Devil Fruit and Judge’s Lineage Factor.</p>
 <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">If such is the case, then everything checks out. Weevill will possess Whitebeard’s genes, thus making the former Emperor his father. Stussy may also have incorporated her genes into the process, ala Seraphim, making her Weevil’s mother. Even if she didn’t, the fact that she created Weevil technically also makes her his “mom.”</p>

<p data-characters="436" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Most trading card games (TCGs) struggle with defining the identities of their colors or card types within their early years. <em>Disney Lorcana</em> is still a toddler compared to the rest of the TCG genre, yet it has done a fantastic job at giving each of its <strong>ink types</strong> a distinct identity. Each of the six ink types have keyword abilities, themes and strategies that make them worthy of seeing play in both casual and competitive environments.</p> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/lorcana-six-ink-types-banner-text.webp&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Ravensburger</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image via Ravensburger</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image via Ravensburger</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure> <p data-characters="154" data-current-count="454" data-injectable="true">Inks in <em>Lorcana</em> can be compared to mana colors from <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> or the various elements from <em>Pokémon</em>. The six different types of inks are:&nbsp;</p>
 <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false"> <li>Amber</li> <li>Amethyst</li> <li>Emerald</li> <li>Ruby</li> <li>Sapphire</li> <li>Steel</li> </ul> <h2 id="h-why-are-ink-types-important-in-disney-lorcana" data-injectable="false">Why are ink types important in <em>Disney Lorcana</em>?</h2> <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="640" data-injectable="true">The Illumineers (players) use ink to play cards such as locations, items, or glimmers (characters). The type of ink that a card belongs to roughly determines what abilities or overall strategy it relates to. One of the best examples of this is the Ruby ink and how its cards, such as Maui—Hero to All, have keyword abilities such as Reckless or Rush, which enable the aggressive nature of the ink. </p>
 <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false"><em>Lorcana</em> decks can consist of up to two different ink types. This means if a deck is built with Ruby and Amethyst cards, it cannot contain cards from Emerald or the other ink types. Ideally, decks are built with ink pairs that complement each other which <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/every-disney-lorcana-starter-deck-ranked/">the official <em>Disney Lorcana</em> Starter Decks</a> do wonderfully.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="136" data-current-count="453" data-injectable="true">Here are every <em>Disney Lorcana</em> ink type, along with explanations of their characteristics, strengths, and most compatible ink pairings.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-every-ink-type-in-disney-lorcana" data-injectable="false">Every ink type in Disney Lorcana</h2> <h3 id="h-amber" data-injectable="false">Amber</h3> <p data-characters="262" data-current-count="262" data-injectable="false">The Amber ink type is considered the most supportive ink in <em>Lorcana</em>. Players can find <strong>Bodyguards</strong>, healing abilities, and many synergies that aren’t found in other ink types. Amber glimmers sport high willpower but has rather insignificant strength stats. </p> <p data-characters="175" data-current-count="437" data-injectable="true">This ink makes great use of the <strong>Bounce</strong> effects produced from the Amethyst ink or utilizes the high-cost Steel characters to sing some of the most impactful <strong>Songs</strong> in the game. </p>

The strength of this ink type is heavily attributed to the abilities that each card has and thus, doesn’t have the best stats. Despite this, Amethyst has one of the most competitive mechanics in the game, known as the “Bounce” effect.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/what-are-the-seraphim-in-one-piece/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=what-are-the-seraphim-in-one-piece<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="227" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After starting the Egghead Arc, the <em>One Piece </em>anime is dropping one revelation after another. After decades of mystery, fans finally got to see Dr. Vegapunk’s true appearance. And that’s only the tip of the iceberg.</p> <p data-characters="299" data-current-count="299" data-injectable="false">The future island Egghead being Dr. Vegapunk’s main base of operations means that it houses most of the genius’ inventions. Among them, the Seraphim certainly stand out. They possess impeccable fighting abilities and sport familiar appearances. So, what exactly are these curious beings?</p> <figure data-current-count="599" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via ONE PIECE Official YouTube</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-the-seraphim-are-the-strongest-version-of-the-pacifista" data-injectable="false">The Seraphim are the strongest version of the Pacifista</h2> <p data-characters="267" data-current-count="267" data-injectable="false">Simply put, the Seraphim are the strongest version of the Pacifista. However, likening them to the mindless Pacifistas is a disservice. The Seraphim are far more powerful combatants than the original Pacifista while also having the capability to think for themselves.</p> <p data-characters="490" data-current-count="757" data-injectable="true">Unlike the Pacifista who are made of metal formed in the likeness of Bartholomew Kuma, the Seraphim are actually clones of the former Warlords of the Sea. However, they are not simple clones. In addition to the former Warlords’ Lineage Factors, Dr. Vegapunk also utilized the Lunarian Lineage Factor. This gave the Seraphim a dark skin tone, white hair, black wings, and fire burning on their backs. Of course, the package also included the Lunarians’ near-invincible physique. </p>
 <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="363" data-injectable="false">The genius inventor also developed the Seraphim’s Green Blood, which contained the Lineage Factor of Paramythia Devil Fruit users. With the Green Blood coursing through them, the Seraphim also acquire Paramythia abilities. On top of all that, they are also equipped with the high-tech weaponry the Pacifistas are known for, like their signature laser beams.</p> <figure data-current-count="663" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-why-were-the-seraphim-created" data-injectable="false">Why were the Seraphim created?</h2> <p data-characters="194" data-current-count="194" data-injectable="false">There are seven Seraphim — one for each of the original Seven Warlords. Each Seraphim is given a codename, though only four of them are known at present: S-Bear, S-Hawk, S-Snake, and S-Shark. </p> <p data-characters="417" data-current-count="611" data-injectable="true">S-Bear is Bartholomew Kuma’s copy, including his Paw-Paw Fruit abilities. S-Hawk is Dracule Mihawk’s clone and wields the powers of the Dice-Dice Fruit. Boa Hancock continues her infatuation with Luffy in S-Snake, who also utilizes the power of the Love-Love Fruit. The last of the known named Seraphim, S-Shark, bears the likeness of Jimbei and possesses the power of Señor Pink’s Swim-Swim Fruit.</p>
 <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">The codenames for Dofflamingo, Crocodile, and Gecko Moria’s Seraphim remain a mystery, though they will likely follow the same naming scheme as the others. As for their powers, Dofflamingo and Moria’s would likely inherit the originals’ Devil Fruit abilities. And for Crocodile’s Seraphim, we can only guess.</p> <p data-characters="398" data-current-count="730" data-injectable="false">The Seraphim’s likeness to the Seven Warlords isn’t just a coincidence. They are specifically made to replace the Seven Warlords of the Sea’s place among the three great powers. While they are yet to earn the title, they’ve certainly proved their might. After all, the Seraphim played a major role in arresting the Warlords the moment the Seven Warlord system was abolished.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/9/24174713/ikea-hiring-roblox-virtual-reality-store<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Corporate publicity stunts involving virtual reality are almost always bad, but Ikea’s new <em>Roblox</em> store feels especially silly. The company announced last week that <a href="https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/newsroom/corporate-news/ikea-is-opening-a-new-store-on-roblox-pub8a9272d0">it plans to pay 10 people</a> £13.15 or €14.80 per hour to work in <em>The Co-Worker Game, </em>a virtual Ikea store in <em>Roblox. </em>The company is <a href="https://thecoworker.co.uk/">taking applications until June 16th</a>, only from candidates in the UK or Ireland who are 18 or older.</p><p>Being paid to be an NPC. What a world. The virtual employees will carry out tasks like serving meatballs or helping people find fake furniture or other Ikea items. They can also “get promoted to move departments, just like in the real world.” </p><div><figcaption><em>A look at Ikea’s </em>Co-Worker Game <em>virtual store.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Ikea</cite></p></div><p>I wouldn’t assume this is a real job, even if Ikea is paying real money for it. The website where you can apply says it’s a “limited contract.” The application asks you questions like “How do you feel about being turned into pixels?” or “If you were a pixelated IKEA furniture, which one would you be and why?” </p><p>Ikea says it requires an up-to-date CV, though it doesn’t ask for one upfront, and I couldn’t get past the form with my US-based phone number. (If one of our readers across the pond wants to give it a go and send us an update, I’d love to read about your experience.) The gig is open to applicants 18 and older who live in the UK or the Republic of Ireland, and it’s remote, so you can pull up your new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/15/24130721/ikea-brannboll-gaming-furniture-range-chair-inflatable-announcement">Ikea gaming chair</a> after you’re done playing around with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/22/23178125/ikea-kreativ-room-scanner-ios-app-virtual-furniture-showroom">Ikea’s virtual design tool</a> and serve some virtual meatballs from the comfort of your own home.</p><p>If you apply and don’t get the callback, don’t you worry. The company says people who don’t get the job can also “work, explore, and experience” the Ikea Roblox store. And it says you can win Ikea-exclusive UGCs, Roblox’s term for user-created items or other content that exists within the game. </p><p>I’ll be very up-front, here. I have never played with anything made in <em>Roblox</em>. But few things sound less appealing to me than pretending to be a retail employee in a virtual version of a real-life furniture dealer. Other companies have tried their hand at hanging their brand out in VR — there’s the <em>Walmart Discovered</em> virtual store for buying digital items with <em>Roblox</em>’s in-game Robux currency, and Gucci has made <em>Roblox</em> environments, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/27/23143404/gucci-town-roblox">including Gucci town in 2022</a>. </p><p>So that aspect of this is nothing new. And people — often kids — do make money in <em>Roblox, </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/4/24121420/roblox-child-exploitation-robux-child-labor">something critics say is exploitative</a>. But this is the first time I’m aware of that a company has offered to pay people real money to work in their <em>Roblox</em> world, and it’s weird, but also seems relatively harmless, and less obnoxious than NFTs.</p><p>The company says it’ll hold virtual interviews between June 14th and June 18th, and <em>The Co-Worker Game</em> launches on June 24th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Instead of a culinary puzzle battle, you’re hopping into anime-inspired mech suits to take on other mech suits in card-based combat.</p>

<p>Revealed during the Future Game Show, players lead a crew of mech pilots, who take the form of cards, to engage in 5v5 battles against enemies. Not only can you improve their mech suits, of which 30 types exist, but you can grow meaningful relationships with your plucky pilot squad.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/smvxkjXiZzM" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>The game includes over 50 voiced characters to bond with over 50 story missions, and players can steer the narrative by making decisions such as choosing to side with one of five factions. Gameplay is all about building the most strategically viable hand based on your personal playstyle to wipe out what Trinket Studios describes as a "star-consuming threat."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Battle Suit Aces is slated to launch for PC via Steam at an unknown date. You can read our review of Battle Chef Brigade <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/battle_chef_brigade/b/switch/archive/2017/11/20/battle-chef-brigade-review.aspx">here</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="211" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If one of Disney’s top TV executives is to be believed, the company’s hit animated series <em>Gravity Falls</em> may be on the verge of a comeback. Yes, yes, burn the child! I mean, yes, yes, revive the show!</p> <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="256" data-injectable="false">Meredith Roberts, executive vice president of television animation and Disney Branded Television, recently raised the possibility of Alex Hirsch’s seminal supernatural comedy epic returning to screens in a recent exclusive interview with <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/gravity-falls-revival-exclusive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Direct</a>. </p> <p data-characters="149" data-current-count="405" data-injectable="true">When asked about <em>Gravity Falls</em>‘ enduring popularity, Roberts revealed she had recently discussed the possibility of a<em> </em>continuation with Hirsch.</p>
 <p data-characters="213" data-current-count="213" data-injectable="false">“You know, we’re in conversations with Alex.” Roberts told The Direct. “He’s about to publish a book with Disney on his project. And we also do some shorts. So never say never.”</p> <p data-characters="446" data-current-count="659" data-injectable="true">This quote is far from an ironclad promise that <em>Gravity Falls</em> will be getting a third season, but it is proof that Disney is at least partially aware of the series’ enduring popularity. While <em>Gravity Falls</em>‘ mystery-driven story came to a satisfying and decisive end in the second season, Hirsch has continued to expand the Pine Family’s adventures in the mystery-soaked titular town through a series of books and graphic novels.</p>

<p data-characters="281" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Yesterday’s IGN Live Preshow brought with it some fresh news out of XSEED Games. The publisher announced plans to bring <em>The Big Catch</em> — a “movement-focused 3D platformer inspired by titles from the 5th and 6th generation of consoles” — to PC sometime in 2025.</p> <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">Developed by Filet Group, <em>The Big Catch </em>initially made its way into the world in the form of a 2022 <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/filetgroup/the-big-catch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kickstarter</a>. The crowdfunding campaign ended up attracting 4,440 backers to the tune of a cool CA$241,747 (about US$175,465) and it’s been in active development ever since.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="442" data-injectable="true">Now, in addition to checking out some footage below, you can catch a demo on Steam, called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2985610/The_Big_Catch_Tacklebox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Big Catch: Tacklebox</em></a>, as part of the IGN Summer of Gaming event. &nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="The Big Catch - Official Trailer | IGN Live 2024" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Qnrnq3ivuQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="503" data-current-count="803" data-injectable="true"><em>The Big Catch </em>looks the part of a classic 3D platformer — not too far separated from what <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/pennys-big-breakaway-preview-impressions-yo-yo-platformer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Penny’s Big Breakaway</em></a> was attempting — but with some really interesting and fun-looking movement to it. The acrobatic fisherman at the center of it all is Caster. His boss, Chef Leurre, has tasked him with saving The Big Catch restaurant. Thus, he’s off and running (and leaping, and wall-running, and grinding) on a hunt for ingredients that will serve up the perfect menu to attract customers.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">True to the theme, Caster’s main piece of equipment is a fishing rod. He can cast, hook, and reel in objects, opening up plenty of possibilities for interacting with the world. On the surface it sounds like Caster is just here to catch fish, but the story description teases “a dark past, a sinister plot, and ominous otherworldly entities.”&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="744" data-injectable="false">The <em>Tacklebox </em>demo is a standalone chapter that acts as a prologue to the main game. Players jump into the fishin’ gear of Caster’s rival and co-worker Tackle, taking on his final days of training with deft platforming, surfing, and fishing. As soon as I finish typing this sentence, please believe I’ll be picking up my fishing rod and getting right to work.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-raid-completion-takes-19-hours-and-unlocks-stunning-final-mission-for-guardians-everywhere<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>The first Destiny 2 clan to complete The Final Shape's raid has unlocked a final mission for all Guardians to close out the sci-fi shooter's expansive story.</p>
<p>It took the Parabellum clan 19 hours to work their way through Salvation’s Edge – and what a triumph it was – but the bigger surprise was that as the cut-scenes played out the end of Destiny's epic decade, a hitherto secret mission became available to all players, regardless of whether or not they'd gotten through the raid themselves.</p>
<figure>
<p>

<p>The mission – called Excision – accommodates 12 players in a stunning crescendo that's sure to squeeze even the steeliest Guardian heart.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>UPDATE: We've seen a dramatic decrease in BAT errors and believe that has been resolved.</p><p>As we continue investigating the loading issue, we recommend that players launch into the Narrative version of Excision with no more than 6 total fireteam members for the full experience. <a href="https://t.co/jXlw6aa3PZ">https://t.co/jXlw6aa3PZ</a></p></div>— Bungie Help (@BungieHelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/BungieHelp/status/1799542873765122210?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 8, 2024</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>News of the secret mission spread quickly, though, triggering a number of "BAT" errors related to "players in fireteams being unable to view all cutscenes upon completion of the Excision activity". Consequently, Bungie advised players to participate in the activity solo, and suggested that anyone who missed the cutscenes could rewatch them in the narrative version of Excision.</p>
<p>Now it seems the issues have "been resolved", but despite it being a 12-member mission, Bungie is still recommending that "players launch into the Narrative version of Excision with no more than 6 total fireteam members for the full experience".</p>
<p>But that's not all. Bungie also confirmed that tomorrow, 10th June at 4pm UK time (8am PT), the team will present a livestream detailing "the next year of Destiny 2".</p>
<p>While some are very excited that this presentation may provide further details about the next Destiny adventure, the key part of that message is that it pertains to Destiny <strong>2</strong>, so it's unlikely we'll learn much about Destiny 3. Who knows, though – Bungie always likes to surprise us!</p> <div>

<p>Of course, some players didn't have to wait for the formal release date<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/huge-destiny-2-the-final-shape-spoilers-leak-online-as-players-get-accidental-early-access">; the DLC leaked online after the expansion was temporarily available</a> on PS5 shortly before its official launch earlier this week.</p>

<p data-characters="291" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Among the Stars</em> stole my heart the second its trailer aired during Summer Game Fest 2024. With an art style inspired by Studio Ghibli and a story that reflects the struggles of indigenous people, this 2-D action-adventure game has earned a spot on my “games I want to play” list.</p> <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="true">Developed by Split Studio, <em>Among the Stars</em> tells the story of Ari and Tai, two sisters separated after armed land developers lay siege to their home in Brazil’s Pantanal region. With Ari lost in a jungle inhabited by nature spirits and Tai stranded deep in territory occupied by the murderous invaders, the sisters embark on a perilous journey to reunite and liberate their homeland before it’s too late.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Among The Stars - Official Teaser Trailer | Latin American Games Showcase" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eOg28sU4Od0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p><figcaption>From GameTrailers</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="446" data-current-count="746" data-injectable="true">The first thing that stands out about <em>Among the Stars</em> is its gorgeous art direction. <a href="https://splitstudio.tv/en/">Split Studios</a> is an animation company that has cut its teeth on several prominent Cartoon Network and Comedy Central shows, and they’re pouring all of their talent into this project. <em>Among the Stars</em>‘ colorful backgrounds and expressive character designs take a lot of inspiration from anime, particularly the legendary film library of Studio Ghibli.</p>
 <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true">While <em>Among the Stars</em>‘ trailer primarily features what I assume are clips taken from in-game cinematics, the gameplay featured <a href="https://www.splitstudio.games/amongthestars">on the game’s official website</a> proves that the in-game animation will be just as stunningly vibrant as those featured in the cutscenes. Those short snippets of gameplay footage also made it clear that the game will be as fun to play as it is beautiful to behold.</p>
 <h2 id="h-gameplay-as-intriguing-as-its-visuals" data-injectable="false">Gameplay as intriguing as its visuals</h2> <p data-characters="501" data-current-count="501" data-injectable="true">If what I’ve seen is true, <em>Among the Stars </em>will feature two radically different gameplay styles. When the player controls Ari, the gameplay will be very similar to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-child-of-light/">2-D RPGs like <em>Child of Light</em></a>, complete with a turn-based battle system. In contrast, Tai’s gameplay revolves around stealth, with the player’s goal being to sneak around heavily patrolled environments to sabotage the land developers’ machinery. A shared focus on puzzle-solving will tie together both gameplay styles.</p>
 <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="true"><em>Among the Stars</em>’&nbsp;visuals and gameplay have already wowed me, but the game’s story is what has me by the neck. There’s a fantastical undertone to <em>Among the Stars</em>‘ narrative, rooted in the rich, underrepresented world of native Brazilian folklore. Unfortunately, the inciting incident that tears Ari and Tai’s peaceful lives apart reflects a bleaker reality that countless Brazilians face daily.</p>
 <p data-characters="432" data-current-count="432" data-injectable="true">“Land grabbing,” a practice in which farmers, miners, and loggers violently seize land owned by indigenous people, is a long-standing tradition in Brazil, and many native Brazilian communities <a href="https://ijnet.org/en/story/how-we-uncovered-largest-land-grab-brazilian-amazon">are still being persecuted for their land today</a>. While <em>Among the Stars</em> isn’t based on an actual event (as far as I know), its story draws inspiration from one of the darkest aspects of Brazilian history and contemporary life.</p>
 <p data-characters="142" data-current-count="142" data-injectable="false"><em>Among the Stars </em>has yet to be given an official release date, but it will be available on the Switch, Playstation, Xbox, and PC through Steam.</p>

<p data-characters="293" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond-adds-throwing-knives-and-the-very-first-vehicle-customizations-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Viper Commandos Warbond</a> announcement for <em>Helldivers 2</em>, developer Arrowhead Game Studios explained that future Warbonds would be more focused on a theme. Of course, what this community heard is that a medieval knight Warbond would be amazing, and now it’s all it can talk about. </p> <p data-characters="458" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="true">I have to say, I was also pretty thrilled when the developer confirmed it would be tightening the theme of Warbonds. all the ones leading up to Viper Commandos have felt like they’ve had armor that matches the theme, but everything else was kind of thrown into them randomly from whatever new items were working. I can’t even find a fault with the idea of a medieval knight Warbond because the suggestions fans have made for items are fantastic. </p>
 <h2 id="h-helldivers-2-fans-have-already-figured-out-what-you-should-get-in-a-medieval-knight-warbond" data-injectable="false"><em>Helldivers 2</em> fans have already figured out what you should get in a medieval knight Warbond</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via PlayStation’s YouTube channel</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="587" data-injectable="true">Fans on the <em>Helldivers 2</em> subreddit have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dazls0/who_would_be_down_for_a_knight_based_warbond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been discussing</a> the potential for a medieval knight-based Warbond in great detail. It has suggestions for armor parts, weapons, and even some themed new items that could be added to the game, just like how Viper Commandos adds the Throwing Knife. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="638" data-injectable="true">User JamesMcEdwards’ suggestion, “Like the Blood Dragon armour from <em>Mass Effect</em>?” is genius. This is an exclusive set of armor for <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-review-mass-effect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mass Effect</a></em> you could get as DLC for having the right bonus pack for <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/review-dragon-age-origins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dragon: Age Origins</a></em>. Based on the image below, I think you’ll agree it fits right into the <em>Helldivers 2</em> universe. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via JamesMcEdwards on Reddit</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="559" data-injectable="true">User Doomedtundra put forward a great idea. “Arc longsword.” I imagine this to be a pretty meaty melee weapon that slows and electrocutes enemies. It would likely cut through the hordes of Automatons in the galaxy like a hot knife through butter. </p>
 <p data-characters="481" data-current-count="481" data-injectable="true">This type of Warbond would also open the door for something <em>Helldivers 2</em> fans have been asking for since day one. As user SpeedyAzi requests, “All I need is a Laser Calvary Sword and a Robot Horse. Then give me a flag banner as a stratagem.” I’ve never known this community to ask for anything more than a flag banner Stratagem, and seeing it finally enter the game, regardless of the Warbond theme, would be glorious. It also nails the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-players-say-theyd-rather-have-new-stratagems-over-new-warbonds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">need for more Stratagems</a>. </p>
 <p data-characters="511" data-current-count="511" data-injectable="true">User Iwlis666 makes a very sensible recommendation for how this Warbond could interact with items already in the game. “Great sword as primary that breaks to a sword and shield for secondary with a skin for GL as crossbow or a musket skin for railgun.” The Viper Commando Warbond will add vehicle customizations for the first time, so it makes sense that we could have weapon customizations. However, we’d also need some additional functionality for a few in-game items to make a shield work. </p>
 <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="403" data-injectable="true">The conversation descends into comparisons to <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-multiplayer-modes-warhammer-space-marine-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warhammer 40K</a></em> quite a lot, but that makes sense. After all, Game Workshop’s universe is filled with sci-fi knights who wield futuristic versions of the same melee weapons knights were using hundreds of years ago. With the addition of firearms and lasers and a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/super-earths-heartfelt-thank-you-to-helldivers-2-players-inadvertently-revealed-yet-another-harrowing-cost-of-the-galactic-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pretty grim leadership model</a>, <em>Helldivers 2</em> does bear a lot of resemblance to the Grimdark. </p>
 <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="372" data-injectable="false">I love that the <em>Helldivers 2</em> community has taken the changes Arrowhead Game Studios wants to make to Warbonds so seriously, even if it has resulted in the craziest idea for a Warbond I’ve ever seen. I think it bodes well for the community’s reaction to future Warbonds and shows players are open to pretty much anything as long as it’s well thought out. </p>

			<p>Deck13 had <a href="https://wccftech.com/atlas-fallen-was-a-financial-disappointment-but-an-enhanced-version-and-new-content-is-coming-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised </a>new content and enhancements for its action RPG Atlas Fallen, and the German studio has now shared more details. The free Reign of Sand update is slated to launch on August 6, adding new voice acting by the talented Ben Starr (who played the protagonist in Final Fantasy XVI), a new area, new enemies, 25 new Essence Stones, new progression mechanics, quality of life improvements (chiefly to the camera, but also balancing and onboarding), the much-requested New Game Plus mode and a new difficulty mode called Nyaal's Nightmare.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atlas Fallen Reign of Sand - Major Update Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RYVLkhaCWcU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Jan Klose, Deck13's Creative Director on Atlas Fallen, stated:</p>
<p><em>Our team was grateful for the opportunity to further develop Atlas Fallen and to bring a vastly updated version to the players. We listened to the feedback and made a whole series of improvements that we hope will make players enjoy the game even more.</em></p>
<p>Ahmed Boukhelifa, Deputy Chief Executive Officer - PULLUP ENTERTAINMENT STUDIOS, added:</p>
<p><em>Reign of Sand reflects our dedication to keeping Atlas Fallen a dynamic and captivating experience for all players. This free update is a testament to our commitment, offering substantial new content that both returning and new players will enjoy.</em></p>
<p>The game launched in August 2023 to underwhelming commercial performance and mixed reviews. Francesco De Meo wrote <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atlas-fallen-god-of-sand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Wccftech's review</a> (7/10):</p>
<p><em>With its unique premise and setting, Atlas Fallen could have been one of the best action games of the year, but its mediocre combat system, dull open-world areas, and lack of interesting characters drag the experience down. The full package ends up being just a decent game for those willing to look past its most critical shortcomings.</em></p>

  <p id="0ADxc1">The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/8/24/16193192/xcom-2-war-of-the-chosen-review">XCOM franchise</a> is pretty synonymous with turn-based tactics games. It’s a beloved franchise for good reason, and has spawned many, many imitators. If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, XCOM is an almost overwhelmingly flattered series.</p>
<p id="leBH0O">Here are our staff’s favorite XCOM-likes and where to play them. Some were directly inspired by XCOM; some weren’t. Some are also sci-fi humans-versus-aliens games, while others take the structure and move it to a fantasy realm or an established IP setting. All of them are fun, tactical times, and we hope you find one you’ll dig.</p>

<p id="KDbs48"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/7/22/5922989/invisible-inc-preview"><em>Invisible, Inc.</em></a> is a gloriously crisp 2015 tactical stealth game from Klei Entertainment, the Canadian indie studio behind <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/don-t-starve/7125"><em>Don’t Starve</em></a>. It’s a dashing, cartoony cyberpunk heist caper in which a team of augmented agents fly around the globe, stealing things from the high-security facilities of sinister corporations with the support of a powerful hacking AI. Procedurally generated levels and an exquisitely designed network of interconnected rules work together to create dynamic sneaking scenarios that seem to exist on a permanent knife edge of tension; unlike many games in the tactics genre, <em>Invisible, Inc. </em>is impossible to overpower or be overpowered by, and rewards playing with just the right amount of heart-in-mouth risk. In this game, using a gun is a last resort, and remembering to close a door behind you can mean the difference between success and failure. A near-perfect hidden gem of a tactics game. —<em>Oli Welsh</em></p>

Whereas games like XCOM go large with expensive production values, <em>Into the Breach</em> is refreshingly minimalist. Your team of just three mechs is tasked with fighting back kaiju-sized insects. You can see the entire battlefield, in all its pixel-art glory, from an isometric view. Every level is randomized, too — a little bit roguelike — so you never fully know what you’re getting into, but you’ll still need to lean on strategic expertise and understanding of your team. <em>Into the Breach</em> is pure tactical bliss distilled to its essence. —<em>Ari Notis</em></p>

<p id="W74n7T"><em>Xenonauts</em> reads like <em>X-COM</em> 1994 with a fresh coat of paint and will feel immediately familiar to fans of the original. While many of the systems from the strategic and tactical layers have been untouched, <em>Xenonauts</em> does introduce some small improvements and quality-of-life features, like a more robust air combat system and a more complex funding system. —<em>Alice Jovanée</em></p>

<p id="GK3X7p">Whereas many XCOM-style games focus on military operations across big battlefields, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22822622/fights-in-tight-spaces-strategy-fighting-grid-rpg-review"><em>Fights in Tight Spaces</em></a> focuses entirely on small-scale encounters. <em>Fights in Tight Spaces</em> pits the player against goons, prisoners, brawlers, and assassins in small environments. I take up the role of Agent 11, and I have to kick ass through a series of bars, mess halls, and other contained spaces. I play cards to duck, dodge, and brawl my way out of each fight, and with each victory, I earn new cards. This turn-based deck-building game excels at making these small situations stressful, and it takes a tactical mind to play your cards right and John Wick your way out of each scuffle. —<em>Cass Marshall</em></p>

<p id="F0LwEG"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23484477/marvels-midnight-suns-review-release-date-characters-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x"><em>Marvel’s Midnight Suns</em></a> could’ve easily just been XCOM with a superhero paint job (Spandexcom, if you will). But it’s so much more. Literally made by the people who made XCOM, <em>Marvel’s Midnight Suns</em> ostensibly features XCOM-style tactics gameplay. That’s merely the vehicle for a deck-building metagame that allows you to further customize your roster’s (awesome) powers. And while an absence of permadeath minimizes the combat tension you’d get in XCOM, it allows room for one of the most compelling Marvel stories in years. <em>Midnight Suns</em> underperformed at launch, but if any tactics game deserves a second lease on life, it’s this one. —<em>AN</em></p>

<p id="1LS4LJ">My personal favorite faction of the 40K universe finally got its due with <em>Warhammer 40K: Mechanicus</em>. Centered around the tech-obsessed Adeptus Mechanicus, you’ll command a cadre of Tech-Priests outfitted with forgotten and occasionally heretical technology, scouring Necron tombs for knowledge and loot. </p>
<p id="iqREfv">While some elements are borrowed from other popular turn-based strategy titles, <em>Mechanicus</em> still manages to bring some interesting wrinkles to the genre and gets high marks for its score and sound design. It also has the added benefit of being available on multiple platforms. —<em>AJ</em></p>

<p id="z2Ampw"><strong>Where to play: </strong>Nintendo 3DS</p>
<p id="qhywCZ">When searching for a good XCOM-like, why not go to the source? Original <em>X-COM</em> designer Julian Gollop produced this spinoff of the Ghost Recon tactical shooter series for Ubisoft, delivering a smartly designed isometric strategy game with the Tom Clancy brand’s modern military styling.</p>
<p id="liJYyz"><em>Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars</em>’ campaign sends players to Eastern Europe and Russia, where they must survey battlefields, carefully move and position their six-person squad, and engage in turn-based skirmishes where one wrong move can spell disaster. You know, real XCOM stuff. <em>Shadow Wars</em> is challenging and sometimes grueling — missions can take upward of 45 minutes each — but the game features a smooth learning curve and difficulty options for players who prefer not to struggle.</p>
<p id="e87BbN">Originally released in 2011 as a Nintendo 3DS launch title, your best option for securing a copy of <em>Ghost Recon: Shadow Wars</em> is secondhand (now that the 3DS eShop is closed) on places like eBay where loose cartridges go for $10 or less. —<em>Michael</em> <em>McWhertor</em></p>

<p id="V2hpWm"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/the-banner-saga/2273">The Banner Saga</a> is a trilogy of titles that plays like a mix of XCOM and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/7/31/4575810/the-oregon-trail-was-made-in-just-two-weeks"><em>Oregon Trail</em></a> with the narrative style of the Mass Effect trilogy. Set against a backdrop of Norse mythology, <em>The Banner Saga</em> has you leading a band of warriors and refugees attempting to survive Armageddon, forcing you to frequently choose between empathy or pragmatism. The trilogy is full of meaningful tactical and narrative choices that carry over from one game to the next and can have a profound impact on your characters or how story beats progress.    </p>
<p id="ezyi7J"><em>The Banner Saga</em> features beautifully hand-drawn characters, animations, and environments that highlight the remarkable level of passion that went into this title. The game also includes a score by the incomparable Austin Wintory, the composer responsible for the soundtracks to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2012/10/2/3445636/journey-review-a-capital-venture"><em>Journey</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/8/2/12290330/abzu-review-ps4-pc-playstation-4"><em>Abzu</em></a>, and other excellent works. —<em>AJ</em></p>

<p id="5Ri8QM">A superhero variant on the XCOM formula, <em>Capes </em>is a relatively new release (May 2024) and puts you in control of a team of superpower crime fighters looking to take on the nefarious Company, which is imprisoning superpowered individuals and experimenting on them. It has fun character design and mechanics that encourage repeated use of powers in combat and unique play patterns for each of the heroes.</p>
<p id="8qPKdf">Some caveats: The writing is intentionally hokey, which I feel matches the expressive art style, but might be a turnoff to some players. And the stages lack the tactical depth of many of the other games on this list, sometimes lacking multiple solutions and forcing you to retry the same stage until you figure out the right path. But I’ve still had a fun time. If, like me, you have fond memories of <em>Freedom Force </em>but wish it played like a more modern tactics game, this one’s for you. —<em>Pete Volk</em></p>

<p id="4Q5qdh"><strong>Where to play: </strong>Windows PC</p>
<p id="gxYOrv">Published in 2001, <em>Fallout Tactics</em> is the only game of its kind in the history of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/fallout">franchise</a>. It’s a combat-focused title, but with a surprisingly meaty narrative that plays out over 22 distinct missions that can be experienced in a variable order. It also features full voice-over, including a substantial role by the late R. Lee Ermey (<em>Full Metal Jacket</em>).</p>
<p id="jy0R1Y">Rendered from the classic isometric perspective, it features three different game modes, including an odd hybrid real-time setting that I’m not particularly fond of. But the most authentic way to play, called Individual Turn-Based, is the most reminiscent of the original Fallout games, <em>Fallout</em> (1997) and <em>Fallout 2</em> (1998). Basically, it takes the gritty combat of the original CRPGs and blows it out into its own version of XCOM. You can even move and fight from inside vehicles.</p>
<p id="dHfpQ7"><em>Fallout Tactics</em> polishes off a lot of the rough edges found in the combat from the first two games, while also introducing a few more of its own devising. Line of sight, in particular, can be a bit hard to suss out at times. I actually prefer its combat to later interpretations of the formula, including <em>Wasteland 2</em>. But the real reason that it’s on my personal all-time-favorites list is that it’s the only entry in the series that takes place in the Midwest, allowing you to blaze a trail from Springfield, Illinois, to Kansas City, Missouri, and beyond to the West Coast.</p>

<p id="4vmwPY"><strong>Where to play: </strong>Nintendo Switch</p>
<p id="KPNNpK">If you’re looking for a cutesier, simpler, easier XCOM-like, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/8/28/16213294/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle-review-nintendo-switch-ubisoft"><em>Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle</em></a> is a great place to start. Players use a variety of Mario and Rabbids characters as pawns on preset stages filled with enemies and obstacles.</p>
<p id="HUj8jS">Each turn, you can boost up your pawns with special powers that heal, hurt, or move your own pawn and others nearby. The pawns also move a set number of spaces in a set pattern each turn, just like chess (or XCOM) — that means it’s just as satisfying when you check an enemy off the stage, bounce off your other pawns to traverse the board in one move, or make it to the goalposts on the other side safely.</p>
<p id="nZI4lV">Mario + Rabbids games are certainly easier than your average level of XCOM, but that’s not to say they aren’t challenging at times. I’ve gotten well stuck on a few different levels, which is humbling considering these games are technically for kids — which brings me to maybe the best part of these games, which is how adorable and fun the cinematics are.</p>
<p id="UEQWJH">Watching a Rabbid version of Luigi fly across the board and cartoonishly bonk your enemy on the head is massively engaging, and the sounds are just as enjoyable. It’s practically designed for parents to play with their kids (I say, childless). The stages are reminiscent of 3D Super Mario levels, piquing my nostalgia, but with plenty of new elements that make it exciting to see each stage unveiled.</p>

            <p>Balatro is getting a physical edition.</p>
<p>The creator of the viral Poker game, localthunk, confirmed via a note posted to the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, that fans will soon be able to pick up a physical copy of the game on PS5, Switch, Xbox Series X/S, and last-gen consoles.</p>

<p>As an extra sweetener, each "special edition" will come with a pack of 10 bonus Joker/booster cards.</p>
<p>Localthunk – who recently spoke out about the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-creator-speaks-out-on-gambling-rating-drama">game's rating drama</a>, stating "it is what it is" – added, "That PEGI 18 rating is mocking me [though]".</p> <div>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1bdtmlg/ama_i_am_localthunk_developer_and_artist_for/">AMA session on </a>Reddit earlier this year, localthunk was asked for comment on how PEGI mishandled the game's rating after it was pulled from sale in some countries due to a "mistaken belief that the game 'contains prominent gambling imagery and materials that instructs about gambling'", as per publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rogue-like-poker-hit-balatro-pulled-from-sale-in-some-countries-due-to-unexpected-ratings-change">Playstack's statement at the time</a>.</p>
<p>"I still believe that the rating is unwarranted, but there is some grey area for interpretation from PEGI and at this point it is what it is," said localthunk. "I think the one thing I am most disappointed by is the fact that other games with actual gambling mechanics aren't rated the same way because of their appearance/theme."</p>
<p>"Over the last few weeks, it has taken over the gaming world completely, and I can see why," we wrote in Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-review">Balatro review</a>. "A poker roguelike is such a brilliant idea you almost don't need to make it to see how clever it is. There are a few of these, and Balatro is comfortably the best I've played. It really is ingenious - and it's also ingeniously simple."</p>

Let’s do it.</p><p>(As always, the best part of <em>Installer</em> is your ideas and tips. What are you into right now? What should everyone else be as into as you are?

I don’t even know what I’ll use this for! But I’m getting one anyway.</li><li><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/974635-hit-man"><em><strong>Hit Man</strong></em></a><em><strong>. </strong></em>A bunch of very smart people have said this comedy-action-thriller Netflix flick is one of the best movies of the year. And why not? Richard Linklater directs, Glen Powell stars, it’s based on <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/true-crime/hit-man-2/">an all-timer of a magazine article</a>. I cannot wait to watch.</li><li><a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/joseph-cox/dark-wire/9781541702691/"><em><strong>Dark Wire</strong></em></a><em><strong>. </strong></em>This is as good a premise for a book as I’ve ever seen: the story of the FBI’s secret tech startup, designed to track some of the world’s most sophisticated criminals. A <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/inside-biggest-fbi-sting-operation-in-history/">few places</a> have <a href="https://www.404media.co/dark-wire-inside-a-kidnapping-planned-on-the-fbis-secret-chat-app/">published excerpts</a>, and I already can’t put this book down.</li><li><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/744393/building-simcity-by-chaim-gingold-foreword-by-janet-h-murray/"><em><strong>Building SimCity</strong></em></a><em><strong>. </strong></em>Two books this week! You love to see it. This is a story all about SimCity, yes, but also about the history of computer simulation, with lots of photos and diagrams to go with it. One for the coffee table for sure.</li><li><a href="https://rivian.com/r1s"><strong>The new Rivian R1</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Same look, same funky headlight design, totally new car underneath. A lot of what Rivian’s doing here is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172761/rivian-r1t-r1s-refresh-update-motor-battery-price">clearly just to keep costs down</a>, but this continues to be the EV I lust after the most.</li><li><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/114479-the-acolyte"><em><strong>The Acolyte</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong> </em>This is a very different kind of Star Wars story, set in a very different time and place, told from a very different point of view, all of which I definitely think is a good thing. The reviews seem pretty mixed so far, but I’m excited to give it a whirl.</li><li><a href="https://www.getsequel.app/"><strong>Sequel 2.3</strong></a><strong>.</strong><em> </em>A very cool update to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23915813/sequel-sofa-media-tracking-apps-roblox-razr-big-vape-installer-newsletter">the Installerverse’s favorite media tracking app</a> for Apple devices. The new feature is called Magic Lookup, and it lets you send a URL to the app and have it automatically parsed and dumped into your lists. Perfect for saving those “20 things coming to Netflix this month” things you see all over the place.</li><li><a href="https://modretro.com/"><strong>The ModRetro Chromatic</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The retro gaming hardware boom we’re in right now is just the best thing. And this, a $199 Game Boy homage from a team led by Palmer Luckey, looks <em>great. </em>It’s not shipping until the end of the year, but it’s up for preorders now.</li><li><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D1025X1701640%26xs%3D1%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Frog.asus.com%252Fus%252Fgaming-handhelds%252Frog-ally%252Frog-ally-x-2024%252F"><strong>The Asus ROG Ally X</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Speaking of portable consoles! This one’s a lot bigger, a lot more expensive, and a lot more ambitious than the Chromatic —&nbsp;but it also sounds pretty great. Maybe this is the first Windows handheld that can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/2/24169709/asus-rog-ally-x-price-release-date-inside-gaming-handheld">really stand up to the Steam Deck</a>?</li><li><a href="https://www.macstories.net/comfort-zone/"><em><strong>Comfort Zone</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong> </em>Fun new podcast from the MacStories crew, with a gimmick I really like: every week, the three hosts have to basically do “Tech Show and Tell” and then issue a tech-related challenge to complete before the next episode. (MacStories also has another new podcast, called <a href="https://www.macstories.net/npc/"><em><strong>NPC</strong></em></a>, all about portable gaming.</li><li><a href="https://crooked.com/podcast/how-wall-e-reveals-our-changing-feelings-toward-tech/"><strong>“How ‘Wall-E’ Reveals Our Changing Feelings Toward Tech.”</strong></a><strong> </strong>I am outrageously jealous of this whole series of episodes from the <em>Offline </em>podcast, looking at how movies like <em>Her </em>and <em>The Social Network </em>influenced the way we think about and build tech. This is the final episode in the miniseries, and they’re all worth a listen.</li></ul></div><p><h3>Screen share</h3></p><p>Well, friends, it took 41 issues, but it happened: I had someone lined up for Screen Share this week, and it just didn’t come together in time. So let’s do something slightly different. I’ve recently become obsessed with the <a href="https://niagaralauncher.app/"><strong>Niagara Launcher</strong></a> for Android, which is, in theory, largely optimized for one-handed phone use but is also just a better, quieter way of organizing your homescreen. In the last 10 days, I’ve probably redone my setup eight times. It’s a lot.</p><p>Niagara is just so clever! It turns your apps into a customizable list, pops up widgets and notifications right in place, and lets you do a shocking amount of stuff without ever opening an app. This is totally how phones should work. (If you want to understand how it operates, here’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DW9U-T_LbIak"><strong>a good thorough video</strong></a> to watch.)</p><p>Niagara just got a big update, too, particularly if you pay the $10 a year or $30 lifetime Pro subscription. Its search is better now, it got some cool new icons, and there are a few other little improvements, too.</p><p>As I’ve been tinkering with my own homescreen, I’ve been collecting some Niagara setups I like, and I figured I’d share a few. You can do so many things with this launcher!</p><p>Cool, right? There are rumors and reports that we’re going to get a bunch of new customization possibilities for iOS, too, so here’s hoping this is a year filled with chaotic homescreen reorgs. If you use Niagara, by the way, or any other awesome Android launcher, I’d love to see your sick homescreen setups. Send them my way. And we’ll be back to regular Screen Share next week!</p><p><h3>Crowdsourced</h3></p><p><em>Here’s what the </em>Installer<em> community is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now as well! Email </em><a href="mailto:installer@theverge.com"><em>installer@theverge.com</em></a><em> or message me on Signal —&nbsp;@davidpierce.11 — with your recommendations for anything and everything, and we’ll feature some of our favorites here every week.&nbsp;</em></p><p>“New version of <a href="https://www.apposite.ai/"><strong>Vibescape</strong></a> just came out for Apple Vision Pro — new Oregon coast-inspired meditation environment! Completely new experience with this and the Forest Ledge environment — pushing the boundaries of what’s possible outside of Apple’s own environments.” – Gregory</p><p>“I’ve been using <a href="https://www.beeper.com/"><strong>Beeper</strong></a> a ton on my Pixel 8 Pro and MacBook Pro. I actually installed it in early April when the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24124179/beeper-app-automattic-acquisition-matrix-messaging">acquisition announcement came out</a> but have really hit my stride with it a month ago. It’s just so helpful to have all of your messaging in one app, both for work and personal.” – Josh</p><div><p>“<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2F%40patrickhwillems"><strong>Patrick Willems</strong></a> has a new video this week about <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DSW9b9VpVW0A"><strong>what’s next after superhero movies</strong></a> so I’ve been diving back into his channel after a while.” –&nbsp;Mike</p></div><p>“A friend introduced me to <a href="https://www.guildwars2.com/en/"><em><strong>Guild Wars 2</strong></em></a> a few months back. As someone who likes the concept of an MMO but always felt let down by the execution, I can confidently say this is one of the most underrated games ever made. A fun, free-to-play MMORPG with a healthy community and no microtransactions sounded too good to be true, but it’s not. Plus, with the recent announcements around the next expansion, there are more reasons to play than ever.” – Dallin</p><p>“I heard about Microsoft’s Recall, which felt exhausting and tedious to me. So, last weekend, I paved over Windows and installed the <a href="https://bazzite.gg/"><strong>Bazzite</strong></a> Linux distro on my gaming PC and have been playing all my Steam and Epic games that way. It’s surprisingly so much better than the last time I tried Linux on the desktop. I’m sure mileage varies, but everything worked with about the same amount of tweaking Windows required.” –&nbsp;Les</p><p>“The <em>LOTR</em> movies are finally<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.fathomevents.com/series/the-lord-of-the-rings-trilogy/"><strong>coming back to theaters</strong></a>. The extended editions — the only versions I’ll watch. So excited to go watch these with my pals, like high school all over again.” –&nbsp;Colin</p><p>“Watching <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/253268-who-killed-wcw"><em><strong>Who Killed WCW?</strong></em></a> from <em>Vice</em>. It’s a three-part miniseries interviewing Eric Bischoff and a bunch of wrestlers like Kevin Nash, Konnan, and Booker T about the inevitable downfall of WCW. Everyone has their own thoughts about who to point the finger at, from Turner executives hating wrestling to Bischoff not knowing what he’s doing to the wrestlers only looking out for themselves. Only one episode out so far, but it’s good.” – Brian</p><p>“The new shows <a href="https://www.dropout.tv/thousandaires"><em><strong>Thousandaires</strong></em></a><em> </em>from Dropout and <a href="https://watch.2ndtry.tv/trolley-problems"><em><strong>Trolley Problems</strong></em></a><em> </em>from 2nd Try premiered this week and are both hilarious and great examples of modern media companies and the trend of creating their own streaming platforms.” –&nbsp;Zach</p><p>“On the anime watch. I highly recommend <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/207784?language=en-US"><em><strong>Delicious in Dungeon</strong></em></a>. Very fun to watch, the characters’ comedic timing is excellent. This anime is hilarious while keeping the stakes of the story high.” – John</p><p><h3>Signing off</h3></p><p>I’ve been thinking a lot this week about <a href="https://boz.com/articles/inbox-ten"><strong>a blog post</strong></a> Andrew Bosworth, Meta’s CTO, wrote recently. He talks about his system of “Inbox Ten,” which basically means not trying to end every day with <em>nothing </em>on your plate but instead just trying to find a more manageable flow of information in your life. Boz has a whole system for managing his inbox in particular, which I really like — I used to be an Inbox Zero zealot and get stressed out when there’s stuff in there, but I like his slightly less drastic approach. And this sentence has popped into my brain all week, every time I get an email: “Don’t let it linger in your inbox or get yourself talked into work you don’t think is a good use of your time.” Words to live by.</p><p>See you next week!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Yesterday, during Summer Game Fest 2024's IGN Live, Piranha Games unveiled the release date for MechWarrior 5: Clans. The narrative-driven game with co-op support will be released on October 3 for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2000890/MechWarrior_5_Clans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam </a>and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/mechwarrior-5-clans-e50e3a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X with cross-play support.</p>
<p>Players will experience the Clan Invasion from the perspective of Clan Smoke Jaguar as they lead their five-mech 'Star' squad through engaging missions and combat, with cinematics unlike anything seen before in the franchise. The developers have also promised a story that will bring players across several planets and diverse biomes.</p>
<p>In a previous <a href="https://wccftech.com/mechwarrior-5-clans-takes-full-advantage-of-unreal-engine-5-finally-ships-with-great-controller-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GDC 2024 interview with Wccftech</a>, Piranha Games CEO Russ Bullock confirmed that the game uses Unreal Engine 5 to the fullest extent: Lumen, Nanite, MetaHuman, Chaos destructibility, and World Partition. MechWarrior 5: Clans will also ship with controller support on PC as well, though that was kind of a given considering the launch on consoles.</p>

			<p>During Summer Game Fest 2024's IGN Live, Offworld Industries unveiled the 1.0 release date for Starship Troopers: Extermination. The 16-player cooperative first-person shooter game will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on October 11, nearly a year and a half after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starship-troopers-extermination-early-access-launch-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 2023 early access debut</a>.</p>
<p>One of the additions to the full version is a single player mode featuring 25 distinct missions and a variety of PvE combat scenarios across multiple environments, with a second chapter to follow post-launch. The story premise is that players are selected to join an elite spec ops group within the Mobile Infantry. They will soon find themselves following the orders of living legend General John “Johnny” Rico, proving their mettle against hordes of enemy Arachnids with the aid of three original NPC allies to prove themselves worthy of recruitment. And yes, Johnny Rico will be played by Casper Van Dien, the actor featured in the cult 1997 Starship Troopers movie.</p>
<p><iframe title="Starship Troopers: Extermination - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E8FRZR728u8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Offworld Industries also confirmed that a long-requested new feature will be added to Starship Troopers: Extermination 1.0: the persistence on the battlefield of bug corpses. This will lend increased realism to the game experience, not to mention the possible introduction of tactical elements as players climb mountains of corpses to shoot the remaining bugs from a vantage point.</p>
<p>Those interested in the game should keep in mind that the current pricing of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1268750/Starship_Troopers_Extermination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early access version</a> ($29.99) will increase with the launch of version 1.0. As such, it may be wise to purchase the game now before the expected price increase. The developers also promised to share more information about the next early access update, slated to go live at the end of June, very soon.</p>

			<p>During Summer Game Fest 2024's Future Game Show, Red Thread Games and Quantic Dream presented a new Dustborn trailer that celebrates the opening of pre-orders. As a reminder, the game is slated to launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/dustborn-red-threads-action-adventure-game-launches-on-august-20-for-29-99/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on August 20</a> for $29.99 on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series S/X, and Xbox One. Moreover, a physical edition will be released for consoles. Priced at $39.99, it includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 postcards from iconic locations visited by the crew;</li>
<li>A map of the American Republic, listing all the pitstops the crew has to make before arriving at their final destination;</li>
<li>A 32-page prequel comic book about the crew’s life before accepting this risky mission;</li>
<li>Stickers of iconic elements from the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone who pre-orders is getting a Sherbert twirl hat, a Psycho Pete bat, and an exclusive Eye C U Jacket. Ragnar Tørnquist, Creative Director at Red Thread Games, stated:</p>
<p><em>We are excited to offer a deeper look at how the power of words shapes Dustborn’s gameplay. As we launch pre-orders, we wanted to give players more insight into the crew’s undercover punk-rock road trip and the adversaries they face along the way. We cannot wait to see players discover the game’s comic book-inspired experience, build relationships with the crew, and use their abilities to defeat Justice and the Puritans!</em></p>

<p>Dustborn will also get a 30-minute free demo next week as part of Steam Next Fest, during which players will be able to go hands-on with Pax, the main character. As an Anormal, she can control words to create new powers, defend herself, get out of sticky situations, neutralize threats, and build relationships with her crew or new encounters. Of course, relationships can be tricky to navigate, as each character brings their own powers, perspectives, motives, and insecurities.</p>

Looking back at January's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-developer-direct-2024-all-of-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5041/">Developer Direct</a>, quite a few Xbox games were shown off then, and it's likely that we'll see more of everyone's favorite archeologist in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Obsidian's new fantasy game Avowed, and the grand strategy of Ara History Untold.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024/" data-ref-id="5000-590943">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dungeons-of-hinterberg/" data-ref-id="5000-590949">Dungeons of Hinterberg</a>, and a look at what's next for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sea-of-thieves/" data-ref-id="5000-438508">Sea of Thieves</a> could also be on the cards, and we've also seen a few Game Pass updates in the past in previous Xbox showcase events. On the third-party side, Xbox has a lot it could show off here. March's Xbox Partner Preview featured games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/unknown-9-awakening/" data-ref-id="5000-517822">Unknown 9: Awakening</a>, Capcom's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess/" data-ref-id="5000-590945">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online/" data-ref-id="5000-43589">Final Fantasy 14 Online</a> amongst several other interesting titles, so there's a chance that we'll see more of those games during the livestream.</p><p>Following the Xbox Games Showcase, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-announced-described-as-dark-new-chapter/1100-6523660/" data-ref-id="1100-6523660">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> Direct will be up next.

Will it contain guns, military jargon, and a few explosions? An educated guess points toward a definite "maybe" for the 2024 Call of Duty game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bodycam-realistic-shooter/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>I’ve spent a few hours playing Bodycam, the Unreal Engine-powered first-person shooter from two brothers that’s turning heads on social and streaming platforms worldwide. It was released on Steam on June 7, with many users and prospective fans confusing the project with Unrecord, a similar-looking game that surfaced last year with a harrowing reveal trailer. </p>



<p>Both games look similar but while Unrecord reportedly focuses on a single-player narrative, Bodycam is a multiplayer-focused shooter. After getting hands-on with Bodycam for a while, I can confirm that it’s so realistic it’s scary, and it’s how I want all my first-person shooters to behave going forward.</p>



<hr>

<p>Bodycam isn’t for the faint of heart. It’s marketed as being a tough-as-nails shooter that walks a fragile line between ‘virtual’ and ‘reality’. In Bodycam, players assume control of a footsoldier in either a military force or a terrorist group, using a series of authentic weapons to take down opponents and complete a range of basic objectives.</p>



<p>Everything from the maps to the game’s audio mechanics have been superbly crafted in Unreal Engine 5, and the visual layer of the game is nothing short of sublime. On a high-end PC, Bodycam looks jaw-droppingly good, offering unparalleled graphics and physics that make something as simple as shooting an opponent a terrifying realistic premise.</p>



<figure><figcaption>This is a game, not a shot from LiveLeaks</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Honest disclaimer: don’t play Bodycam if you’re easily disturbed or made uncomfortable by real-world violence.</strong></p>



<p>Allow me to explain. In one sequence, I crept through a gorgeous wooded area on my way to defuse a bomb that had been planted by a terrorist force. In the next moment, I was engaged, and bullets were whipping through the scenery, deafening me. I whirled on an opponent and blasted him with a shotgun, and he was sent collapsing to the floor, his legs bucking wildly as he contorted with the pain of the buckshot slamming into him.</p>



<p>Then, I was hit, and as my camera disconnected I too fell to the ground in the middle of a thick forest, blood gurgling in my throat as my operator choked on his final breaths. It’s <strong>intense</strong>.</p>



<figure><figcaption>You never know where the next shot will come from</figcaption></figure>



<p>Players have a few gripes with Bodycam, namely with the game’s matchmaking mechanics and server instabilities, but for the few hours that I played, I suffered from two issues:</p>



<ul>
<li>In one match, I was doing pretty well and then was suddenly disconnected</li>



<li>In another match, the player I was spectating after I’d been killed was bugging out, jerking around the map</li>
</ul>



<p>Aside from that, I have no issues with any aspect of Bodycam. It’s a solid shooter with huge amounts of potential, and although it could be seen as little more than a tech demo, it has left Unrecord sitting in the dust as far as I’m concerned. Some users might brand it a clone or an act of plagiarism, but I maintain that we saw one trailer for Unrecord several months ago and nothing else, while Bodycam is here, in the wild, and making a stellar impression.</p>



<p>Bodycam is available (for now) exclusively on PC.</p>

			<p>State of Decay 3 will receive a brand-new trailer during the highly-anticipated Xbox Showcase later today, it's been revealed.</p>
<p>Developer Undead Labs revealed as much as part of a press release that was briefly available on the studio's website. As <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1799547951758340402" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by Gematsu on X (and several others), the Microsoft-owned studio responsible for the State of Decay series is rebranding, and in a now-deleted press release, the studio confirmed that fans will get a new trailer for State of Decay 3. Seemingly, a .zip file containing a press release was<a href="https://www.undeadlabs.com/jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> briefly available on the studio's job page</a>. This link no longer exists, however, and we haven't been able to find a cached sample of the page either. Luckily, Gematsu included a screenshot of the press release as well as the new logo that Undead Labs will use as part of the studio's rebranding. You can find the new logo at the top of this article. A screenshot of the press release is included below.</p>
<p>"Undead Labs revealed its new brand during the highly anticipated Xbox Showcase presentation on June 9th, in the newest State of Decay 3 trailer", the press release reads.</p>
<p>"This rebrand evolves the Undead Labs brand and elevates the the role of the game studio brand within the category by building a brand-world that feels substantial and immersive in the way previously reserved for games", Nate Manny from brand development experts 51 Eggs writes in the press release.</p>

<p>As reported yesterday, the Xbox Showcase is <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-showcase-8-world-premieres-gears-6-new-doom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said to offer 8 world premieres (aside from previously announced games)</a>, including the new Gears title as well as the rumored new DOOM: The Dark Ages.</p>
<p>Formally <a href="https://wccftech.com/state-of-decay-3-announced-to-be-early-in-pre-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced back in 2020</a>, State of Decay 3 is being made in <a href="https://wccftech.com/state-of-decay-3-is-being-made-with-unreal-engine-5-and-help-from-gears-of-war-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unreal Engine 5 with the help of devs from Gears studio The Coalition</a>. As covered some weeks ago, the title is said to be coming along very well - at least, that's <a href="https://wccftech.com/state-of-decay-3-is-reportedly-coming-along-very-very-well/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what Windows Central's Jez Corden claimed</a>.</p>
<p>We'll update you as soon as we learn more about State of Decay 3. For now, stay tuned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/eternal-strands-might-just-be-the-next-breath-of-the-wild-no-really/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s easy to get caught up in the hype of games. Hell, getting people excited about what’s coming out is at least part of what we do here on a daily basis. However, you can’t bandy around the phrase ‘next Breath of the Wild’ without a bit of evidence to back it up, and thanks to the latest Eternal Strands trailer from the Future Games Show, we’ve got some pretty compelling evidence.</p>
<p><iframe title="Eternal Strands Gameplay Trailer - Future Games Show Summer Showcase 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ql_EdNY7eX0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This new gameplay trailer follows on from the original announcement, and it showcases exactly the kind of action you can expect to indulge in when Eternal Strands releases in the near-ish future. First on the ‘Breath of the Wild comparison chart is the expansive open world and the vibrant visuals, with Yellow Brick Games forging a beautiful graphical style that’s undoubtedly going to entice players into their world. Exploration is clearly going to play a major part in the experience, and there’s plenty of footage of our heroine running and clambering around a variety of distinct and exciting areas.</p>
<p>Besides that, there’s a bunch of combat, and here you’re tackling an array of gigantic beasts in a way that’s perhaps more reminiscent of Shadow of the Colussus rather than Link’s escapades. You can climb up their limbs, ready to hack parts of them off, or perhaps you’ll be taken for a ride by a gigantic dragon who’s expecting some kind of flame-grilled adventurer for lunch. The designs of these huge bosses looks especially impressive, offering both terror and temptation in equal measure.</p>


<p>There’s also the options of crafting new items of armour and weaponry to improve your chances – we’ll wait to see if there’s a cooking point to throw things into – or to lean on magic to take down these massive creatures. Whatever you choose, Yellow Brick Games looks more than ready to provide it.</p>
<p>While we don’t yet have a release date for Eternal Strands, we do know that it will be releasing on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series consoles and PC, and that you can add it to your relevant <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491410/Eternal_Strands/">wishlist</a> right now. No matter where you play, Eternal Strands could well be essential when it finally arrives.</p>

  <p id="pC3IeD"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/pokemon-go/38713"><em>Pokémon Go</em></a> is having a Goomy Community Day event on<strong> Sunday, June 9, from 2-5 p.m. in your local time</strong>.</p>
<p id="dnBcPc">As expected with a Community Day event,<strong> Goomy </strong>will spawn in huge numbers with a high chance for it to appear shiny. There are also several other bonuses and perks, which we’ve list out below.</p>

<h2 id="JHxyzU"><strong>How do I catch a shiny Goomy in Pokémon Go?</strong></h2>
<p id="ZGv7YR">As per old research by the now-defunct website The Silph Road (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230423103325/https://thesilphroad.com/shiny-pokemon">Wayback Machine</a>), Shiny rates on Community Days are about 1 in 24, which means that if you keep playing throughout the three-hour window, you should find quite a few shiny Pokémon.</p>

<p id="JqBuiK">If you’re short on time or Poké Balls, you can pop an <strong>Incense</strong>, then quickly <strong>tap each Goomy </strong>to check for shiny ones, running from any that aren’t shiny. Notably, any Goomy you’ve already tapped will face where your player is standing, so that should help identify which ones you may have already checked.</p>
<hr id="fCZXnK">
<h2 id="Rck3HW"><strong>What Community Day move does Goomy’s evolution learn?</strong></h2>
<p id="P33K1t">If you evolve Sliggoo into Goodra from 2 p.m. until 10 p.m. in your local time, it will learn the charged move <strong>Thunder Punch</strong>.</p>
<p id="pcrxXf">If you miss out on evolving it during this period, you will likely be able to evolve it during a Community Day weekend event in December to get Thunder Punch. If you don’t want to wait, you can use an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/22557832/tm-elite-fast-charged-best-use-how-to-get-technical-machines">Elite TM</a> to get the move.</p>
<hr id="sJ5mE8">
<h2 id="PRBqBQ"><strong>How does Goodra do in the meta?</strong></h2>
<p id="UnfEw0">For raiding and gyms, Goodra isn’t nearly as good as its fellow pseudo-legendary dragons. You can set it up with Dragon Breath and Draco Meteor, but you should use just about anything else over it (Salamence, Dragonite, or Garchomp, just to name a few).</p>
<p id="nsarC1">Goodra is actually used more in PvP, so you can set it up with Dragon Breath alongside Power Whip and Aqua Tail to give it some good move coverage.</p>
<hr id="wsHYws">
<h2 id="rVGJO4"><strong>How do I make the most of Goomy Community Day?</strong></h2>
<p id="VP2Yku">The following bonuses will be active during Goomy Community Day:</p>
<ul>
<li id="RnqjWH">Tripled Stardust for catching Pokémon</li>
<li id="ygtKvn">Doubled candy for catching Pokémon</li>
<li id="IlHTnG">Doubled chance for level 31+ trainers to get XL candy from catching Pokémon</li>
<li id="PF2Fbg">Incense lasts three hours</li>
<li id="R4eQq7">Lure Modules lasts three hours</li>
<li id="Kt1oY9">Goomy special photobombs when taking snapshots</li>
<li id="3l86uP">One additional special trade</li>
<li id="QaoYEy">Stardust cost halved for trading</li>
</ul>
<p id="kOd6mO">That said, you should definitely pop a Star Piece and an Incense and try to nab some powerful Goomy.</p>
<p id="miKL06">Notably, there will also be a <strong>Timed Research set that rewards you with a Rainy Lure Module</strong> — which you’ll need to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go/22423676/evolve-goomy-sliggoo-pokemon-go-goodra-evolution-requirements">evolve your Sliggoo into Goodra</a> (if it’s not raining for you). That said, if you head to a more populated <em>Pokémon Go</em> spot (like a shopping mall or park), some players may already use Rainy Lure Modules, so you can use theirs rather than using your own.</p>
<p id="tLRqH5">If you can <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/22447919/mega-evolution-list-candy-bonus-buddy-raids"><strong>Mega Evolve</strong></a><strong> Charizard X, Ampharos, Sceptile, Altaria, Salamence, Latias, Latios, Rayquaza, or Garchomp</strong>, you’ll score additional Goomy Candy per catch.</p>
<p id="mfZjRH">In addition to all this, Niantic is still running special four-star raids from 5-10 p.m., where if you clear the Sliggoo raid, Goomy will spawn in a 300-meter radius around the gym for 30 minutes. These raids cannot be done remotely. If the usual 2-5 p.m. spawn increase doesn’t get you the Goomy you wanted, you can try raiding for another chance.</p>

        <p><strong>About the Developer</strong></p><p>Creating <em>Bogdan’s Cross</em> has been a deeply personal and transformative journey for me. Coming from the animation industry, where I honed my skills in storytelling and visual artistry, I decided to embark on the ambitious path of solo game development. This game represents my first foray into the world of video games, driven by a passion to blend historical authenticity with compelling fiction.</p><p>A key part of my development process involved using Quill, a VR art tool, to bring Bogdan’s universe to life. This innovative workflow allowed me to craft detailed environments and characters in a highly immersive and intuitive way, ensuring a unique and visually stunning experience for players. Every element of <em>Bogdan’s Cross</em>, from the detailed environments to the intricate character arcs, reflects my dedication to creating an immersive and engaging experience. I hope that players will find the same sense of wonder and excitement in playing the game as I did in making it.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Bogdan's Cross Reveal Trailer - Future Games Show Summer Showcase 2024" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OKRdEJVSZwU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The link, per gematsu, leads to a press release which reads, in part, "Undead Labs revealed its new brand during the highly anticipated Xbox Showcase presentation on June 9th in the newest State of Decay 3 trailer." Its new logo also appeared to leak.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>A new State of Decay 3 trailer will appear at Xbox Game Showcase 2024 tomorrow.</p><p>The "Press Kit" link on the Undead Labs website leads to a ZIP with the press release confirming it: <a href="https://t.co/xHygAWNTuc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/xHygAWNTuc</a> (scroll down to find the link)</p><p>Studio is also rebranding with new logo. <a href="https://t.co/clQWgtsJtv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/clQWgtsJtv</a></p></div>— Gematsu (@gematsu) <a href="https://twitter.com/gematsu/status/1799547951758340402?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <p><a href="https://undeadlabs.com/jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Undead Labs jobs page</a>, however, was swiftly taken down once the leak was spotted.
