            <p>The makers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> over at Behaviour Interactive are no strangers to the cold, calculating mindset of killers, having created <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evils-nemesis-is-coming-to-dead-by-daylight">plenty</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-big-bad-albert-wesker-is-coming-to-dead-by-daylight-soon">of</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/aliens-iconic-xenomorph-is-stalking-into-dead-by-daylight">them</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-by-daylight-is-adding-dd-killer-vecna-voiced-by-critical-role-dm-matthew-mercer-with-castlevania-also-on-the-way">now</a> for their multiplayer hunt-and-seek <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror game</a>. That coldness seems to have seeped into the company itself too, as they racked up their career-killing bodycount with nearly 100 more layoffs this week.</p>

<p>Behaviour’s <a href="https://media.bhvr.com/behaviour-interactive-implements-strategic-changes-for-future-growth">announcement</a> - the opening of which ominously dubs the studio as “The Company” in true killer-like fashion - confirmed that they will look to cut up to 95 staff. Of those almost 100 devs, the majority will be laid off from the developers’ Montreal studio.</p>
<p>In true corpospeak, the announcement euphemistically dubbed the firing of dozens of people as “strategic changes for future growth”, citing a “challenging period for the games industry” amid “unprecedented competition” as part of thinking behind the move. The studio also noted that their headcount has more than doubled from just shy of 600 employees to 1,300 staff in the last five years, in what seems to be a sadly continuing trend of games companies having richly gorged themselves during the at-home pandemic boom - Behaviour calls it “remarkable growth” - only to forcibly vomit up their blameless workers as things then contract due to the lightening of lockdowns and the subsequent cost-of-living crisis.</p>
<p>Behaviour say that the “multiple strategic changes to its corporate structure” - i.e. putting dozens upon dozens of people out of a job - will help “ improv[e] the distinction between its product, production, business development, and marketing resources” as the studio double down on their “historical strengths” of horror and development services, along with a possible expansion into whatever “location-based entertainment” means.</p>

<p>For all their hard work on the likes of Dead by Daylight, Behaviour waved off the laid-off devs with the caring, heartfelt acknowledgement that “each of these individuals offered valuable contributions to Behaviour” - which I’m sure they’ll be grateful for as they try to pay their rent and put food on the table - while adding that Dead by Daylight’s development won’t be affected by the changes. (Upcoming single-player spin-off The Casting of Frank Stone is being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/supermassive-reveal-the-casting-of-frank-stone-a-single-player-dead-by-daylight-game">worked on over at Supermassive</a>, so that won’t be affected either.)</p>
<p>“I would like to express my deep personal appreciation for any employee affected by today’s changes,” said CEO Rémi Racine. “While changes to our structure and strategic vision have led to challenging decisions, we are confident that these decisions will position us for continued success. As we begin the next phase of Behaviour’s growth, our commitment to excellence in our products and workplace culture remains steadfast.”</p>
<p>The latest layoffs at Behaviour come fewer than six months after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-layoffs-as-behaviour-interactive-and-ci-games-adjust-scope-and-make-optimisations">close to 50 staff were cut at the start of the year</a>, meaning around 10% of the studio have been dropped in 2024 so far. Behaviour are far from the only studio to be part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">the unrelenting barrage of job losses across the games industry over the last year or so</a>, with thousands of staff losing their jobs at developers, publishers and more. Hard to match that level of fear and wanton destruction with someone in a pig mask, honestly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24171899/xbox-showcase-2024-preview-analysis<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="9aZs9Z">In theory, Microsoft approaches this week’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24167070/summer-game-fest-2024-schedule-sgf-e3">Summer Game Fest</a> and the annual Xbox showcase on June 9 from a position of fantastic strength: Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/30/24055445/microsoft-q2-2024-earnings-revenue-profits-windows-xbox-gaming-surface">supercharged the revenues</a> of its gaming division and turned it into a super-publisher the likes of which the game industry has never seen. It now owns an astonishing war chest of hall-of-fame gaming properties that includes Call of Duty, Minecraft, Warcraft, Halo, Fallout, Diablo, The Elder Scrolls, Doom, Gears of War, Forza, and much, much more.</p>
<p id="gNeJ7F">Microsoft gaming chief Phil Spencer and his team are also well poised to make a strong impression in what is shaping up to be a fallow year for the rest of the industry. Sony, having already confessed that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24072730/no-new-ps5-games-exclusives-2024-release">PlayStation won’t see any major exclusive releases</a> this year, went early with a short, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2024/1/31/24057143/playstation-sony-state-of-play-ps5-showcase-announcements-trailers">low-key showcase</a> last week. Nintendo has delayed its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo/23899504/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-power-name-games">successor console to the Switch</a> into 2025; at <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24151013/nintendo-switch-2-direct-announcement-teaser">its own showcase later in June</a> it will be forced to lean on whatever games it’s been able to scrape together for the Switch’s last holiday season. And Summer Game Fest MC Geoff Keighley has <a href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-2024-geoff-keighley-sets-expectations-1851516386">moved to temper expectations</a> for his roundup showcase on June 7.</p>
<p id="Mxdcgt">Microsoft has faced similar lulls in its release schedule in the recent past, but on this count it is now simply too big to fail. On the Activision Blizzard side, Microsoft will trumpet its ownership of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24145559/xbox-games-showcase-june-2024-call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty with a special showcase</a> highlighting this year’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24166198/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass"><em>Black Ops 6</em></a>, and can point to big expansions coming this year to both <em>World of Warcraft </em>and <em>Diablo 4</em>. Bethesda has <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> to show, plus a possible <em>Starfield </em>expansion, and a strongly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages/">rumored new game in the Doom series</a>. Meanwhile, Xbox Game Studios is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/5/24122208/microsoft-xbox-kareem-choudhry-leaving-xbox-cloud-gaming">reportedly</a> ready to unveil a new Gears of War, as well as show more of <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> and Obsidian’s<em> </em>fantasy role-playing game <em>Avowed</em>.</p>
<p id="Q1KWrZ">That one of these three powerhouse gaming brands also happens to appear on game consoles almost seems like an afterthought. But this is precisely Microsoft’s problem — or one of them, anyway — as it prepares to deliver this crucial address to fans. In 2024, Xbox finds itself in the grip of a profound identity crisis.</p>

<p id="W68mD7">The Xbox fandom, and the wider gaming community, has been shaken over the last few months by reports that Microsoft (which already publishes all its games simultaneously on Xbox and PC) was planning to push deeper into multiplatform publishing by putting previously console-exclusive titles on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24063938/microsoft-xbox-exclusivity-playstation-5-nintendo-switch">Microsoft eventually did just that</a> with <em>Pentiment</em>, <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, and <em>Grounded</em>, but reports persist that much bigger properties — including <em>Starfield</em>, the Indiana Jones game, and franchise jewels like Halo — are also on the table. Windows Central reports that there is <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsofts-quest-for-short-term-dollardollardollar-is-doing-long-term-damage-to-windows-surface-xbox-and-beyond">“no red line” for this initiative</a>, codenamed Latitude, and that more PlayStation versions of Xbox-owned games are in development.</p>
<p id="PweIJ5">The move has a simple business goal — increase the profit margins on Microsoft’s in-house games <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24166647/aaa-exclusive-games-are-dead-playstation-xbox-multiplatform">in a challenging market</a> — but it completely upends a foundational marketing strategy for console gaming, by which the worth and desirability of a platform are deeply linked to its exclusive games. This has become a tenet of almost religious faith for gamers, and the suggestion that it might be abandoned is head-spinning.</p>
<p id="rxmsJk">The context for Microsoft’s decision is important, too. With its push into PC, cloud gaming, mobile, and subscription services with Game Pass, and by buying <em>Minecraft</em>, Microsoft has been clearly signaling that it was thinking beyond the boundaries of Xbox consoles for a decade now. But the acquisition of Activision Blizzard went further by turning the company into a huge multiplatform publisher overnight. </p>

<p id="y445JU">Thanks to regulators, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23797265/microsoft-sony-xbox-playstation-call-of-duty-deal">Microsoft couldn’t make Call of Duty Xbox-exclusive</a> even if it made sense to (it doesn’t). It isn’t any more likely that it would do the same to Blizzard’s games. A massive chunk of Microsoft’s gaming business now lies on PlayStation, Nintendo, and PC, and that’s bound to change the strategic thinking of Xbox leadership.</p>
<p id="jBIXpE">But while Microsoft’s gaming horizons have broadened, the same can’t be said for the Xbox platform itself. According to analysts quoted in the Financial Times, Xbox Series X and S were <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3b89e9f7-e3cf-4e60-bfa4-987af24efa75">outsold three-to-one by PlayStation 5</a> in 2023. Microsoft does not report console sales figures, arguing they don’t present an accurate picture of the overall health of its games business. It does report figures for Game Pass, but only intermittently; after a period of rapid growth, the service seems to have plateaued somewhat at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/23570040/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-subscriber-numbers-34-million">34 million subscribers</a>.</p>
<p id="1v998j">There are more troubling signs still. In early 2024, Microsoft <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24050311/microsoft-xbox-activision-blizzard-layoff">laid off 1,900 workers</a> across its gaming division. This was very bad, though in line with the rest of the game industry, and arguably not the worst of it. That came in May, when the company <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24151045/microsoft-xbox-studio-closures-tango-gameworks-arkane-austin-redfall">shuttered several Bethesda studios</a>, including Arkane Austin (<em>Dishonored</em>, <em>Redfall</em>) and Tango Gameworks (<em>The Evil Within</em>, <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>). The closures stirred uncomfortable memories of Microsoft’s botched management of other studios in the past — especially Fable developer Lionhead, which <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/4/29/11537392/lionhead-studios-closed">was shut down in 2016</a>.</p>

<p id="A547N8">The cumulative effect of all this is to raise huge existential questions for Xbox, and for Microsoft’s ambitions in gaming. What is Xbox now? Do the consoles matter at all? Is Microsoft now just a massive third-party publisher — a bigger EA? Is the Game Pass strategy working? How does owning Call of Duty help any of this? How has Halo, Xbox’s flagship franchise, been allowed to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23590852/halo-infinite-343-industries-future-franchise-reboot">fall into disrepair</a>? And, perhaps most worryingly for players beyond the Xbox community: Can Microsoft be trusted to keep tabs on this vast empire and manage all these beloved properties and storied studios responsibly, without doing irreparable damage like we saw with Fable and Lionhead?</p>
<p id="szRBhZ">On Sunday, Spencer and his team need to do something much more nuanced, and challenging, than just unleash a megaton of game announcements. They need to organize all this bigness into a coherent vision for Xbox’s place in the industry, its relationship to fans, and its strategy for the future. They need to be extremely clear in their messaging about exclusivity on all upcoming games. They need to show commitment to Game Pass (this is where Call of Duty comes in — with regulators insisting the series remains available on rival cloud services and consoles, Game Pass is the only strategic play open to Microsoft with CoD). And they need to show commitment to console hardware; <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24108660/xbox-handheld-console-phil-spencer-interview">unveiling a new handheld</a> would go a long way here.</p>
<p id="82TitY">To be fair to Xbox management, these are uncharted waters. No one has ever attempted to combine the roles of platform holder and third-party publisher before, and whether the move makes sense at all remains an open question. On Sunday, Microsoft needs to show the gaming community why it was worth doing, and how it will make a brighter future for both the industry and the art form — rather than just eating them up and running them down. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/counter-strike-skin-sells-for-more-than-1-million.890439/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/counter-strike-skin-sells-1-million/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>The most expensive skin ever sold <strong>publically </strong>in Counter-Strike history has just changed hands for over $1 million. The final sum wasn’t disclosed by the private buyer, but it was referenced that the transaction was worth ‘more than $1 million’. It was a StatTrak Factory New AK-47 in Blue Gem (Pattern 661), a one-of-one weapon skin that was shielded in secrecy for more than a decade. It was known to be in the wild, but it was never revealed who owned it – but the value of the skin was always common knowledge.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-moolah">Moolah</h2>



<p>In January 2024, the Blue Gem AK-47 – a one-of-a-kind skin – was ‘discovered’, with many users surmising it had been unboxed in a CS weapon case. This extraordinary pull would have had the clout to turn an average gamer into a millionaire overnight – but it’s believed that it sat firmly in the grip of a collector for several years. In 2022, a slightly ‘more worn’ variant of this skin sold for a whopping $400,000 – but that’s far from being the most expensive Counter-Strike skin ever auctioned off.</p>



<p>This news was broken on social media by Jake Lucky, who shared an attractive montage of the weapon:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The most expensive skin in Counterstrike history was publicly sold this morning, a StatTrak Factory New AK-47 Blue Gem pattern 661</p><p>For over $1 million <a href="https://t.co/1FdxoNM2ov">pic.twitter.com/1FdxoNM2ov</a></p></div>— Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/1798387413313868135?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Last year, one user unboxed a $150,000 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-csgo-player-blue-gem-karambit-lucky/">rare Blue Gem Karambit</a> – a type of knife – mere weeks into playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Before that, a wealthy Chinese collector secured a super-rare AK-47 skin <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/csgo-ak47-skin-sold/">for a staggering $160,000</a>.</p>



<p>Many have dubbed CS skins the ‘OG NFTs’, but what’s ironic is that the value of these top-tier cosmetics has outlasted the value of the most popular NFTs, and will probably continue to do so for quite some time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/does-concord-require-a-psn-account-on-pc-answered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>There is an unfortunate and rising trend of upcoming titles, specifically once-console-exclusive games from PlayStation that require a third-party account to run on PC. We saw it with Helldivers 2, where the community came together to revolt against Sony’s decision. Even today, that decision isn’t fully reversed. But here we are once more. Does Concord require a PSN account on PC?</p>



<h2 id="h-do-you-need-a-psn-account-for-concord">Do You Need a PSN Account for Concord?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, like with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-god-of-war-ragnarok-require-a-psn-account-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War Ragnarok</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-until-dawn-require-a-psn-account-on-pc-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Until Dawn</a>, users will require a PSN account for Concord once it launches on PC. The upcoming hero shooter will require a PlayStation Network connection on Steam and Epic Games Stores, meaning you can’t play the online-only game if you don’t have a PSN account. There are still <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/countries-that-dont-have-psn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 120 countries where the PlayStation Network isn’t available</a>. That’s countless millions of players left in the dust yet again.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, following State of Play, Concord proved to be the most lackluster announcement of the bunch. By now, most people find themselves exhausted by hero-based arena shooters, and yet developers keep forcing them out the door. The decision to require a PSN account on PC doesn’t help anyone, especially not the studio behind the game.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-concord">What is Concord?</h2>



<p>During the first few minutes of the game’s announcement, I thought Concord was a single-player adventure in the same style as Guardians of the Galaxy. Instead, the team revealed a 5v5 arena shooter with hero characters—a PvP-only, frantic first-person shooter focused on social play and semi-competitive gameplay elements.</p>



<p>We’re still learning more about the game, and perhaps it will surprise us in the end, so fingers crossed for something a little more unique!</p>

Thank you again to everyone who has supported us!”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Hypercharge: Unboxed is inspired by films like Toy Story and Small Soldiers, and comes with a story campaign mode that can be played solo offline or with up to four players in online co-op. It also supports splitscreen play locally and online. There are PVP modes, too.</p><p>The game launched first on Steam back in April 2020, where it was met with a ‘very positive’ user review rating.

Over the years many indie developers have bigged up Game Pass, with money paid by Microsoft taking much of the risk out of launching new games across multiple platforms. Day-one Game Pass deals are even more lucrative. Hypercharge: Unboxed, it seems, has achieved relative success on Xbox without either.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p data-characters="390" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">You’ll solve puzzles in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> for many reasons, from opening a locked chest to completing various quests. One puzzle you’ll encounter at the lighthouse in Frosting Harbor asks you to look afar at the break of dawn to find something, but it doesn’t give additional context for what you’re looking for. Let’s find out what lies in wait for you at dawn.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-solve-the-look-afar-at-the-break-of-dawn-puzzle-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">How to solve the look afar at the break of dawn puzzle in Wuthering Waves</h2> <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">To solve the lighthouse’s “look afar at the break of dawn” puzzle, set your in-game clock to 06:00 before traveling down the hill to the nearby harbor. Here, you’ll spot a golden glow on the ground, which you can investigate to reveal a standard supply chest containing <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-astrite-in-wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astrite</a>, medium energy core, and other rewards.</p> <figure data-current-count="641" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false">The first part of this puzzle after hacking the lighthouse control panel is to switch your in-game time to 06:00. You can do this by heading into your main menu, selecting the clock icon at the bottom of your screen, and scrolling through the time shards until you see 06:00. Choose this time and confirm your selection to skip through the day, allowing you to see the world at the break of dawn.</p> <figure data-current-count="696" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false">Once you set your time to six in the morning, look away from the lighthouse and toward Frosting Harbor.

Open it to find your rewards, knocking out the lighthouse’s look afar at the break of dawn puzzle.</p>

            <p>
UK high street chain GAME will no longer offer Xbox All Access to new subscribers beginning later this month, Eurogamer can confirm. 
</p>
<p>
Xbox All Access, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-all-access-the-best-way-to-buy-an-xbox-series-x-or-xbox-series-s">which lets you pay for an Xbox Series X or S console via 24 monthly installments</a>, is available through only a handful of partner retailers globally, and just three in the UK. 
</p>
<p>
GAME is by far the largest chain to have supported the subscription, but Eurogamer understands it is now dropping the offer as part of an ongoing series of changes as many of its high street stores are replaced by concessions in other Frasers Group chains, such as Sports Direct.
</p>

<p>
Earlier this week, Eurogamer reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-shutting-reward-scheme-next-month-and-you-should-use-any-remaining-credit-while-you-can-still-can">GAME was scrapping its long-running GAME Rewards membership scheme</a>, including its premium Elite tier. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-retailer-game-to-cease-video-game-trade-ins-staff-say">we also reported that GAME was set to drop its trade-in program</a>, too. 
</p>
<p>
In each case, Eurogamer understands this is to streamline the offerings GAME provides as the brand operates increasingly out of concessions.
</p>
<p>
"GAME is simplifying its credit offering and, as of 26th June, will no longer be offering Xbox All Access," a GAME spokesperson confirmed to Eurogamer. "This decision will not impact any of our existing Xbox All Access customers. 
</p>
<p>
"We continue to offer our full range of Xbox products and customers will be able to apply for flexible financing options through Frasers Plus."
</p>
<p>
Microsoft has separately confirmed it will continue to offer Xbox All Access in the UK. Currently, the scheme is operated here by GAME, Smyths Toys and 4Gadgets.
</p>
<p>
"Xbox All Access - which allows players to purchase Xbox Series X|S and Game Pass for a monthly price - will continue to be available at participating retailers throughout the UK,"  a Microsoft spokesperson confirmed. 
</p>
<p>
It's been a year of change for GAME, as it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-staff-told-to-expect-redundancies-as-most-workers-move-to-zero-hours-contracts">moves staff to zero-hour contracts and makes others redundant</a>, while the company shifts to operate from fewer high street outlets.

<p>First up, Remedy has posted this teaser, which seems to be a reference to the upcoming “Night Springs” story DLC for <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/alan-wake-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alan Wake 2</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Dark Triangle Coffee. Just coffee, nothing else. Have a sip at Night Springs' One and Only Coffee World.</p>
<p>Join the percolation on June 7th... in Night Springs.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NightSprings?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NightSprings</a> <a href="https://t.co/qzXEwVxDWB">pic.twitter.com/qzXEwVxDWB</a></p>
<p>— Alan Wake 2 (@alanwake) <a href="https://twitter.com/alanwake/status/1798006904150458559?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>For those who haven’t been keeping up, here’s how Remedy has <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-story-dlc-detailed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously described the Night Springs DLC</a>…</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Visions and dreams. Fiction is written and coming true. Fiction collapses and remains just words on a page. These are those stories… in Night Springs.</em></li>
<li><em>Play as several familiar characters from the world of Alan Wake and experience the unexplainable in multiple self-contained episodes of Night Springs, a fictional tv-show set in the world of Alan Wake.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Second, Geoff Keighley has promised Blumhouse Games will be officially unveiled. Blumhouse is, of course, the biggest name in horror cinema right now, and some movie production companies, like Annapurna, have had quite a bit of success in the realm of video games recently, so this is something to watch.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Finally, for those who perhaps aren’t feeling the <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-new-2024-trailer-gameplay-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, many of the original creators of that series will finally show off first gameplay of their new horror game <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/slitterhead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slitterhead</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Don't miss the gameplay world premiere of SLITTERHEAD, from the mind of Silent Hill creator Keiichiro Toyama and <a href="https://twitter.com/BokehGameStudio?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BokehGameStudio</a> during <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SummerGameFest?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SummerGameFest</a> live this Friday.</p>

<p>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1798367846449430889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Summer Game Fest kickoff show will be livestreamed this Friday (June 7) at 2pm PT. Geoff Keighley has cautioned that the show may be a <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-2024-will-be-quieter-when-it-comes-to-shocking-announcements-says-keighley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bit light on “shocking announcements,”</a> but at least for horror fans, it looks like there’s still going to be plenty of reason to tune in.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dave-bautista-takes-on-the-entire-assassin-underworld-in-the-killer%E2%80%99s-game-trailer.890400/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24171995/killers-game-trailer-release-date-cast-dave-bautista-action-movie<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="YKh9Sx">It’s finally Dave Bautista’s time to shine as a bona fide action lead. The first trailer for <em>The Killer’s Game</em>, an assassin comedy with a star-studded cast and action royalty behind the camera, has dropped. The movie, based on the novel by <em>The Walking Dead</em> comics co-writer Jay Bonansinga, is coming to theaters September 13.</p>
<p id="v3THfO">Bautista plays an assassin diagnosed with a terminal illness who decides to put out a hit on himself for a quick death, rather than have him and his partner suffer through the deterioration of his health. But when he finds out his doctor made a mistake and he’s not actually dying, he has to fend for his life against some of the deadliest killers in the world. It’s a bit similar to the set up of last year’s <em>King of Killers</em>, starring Frank Grillo as an assassin who put out a hit on himself, but with a more fun twist and a much more exciting lineup.</p>
<p id="8vnwrD">Bautista has been largely relegated to side roles in the action genre, and here’s a real chance for him to shine in a genre well-suited to his considerable skills. And you can bet he’ll shine, with the support around him. <em>The Killer’s Game </em>is directed by legendary stunt performer and action director <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23301622/action-horror-comedy-movies-like-day-shift-watch-streaming">J.J. Perry</a>, who has been involved in a significant percentage of the great American action movies of the past 30 years, from <em>Blade </em>to <em>John Wick</em>. Perry’s feature debut as a director, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23301934/day-shift-review-netflix-vampire-movie-jamie-foxx-scott-adkins"><em>Day Shift</em></a>,<em> </em>was a fun vampire action comedy starring Jamie Foxx with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23301720/day-shift-vampires-netflix-contortionists-jamie-foxx-jj-perry">creative action choreography and camera work</a>. </p>
<p id="zmu4hf">Bautista will also have more support than just <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23835899/blue-beetle-flight-scenes-action-director-interview">Perry</a>. <em>The Killer’s Game </em>has a tantalizing cast, with Ben Kingsley (I’m obsessed with how he says “There are only two ways out of the killer’s game, Joseph”), Pom Klementieff, Sofia Boutella, Terry Crews, and WWE wrestler Drew McIntyre all involved. For the action diehards, the presence of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/videos/2021/1/29/22256482/scott-adkins-breaks-down-video-game-fights-mortal-kombat">Scott Adkins</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23664737/fist-of-the-condor-movie-review-marko-zaror-martial-arts">Marko Zaror</a> (who features heavily in the trailer), and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22973113/hell-hath-no-fury-hulu-thriller-movie-watch">Daniel Bernhardt</a> is especially appealing. All three are legends in their own right, and Bernhardt in particular has made a career of making movie stars look god at kicking his ass (<em>Atomic Blonde</em>, <em>Nobody</em>).</p>
<p id="nXbyhO">The project’s been in the works pretty much since Bonansinga’s novel came out in 1997. At different points over the past few decades, Wesley Snipes, Michael Keaton, and Jason Statham were each attached in the lead role. But ultimately, it’s Bautista who got the part, and it seems like a promising vehicle for his combination of charm, humor, and physical ability as a former professional athlete.</p>
<p id="SoAoJh">The trailer advertises lots of action and plenty of gore, as Bautista shoots, stabs, and garrotes his way through a bevy of targets. The comedy’s a bit hit-or-miss for me in the trailer, but that’s how trailers go sometimes. The lineup of talent and the teases of great action are more than enough for me to be counting down the days to September. </p>

There’s lots of characters, motivations, plot twists, and proper nouns to keep track of. For the longest time, <em>Destiny 2 </em>has reveled in these things, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-lore-catch-up-mynameisbyf-1851513216&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-lore-catch-up-mynameisbyf-1851513216">spinning a hell of a yarn</a></span> for the fans who have stuck around for all of it over the years. <em>The Final Shape </em>is unconcerned with most of those nitty-gritty lore tidbits as it brings some of these arcs to a close, placing emphasis instead on big feelings and a surreal environment that lends those feelings real power. This makes it a bit messy, but there’s something deeply moving about how much <em>The Final Shape </em>wears its heart on its sleeve, too.</p><p><em>The Final Shape </em>has the unenviable task of having to close out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-the-final-shape-ten-years-tiktok-1851518305&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-the-final-shape-ten-years-tiktok-1851518305">this book of <em>Destiny</em>’s history</a></span>. I worried about how it might begin to tackle such an immense task, which seems impossible to accomplish to the satisfaction of everyone playing. The answer Bungie found, however, is pretty simple: keep the story lean, funnel the player to the climactic fight, and tug on some heartstrings while you’re at it.</p><h2 id="h4382"><a id=""></a><strong>Feelings given shape</strong></h2><p><em>Destiny 2</em>’s climactic conclusion to the Light and Darkness saga does center the series’ villain, the Witness, more than it ever has before, but it’s difficult to call them and their motivations the heart of this expansion. That honor’s reserved for the most highly esteemed and messy fireteam in <em>Destiny</em>’s history, the Vanguard. Commander Zavala, Ikorra Rey, and the returning Cayde-6 make <em>The Final Shape </em>thrum with an electric and uneasy energy as their painful reunion gets swept up into the larger crisis of the end of the world.</p><figure id="" data-id="2da72661542cfdf73c45dde382db2a66" data-recommend-id="image://2da72661542cfdf73c45dde382db2a66" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot showing some of The Final Shape's more distorted and dark environments." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot showing some of The Final Shape's more distorted and dark environments." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bungie / Sony</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2da72661542cfdf73c45dde382db2a66" data-recommend-id="image://2da72661542cfdf73c45dde382db2a66" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot showing some of The Final Shape's more distorted and dark environments." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Upon entering the Pale Heart of the Traveler, a destination that reuses and distorts several environments from <em>Destiny</em>’s past, things feel immediately off. The Pale Heart is often beauteous, especially where nature seems to have reclaimed long-forgotten locales, but pockets of it tout these vast veiled statues of ghastly figures that <em>Destiny 2 </em>players have become familiar with, and calcified hands seem to jut from the ground and caves. As you push deeper into the festering wound the Witness has cut here, the environments grow more tortured and agonized faces protrude from walls. <em>The Final Shape </em>leans into pain, fear, and anger, and it especially comes through in the Pale Heart. If I may, it looks good on <em>Destiny.</em><br></p><p>This expansion’s central cast is going through it just as much as the world appears to be. Ikorra and Zavala’s reunion with their best friend Cayde-6 is…less than joyous. His appearance, as well as the current, urgent state of things, prompts crises of faiths that see some characters pushed beyond their breaking points, and here is where I’d like to give a nod to <em>Destiny</em>’s stable of voice actors. Everyone from Keith David (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-zavala-keith-david-lance-reddick-1851497272&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-zavala-keith-david-lance-reddick-1851497272">taking over as Zavala</a></span> from the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lance-reddick-death-age-actor-john-wick-destiny-horizon-1850238254#:~:text=Reddick%20was%20a%20particularly%20big,the%20beloved%20in%2Dgame%20character.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lance-reddick-death-age-actor-john-wick-destiny-horizon-1850238254#:~:text=Reddick%20was%20a%20particularly%20big,the%20beloved%20in%2Dgame%20character.">late Lance Reddick</a></span>) to Kirsten Potter as Mara Sov clearly understood the assignment, and their line readings in this expansion are some of the most emotive and expressive stuff I’ve ever heard in the series. Mara Sov’s anguished cries for her brother haunted me the entirety of the campaign, and Zavala, Ikorra, and Cayde in particular have some emotionally resonant and tough conversations. They verbally spurn each other like jilted friends that never got over the sour end of a cherished relationship, but they also have the most tender moments of the whole experience too. Their performances help ground the finality of the events occuring throughout <em>The Final Shape</em>.</p><h2 id="h4383"><a id=""></a><strong>Growing pains</strong></h2><p>The strength of these various performances helps mask the fact that little else seems to be going on for all of <em>Destiny 2</em>’s countless ongoing threads outside of the Pale Heart. While I’m grateful for the emotional weight of the beats <em>The Final Shape </em>does deliver for some beloved characters, I can’t help but be let down that this doesn’t feel like <em>Destiny 2</em>’s “Avengers, assemble” moment. I will likely be proven wrong by the time the raid rolls around—and there’s a seasonal story appended to <em>The Final Shape </em>that’ll likely tease out some of those secondary plots—but it’s a bummer that more of the allies and friends we’ve made along the way haven’t figured in more prominently.</p><figure id="" data-id="345c86b6fcac85901294f7fcd5e0c30f" data-recommend-id="image://345c86b6fcac85901294f7fcd5e0c30f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of a fireteam taking on The Final Shape's great new strike." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of a fireteam taking on The Final Shape's great new strike." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bungie / Sony</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="345c86b6fcac85901294f7fcd5e0c30f" data-recommend-id="image://345c86b6fcac85901294f7fcd5e0c30f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of a fireteam taking on The Final Shape's great new strike." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>The Final Shape</em>’s missions are a bit uneven, too. Though they’re certainly a step above <em>Lightfall</em>’s campaign, which felt tonally confused from the get-go, they don’t quite reach the highs of <em>The Witch Queen</em>, either. <em>The Final Shape </em>gets the stakes, at least, but fails to make immense moments or mechanical setpieces of them. Which isn’t to say I didn’t have a blast, because I did, especially as <em>Destiny </em>campaigns continue to borrow mechanics from its endgame raids that deepen the story experience. While most of the campaign missions came and went, a thrilling strike and the final mission were the biggest standouts, boasting a mixture of environmental design and mechanics that recalled the highs of <em>Destiny</em>’s very best encounters. But whereas I felt I could point to numerous landmark moments in <em>The Witch Queen </em>campaign, like a certain boss encounter in a sprawling maze-like environment, I mostly found approximations of some of <em>Destiny</em>’s greatest hits, including that very same encounter, in <em>The Final Shape</em>.<br></p><p>It also struggles to make the new Prismatic subclass stand out, though this isn’t exactly new to <em>Destiny </em>expansions. Prismatic blends all of the previous elements (Void, Arc, Solar, Stasis, and Strand) and turns players into a super-powered warrior capable of using them all simultaneously. It is the definition of a power trip, and yet, the campaign deploys the new subclass as more of a gimmick than a new part of the player’s arsenal, though I’m sure that will give way to radical builds once players clear the story and get into <em>The Final Shape</em>’s postgame.<br></p><p>I still really enjoyed <em>The Final Shape</em> (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-servers-1851519144&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-servers-1851519144">despite server issues</a></span>) and I’ll admit that some of the cheap nostalgia plays it pulled successfully made me teary-eyed. Even if it doesn’t entirely land, it’s got so much heart, and wrings so much from a cast and world I love, that I can’t fault it too heavily for its missteps. It is at least as focused as <em>Destiny 2 </em>has ever been, and as the twists and turns kept piling up, I couldn’t wait to see where folks wound up. It’s a little hard to believe, but an era of <em>Destiny 2 </em>is ending, and true to itself, <em>The Final Shape </em>is an appropriately uneven but endearing close to one chapter and the beginning of a new one.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Never underestimate the fans who want to see more Shenmue. After raising over $7 million to partially crowdfund Shenmue III in 2018, passionate followers of the franchise haven't given up on pushing for Shenmue 4. Now, six years after the latest game in the series, Shenmue fans have ramped up their efforts by purchasing a 15-second ad on a Times Square video billboard to campaign for a sequel.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shenmue-fans-rented-a-times-square-billboard-to-campaign-for-shenmue-4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, the ad was placed by a fan site, <a href="https://shenmuedojo.com/letsgetshenmue4-trending-at-new-yorks-times-square/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Shenmue Dojo</a>. The stated goal of Shenmue Dojo's campaign is to "support the continuation of the series and attempt to spread global awareness to find [developer] Ys Net a potential partner for Shenmue 4." The Times Square ad also included the hashtag #LetsGetShenmue4.</p><p>In the short term, the campaign successfully managed to get Shenmue trending on X. However, getting a fourth game in the series may still be an uphill battle. Shenmue III debuted to mixed or negative reviews in 2019, and the sales weren't high enough to immediately warrant a sequel. Regardless, the team behind the Shenmue 4 campaign remains optimistic about the franchise's future, as explained in the following message posted on the site.</p><p>"Thank you to everyone that helped to show their support with the timed mass tweets/posts today. It was very much appreciated and proves that together, as a collective, we can spread the awareness that we are not going to sit back without a fight. We will continue to strive until Shenmue 4 is a reality."</p>

                <p>The Last Of Us Part 2 is one of the most-acclaimed games of the past few years, but it has stubbornly remained a PlayStation exclusive for that time. A leaker with a proven track record of reliably releasing game info ahead of time recently said that the PC port of The Last Of Us Part 2 Remastered has been finished for more than six months.</p><p dir="ltr">That leaker--Billbil-kun, over at <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/mais-quand-sortira-la-version-pc-de-the-last-of-us-part-ii-52283" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dealabs Magazine</a>--claims that development on The Last Of Us Part 2 started way back in 2021, and that it concluded prior to this year, perhaps in November 2023. The leaker notes that the remastered version of the game was released on PS5 in January 2024, which perhaps means that Sony is deliberately holding back the PC port. Billbil-kun then speculates that it may release with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-last-of-us-season-2-release-window-cast-and-everything-else-we-know-so-far/2900-4679/" data-ref-id="2900-4679">season 2 of the HBO TV adaptation</a>, which is set to come out in 2025.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Last Of Us 2’s Roguelite Mode Explained</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As with all leaks of this nature, we recommend you take it with a grain of salt. However, it has been almost four years since The Last of Us Part 2 came out, which means Sony's had plenty of time to work on a PC port. Over the past few years, Sony has released PC ports of its big exclusives months or even years after their launch on PS4 or PS5. For example, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima/" data-ref-id="5000-474583">Ghost of Tsushima</a> came out in May of this year, almost four years after its 2020 console launch.</p>

        <p>Check out our panel featuring Shawn Layden, Michael Pachter and Van Burnham</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
Where will gamers be playing in the future? That's the question we're going to try and answer during a special panel at <a href="https://www.ign.com/live/">IGN Live on Sunday.</a>
</p>
<p>
<em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> head Christopher Dring will lead a panel featuring former PlayStation exec, and current advisor to Tencent, Shawn Layden, veteran games analyst Michael Pachter and author, curator and historian Van Burnham. It takes place at 2pm local time in Los Angeles, with coverage on IGN and GamesIndustry.biz. 
</p>
<p>
During the 30-minute session, we will discuss the role of consoles, the trends on mobile and PC, and look to the potential impact of areas such as game streaming, Netflix and 'metaverse' titles such as Fortnite and Roblox.
</p>
<p>
IGN Live is one of several games events taking place in LA this week, during a period previously occupied by the E3 trade show. Other events include Summer Games Fest, Play Days and Ubisoft Forward, while Xbox will also be on the ground meeting with media following the close of its Games Showcase.
</p>
<p>
There are also a string of digital events scheduled over June, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/summer-games-showcases-what-to-watch-and-when">which you can read all about here. </a>

It uses a dual bar system where you can quickly swap between weapons and skillsets at the press of a button. But that’s just more complications. Thankfully you can create builds that just use one bar, like this one bar PvE Magicka Sorcerer Build.</p> <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="296" data-injectable="false">There isn’t really one single “one bar” build. Finding out the best one that works for you is often a matter of experimentation. So, try this, but if it doesn’t work for you, change what doesn’t work. However, you will definitely be able to get a capable defense/attack from this build.</p> <p data-characters="217" data-current-count="513" data-injectable="true">If it isn’t clear, as you level your character and decide on where to put your stats and Champion Points, you’re going to want to <strong>focus mainly on improving magicka</strong>. Build your Health and Stamina only as secondary.</p>

So, my recommended one bar build looks like this:</p> <p data-characters="23" data-current-count="245" data-injectable="false"><strong>Weapon: Lightning Staff</strong></p> <figure data-found-rows="7" data-current-count="825" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Skill</strong></td><td><strong>Skill Line</strong></td><td><strong>Base Skill</strong></td><td><strong>Use</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mystic Orb</strong></td><td><strong>Undaunted</strong></td><td><strong>Necrotic Orb</strong></td><td><strong>Attack</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Unstable Wall of Elements</strong></td><td><strong>Destruction Staff</strong></td><td><strong>Wall of Elements</strong></td><td><strong>Attack</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Critical Surge</strong></td><td><strong>Storm Calling</strong></td><td><strong>Surge</strong></td><td><strong>Damage buff</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Summon Volatile Familiar</strong></td><td><strong>Daedric Summoning</strong></td><td><strong>Summon Unstable Familiar</strong></td><td><strong>Passive damage/damage mitigation</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Summon Twilight Tormentor</strong></td><td><strong>Daedric Summoning</strong></td><td><strong>Summon Winged Twilight</strong></td><td><strong>Passive damage/damage mitigation</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Greater Storm Atronach</strong></td><td><strong>Daedric Summoning</strong></td><td><strong>Summon Storm Atronach</strong></td><td><strong>Passive damage/damage mitigation</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="203" data-current-count="203" data-injectable="false">This build provides a great deal of passive damage from your summons, gives you two straightforward attacks to keep you engaged, and a buff to keep your damage high enough to take down difficult targets.</p> <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="533" data-injectable="true">Your rotation should start by summoning your familiar and twilight tormentor. Once they’re at your side, it’s time for Critical Surge. Throw a Mystic Orb, then an Unstable Wall of Elements. It’s then time to mix in your heavy attack. Whenever one of your skills expires, recast it. Once your Ultimate is charged, unleash it.</p>
 <p data-characters="115" data-current-count="115" data-injectable="false"><strong>Summon Volatile Familiar&gt;Summon Twilight Tormentor&gt;Critical Surge&gt;Mystic Orb&gt;Unstable Wall of Elements.</strong></p> <h2 id="h-gear-for-one-bar-pve-magicka-sorcerer" data-injectable="false">Gear for One Bar PvE Magicka Sorcerer</h2> <p data-characters="115" data-current-count="230" data-injectable="false">Get your crafting character ready to work out some upgrades for the One Bar PvE Magicka Sorcerer’s best gear.</p> <h3 id="h-sergeant-s-mail" data-injectable="false">Sergeant’s Mail</h3> <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="593" data-injectable="true">This is going to sound somewhat strange for a magic-centric character, but my recommended set Sargeant’s Mail. That means it’s heavy armor. It gets dropped in the Wayrest Sewer Dungeons (1 and 2). It might sound bulky (you can always change its appearance at an Outfit Station if it interferes with your drip), but the helpfulness of its bonuses are apparent:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>(2 items)</strong> Adds 1206 Maximum Health</li> <li><strong>(3 items)</strong> Adds 129 Health Recovery</li> <li><strong>(4 items)</strong> Adds 129 Weapon and Spell Damage</li> <li><strong>(5 items)</strong> When you deal damage with a Heavy Attack, you gain a stack of Sergeant’s Focus for 5 seconds, increasing the damage of your Heavy Attacks by 645 per stack. This effect can occur once every second and stacks up to 4 times.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="131" data-current-count="291" data-injectable="false">Not hard to gain, upgrades your heavy attack (which you’ll be using, er, heavily), your spell damage, and Health. Very effective.</p> <h3 id="h-deadly-strike" data-injectable="false">Deadly Strike</h3> <p data-characters="194" data-current-count="485" data-injectable="true">If you’re willing to do some PvP in Cyrodiil, you can supplement with Deadly Strike gear. This is useful, because you don’t need to pile on the equipment in order to get some useful effects:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>(2 items)</strong> Adds 129 Weapon and Spell Damage</li> <li><strong>(3 items)</strong> Adds 657 Critical Chance</li> <li><strong>(4 items)</strong> Adds 129 Weapon and Spell Damage</li> <li><strong>(5 items)</strong> Increase the damage your damage over time and channeled attacks do by 15%.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="53" data-current-count="213" data-injectable="false">As mentioned, you can find Deadly Strike in Cyrodiil.</p> <h3 id="h-oakensoul-ring" data-injectable="false">Oakensoul Ring</h3> <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="483" data-injectable="true">For any One Bar build, the Oakensoul ring is indispensable. It prevents you from swapping between your weapon sets, but… that’s the point of this build. That was already our objective. So, why not just take that option a way in favor of some of these terrific perks.</p>
 <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="40" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>(1 item)</strong> While equipped, you are unable to swap between your Primary and Backup Weapon Sets and gain Minor Berserk, Minor Courage, Major Brutality, Major Sorcery, Major Prophecy, Major Savagery, Minor Force, Minor Protection, Major Resolve, Minor Mending, Minor Fortitude, Minor Intellect, Minor Endurance, Minor Heroism, Minor Slayer, Minor Aegis, and Empower.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="149" data-current-count="189" data-injectable="false">Damned right. You can get the Oakensoul ring through the Antiquities system. You’re going to need to focus your search around High Isle and Amenos.</p> <h2 id="h-other-considerations" data-injectable="false">Other considerations</h2> <p data-characters="97" data-current-count="286" data-injectable="false">Beyond what has already been listed here, there are a few other things you’ll want to consider.</p> <p data-characters="328" data-current-count="614" data-injectable="true">In terms of the race you choose for your character, <strong>High Elf (Altmer) is probably your best bet</strong>, as its passives are magicka and destruction staff-based. Breton is the next best, as they also receive Magicka Bonuses. Dunmer also gets bonuses to spell damage, but the Dual Wield proficiency and Stamina boosts are largely wasted.</p>
 <p data-characters="154" data-current-count="154" data-injectable="false">Otherwise, the race of your character <strong>isn’t a crucial decision</strong>. Choose the one you want to play as or build around the suggested ones. It’s up to you.</p> <p data-characters="218" data-current-count="372" data-injectable="false">As for the Mundus sign you’ll want to align with, the build provided here doesn’t depend too much on it. However, I’d recommend either <strong>The Lover for additional attack damage or The Steed for better survivability</strong>.</p> <p data-characters="328" data-current-count="700" data-injectable="true">For your potions, I’m a simple person. I usually just go with something that boosts your Health/Stamina/Magicka (I always have a glut of one type or another after so many years of playing.) However, you probably also want something that can heal you since you don’t have any direct healing skills to keep yourself topped up.</p>
 <p data-characters="177" data-current-count="177" data-injectable="false">Finally, if you’re playing by yourself. Your survivability can be increased dramatically by keeping a companion with you. Also, they’re fun. I mean, I find them fun.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-creator%E2%80%99s-slitterhead-to-get-gameplay-reveal-at-summer-game-fest.890358/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slitterhead-gameplay-reveal-sgf-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Summer Game Fest organizer Geoff Keighley has announced that one of the games being showcased during this Friday's presentation will be Bokeh Game Studio's&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead</em>, which is the brainchild of&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>creator Keiichiro Toyama.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1798367846449430889" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X</a> (formerly Twitter), Keighley says that the "gameplay world premiere" of&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead&nbsp;</em>will be shown during the Summer Game Fest opening presentation, which will be happening at 5pm Eastern on Friday.</p>

<p><em>Slitterhead&nbsp;</em>was first unveiled back in 2021 as part of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-announcement-from-game-awards-2021">that year's Game Awards ceremony</a>. A teaser trailer for the game was shown, revealing its art direction and some of its creature design (although, crucially, no gameplay was demonstrated).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bokeh-game-studio-slitterhead-gameplay-reveal-sgf-monster.jpg?itok=Vg5z8l5C 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bokeh-game-studio-slitterhead-gameplay-reveal-sgf-monster.jpg?itok=_9aDKxRn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Slitterhead&nbsp;</em>has some pretty evocative-looking art direction.</figcaption></figure><p>The game was actually teased earlier than that year's Game Awards, though. It's possible to see some concept art for what would eventually become&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead&nbsp;</em>in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-creator-keiichiro-toyama-founds-bokeh-game-studio">a video announcing the foundation</a> of Bokeh Game Studio from back in late 2020.</p>

<p>After the Game Awards reveal, Bokeh began to tease more information about&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead</em>.</p>

<p>The company has released a series of dev diaries showing off the development process for the game, including one in which we <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-slitterhead-dev-diary">get to see some user testing phase footage</a> (and a very brief snippet of rather early-in-development-looking gameplay).</p>

<p>In addition to these videos, Bokeh has also released several Q&amp;A sessions with horror luminaries and industry legends, including chats with horror manga icon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stzQrcyzyTU" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Junji Ito</a>,&nbsp;<em>Danganronpa&nbsp;</em>creator <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nzd6ZESIkE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kazutaka Kodaka</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma&nbsp;</em>head honcho <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yEUS1VDwzo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hideaki Itsuno</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bokeh-game-studio-slitterhead-gameplay-reveal-sgf-motorcycle-helmet.jpg?itok=yocmT8WF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bokeh-game-studio-slitterhead-gameplay-reveal-sgf-motorcycle-helmet.jpg?itok=fYUjaloR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Will this be&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead</em>'s protagonist?</figcaption></figure><p>It's not clear exactly how far along the development pipeline&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead&nbsp;</em>actually is, but the fact that Bokeh is showing gameplay this Friday is encouraging, at least.</p>

<p>We still don't have a release date or even a release window for&nbsp;<em>Slitterhead</em>, but perhaps we'll learn more about when we can expect the game to land later this week. Stay tuned for all the news from Summer Game Fest as and when we get it.</p>

This week we <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-hollows-out-everything-you-loved-about-elden-ring-and-its-brilliant">finally got our raging bear gauntlets on Elden Ring Shadow Of The Erdtree</a>, an even dingier and danker edition of 2022's best and dankest open worlder, but perhaps you'd rather play a Soulslike with a Florentine flounce and the warmth of a Mediterranean sunset on its brow. A brighter, stagier variety of action-role-playing, which deepens the connection between Italian folklore and Soulsliking established by last year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies Of P</a>. Well then: cast aside those ursine mitts, slip on a pair of immaculate white theatre gloves and get your thumbs into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/enotria-the-last-song">Enotria: The Last Song</a>, which has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2102450/Enotria_The_Last_Song/">a demo on Steam</a>. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The work of Milan-based Jyamma Games, it takes place in a world overtaken by a "twisted eternal play", in which everybody has a mask that determines the role they are doomed to perform indefinitely - the latest plot justification for the classic Dark Souls tragicomic ritual of everything and everybody resetting when you die.</p>
<p>You don't have a mask, however. Rather, you're the Maskless One and as such, free to wear any dang mask you choose and make use of its esoteric powers. Each mask is a set of stat modifiers and special abilities which you can switch between with D-pad down. Land a finishing move in a brawl and your equipped mask will "awaken", sprouting additional bonuses. My favourite of the two I've discovered so far is the Piercing Wit Mask - yes, mostly because it sounds dashing, but also because when I Pierce somebody with my Wit (impale them with my longsword), my ranged "Mask Lines" or spells recharge instantly, making this a great piece of headwear for budding battlemages.

<p>
The complexities of the mask mechanic notwithstanding, the first few minutes and opening tutorials for Enotria are interchangeable with those of most other Soulslikes. You've got light and heavy attacks, a stagger bar of sorts, a parry and dodge (but no block), a distressingly finite flask of health replenishment, and a branching corridor map pegged down by bonfire-equivalents which here take the form of pluckable, glowing cords.</p>
<p>
During those opening sections I was concerned that the game's cultural influences would prove grafted-on, with terms like "fast" and "slow" archly swapped out for "allegro" and "adagio" in a bid to wow stupid tourists like, yes, myself. Perhaps that'll be my conclusion after 40 hours of play, Enotria's estimated minimum completion time. But the set dressing is undeniably appealing. The sun-drenched landscape (available in several parallel incarnations, I understand, though I haven't unlocked the associated plane-shifting mechanic) feels like the ambience of Dark Souls 2's Majula smeared across a continent. There are fields of sunflowers along the shores and piles of broken stained glass in the catacombs which doubtless have a tale attached. And there are some promising mechanical wrinkles beyond the first few scuffles.
</p>
<p>
Take "primal elements". These aren't the usual water-beats-fire gambit, but a curious medley of positive and negative status modifiers. There's Vis, which inflicts Dizziness, boosting damage and stamina regen while lowering defence. There's Fatuo, which makes you Wicked, amplifying your Elemental abilities while also letting attackers heal themselves by hurting you. Malanno is a source of Sickness, which (more predictably) erodes your health over time and spreads to nearby characters. And then there's Gratia, which renders you Radiant, regenerating your health, but also causes you to explode when struck.</p>
<p>You can make out the dim traces here of conventional elemental systems and status effects like Berserk, but they've been intriguingly defaced. I'm keen to see how impactful these disfigurations are, as somebody who's very bored of beating fire with water, water with earth, and so on. But in the shorter term, I have to confess that I'm just happy to be out of the shadows and enjoying the sun.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24172050/hades-2-patch-notes-chronos-weapon-upgrades<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="s60J7D">If you’ve been struggling to beat Chronos, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24151266/hades-2-early-access-content-hecate-scylla-bosses"><em>Hades 2</em></a>’s final boss, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/4191241567727414432?l=english">Tuesday’s patch</a> might give you a boost. Don’t get me wrong, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/hades-2-guides/24153678/chronos-boss-fight-how-to-beat-best-build">Chronos will still be hard to take on</a>, but developer Supergiant Games made some tweaks that decrease the likeliness that the boss will be “patently unfair.”</p>
<p id="vtmnUP"><em>Hades 2</em>’s second patch is pretty big — it’s got a whole slew of general changes, UI and menu updates, and weapon upgrades alongside changes to different foes. Supergiant Games said player feedback was used to “inspire” the changes brought forth in Tuesday’s patch. Boon updates, which give players increased abilities, will be included in the next patch, Supergiant Games said. The full patch notes are included at the bottom of this post, but let’s go over some of the biggest ones.</p>
<p id="qq43k0">Supergiant Games will allow players to encounter one more Olympian each night, just like in <em>Hades</em> — that means one additional boon. You’ll also be more likely to find another boon or reward in Erebus. Melinoë’s weapons, Nocturnal Arms and Daedalus Hammer, have been updated; for instance, Nocturnal Arms’ Argent Skull channels attacks faster and “hits a larger area,” according to the patch notes. The Daedelus Hammer had a ton of upgrades outright removed from the game, replaced with new stuff. One instance is the removal of Double Cataclysm, which has been replaced by Mirrored Thrasher, which lets all attacks hit twice (but you take more damage).</p>
<p id="9hgtWi">Beyond Chronos, several other bosses were tweaked, like Infernal Cerbeus, which got attack pattern changes. The Chaos Trials, which are basically challenge runs, also had their difficulty reduced.</p>

<h3 id="UUkRwt"><strong>General Gameplay</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li id="1839hU">You now can encounter up to one additional Olympian each night (as in the previous game)</li>
<li id="6VftLp">You now are likely to find one more Boon or other major reward while in Erebus</li>

<li id="UaSEnt">Toula should now stay closer to you in Encounters, especially in the Fields of Mourning</li>
<li id="5IsiYg">Nemesis no longer offers Death Defiance items if you do not need to refill the effect</li>

<li id="FeEnwR">Minor adjustments to the order in which Olympians may first appear early on</li>
<li id="sxAKht">Normalized chances of finding Fishing Points in various regions</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="8MCltH"><strong>Nocturnal Arms &amp; Abilities</strong></h3>

<li id="Wc1VjB">Argent Skull: Omega Attack channels faster and hits a larger area</li>

<h3 id="u2p8wW"><strong>Aspects of the Nocturnal Arms</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li id="E81GMa">Witch’s Staff (Circe): adjusted activation and duration of Serenity effect; Serenity now adds Omega bonus damage that scales with this Aspect’s rank</li>
<li id="vmBkiZ">Witch’s Staff (Momus): reworked; each of your Omega Moves automatically fires several times in succession from where you use them</li>
<li id="oObagX">Sister Blades (Artemis): you will Block again if the effect recharges while you are channeling; Block now takes priority over Dodge and similar effects</li>
<li id="KmRtn4">Umbral Flames (Eos): reworked; Omega Attack now fires a slow shot that occasionally creates damage blasts and also copies your Specials</li>
<li id="cz8Rqq">Moonstone Axe (Melinoë): reworked; now adds Power and Max Life</li>

<li id="tuqyZ1">Argent Skull (Persephone): you now earn Glory much faster, but only by using your Omega Cast; improved control responsiveness during Omega Special</li>

<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero might include split-screen multiplayer for up to 2 players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the latest revelation, Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero might just be the true Budokai Tenkaichi successor we have been waiting for. Discovered through the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10007902" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation Store</a> listing for the game, it has been found that 2 types of multiplayer experiences will be offered to players, online and offline. </p>



<p>Both multiplayer modes will allow up to 2 players. The offline mode might offer a split-screen option, similar to what we’ve seen in the previous titles. It is worth noting that this could be a mistake on their end, but we hope it’s not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero was revealed at The Game Awards 2023. The devs promised to provide players with an improvement on the iconic gameplay of the iconic Budokai Tenkaichi series while adding new characters and maps to the roster. Moreover, the game involved fast-paced battles, featuring the narrative and characters from the late Akira Toriyama’s iconic anime series. </p>



<p>From the already-released gameplay trailer, it has become clear that the combat mechanics, visuals and authenticity of Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero have greatly increased.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Since then, we have received a few trailers on the game, showcasing the diverse characters and unique movesets we can expect to see. Most recently, Bandai Namco released the Fused Warriors Trailer, which included characters like Gogeta, Vegito, Gotenks, Kefla and Fused Zamasu. Furthermore, a recent leak revealed the Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero might have an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-leak-teases-special-edition-pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultimate Edition</a>. with more details about pre-orders and release date arriving at Summer Game Fest 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How do you feel about Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero adding a split-screen mode? Let us know in the comments. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arco-is-a-minimalist-beautiful-pixel-art-tactics-game-set-in-the-american-frontier.890343/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/arco-is-a-minimalist-beautiful-pixel-art-tactics-game-set-in-the-american-frontier<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It's been a while since I've felt so captivated by such a minimalist game as Arco. A simple but effective revenge tale set against the backdrop of early colonial Mesoamerica, it presents its snappy combat and distinctive worldbuilding with an art style that almost looks like something out of the 8-bit era. Yet the sweeping landscapes are never lacking for detail. And the tale woven across them had me hooked from the start.</p><p>Nearly all media about the American frontier focuses on the settler experience, so it's refreshing to see that Arco presents a rich, thriving, and diverse Native world as the player's point-of-view, with European "Newcomers" representing a looming, somewhat enigmatic threat. Everything is slightly fantastical, with groups and nations that take inspiration from Mesoamerican and South American indigenous groups, but not too directly modeled after any one real-world society.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Arco Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>And the tapestry they form is treated with the same nuance and depth as the myriad pseudo historical fantasy settings we're used to based on other parts of the world. The hero of the first two chapters, Tizo, is from the Iyo tribe, who are nomadic nature-worshippers traversing green valleys that reminded me of Central California. The Onem are a monastic community with great monasteries built onto the side of a mountain, reminiscent of Andean societies. The mighty Kanek live in massive temple cities in the jungle, reflecting elements of Aztec, Maya, and Toltec cultures. These groups, collectively, are not treated as culturally monolithic, politically unified, or as one-note stereotypes, and fit together in fascinating ways.</p><h3>Vendetta</h3><p>In keeping with the tradition of Western storytelling, however, Arco is ultimately a tale of revenge. Tizo was kidnapped as a child by Newcomers and grew up on a Spanish mission. The first chapter is a brief episode from his early life, when the Newcomers were mostly a subject of rumor and superstition. The second picks up with him as an old man wandering the land, seeking justice for wrongs done to him and his people. It's fascinating to see how the setting evolves in this time as well, with many of the Native groups adopting more European-influenced ways of life, including one settlement even having their own windmill.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Rather than a cattleman's revolver, Tizo uses a traditional native bow, the titular "arco", with which he can quite capably best even gun-toting opponents. Arco's combat system is a turn-based hybrid, in which you plan out an action while paused, then watch it play out in real time over the course of a few seconds. Movement and positioning are key to success, and there's also an engaging action economy, where attacks and special abilities generally cost "magia", which can be refilled a little at a time by moving or much faster by standing still to take a breather.</p><h3>Let's Dance</h3><p>Tizo has to tangle with a troupe of fantastical wildlife inspired by the region, like giant insects and monitor lizards, as well as sometimes bandits and soldiers. He's joined at various points by allies like the mercenary Zoka and the Kanek prince Kaax, who add an additional element of tactical depth. They each have their own skill trees, too. While Zoka and Kaax specialize in one type of fighting each, Tizo's skill tree is fairly expansive, and you can choose to focus him more on ranged, melee, or movement-based abilities.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Tizo is also a haunted man, though. Literally. Certain choices you make throughout the story can increase your Guilt, which causes ghosts to spawn during combat who, unlike other enemies, can chase and attack you even when the action is paused and you're thinking about your next move. This was a little annoying at first. But aside from being a very literal manifestation of how Tizo can't escape from the regrets of his past, it also trained me to play Arco in a more free-flowing, fast-paced style, which ended up being more fun than agonizing over every move for a long time. It has a nice rhythm to it when you treat it more like an action game.</p><h3>Fantastical Frontier</h3><p>In addition to all the different combos and fighting styles that are possible using Tizo's array of skills, the encounters in Arco never get too stale, either. Many feature enemies with unique mechanics you need to learn, and environmental features that can really turn the tide of battle. I never felt like I was being thrown into samey trash fights just as an excuse to inject some action. From dodging sandworms in the cactus-decked drylands to exploring an ancient, abandoned temple under attack by treasure-hunters, Arco always seems conscious that variety is the spice of life when it comes to environment and encounter design.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I found I was often rewarded for exploring every little corner with hidden loot, memorable side quests like tracking down some poachers, or even a simple fishing minigame. The world isn't only richly imagined. It's also full of stuff to do.</p></div><p>There are lots of little touches, too. Each individual area is fairly small, but the world altogether is actually quite large. And I found I was often rewarded for exploring every little corner with hidden loot, memorable side quests like tracking down some poachers, or even a simple fishing minigame. The world isn't only richly imagined. It's also full of stuff to do.</p><p>I look forward to making my way through the remainder of Arco's stories, which focus on different characters, and learning Tizo's eventual fate along the way. This is one of those somewhat unassuming indie games that surprised me with the grandeur, imagination, and affection present in its storytelling, offering a totally new perspective on some classic elements of the Western genre. I already think it will be close to the front of my mind when I talk about the hidden gems of 2024. You'll be able to saddle up and give it a try yourself later this summer.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-90s-board-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The 90s was really the birthplace of the modern <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">board game</a> hobby. Yes, timeless artifacts such as Go, Mahjong, and even Cosmic Encounter pre-exist the post-Cold War decade, yet the groundswell of fresh titles with radical ideas really built the foundation for modern design principles. Germany was popping off with hits left and right, while the collectible card game format changed everything. Beyond the greats, there are several nearly forgotten releases that deserve recognition.</p><h3>TL;DR The Best '90s Board Games</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/yNZVw" target="_blank">Magic: The Gathering</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/OwYND" target="_blank">Twilight Imperium</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/pPl0o" target="_blank">Catan</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Nx0KE" target="_blank">Robo Rally</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Ow7jE" target="_blank">Modern Art</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/lnYed" target="_blank">Paths of Glory</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/mLP8y" target="_blank">For Sale</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/lOJ8R" target="_blank">Blood Bowl</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/kv8j3" target="_blank">Tichu</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/vw2AP" target="_blank">High Society</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/kvWN0" target="_blank">El Grande</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/6yr4Z" target="_blank">Ra</a></li></ul><h2>Magic: the Gathering</h2><div id="165420"><p><h3>Magic: The Gathering Arena Starter Kit</h3></p></div><p>Where else to start than with the game that started the collectable card craze and revolutionized games and game stores in the nineties? There was a time when almost every role-playing and board gaming club switched to playing Magic: the Gathering. And it’s easy to see why with the lure of finding powerful rare cards in hidden packs, planning a deck to construct around them and thrilling to the mix of random draw and strategic combinations during play. It’s a recipe that’s still almost as intoxicating today and the game remains in good health. With high prize money tournaments, online play, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/Km3pV" target="_blank">regular expansions</a> to collect there’s never been a better time to get involved.</p><h2>Twilight Imperium</h2><div id="158887"><p><h3>Twilight Imperium 4th Edition</h3></p></div><p>Many fans of Twilight Imperium would not even recognize its first edition. Fantasy Flight Games founder Christian Petersen brought his vision of a 4X board game to life way back in 1997. Flush with cardboard chits instead of plastic, the spirit of its later iterations was present in this inspired asymmetrical space conflict. Faction favorites such as the Jol-Nar and Emirates of Hacan were there right from the beginning, and the game was packed with an immense amount of setting. Its systems are slow and clunky by today’s standards, but this original release established a legacy that would prove the foundation for one of the strongest board game publishers of the early 2000s. The current fourth edition remains one of the most immersive and rich titles available.</p><h2>Catan</h2><div id="159921"><p><h3>Catan</h3></p></div><p>Catan, known in the ’90s as Settlers of Catan, didn’t sweep the popularity stakes like Magic. Nor has it aged quite as well. But in many respects, it had as much -- if not more -- long-term influence on the gaming scene. Before Catan, almost all tabletop games were variations on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">war board games</a> or dungeon crawling. But Catan’s mix of trading resources that players used to build a network of roads and settlements in an attempt to secure as much territory as possible showed us a whole new side to gaming. There was rich interaction without direct fighting or ganging up and rich <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy</a> while still rolling a pair of dice and drawing random cards. It also introduced us to the novel paradigm of board games that existed in Germany, and gaming has never been the same since. </p><h2>Robo Rally</h2><div id="196201"><p><h3>Robo Rally</h3></p></div><p>Richard Garfield is known for more than just Magic: The Gathering. Robo Rally has players programming bots to dart around the factory in a ludicrous race. Each participant secretly chooses which cards they will play simultaneously. Then they are revealed and the robots start zipping around as chaos ensues. The goal is to pass through all of the checkpoints in order, which can prove more difficult than it initially appears. While many games would later nick Robo Rally’s programmed action approach, this was one of the first designs to lean into this creative and zany system. It still holds up and even just received a brand new reboot courtesy of Renegade Games.  </p><h2>Modern Art</h2><div id="165421"><p><h3>Modern Art</h3></p></div><p>Among the top designers who worked in German gaming, the most talented and prolific is Reiner Knizia. His oeuvre is so large that he’s worked on almost every genre but his particular love is for auction games, and his best auction game is Modern Art. Players take the role of dealers bidding to secure artworks based on five different methods of auction, from open bids to hidden values. But there’s a catch: your purchases will only be valuable if they’re popular: in other words, if other players are also collecting paintings by the same artist. This heady mixture of strategy and pointed satire on the art world is leant extra depth in the latest edition, which uses pieces by real-life artists.</p><h2>Paths of Glory</h2><div id="196202"><p><h3>Paths of Glory</h3></p></div><p>This wargame arrived at the end of the decade with a splash. Boasting a harrowing playtime of up to eight hours, this beast attempts to simulate the entirety of the First World War. This is one of the early card driven games where players spend cards for flexible action points or to trigger specific narrative events. There is a fascinating element of deck manipulation as participants race to attain new cards, while also thinning their deck through playing events. This creates an interesting ecosystem of turnover that has subtle implications over the length of play. While some may criticize this design as being too complex, and there is a certain truth to the notion that Twilight Struggle later perfected this format, this is still quite the evocative experience that remains available through continual print runs over the years.   </p><h2>For Sale</h2><div id="165423"><p><h3>For Sale</h3></p></div><p>You’ll rarely see so much game in such a small package as you will in For Sale. The game involves two decks of cards, one of real estate and the other of cheques, which are used in the two phases of play. In the first a selection of real estate cards is revealed each turn and the players bid on them using a limited supply of money. In the second, a selection of cheques is revealed and players secretly choose real estate from their hands to sell for those cheques, the most valuable getting the biggest payout. This simple game is a setup for endless agonising moments of not knowing whether you're going to be outbid in an auction, or outclassed in the secret hunt for cheque payouts. It’s excitement all the way down to the wire, but is simple enough for kids to play and still rewards canny strategizing.</p><h2>Blood Bowl</h2><div id="165424"><p><h3>Blood Bowl</h3></p></div><p>Adding this game here is a bit cheeky: you may have fond memories of the first edition of this crazy game of violent fantasy football, but the current edition is a complete redesign. The good news is that it’s even better: leaner, better looking and more strategic while still being just as crazy and just as violent. The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warcry-heart-of-ghur-brings-big-changes-to-the-tabletop-game">Warhammer</a>-esque underpinnings have been jettisoned in favor of a whole new game concept where your turn ends when you fail an action. That leaves every choice teetering on the precipice of risk and reward as you struggle to decide whether it’s worth prioritizing a dangerous action to advance your game plan. Plus, the old cardboard standees have been replaced with super-detailed plastic miniatures that look amazing on your tabletop. </p><h2>Tichu</h2><div id="165426"><p><h3>Tichu</h3></p></div><p>If Tichu didn’t require exactly four to play, it would have conquered the world. It’s not much to look at, essentially a rebranded deck of standard playing cards with four special extras, but there’s a reason for that. It’s actually a tweaked, commercialized version of a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family</a> of playing card games widely played in China. You play with a partner and the idea is to try and clear your hand by laying out a higher-value Poker style card combo than is currently on the table. But this basic formula is full of fascinating wrinkles because it’s rarely clear when it’s worth splitting a combo in your hand just to take what’s on the table, especially given the partner element. There’s also a pivotal bidding aspect because calling “Tichu” -- betting you’ll be first to empty your hand -- is where the bulk of points are won. Accessible, engaging and scarily addictive, Tichu deserves a much wider audience.</p><h2>High Society</h2><div id="165427"><p><h3>High Society</h3></p></div><p>Given this is the second Reiner Knizia auction game on the list you may gather that the good doctor (he’s got a PhD in mathematics) is keen on the mechanic and good at delivering it. This is the lightest and fastest of the three (see one more below) but it still delivers thrills, spills and biting social commentary. Each round is a sequence of bids on some fancy item that indicates you’re part of monied culture. But while your cash reserves range from small to high value, you can’t get change: you’re forced to choose between creeping up your bid or risking being left with only high-value notes to fritter on paltry wins. The other twist is that some cards are negative; for these, bidding works in reverse, with the first player to pass “winning” and everyone else throwing away their cash. You’ve got to keep up with your social circle by spending vast sums on trifles without beggaring yourself, a point of view that’s as fun to play as it is alienating to observe in reality. </p><h2>El Grande</h2><div id="159923"><p><h3>El Grande</h3></p></div><p>Of all the games published in the ‘90s, El Grande is perhaps the most enduring and the one that still feels freshest and most relevant today. Which makes it surprising that it hasn’t seen a reprint and remains expensive on the second-hand market. The secret of its success is posing players with a series of circular, but interactive, conundrums to solve as they seek to maximise influence on a map of Spain. You can go early or gain more influence to spend, not both. You can take a powerful action, or you can put lots of influence on the board, not both. And of course you can’t possibly have the majority in all the regions of the board, you’ve got to pick and choose your battles. It’s so well done and pushes so many gaming buttons that it remains thrillingly playable 25 years after it was released.</p><h2>Ra</h2><div id="165422"><p><h3>Ra</h3></p></div><p>Now, we come to another Reiner Knizia classic involving auctions. In Ra, you’re bidding on the history of ancient Egypt. Not in terms of artefacts but the far more abstract concepts of events, monuments, pharaohs and the like. Each type of tile has its own convoluted scoring mechanic, so you want to collect -- or avoid -- certain combinations. On your turn, you either add a tile to the stack available or start an auction, but currency in Ra is very limited and the winning amount becomes part of the next lot for auction. This makes every tile draw and every bid an excruciating elevator of excitement as you try and force players to bid on tiles they’d prefer to avoid while not getting caught in that trap yourself. This is back in print with a deluxe new edition that is gorgeous to behold.</p><h2>Why Highlight Games from the 90s?</h2><p>Well a lot of adults nowadays grew up in the 90s, so there's a big nostalgia factor for the decade! But on a more serious and interesting note, the decade was a particularly important and fertile one for board game design. Before the 90s, board games were either solidly commercial offerings of dubious quality for families, or adjuncts to the role-playing and wargaming hobbies. The 90s was when they came of age as a hobby and a media niche in their own right. There were two key reasons for this. </p><p>The first was an influx of designs that were translated into English from Germany and bought onto the international markets. Germany has a long, strong tradition of game playing as a mainstream passtime and that, together with an aversion for the kind of conflict games that used to dominate elsewhere, had lead to the growth of mechanical concepts that were almost unheard of outside the country. The first such game to gain much traction was known in German as Adel Verpflichtet which doesn't have a direct translation and so appeared under several different titles, the best known of which was Hoity-Toity. It combined bluffing and set collection into a package that was both exciting and strategic. It's designer was one Klaus Teuber who would, of course, go on to give us the game that changed everything in this regard, Settlers of Catan, after which the floodgates opened.</p><p>The other arrival on the scene was Magic: the Gathering in 1993. Part of the reason for its success is that it was inspired by, and was a distillation of, some of the biggest and most innovative games of earlier years such as Wiz-War, Titan and, most importantly, Cosmic Encounter. But the really fresh idea that it bought to the table was to combine a strategic card game with collectible trading cards into something where you could build your own decks leveraging your own strategies from your own collections. That gave it an incredibly addictive quality that allowed it to sweep the hobby sector. By the mid-90s a lot of role-playing game clubs were spending a lot of time playing Magic instead!</p><p>These two major changes saw a huge upsurge in creativity in the board game design space that would rocket over the next ten years, leading to a slew of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-classic-board-games">all-time classic board games</a> in the mid-00s. But that's a whole other list.</p><p>For more, check out our picks for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-engine-building-board-games">best engine-building board games</a>, as well as our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/root-board-game-buyers-guide">Root buying guide</a>.

<p data-characters="276" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’re taking on <em>Fortnite</em>‘s Season 3 Weekly Quests, then you’ll know that the second set tasks you with healing in an Oasis Pool. If you don’t know where to find one, then never fear, as I’m here to help you with a map showing their locations.</p> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false">While it’s not the toughest challenge in Season 3’s Week Two Quests—that honor goes to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/where-to-get-mythic-nitro-cars-in-fortnite-season-3-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">driving the Mythic Nitro Cars</a>—this still isn’t super straightforward, especially if you don’t know where the Oasis Pools are. Jumping in any old water you see isn’t going to cut it, so you need to be certain that you know where you’re going. </p> <h2 id="h-every-oasis-pool-on-the-fortnite-map" data-injectable="false">Every Oasis Pool on the <em>Fortnite</em> map</h2> <p data-characters="98" data-current-count="467" data-injectable="true">There are five Oasis Pools in <em>Fortnite</em>, all found in the wasteland biome in the south of the map. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>They’re all in the bottom half of the island. Image via Epic Games, Remix via Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="188" data-current-count="488" data-injectable="true">You’ll know that you’ve found an Oasis Pool as the water is a much brighter blue than normal rivers and lakes, letting you know that it’s got special healing properties. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">What do Oasis Pools do?</h2> <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="258" data-injectable="false">Oasis Pools will heal you when you’ve taken damage and will fill your health bar all the way up, which is very useful. If you’re already at full health, they will then start boosting your Shields too, giving you extra protection against enemies. </p> <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="620" data-injectable="false">As an added bonus, there is usually ground loot and Chests around Oasis Pools too, which makes them an attractive place to land early-game, or a good option to rotate to later in the game. It’s not the first time that an Oasis Pool has saved me after a gunfight against a sharp opponent, so keep them in mind even when you complete the Week Two challenge. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodstained-ritual-of-night-classic-2-dlc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>ArtPlay and 505 Games have announced the release date for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night&nbsp;</em>Classic 2 DLC, and it's just around the corner.</p>

<p>Classic II: Dominique's Curse, to give it its full title, launches on June 11th. It follows on from the game's first Classic mode, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodstained-classic-mode-release-date-set-for-next-week">released back in January 2021</a>.</p>

<p>The new DLC picks up where the main story of&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night&nbsp;</em>left off. You play as Dominique, who finds herself in Limbo after the events of the original game. She must acquire the power of the demon Bael for herself and attempt to escape.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night-classic-2-dlc-dialogue.jpg?itok=KTWxBDAf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night-classic-2-dlc-dialogue.jpg?itok=go47HM0j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</em>'s second Classic mode follows Dominique on her journey through Limbo.</figcaption></figure><p>This mode will feature the same retro-inspired gameplay as the original Classic mode, which was in turn inspired by the original&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>games (although not quite to the same degree as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodstained-curse-of-moon-2-brings-back-castlevania-nostalgia">the&nbsp;<em>Curse of the Moon&nbsp;</em>spinoffs</a>).</p>

<p>It'll offer a huge new map to explore, as well as new abilities and artifacts to acquire, all of which will boost Dominique's power.</p>

<p>As you play, you'll encounter friendly demons who will give you hints, but beware: when night falls, those demons will become your enemies, and you'll have to vanquish them to proceed. If you're a fan of&nbsp;<em>Castlevania 2: Simon's Quest</em>, then it sounds like you'll get a kick out of this new mode.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night-classic-2-dlc-map.jpg?itok=2D-BpW4D 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloodstained-ritual-of-the-night-classic-2-dlc-map.jpg?itok=fV0TQjDf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ritual of the Night</em>'s Classic 2 map is "massive", according to ArtPlay and 505.</figcaption></figure><p>If you haven't played&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night&nbsp;</em>yet, it's a 2.5D Metroidvania masterminded by&nbsp;<em>Castlevania</em>&nbsp;legend Koji Igarashi, and it's heavily inspired by that series, to say the least.</p>

<p>It features a huge, non-linear map to explore, plus a mechanic by which you can absorb the souls of defeated enemies, giving you new abilities in battle. Throw in a soundtrack that boasts the involvement of&nbsp;<em>Castlevania</em>'s Michiru Yamane and you've got a game&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>enthusiasts should be very excited about.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night&nbsp;</em>right now on PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-file-size/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-file-size/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The file sizes for the next <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/">Elden Ring</a> patch and the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion were revealed today after being added to the PlayStation Database.</p>
<p>As reported on X/Twitter by PlayStation Game Size, the <a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize/status/1798322189818876215" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.012 patch</a>, which will introduce support to the highlight anticipated expansion, will bring the total file size to a little over 54 GB, around 3 GB more than the current version's size of around 51 GB. The<a href="https://x.com/PlaystationSize/status/1798320557706076525" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Shadow of the Erdtree</a> expansion will obviously weigh more, as it will be over 16 GB big. The total file sizes will be different depending on the platform, but this gives a rough idea of how much free storage space will be needed on PC and consoles to install the new patch and the expansion. That extra 3 GB getting added to the total file size of the base game may also suggest that something new could be coming to Elden Ring besides the expansion later this month.</p>
<p>It has been over two years since FromSoftware launched its latest game to critical and commercial acclaim, but soon enough, Tarnished will be able to experience more of the Elden Ring's brutal world with the aforementioned Shadow of the Erdtree expansion. You can learn more about the massive DLC launching on June 21st on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-hands-on-preview-the-erdtrees-light-casts-the-longest-shadow/">preview.</a></p>
<p><em>Two hours was only enough time to get a brief taste of the smörgåsbord of new content Miyazaki and his team had been cooking up. However, it was just enough to get a proper feel for the trials and tribulations against a variety of bosses, explore a new legacy dungeon, and walk away with more questions than answers about Miquella’s true role in the upcoming Shadow of the Erdtree DLC. Besting a giant floating Chinese lion dance that constantly shifted its elemental affinity around rewarded me with a pretty sweet lion helm to wear around the Shadowlands, so that was a nice bonus.</em></p>

Sure, there are still plenty of problems, and plenty of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23935633">people who want to threaten the galaxy</a>, but without the Sith to occupy them, the Jedi can be on top of these other dangers in a way they couldn’t during <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/13/20959862/star-wars-watch-order-disney-plus-movies-shows-chronological-skywalker-saga">the Skywalker Saga</a> or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23845775/star-wars-old-republic-hella-tight">the Old Republic</a>. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23672528/star-wars-movies-tv-schedule-calendar-upcoming"><em>Star Wars: The Acolyte</em></a> gives us a glimpse of the Jedi as galactic peacekeepers, but it also shows us a darker side of the Jedi, and a hint that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23673259/star-wars-high-republic-explained">their High Republic incarnation</a> could be more like the Sith than they’d like to admit — particularly when it comes to their use of the Force. </p>
<p id="cxgSCY">[<strong>Ed. note:</strong> This post contains spoilers for the first two episodes of <em>Star Wars: The Acolyte</em>.]</p>
<p id="PvOIgA">Anyone who has spent time thinking about the Jedi, especially as they are in the prequel trilogy, will essentially understand them as the Star Wars galaxy’s police force. Ostensibly agents of the peace, they’re sent into difficult situations with the purpose of de-escalating them, but somehow — sometimes through their fault and sometimes not — the situation escalates to violence anyway. The Jedi must then, in spite of showy faux-monastic protestation, violently end the conflict, usually with the death of one or a few sentient beings. </p>

<p id="DQeQqr">Despite all this, the Jedi are generally (and not without reason) seen as the good guys in the Star Wars universe, thanks in part to their counterpart the Sith. The exact lines between the two factions have always been murky, but among the most important concerns their use of the Force. The Jedi use it to push and pull their foes, but there are clear delineations between what they deem good and bad. Using the Force to choke someone, turning it into lightning, reading someone’s mind, or holding their body in Force-induced paralysis are all seemingly frowned upon in almost every era of Star Wars. </p>
<p id="FEL9so">But <em>The Acolyte</em>’s first two episodes suggest that this might not be true in the High Republic. Late in the second episode, Jedi Master Sol (Lee Jung-jae) ends a fight with Mae (Amandla Stenberg), the show’s titular acolyte and the assassin who’s been hunting down Jedi, by freezing her body in the air, rendering her completely unable to move. Then he reads her mind. </p>
<p id="ATcwAf">The show doesn’t treat the moment with much regard, but to a longtime Star Wars viewer it’s an unambiguous change in the Jedi’s usual code of conduct. In fact, the most memorable time we’ve seen Force mindreading in live-action, the character to use it was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/2020/1/5/21050442/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-ending-kylo-ren-prequels-anakin">Kylo Ren</a>, not exactly a beacon of ethical Force use. In some ways this makes sense. </p>

<p id="nsVhki">With no Sith to compare themselves against, it seems reasonable that the Jedi’s actions would slip closer to their counterparts’. There’s no similar-but-bad group running counter to them, and the Jedi essentially have free rein over how the Force is defined. In the High Republic, it seems that means mind-control by way of Force stasis is a tool of the good guys. Or at least a tool of those that see themselves as the good guys — not entirely unlike Obi-wan Kenobi’s gray-area mind trick in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/13/20959862/star-wars-watch-order-disney-plus-movies-shows-chronological-skywalker-saga"><em>A New Hope</em></a>. </p>
<p id="VjNSBA">While <em>The Acolyte</em> is only just getting started, it certainly seems like it’s going to be a show about the faults of the Jedi, both in the High Republic era and beyond. After its first two episodes, the show is still playing most of its cards close to its chest with regard to what exactly happened to Mae and what the Jedi’s role in it was. But we certainly see that at least one Jedi is carrying so much guilt that he hasn’t spoken or done anything but meditate in years. If the rest of the show really is about the failings of at least some of the High Republic’s Jedi, then showing the ease with which they use the same tactics as the Dark Side of the Force, while still claiming to be working for good, would certainly be a compelling way to demonstrate that. </p>

<p id="D631rM">Of course, all of this involves a lot of “if”s, particularly for a Star Wars project. Star Wars’ live-action track record on meaningful themes isn’t so good, particularly of late. Ever since the prequels’ suggestion that the Jedi’s strict ban on emotions could push people toward evil rather than prevent it got reduced to a bizarre series of misunderstandings that pushed Anakin to the Dark Side, Star Wars has frequently been enamored with bringing up big ideas and important themes, only to drop them when things get complicated. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/22929592/book-of-boba-fett-hero-vs-villain"><em>Book of Boba Fett</em></a> took a character with the potential to explore themes like regret in the face of aiding fascism and turned him into a mayor instead. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23896100/star-wars-ahsoka-season-2-release-date-cast-news"><em>Ahsoka</em></a><em> </em>flirted with giving Ezra a non-violent appreciation of the Force after his accidental exile, then <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23903596/ahsoka-season-1-review">abandoned that without a second thought</a>. The sequel trilogy is perhaps the best example of this, with each movie gesturing toward something important before the next movie dropped it entirely. Only <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23473565/andor-season-1-review"><em>Andor</em></a><em> </em>has actually managed to find a voice and say something truly compelling, and those are awfully big shoes to fill. </p>
<p id="emdQma">Nonetheless, this is the position that <em>The Acolyte</em> has put itself in. And whether it succeeds or not, showing us an otherwise noble and upstanding (so far) Jedi who also happens to use the Force to torture someone is a pretty compelling starting point for the misdeeds of the Star Wars galaxy’s most powerful cult.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1798367846449430889?s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X from Geoff Keighley, the world premiere gameplay trailer for Slitterhead will debut during Summer Game Fest 2024.</p>



<p>Slitterhead is the upcoming game from Keiichiro Toyama and Bokeh Game Studio. Toyama has been an industry giant for decades, and fans widely recognize them for creating Silent Hill.</p>



<p>Bokeh Game Studio first announced Slitterhead during The Game Awards 2021, with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyUGYL9aSww" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very brief teaser trailer</a>. </p>



<p>There have been very few notable updates since then, aside from a dev diary featuring some pre-alpha user tests. The devs posted that video in July 2023, showing more horror and potential combat mechanics.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The previous Slitterhead trailer featured tiny glimpses of gameplay, but it was mostly cinematic. It kept an aura of mystery and suspense throughout. </p>



<p>In fact, there wasn’t even a trailer description with minor details, which sometimes accompany big reveals. However, the teaser did mention that Slitterhead will include music from Akira Yamaoka.</p>



<p>At this time, Keiichiro Toyama and Bokeh Game Studio have not confirmed a release window or date for Slitterhead. Summer Game Fest would be an excellent opportunity to confirm a release window, if not a concrete date.</p>



<p>Slitterhead joins many other anticipated titles at Summer Game Fest 2024, which will include at least <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/summer-game-fest-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2 hours of game showcases</a>. The event begins on June 7, 2024, at 5 pm EST / 10 pm GMT.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Hidden Side Of Octopath Traveler's Combat</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">It's important to take the news with a grain of salt, as Octopath developer Square Enix hasn't yet announced the release of Octopath Traveler for PlayStation consoles the way it announced the Xbox release last September. But the fact that it has been rated at all is likely indicative that the PlayStation release is indeed happening.</p><p dir="ltr">Giving PlayStation users access to the sequel without giving them access to the original game doesn't make a whole lot of sense, so despite the lack of any official announcement from Square Enix, the fact that the game has now been rated for PlayStation in Taiwan certainly gives fans of the franchise (and those who have been looking forward to playing it) a reason to celebrate. That being said, the second game is not a direct sequel to Octopath Traveler, so you don't need to play the first game in order to enjoy it</p><p>Although Square Enix did announce Octopath Traveler II's arrival on Xbox consoles, it has yet to announce exactly when that arrival will happen, but according to a report from <a href="https://exputer.com/news/xbox/octopath-traveler-2-xbox-release-june/" rel="nofollow ">Exputer</a>, it's likely to be sometime this month. It's possible that the PlayStation versions of the original Octopath Traveler could become available around the same time, since the Xbox versions of the sequel were rated by the Taiwanese committee alongside the PlayStation versions of the original game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/the-acolyte-can-star-wars-fans-expect-any-big-cameos/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-acolyte-can-star-wars-fans-expect-any-big-cameos<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="109" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>Star Wars</em> galaxy continues to expand on the small screen, specifically on the Disney+ streaming service. </p> <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="330" data-injectable="false">Following up such titles as <em>The Mandalorian</em>, <em>Star Wars: The Bad Batch</em>, and <em>Star Wars: Visions </em>comes <em>Star Wars: The Acolyte</em> from showrunner Leslye Headland. Based on promotional material for the series so far, it’s safe to say that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-acolyte-how-the-series-was-inspired-by-star-wars-games/">the <em>Star Wars</em> RPG-inspired program</a> is quite a departure from most recent franchise endeavors.</p> <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="733" data-injectable="true">Set long before the events of <em>Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace</em>, <em>The Acolyte</em> sees a period of relative peace interrupted in the worst way. Mysterious forces are conspiring against the Jedi, killing those within its ranks. Thus, it’s up to a few brave members of the Jedi Order to figure out who is responsible for these heinous acts and put a stop to them before it’s too late.</p>
 <p data-characters="494" data-current-count="494" data-injectable="true"><em>The Acolyte</em> puts a host of new characters front and center for this mystery, from Jecki Lon (Dafne Keen) to Master Sol (Lee Jung-jae). However, it’s no secret that <em>Star Wars </em>loves nothing more than tossing viewers cameos of their favorite legacy heroes and villains. In fact, it has come to light that a staple of the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/star-wars-how-to-read-the-high-republic-era-in-order/">Star Wars: The High Republic</a></em> multimedia initiative, Vernestra Rwoh (Rebecca Henderson), will appear on the program. Can fans expect more preexisting characters to appear?</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Lucasfilm</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="456" data-current-count="756" data-injectable="true">Though it takes place far ahead of the Skywalker saga, one might think that characters with long lifespans like Yoda (Frank Oz), Yaddle (Bryce Dallas Howard), and potentially Plo Koon (James Arnold Taylor) could appear on <em>The Acolyte</em>. In reality, however, this isn’t the case. Headland herself revealed to <a href="https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/the-acolyte-creator-major-star-wars-cameos-yoda/">ComicBook.com</a> that cameos from such characters, specifically Yoda, who has appeared in <em>High Republic</em> stories already, aren’t on the table.</p>
 <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="428" data-injectable="true">With that said Headland did mention that she and the <em>Acolyte</em> team pulled from existing <em>Star Wars</em> material to fill out the show’s roster. “We are pulling characters from the <em>High Republic </em>and characters from the EU, but that’s it,” she said. So, one has to wonder which other <em>High Republic</em>-era characters besides Rwoh could pop up, and, more intriguingly, who from the Expanded Universe could do the same.</p>
 <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="368" data-injectable="false">This time period could allow for Emperor Palpatine’s (Ian McDiarmid) Sith Master, Darth Plagueis, or even his master, Darth Tenebrous, to appear. After all, <em>The Acolyte</em> is about the sudden and violent reemergence of the Sith to the galactic forefront, so if there were ever a production for them to make their live-action introductions, this seems to be the one.</p> <p data-characters="214" data-current-count="582" data-injectable="false">Time will tell which <em>High Republic</em> and Expanded Universe names could be on the table as <em>The Acolyte</em> unfolds across its eight-episode debut season. For those curious, here’s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/star-wars-the-acolyte-release-schedule/">the series’ release schedule</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gta-online-summer-update-info<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rockstar has released new information about the upcoming&nbsp;<em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>summer update, which will let you engage in your very own brand of vigilante justice.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/1774797o5ka358/coming-this-summer-a-new-brand-of-vigilante-justice" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new blog post</a>, Rockstar says the update, which doesn't have a release date yet, will allow you to start up and run "your very own bail enforcement and bounty hunting business" in order to "clean up the roving reprobates of Southern San Andreas".</p>

<p>Even if you're not interested in dispensing the San Andreas version of frontier justice, though, there's still plenty for you to look forward to in this summer's&nbsp;<em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>update.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gta-online-summer-update-2024-cars.jpg?itok=jVKMj2HE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gta-online-summer-update-2024-cars.jpg?itok=xt2Gf_Wz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lots of new goodies are coming your way in this summer's&nbsp;<em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>update.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll get the chance to help Vincent with a "range of off-the-books enforcement activities", for instance, and if you're into racing, you can also look forward to new cars to collect.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of using&nbsp;<em>GTA Online</em>'s Creator feature, then you'll be pleased to know that this summer's update is bringing the opportunity to create custom Drag and Drift Race circuits. More units will be added across all tracks too, including crowd animations and "bouncing lowriders". Nice.</p>

<p>Testing races should also be easier, since you'll be able to test your races from any checkpoint you choose. In short, if you like creating&nbsp;<em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>races, you should be looking forward to this update.</p>

<p>A number of smaller updates and tweaks are on the way too, including a boosted Sell Mission timer, buffs to the Sparrow and Bombushka aircraft, and more. We'll likely get more info as we get closer to the release date, whenever that happens to be.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gta-online-summer-update-2024-new-car.jpg?itok=Pm2hsOvw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gta-online-summer-update-2024-new-car.jpg?itok=ZplG5ra5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Seriously, the new&nbsp;<em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>update really hopes you love cars.</figcaption></figure><p>More info is coming soon, so make sure to keep an eye out on Rockstar's socials and other channels if you want to learn more about this summer's&nbsp;<em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>update.</p>

<p><em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>may still be going strong, but its days in the sun may be numbered, at least in its current form. Rockstar is currently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025">hard at work on&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em></a>, the next mainline installment in the&nbsp;<em>GTA&nbsp;</em>series, and it's not clear how that new game will affect&nbsp;<em>GTA Online&nbsp;</em>yet.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more news on all things&nbsp;<em>GTA Online</em>, as well as all things Rockstar in general.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/enshrouded-releases-melodies-of-the-mire-update-adding-musical-instruments-for-fireside-jamming-sessions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>The team at Keen Games has released its second update for Enshrouded, known as Melodies of the Mire.</p>
<p>As you may have surmised from the name, this rather chunky update introduces musical instruments into the game, including lutes, harps, drums, and flutes. Players will be able to learn how to craft instruments from a new NPC, Valory of the Silverstrings. More instruments will be added further down the line.</p>
<p>In addition to this musical side of things, Melodies of the Mire also introduces a new area to Enshrouded: The Blackmire. This can be found in the north of the Revelwoods, with the developer stating things here are "a little bit bigger". This area holds a number of new quests, enemies, items and so forth for players to discover, as well as new floral pads which can be used as a kind of natural trampoline. You can take a little peek at The Blackmire in the trailer below.</p>

<p>Enshrouded players will also be able to get their hands on the game's first dual-wield weapon. These daggers, Keen said, are ideal for the Ranger class, adding it has also made improvements to the game's combat more generally.</p>

<p>Eurogamer contributor Emma Kent <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/for-a-survival-game-enshrouded-feels-too-safe">took a look at Enshrouded</a> earlier this year, calling it an "ambitious project in terms of scope, made all the more impressive by the fact it's still only in early access". While at the time she felt there was room for improvement, this is something today's update will perhaps address.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sorry-were-closed">Sorry We're Closed</a>, an axe-murdering entrepreneur called Jenny is described in newspaper clippings as both a serial embezzler and as the city's "wealthiest bachelorette". Aside from being a dry reflection of tabloid reporting on women who commit crimes (bad woman! sexy, bad woman!) this is also the kind of incidental character-building you can expect in this perky, retro-styled survival horror. It plays like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill">Silent Hill</a> charged with the hot pink body horror of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/porpentine">Porpentine</a> interactive fiction. And judging by my hour of unsettled strolling through the decrepit tube station of the game's demo, it's a powerful combo.</p>

<p>You play a moping break-up victim called Michelle in her "final days" as she becomes cursed with a third eye. Soon enough she is stumbling through grotty corridors and taking panicked potshots at twisted monsters that simply will not die. It's all given that late-90s Resident Evil look with cameras both fixed and following. By the time you encounter Jenny, she has already killed a man, ripped the paper money from his pockets, and shoved them into her mouth, yelling "MAXIMISE PROFITS!" She's a real catch.</p>

<p>I'm not the first of us to crawl through the demo, of course. "Its layers of London are like Silent Hill by way of Persona and Paradise Killer," said Alice O (RPS in peace) when she added it to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-75-most-anticipated-pc-games-of-2024">our 75 most anticipated games of 2024</a> list. She was not wrong. </p>
<p>It gets the feel of those old games spot on. What's more, it's adept at survival horror's old habit of understatement (aka. the <a href="https://i.redd.it/lze4f0atwue21.jpg">"doghouse"</a> effect). In one room, a portrait of a terrifying woman looms over you, her white eyes and noseless face staring into your soul. "She is well-dressed," says the game. In another room, you find the twisted corpses of some otherworldly creatures hanging from the walls, perhaps they are even humans, mutilated beyond recognition. "This display has a strong smell," it says.</p>
<p>I love this. The detached narrator voice that accompanies environmental moments in old horror games, aside from being incredibly comical, suggests a kind of mental shutdown. As if part of the game itself remains in denial. As if the puppet masters of this world, perhaps even the player themselves, are detached and unmoved by the terror that assails Heather Mason or Jill Valentine. You never find a pile of severed heads and bloodied torsos. You find <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fwkr8x1fir5g41.jpg%3Fauto%3Dwebp%26s%3D1e29729b831d1808d4c1b0e53c2f234f85b5e6c9">"nothing unusual here"</a>.</p>
<p>But I've focused on perhaps the wrong thing. When you play, you'll be too busy using our hero's third eye to change the environment immediately around your character. This is partly cosmetic; viscera-coated cages turn into simple vending machines as you pass by. A huge rusty safe, under the lamplight of your third eye, becomes a pile of ordinary luggage. </p>

<p>It also has a practical effect. Thorny obstructions in the grimey world are reduced to spindly stalks you can pass through freely. Bathroom sinks that dispense filthy water in the disgust-dimension will spurt out clean water under the influence of the third eye's aura, restoring your health. Enemies meanwhile, will be briefly stunned when you click your fingers to activate the eye, and a weak point gets revealed when they step into the aura. Prime shootin'. So long as you remember that anything outside the aura cannot be struck.</p>
<p>There was a period in which old games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-3">Silent Hill 3</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/legacy-kain-soul-reaver">Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver</a> were obsessed with the idea of two parallel dimensions existing within the same space. But the technical solutions applied to that idea always meant it felt like you were merely stepping from one space into another. Sorry We're Closed chases the same dimension-hopping dream as those old designers but applies the modern approach that allows you to see the difference between realms in real time. </p>
<p>This may not seem significant to many players in the post-Portal, post-Titanfall 2 world we live in today, but if the creators at Team Silent in 2003 could be shown the third eye effects of Sorry We're Closed (and, come to think of it, Bloober Team's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-medium">The Medium</a>), their noughties eyeballs probably would have popped out of their sockets and rolled into a fetid drain. As a developer that must be worth some pride, to know that you've got a tool in your rusty toolbox that the horror heroes of yesteryear would have loved to use, if only they'd had the chance.</p>
