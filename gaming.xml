            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-starfy-gba<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has released the first three three&nbsp;<em>Densetsu no Starfy&nbsp;</em>games (known as&nbsp;<em>The Legendary Starfy&nbsp;</em>outside of Japan) in the West for the first time via its Nintendo Switch Online service.</p>
<p>The three Game Boy Advance platformers were originally released in Japan in 2002, 2003, and 2004 respectively, and this release marks the first time they've been available outside of Japan.</p>
<p>It's worth noting, however, that although these games are now available to Western gamers, they haven't been translated, so you'll only be able to play them in Japanese.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-starfy-japan-only-text.jpg?itok=84GJy3gY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-online-starfy-japan-only-text.jpg?itok=7gQbNt90 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I hope you've got a decent grasp of Japanese if you're planning to play&nbsp;<em>Densetsu no Starfy</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Starfy&nbsp;</em>games are side-scrolling platformers, but they're perhaps a little more text-heavy than other games in the genre might be, and they feature dialogue with instructions for the player as well, so a basic grasp of Japanese might be needed to fully enjoy them.</p>
<p>However, if you're willing to work on visual context clues and a little bit of guesswork, then you'll probably be able to get through these three platformers just fine, and their adorable protagonist should hopefully carry you through some of the more frustrating parts.</p>
<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Densetsu no Starfy&nbsp;</em>on Nintendo Switch Online right here.</p>

<p><em>Densetsu no Starfy&nbsp;</em>joins a range of other Game Boy Advance games available on Nintendo Switch Online, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/golden-sun-nintendo-switch-online">the&nbsp;<em>Golden Sun&nbsp;</em>games</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kirby-nintendo-switch-online"><em>Kirby &amp; the Amazing Mirror</em></a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-online-gba-mario"><em>Mario Advance&nbsp;</em>lineup</a>, plus more.</p>
<p>It's also not the first game entirely in Japanese to hit the Western Switch Online service; other games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-september-update"><em>Downtown Nekketsu March: Super Awesome Field Day!&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-september-update">Kirby's Star Stacker</a>&nbsp;</em>are also only available in their original language.</p>
<p>You can grab a Nintendo Switch Online subscription via your console's eShop. If you want to enjoy Switch Online's Game Boy Advance library, you're also going to need an Expansion Pack addon, which costs extra but which also adds DLC for games like&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&nbsp;</em>and <i>Splatoon 2</i>.</p>

<p>"Mere words would be empty without a meaningful act though – we had previously stated that a portion of 11 Bit Studios revenue generated from Indika will be donated to aid children affected by the war in Ukraine, we knew the time to act was now.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-olympic-esports-games-saudi-arabia/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/breaking-12-year-deal-signed-to-bring-first-olympic-esports-games-to-saudi-arabia.925638/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-olympic-esports-games-saudi-arabia/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It has just been announced that Saudi Arabia will become the proving ground for the inaugural Olympic Esports Games in 2025. This landmark revelation comes off the back of a 12-year deal signed between the IOC and the Saudi Esports Federation. Presently, the Esports World Cup is taking place in Riyadh, but the Olympic Esports Games will be something else entirely.</p>



<p>This is the result of a collaboration between Thomas Bach, the President of the IOC, and HRH Prince Abdulaziz, Minister of Sport in Saudi Arabia.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-making-history">Making History</h2>



<p>The IOC has long toyed with the idea of introducing esports to the Olympic Games, but why do that when you can just create an entirely new event focused on the unique, digital industry?</p>



<p>In a statement on LinkedIn, Ralf Reichert, the CEO of the Esports World Cup Foundation, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>National teams and pride are still underdeveloped in esports but I am certain this will change over time. This is a big step for the sport, not so much for the short-term impact but the long-term prospect.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This huge deal will see the first-ever Olympic Esports Games play out in Saudi Arabia next year. Speaking on the partnership, the IOC’s Thomas Bach touched on some key concerns about the setting: <em>“By partnering with the Saudi NOC we have also ensured that the Olympic values are respected, in particular, with regard to the game titles on the programme, the promotion of gender equality and engagement with the young audience, which is embracing esports.”</em></p>



<p>It hasn’t been established how often the Olympic Esports Games will be held, but if it aligns with the traditional Olympic Games, it’ll be once every four years. The <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-announces-olympic-esports-games-to-be-hosted-in-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">full press release</a> is available on the Olympics’ website.</p>

<p><em>Having been </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/romance-of-three-kingdoms-8-remake-delayed-to-improve-quality">delayed back in December</a><em>, Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8&nbsp;</em>is officially set to launch across PC, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch on October 24th, when you'll be able to pick it up digitally via these platforms' respective storefronts (it'll be on Steam for PC players).</p>
<p>This reimagining of&nbsp;<em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8&nbsp;</em>will be based on the original game's&nbsp;<em>Power Up Kit&nbsp;</em>version, so you can expect the same features offered by that enhanced edition, including the All Officers Play and All Periods Scenarios options.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-8-remake-release-date-strategic-window.jpg?itok=CrX-Fkbj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-8-remake-release-date-strategic-window.jpg?itok=suGckIhp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you love&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors&nbsp;</em>but wish it was a bit more cerebral,&nbsp;<em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake&nbsp;</em>is for you.</figcaption></figure><p>You can also look forward to the addition of Traits, abilities possessed by officers with "exceptional achievements or memorable anecdotes in history".</p>
<p>Legendary Wei general Cao Cao, for instance, can act twice during the council stage, while the iconic hero Liu Bei can meet with officers "without fail". Various other generals will likely have exciting traits for you to discover as well.</p>
<p>Lots of other changes have been implemented, too, including the ability to view relationships quickly and easily as they build up via the new Relationship Chart, as well as the addition of Tales, a new way by which officers can initiate major historical events and anecdotes within the game.</p>
<p>You can check out the new release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake</em>, which features some lovely-looking art courtesy of illustratior Keiji Hida, right here.</p>

<p><em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8&nbsp;</em>is a strategy game set during the warring Three Kingdoms period of ancient Chinese history.</p>
<p>The game allows you to manage your very own kingdom as one of a number of officers from the period, and if you're a&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors&nbsp;</em>fan, you'll likely recognize famous faces like the aforementioned Cao Cao and Liu Bei, as well as Lu Bu, Zhang Fei, and more.</p>
<p>You'll be able to get your hands on&nbsp;<em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake&nbsp;</em>when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2288150/ROMANCE_OF_THE_THREE_KINGDOMS_8_REMAKE/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch on October 24th.</p>

            <p>Red Barrels has a new villain, map, trials, and rig for players brave enough to re-enrol in The Outlast Trials.</p>
<p>As part of the first major update to the chaotic cooperative horror since it released in full earlier this year, new enemy Franco "II Bambino" Barbi is "the perverse son of New Orleans mafia don Salvatore Barbi, driven by craven entitlement, greed, and psychosexual violence fueled by his impotence and insecurities" (yikes) and "a freakish big baby obsessed with his Pacifier".</p>

<p>To mark Barbi's arrival, the Bambino Special Event will run for the first four weeks following the update. You'll find Franco Barbi pop up in certain Trials and MK-Challenges, alongside Mother Gooseberry or Sergeant Coyle, and in Trials and MK-Challenges set in The Docks map.</p>
<p>Talking of which: new map The Docks – which is Franco's drug manufacturing domain – is also on the way. It features deadly puzzles during which you'll come face-to-face with Franco in a new trial, Poison the Medicine.</p>
<p>There's also a new game mode, too. Escalation Therapy is a rogue-lite mode which pits players "against a never-ending series of randomised Trials with variators until they succumb to a Permadeath or begin anew". Reagents spawn with nothing, and will have to build their loadouts as they unlock upgrades along the way.</p>
<p>The Barricade is a new rig you can use to, unsurprisingly, create barricades, blocking pathways to give you the chance to get an objective completed or make your escape.</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, there's a new maddening-sounding lobby mini-game, Stroop Effect Test, which asks you to correctly select the colour of a word when the word it spells out is in a different colour.</p>
<p>The new content will drop next week on PC, PS5, and Xbox on 16th July, 2024.</p>
<p>Red Barrels says "Project Lupara" is simply the first of a number of upcoming major updates for the "growing live service game, which has sold over 2 million copies to date".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outlast-trials-outlines-post-launch-plans-with-this-intriguing-qa-session">Red Barrels recently opened up about what's next for its deliciously gory cooperative horror, The Outlast Trials</a>.</p>
<p>In a Q&amp;A posted to YouTube, director Alex Charbonneau and community manager Rosie Sarno explore how the game has changed between its early access release in May 2023 and the 1.0 update, which rolled out earlier this year, as well as field questions from the Outlast community.</p>
<p>"The Outlast Trials is excessive and frantically enjoyable - but can occasionally tip over into frustration more than fear," I wrote when I reviewed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-outlast-trials-review-a-unique-obscene-spin-on-the-horror-staple">The Outlast Trials</a> back when it was released in early access last year, awarding it three out of five stars.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dungeonborne-release-date-revealed-for-next-week.925596/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeonborne-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mithril Interactive has announced the&nbsp;<em>Dungeonborne&nbsp;</em>release date, and if you've been excited to get your hands on the PvPvE dungeon-crawling action RPG, you won't have much longer to wait.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2448970/view/4228398800952553301" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement on Steam</a>,&nbsp;<em>Dungeonborne&nbsp;</em>will launch in Early Access on July 18th, so you've got less than a week to wait before you can check it out, assuming you haven't been taking part in the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeonborne-playtest-early-access">pre-release playtests</a>.</p>
<p>If you have been taking part in those tests, however, your progress has been wiped, so you'll be starting off with a clean slate when next week rolls around, which is probably better for everyone.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeonborne-release-date-spell.jpg?itok=9O36Io2f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeonborne-release-date-spell.jpg?itok=74hVE3K_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dungeonborne&nbsp;</em>brings its dungeon-delving RPG action to Steam Early Access next week.</figcaption></figure><p>Mithril says it will be "cooking hard" over the next week or so in order to ensure that&nbsp;<em>Dungeonborne</em>'s launch is smooth, so hopefully, everything will be ready come July 18th.</p>
<p>Changes that will be implemented prior to the Early Access launch include widespread class balancing changes, more skill options, and improvements to various systems including PvE engagements and matchmaking lobbies.</p>
<p>In short, if you have tried out the&nbsp;<em>Dungeonborne&nbsp;</em>playtests ahead of release, then you'll almost certainly find a smoother and more player-friendly game waiting for you when the Early Access version arrives.</p>
<p>You can check out the new&nbsp;<em>Dungeonborne&nbsp;</em>release date trailer, which gives a sense of what kind of game you're in for if you pick it up, right here.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dungeonborne</em>, it's a PvPvE dungeon-crawling action-RPG inspired by the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dark-and-darker"><em>Dark and Darker</em></a>, as well as games like&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov</em>. It counts rivals <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeon-stalkers-early-access-fall">like&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeon-stalkers-early-access-fall">Dungeon Stalkers</a>&nbsp;</em>among its stablemates.</p>
<p><em>Dungeonborne&nbsp;</em>challenges you to delve into a series of dungeons, comb them for loot and goodies, and then get out before things get too hairy. With eight classes to choose from and more than 80 items to help you craft a unique build,&nbsp;<em>Dungeonborne&nbsp;</em>wants to be your go-to dungeon-crawler.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Dungeonborne&nbsp;</em>and see whether it can replace&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>in your heart on July 18th, when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2448970/Dungeonborne/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC via Steam Early Access</a>.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-lite-oled/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-lite-oled-is-a-massive-improvement-over-regular-model-new-video-highlights.925593/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-lite-oled/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Nintendo Switch Lite OLED mod has been in the works for <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-lite-oled-not-expensive/">a few months</a>, and a few hours ago we got the very first look at it, and at how much of an improvement it is over the regular Lite model's screen.</p>
<p>The first proper look at the OLED mod for the handheld-only model of the current Nintendo console came from a video shared by the mod's creator <a href="https://x.com/TakiUdon_?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1752326328697889212%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taki Udon</a>, who showcased the OLED screen with Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and compared it with a regular Switch Lite and Switch OLED. Using the same Vivid profile used in the regular OLED model, the colors look more saturated than on a regular Lite and generally much better.</p>
<p><iframe title="Switch Lite OLED - Engineering Preview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ufYiLnbOkbc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As showcased by multiple systems in the past, an OLED screen is always the better choice, but not every manufacturer is willing to go with one, at least for a system's first iteration. Having received no hardware revision, the Nintendo Switch Lite is among those systems stuck with an LCD screen, and with the console being at the end of its cycle, the only option for those who want a better screen will be to get this mod. Hopefully, Nintendo will launch its next system with an OLED screen from the get-go, although it is hard to say at this time if it will be the case due to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-no-oled-release-date/">contradicting</a> <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-oled-samsung/">information.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <p>Free-to-play open world survival shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/once-human">Once Human</a> has spent its first week in the wilds weathering a series of complaints about its data collection practices, much of it orbiting a line from publisher NetEase's privacy policy in which they state that personal information they receive from you may include "government-issued ID, such as passport information, as required by applicable laws for age verification and correction of personal information".</p>
<p>Following a backlash in the user reviews (the game was Mostly Negative on Steam at launch, but has since risen to Mixed) and on social media, the game's developers Starry Studio have published a blog insisting that they harbour no dark intentions for your personal details, or at least, that they harbour intentions no darker than any of the large number of video games that collect your personal information.</p><!--more-->
<p>You can read NetEase's privacy policy <a href="https://protocol.unisdk.easebar.com/release/latest_v475.html#div1">here</a>. The primary bone of contention is the bit directly under "Personal Information we receive from you".  This includes "name and contact details", "such as first and last name, title, prefix, email address, telephone number, (instant) messaging account, postal address, date of birth, age, gender, country/region, and government-issued ID, such as passport information, as required by applicable laws for age verification and correction of personal information."</p>
<p>Another thing users have picked up on is that NetEase may (with consent) collect "location information... such as IP geolocation information, cell-ID, and Wi-Fi connection location", by means of third-party services and platforms, who will of course have their own data collection policies. There's a lot more in the doc. If you're uneasy about the game, I encourage you to go through it in full.</p>
<p>Now, here's Starry Studio's <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2139460/announcements/detail/4230650600762196614">post on Steam</a> in response to the privacy concerns. "Once Human takes our users' data privacy very seriously," it reads. "We would only use personal data if we have a legitimate legal basis, such as providing requested services or acting with your expressed consent. We will only use your data lawfully and reasonably and in accordance with local legal compliance requirements, while practicing the data privacy principles such as data minimization, purpose limitation, and transparency. We appreciate and welcome any and all feedback given by our players to help us improve."</p>
<p>The statement notes that if players are worried about NetEase's launcher specifically, they have the option of playing Once Human over Steam or Epic Games Store.</p>
<p>"We sincerely apologize for any confusion or uncertainty experienced by our players," it goes on. "We hope this clarifies the above and please rest assured that we will continue to maintain a transparent, player-friendly gaming environment, not only because it's required by law, but also because it's the right thing to do."</p>
<p>As pointed out by <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/once-human/privacy-policy">PCGamesN</a>, NetEase are hardly alone in gathering this kind of data. <a href="https://account.elderscrollsonline.com/en-gb/privacy-policy">The privacy policy for ZeniMax Media</a>, for example, notes that "in limited circumstances" they may collect your "Social Security Number, driver’s license, precise geolocation, and personal information collected and analyzed concerning a consumer’s health". <a href="https://www.blizzard.com/en-gb/legal/8c41e7e6-0b61-42c4-a674-c91d8e8d68d3/blizzard-entertainment-privacy-policy">Blizzard's privacy policy</a>, similarly, specifies that "in some very rare, specific and restricted cases, we may ask you to provide a copy partially obfuscated of a document or government-issued ID to verify your identity, location, and/or account ownership to comply with our legal obligations."</p>
<p>Again - and at the risk of being a brow-beating mollycoddler and trying to set you homework - it's worth reading those documents in full if you have anxieties about how the games in question are handling your info.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/former-world-of-warcraft-security-expert-defends-survival-hit-once-humans-unpopular-privacy-policy-fearmongering-on-social-media-is-boring-as-s/">Gamesradar</a>, Jason Thor Hall, a former Blizzard and Amazon developer and nowadays, director of strategy for Offbrand Games, thinks the online reaction to Once Human's privacy policy is "fearmongering". In <a href="https://x.com/PirateSoftware/status/1810952269283868895">a Xitter post on Wednesday</a>, he commented that the policy doesn't actively require you to hand over the personal info given under "Name &amp; Contact details".</p>
<p>"The general internet has warped this into a demanded requirement and a privacy issue," Hall wrote. "It's not. These are only sent to the company when required by applicable local laws. This is why it says 'Receive from you' and 'as required by applicable laws'. In some countries government issued ID's are required for live service game access. If you are not in one of these countries you obviously are not asked or required to present those documents."</p>
<p>My fairly unremarkable tl;dr: I think it is generally a bad thing that video games sponge up so much of our personal data, especially in countries whose governments keep their citizens under tight surveillance. Based on my own reading of the Once Human TOS and the commentary above, I do not think that NetEase in particular are doing anything out of the ordinary here.</p>
<p>While many of the concerns I've read about Once Human's data collection seem sincere and substantial, I think there's a touch of sinophobia to a portion of the angry reactions, and an accompanying dismissal of how much of our private lives we've normalised handing over to nice, safe Western companies like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/privacy_agreement/">Valve</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/privacypolicy">Epic</a>. It would be useful if the furore over Once Human - which, privacy concerns aside, doesn't sound like a brilliant game - lent momentum to a larger conversation about such things.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-developer-is-now-worth-as-much-as-koei-tecmo-in-market-capitalization-following-huge-ipo/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stellar-blade-developer-is-now-worth-as-much-as-koei-tecmo-in-market-capitalization-following-huge-ipo.925581/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-developer-is-now-worth-as-much-as-koei-tecmo-in-market-capitalization-following-huge-ipo/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>South Korean Stellar Blade developer Shift Up has finalized its IPO (initial public offering), which turned out to be highly successful. As <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-10/game-maker-shift-up-debuts-in-south-korea-after-320-million-ipo?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_content=business&amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported by Bloomberg</a>, Shift Up raised $320 million (435 billion won, the local currency), the largest amount a gaming firm gathered during an IPO in almost three years. Back then, Krafton (maker of PUBG) raised $3.8 billion in its IPO. It's also the largest IPO in South Korea across all sectors since HD Hyundai Marine Solution in May.</p>
<p>Lee Jieun, analyst at Daishin Securities Co., reckoned there would be 'ample space' for the stock to rise following the IPO. He was right: Shift Up ended the day with a market capitalization of around $3 billion, which is roughly similar to KOEI TECMO from Japan. KOEI TECMO, however, is a company with roots that date back to many decades ago, having released many notable franchises like Atelier, Dead or Alive, Dynasty Warriors, Fatal Frame, Monster Rancher, Ninja Gaiden, Nioh, Nobunaga's Ambition, One Piece: Pirate Warriors, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rise-of-the-ronin-neo-edo-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rise of the Ronin</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-8-remake-to-launch-on-october-24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romance of the Three Kingdoms</a>, among others.</p>
<p>Shift Up, on the other hand, was founded only in 2013 (by Hyung-Tae Kim, who hit the drum during the company's listing ceremony and remains the largest shareholder) and is mainly known for two franchises: Goddess of Victory: Nikke, available on mobile devices and PC, and Stellar Blade, which launched in April for PlayStation 5. The game quickly gained <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favorable critic reviews</a> and commercial results, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-has-sold-over-one-million-units-since-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having sold one million units</a> in a couple of months.</p>
<p>Shift Up is already <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-port-and-sequel-planned-confirms-dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looking into</a> a PC port of Stellar Blade and a sequel. Additionally, they have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-shift-up-hiring-new-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hiring</a> for a new AAA urban sci-fi action RPG project made with Epic's Unreal Engine. Inevitably, though, this game will take a few years to materialize on the market.</p>
<p>In a way, Shift Up's meteoric rise in market capitalization brings back to mind CD Projekt RED, which at one point was the largest video game company in Europe by market cap with $8.1 billion, on the heels of The Witcher trilogy and the third installment in particular.</p>
<p>The Polish company then experienced a fall from grace with the problematic launch of Cyberpunk 2077 on consoles, but the following updates and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phantom Liberty expansion</a> have largely restored its reputation. Currently, its market cap is $3.34 billion, a bit higher than Shift Up's.</p>

<p>Responding to Forbes, which initially raised the issue, publisher Nexon said it is "taking the concerns raised seriously" and will "ensure that the imagery that may appear similar [to Destiny 2] clearly reflects the unique identity of [its] game".</p>
<p>"The First Descendant, as a looter shooter game, was developed with a deep affection and respect for other games in the genre," Nexon said in a statement.</p> <div>

<p>"Destiny 2, being a globally renowned looter shooter game, is also personally admired and respected by the team, and it has served as an inspiration during the development process.</p>
<p>"We have taken the concerns raised seriously and decided to make adjustments to ensure that the imagery that may appear similar clearly reflects the unique identity of our game. We will continue to improve the game for fans of the looter shooter genre."</p>
<p>The First Descendant is an all-new, free-to-play looter shooter wherein you must "accept your calling [...] and fight against invaders for the survival of humanity".
</p>
<p>Featuring character growth, dynamic battles, "colossal" boss battles, and customisation, The First Descendant is available now on PC via Steam, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and last-gen consoles.
</p>
<p>Destiny 2 developer Bungie recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-disables-rewards-in-private-crucible-matches-after-players-discover-loot-farm-exploit">disabled rewards generated in private Crucible matches</a> because of "an issue".</p>
<p>Whilst the studio stopped short of revealing what, exactly, that issue was, Destiny 2 players believed it was connected to a glitch that enabled players to farm a whole host of items and consumables in private matches, even if they're away from their consoles/PCs.</p>

			<p>Some Unreal Engine 5 features, such as Lumen and Nanite, can significantly improve visuals in certain scenarios, but their performance is rather considerable.</p>
<p>A new comparison video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Cycu1">Cycu1</a> put the <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/scans-medieval-fantasy-ruins-dark-forest-environment?sessionInvalidated=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medieval Fantasy Ruins tech demo</a> by Scans Factory running with Lumen and Nanite and with the standard pipeline side-by-side, highlighting the visual improvements brought by Lumen and Nanite but also their impact on performance. At 1080p resolution, on an RTX 4080, the demo drops from the over 120 FPS of the standard pipeline to the 40, 50 FPS range with Lumen and Nanite at 1080p resolution. This tech demo obviously hasn't received the same optimization a game would receive, but it is becoming clear how current gaming hardware cannot handle Unreal Engine 5's most impressive features properly.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fantasy Ruins Demo Unreal Engine 5 -  Standard Pipeline vs Nanite/Lumen RTX 4080 Graphics Comparison" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JPPp-_PBhzk?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While current generation consoles are having trouble running games using Unreal Engine 5's Lumen and Nanite, things could change in the near future with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-ps5-pro-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>, whose better specs and increased ray tracing performance could allow the system, for example, to use hardware Lumen and provide console players with a taste of what is possible to do already on PC.</p>
<p>The latest version of Unreal Engine 5 is version 5.4, which introduced some performance improvements. More information can be found on its <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/unreal-engine-5-4-is-now-available">official website.</a></p>

            <p>Gotcha Gotcha Games, creators of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rpg-maker">RPG Maker</a> series, have announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/action-game-maker">Action Game Maker</a>. Much like its predecessors, it aims to allow users to create games in its chosen genre without any programming experience, using a “node-based visual scripting system” (draggable arrows and concepts, basically). Could this finally be the opportunity to create the legally distinct Little Shop Of Horrors management sim of my dreams? No, of course not. The technology does not yet exist powerful enough to manifest it. Also, it's not an action game. Also, I don't know how to make games. Also it's Friday and I'm tired. Also, AGM isn't out yet. Still, I’m intrigued!</p>

<p>Here are some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a>-facts:</p>
<blockquote><p>Advanced Engine Technology With Godot Engine!</p>
<p>Take advantage of the excellent 2D functionality provided by Godot Engine, the popular open source engine powering ACTION GAME MAKER!</p>
<ul>
<li>UI design based on the existing Godot UI</li>
<li>Support for GDScript is provided for those who want to move beyond visual scripting.</li>
<li>A complete 2D pipeline</li>
<li>Tile Map Editor with auto-tile function</li>
<li>Supports both sprite and 2D bone animation systems</li>
<li>Access to Godot's rich particle and shader systems as well as support for dynamic lighting and shadows, enabling a full suite of graphics features!</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The toolkit ships with “everything you need to build your first game" from "character art to tiles, music, and sound effects!" What's more, “if you already have your own assets it’s easy to import them – and high resolutions are supported!”</p>
<p>My immediate thought here is whether the tools are going to robust enough to offer as wide an array of projects as RPG Maker? Everyone’s got a story to tell, but does everyone have a distinctive double jump to unleash on the world? Are we going to get action-y equivalents of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lisa">Lisa: The Painful</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-to-the-moon">To The Moon</a>? Will I cave and settle for a lesser version of the legally distinct Little Shop Of Horrors management sim of my dreams? Anything is possible, it seems, as long as it involves chaining verbs together. RPG Maker XP, by the by, is currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/235900/RPG_Maker_XP/">90% off on Steam</a>, although it has been cheaper than that in the past by a good 10%. You can find Action Game Maker on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2987180/ACTION_GAME_MAKER/">here</a>, release date TBC.</p>

            <p>
Three Starfy games previously only available in Japan have been added to Nintendo Switch Online for Expansion members.
</p>
<p>
Densetsu no Starfy 1, 2 and 3 were all released on the Game Boy Advance between 2002 and 2004, but are now available globally on Switch. A fourth game came to Nintendo DS in 2006, which was followed by The Legendary Starfy on the same console - the only game in the series to be released outside of Japan, until now.
</p>
<p>
So who is Starfy? As one comment on X put it: "He's like Kirby, but a starfish". Makes sense.
</p>

<p>

The Starfy games are platformers with underwater worlds, which also makes sense considering Starfy is a starfish. He's also the prince of Pufftop, which is maybe why these games were Japan only.
</p>
<p>
Smash Bros. fans may recognise Starfy as an assist trophy, though. He's appeared in each game since Super Smash Bros. Brawl on the Wii with a handy spin attack.
</p>
<p>
His <a href="https://www.ssbwiki.com/Starfy">trophy data</a> also provides some more background information: "He's a bit spacey and clumsy, but when he sets his mind to something, he gives it his all". He also "sometimes dons a pig suit and throws pork cutlets".

We have taken the concerns raised seriously and decided to make adjustments to ensure that the imagery that may appear similar clearly reflects the unique identity of our game. We will continue to improve the game for fans of the looter shooter genre.”</blockquote><p>Generally speaking, The First Descendant is a mash-up of mechanics from various looter shooters already in the market. There’s more than a whiff of Destiny about The First Descendant’s design, systems, and mechanics, but then there’s also a lot of Warframe about it, too.</p><p>This week, Nexon released <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-patch-102-makes-some-big-changes-heres-what-it-does">a significant update for The First Descendant</a> that makes some big changes to the game, and leaves some aspects of it that had become a topic of discussion within the community well alone.</p><p>IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-review">The First Descendant review</a> returned a 5/10. We said: “The First Descendant has all the building blocks of a fantastic looter shooter, but they’re buried under a pile of monotonous quests, a terrible story, and an infuriating free-to-play model that has influenced its game design in the worst possible way.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

I remember seeing my name in the credits of a Nintendo game for the first time. It feels really great to be acknowledged for your work.&nbsp;It's like a warm thank you from the developers and the company for all the work you put in," they explained.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I do remember one project where the company decided not to put the in-house testers in the credits. This was one of the Professor Layton games by Level-5. Nintendo of Europe handled the localization and publishing for the Layton series at the time. The translators on that project protested strongly against this decision, but in the end the testers were not credited for this project. I don’t know if this has since become policy."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Nintendo contributing to normalization of &quot;ridiculous&quot; miscrediting policies">Nintendo contributing to normalization of "ridiculous" miscrediting policies</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After departing the Japanese company, they continued working on Nintendo projects as a contractor through service provider Localsoft. They have yet to be credited for their work on Nintendo titles through Localsoft and claim they also worked on Nintendo projects at Keywords—where they also failed to receive a credit.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I kind of accepted [miscrediting] as 'part of the business' but that doesn’t mean it's fair or right. The fact that these companies are not able to give any reasonable explanation for omitting external translators (and even developers) from their credits is proof of this, I think" they continued.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Professionally, it's hard to tell how much this has impacted me. It's entirely possible that more translation agencies would have approached me if my name was out there in all these big blockbuster Nintendo games, but who knows?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those claims were corroborated by another source, who spent over a year working on multiple Nintendo projects at Localsoft but haven't been credited. "It is Nintendo's policy to not list the name of translators from external agencies in their game credits, which also forbids us from listing those titles on our CVs," explained our source.</span></p><p>A robust list of credits for the NOA localization team in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door. External translators don't receive the same treatment.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They said, when working on Nintendo titles as an external translator, they were asked to sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) with a standard duration of 10 years, prohibiting them from discussing or promoting their work. Game Developer has viewed an email that confirms Nintendo used a decade-long NDA on multiple projects.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If you look at the credits for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, for instance, you will notice that only six people were credited for localizing a full title that's available in eight languages," our source continued. "[In my experience] a game like this would normally be localized by a team of around 25 translators. Some languages are skipped over completely like they got magically added to the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"For games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Crossing</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Breath of the Wild</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> you don't really notice that 15 or 20 translators are not in the credits, as there are all the other names from their in-house translators, which is why Nintendo's policy of miscrediting might have flown under the radar. But almost every big title that Nintendo releases which uses external translators actually fails to credit translators."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They stressed the prevalence of miscrediting is "ridiculous" and prevents workers from championing themselves and furthering their career. "You work on an award-winning title with newspapers and magazines raving about your work, and you’re forced to hide the fact that you actually were a part of that for 10 years," they added.</span></p><p>Localsoft in the credits for Animal Crossing: New Horizons. The company was placed below the names of Nintendo's internal localization workers.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another source, who was employed by Localsoft as an external translator, worked on titles such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for months. Much like their peers, they have yet to be credited for their contributions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We were never openly told that we wouldn't be credited, it was just a topic we sometimes discussed among us Localsoft translators during lunch breaks," they said. "It was upsetting, but sadly, that's generally how things work when working through translation agencies, so as much as we were upset (at least some of us), in the end, we shrugged it off as just another day in translation."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;I felt robbed, but in an all too familiar way&quot;">"I felt robbed, but in an all too familiar way"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our source considered raising the issue with Localsoft at the time, but felt the company would simply feed them excuses. "That's how it always goes," they continued. "The agencies and the clients just play the blame game endlessly. It is my opinion that the clients don't care, and the agencies&nbsp;have everything to gain from keeping their vendors, us the translators, in the dark. When it comes to money, fees, contracts and anything related, everything shifts to dark mode."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They claimed Localsoft leaders told staff to avoid discussing workplace issues with their colleagues, and that translators are frequently penalized for sharing information that studios and employers feel should be kept under wraps. "There's a very perceptible 'don't tell' mentality in this line of work," they said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After realizing they hadn't been credited for their work, they admitted to being "upset but not surprised." On a personal level, being miscredited prevented them from telling friends and family about their work. It was, they said, incredibly demoralizing. On a professional level, the impact was more insidious.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I felt I would benefit from being able to state I worked on the title when offering my services to new clients. Not to mention that I actually spent a fair amount of time working almost&nbsp;exclusively for them," they added. "When the whole project was done, it took me months to get some steady work going again as I had been unavailable for so long. So logically, I felt robbed, but in an all too familiar way—which says a lot about this line of work."</span></p><p>Localsoft received a 'Special Thanks' for its work on Tears of the Kingdom, but individual translators weren't credited.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ultimately, they said freelance translators are always "caught in the middle" of the biggest companies—whether that's the service provider that hired them or the studio overseeing development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As we've seen in the past when instances of miscrediting were highlighted on projects such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/ubisoft-and-keywords-fail-to-credit-skull-bones-translators">Skull &amp; Bones</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/baldur-s-gate-3-localisation-company-altagram-apologises-for-miscrediting">Baldur's Gate III</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the service providers </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/altagram-only-able-to-properly-credit-devs-on-5-percent-of-projects-estimates-ceo">often blame their partner studios</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, while the studios themselves point the finger in the opposite direction.

If the game company makes a bad call, the&nbsp;agency will roll with it 100 percent. If the&nbsp;game company&nbsp;screws the translators over, the agency will nod their heads and feed on what's left. And if the agencies can get you to work more for less, even though the company didn't ask for it, they will," our source continued.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It is nigh impossible for translators to push back against this structure. Anyone trying will get blacklisted before getting anywhere. This is a field where taking an annual break can shut you out of months of work. No one cares what we think because there's literally&nbsp;nothing we can do about it, and that's even if we were willing to forfeit our livelihood for&nbsp;the greater good.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Perhaps the bigger question is why are externalized translators so often left out? Why would companies be inclined to refuse to credit them in the first&nbsp;place? Who benefits from this obfuscation? And why is it so common practice to strip all of these people of any recognition for their work?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer reached out to Nintendo, Keywords, and Localsoft weeks before publishing this article in search of answers.

		<p>Lidia Sobieska is going to be available for Tekken 8 from July 22nd, Bandai Namco has confirmed. That date is for those players who have the Playable Character Year 1 Pass. Her official release date for everyone else is July 25th. A new trailer has been released to show Lidia in action, with The Warrior Prime Minister doling out the damage using her traditional karate skills.</p>
<p><iframe title="TEKKEN 8 — Lidia Sobieska Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ne4AF6E-PHE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Lidia is the second character from the Playable Character Year 1 Pass, following Eddy Gordo. Her introduction also sees the addition of the new Seaside Resort stage will be added to the game giving players a nice beach setting to get your fight on. Both Eddy and Lidia were leaked ahead of their official announcements, and if the leak is 100% spot on, the remaining characters for the Year 1 pass are Craig Marduk and Fahkumram.</p>

<p>In our Tekken 8 review, Nick wrote,<em>&nbsp;“Tekken 8 has started 2024 off with a bang, proving once again why this fighting series is great! It’s maybe not quite as newcomer friendly as Street Fighter 6, but has a bevy of modes and new tweaks that means it’s going in the right direction to be a game for all players, old and new, and will only get better over time. “</em></p>

            <p>Kain is merchandised. The clans sell tales of him. Few know the truth. He was a character in a dead franchise once, as we were we all. However, his contempt for anonymity drove him to inspire the creation of an upcoming (<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bitbotmedia/706736940?ref=e9g0rc&amp;token=21dc992b">crowdfunding allowing</a>) graphic novel. The book stars Raziel, the first-born of his lieutenants, and It’s a canonical prequel story to the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/legacy-kain-soul-reaver">Soul Reaver</a>. I have waited a millennium. Over time, I became less human and more…games blogger. I have had the chance to write about Legacy Of Kain <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-ode-to-kain-from-blood-omen-and-his-legacy-including-untitled-goose-game">precisely once</a>. You’re goddamn right I’m going to froth at the mouth at even the vague promise of more Shakespearean monologues and time-travelling vampires.</p>

<p>Ok, so I’ll dial back on the frothing. The Dead Shall Rise looks gorgeous, absolutely no complaints there. Any reservations I have are in the monkeys paw of getting more Legacy Of Kain media at the cost of fleshing out a chunk of the timeline that I always felt worked better as an unknown. The story, which has been written in collaboration with Crystal Dynamics, aims to focus on aspects of Raziel’s human past, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-returns-in-new-prequel-graphic-novel">via IGN</a>. As I say, I’m left both intrigued and cautious. Not that I don’t think the writers won’t do a great job, just that so much of Soul Reaver’s strength lie in letting the player fill in the gaps in Raziel’s past for themselves. Never getting to see Kain’s empire at its height of power, for example, always felt like a deliberate choice rather than a lacking omission. There’s something to be said to filling in the literal cracks in Nosgoth’s corpse for yourself.</p>
<p>None of this, I’m sure, will stop me devouring the book like so many wayward souls haunting the spectral realm. The real question here, of course, is what this might mean for the Legacy Of Kain franchise going forward. In 2018, Crystal Dynamics <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/legacy-of-kain-devs-crystal-dynamics-seek-opinions-about-new-games-in-the-series">put out a survey</a> asking fans about what they’d like to see from the future of the long-dormant series. I remember it well, because one of the questions was something along the lines of “what games should any new Legacy Of Kain titles be like?” to which I responded “Legacy Of Kain”, which felt so obvious I wonder why they asked it. Anyway, I’d say this new comic bodes well, although only time will tell if it’s anywhere near as brilliant as <a href="https://youtu.be/OCZXvblpNSM">this </a>wonderful tale of Kain discovering Raziel making chocolate pudding at an ungodly hour.</p>

			<p>Today, KOEI TECMO announced the release date of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 remake. The game will be released digitally on October 24 for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>It is a remake of 2001's PlayStation 2 game with Power Up Kit features, the "All Officers Play" and "All Periods Scenarios" features, and a host of new content. There are now a thousand playable officers, up from 600, while the All Periods Scenarios feature now offers 55 scenarios (some of which are fictional), the most ever in the franchise.</p>
<p>Through the enhanced "All Officers Play" feature, players will be able to take control of the powerful rulers and the officers who serve them or be a free officer and join a roving army. This allows players to explore the Three Kingdoms with a fresh and unique experience every time, thanks to the new features and the variety of associations formed both on and off the battlefield, highlighted by "Symbiotic" and "Antagonistic" relationships.</p>
<p>"Symbiotic" relationships are formed when the player interacts with other officers through situations such as commands or events, and a certain number of "sympathies" occur. When a player is in a "symbiotic" relationship with another officer, the officer will join and help the player in many situations, including domestic tasks, councils, and battles. On the other hand, if the relationship is "Antagonistic," the officer will not accept visits from the player and may even hunt them on the battlefield.</p>
<p>The variety of relationships built throughout Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 remake will now be dramatically on display. Players will be able to monitor the ever-changing dynamics of each relationship through the Relationship Chart, which not only displays relationships such as "Sworn Siblings" and "Spouses," but also special relationships such as "Destined Partners," "Rivals," and "Sworn Enemies," as well as the various "Symbiotic" and "Antagonistic" connections. As relationships with others deepen, Linked Forge can even occur during battles and missions. These special links allow for a better performance beyond individual capabilities in various situations.</p>
<p><iframe title="ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS 8 REMAKE - First Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6RPhIhvsiIw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Moreover, many in-game events, from major historical events to officer anecdotes, may now be initiated by officers through "Tales". This feature allows players to selectively participate in events of their choice. Some events even offer choices, and the player's choices will dynamically change the lives of the officers and the Three Kingdoms.</p>
<p>The Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 remake also introduces a new strategic element called "Traits." These are abilities possessed by certain officers with extraordinary achievements or memorable anecdotes in history. For example, Cao Cao can act twice in the Council, and Liu Bei is able to meet with officers without fail.</p>
<p>This will be the latest franchise installment following <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-xiv-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romance of the Three Kingdoms XIV</a>, launched in 2020 to fairly positive reviews.</p>

		<p>Koei Tecmo has announced that Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake will be released on October 24th, with the game coming to PC, PS5, PS4, and Switch. There is no planned Xbox One or Xbox Series XS release. To mark this announcement, a new trailer has been released for Romance of the Kingdoms 8 Remake, showing what to expect from the remake including new events.</p>
<p><iframe title="ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS 8 REMAKE - First Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6RPhIhvsiIw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake will have 55 different scenarios, and over 1000 officers. Players can create their own Officer as well, allowing for new stories to be weaved. In the game, players will do everything from helping out people living in town with their problems, to forging relationships with other officers. Some of these relationships are based in real history, but alternate history routes are open depending on the choices made during the story. Links are forged between characters, and the stronger this link is the more effective the partnership can be in diplomacy and in battle. The game has a renewed and Duel mode, and has the addition of a Debate mode where conflicts are sorted with words instead of swords.</p>
<p>It has been 17 years since Romance of The Three Kingdoms 8 last got any kind of release. The game first appeared for PC in Japan in 2001, before releasing in 2002 for the Japanese PS2 audience. It would then land on the shores of North America for PS2 in 2003, followed by Europe in 2004. A Japanese PSP exclusive release of Romance of the The Three Kingdoms 8 was then released in 2007.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apex-legends-champion-imperialhal-says-%E2%80%98apex-is-dying%E2%80%99.925521/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-champion-apex-dying/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Apex Legends is suffering at the moment. Following a miserable update, the game has been review bombed by disappointed fans worldwide, and even the game’s most prolific esports champions have spoken out about the state of the once-popular battle royale game. For a while, Apex Legends spearheaded the growth of the genre, but over the years, the charm has worn thin and players are starting to tire of Respawn’s competitive-first title.</p>



<p>In a recent statement, Phil ‘ImperialHal’ Dosen claimed that Apex is dying – a claim made despite him being one of the title’s most prominent and successful pro players.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-no-way-back">No Way Back</h2>



<p>Apex Legends is sliding downhill at an alarming rate. The player count is experiencing an all-time low on some platforms, and initiatives dubbed ‘cash grabs’ by the community have left the ecosystem in a shambolic state, sneered at by players worldwide. </p>



<p>ImperialHal, one of the winningest Apex Legends pro players of all time, had a simple comment to make about the game that could have devastating implications:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Apex is dying…… sucks to say</p>— Falcons ImperialHal (@ImperialHal) <a href="https://twitter.com/ImperialHal/status/1811239465622344184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 11, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Last year, ImperialHal won the ALGS 2023 Championship just months after netting the top prize in the ALGS 2023 Split 1 Playoffs, netting a whopping amount of prize money in a relatively short period. In his time in the Apex Legends space, he has repped TSM’s banner in countless tournaments (before leaving the team in May this year), bringing home more prize money than any other Apex Legends pro player in history.</p>



<p>In a few weeks, Apex Legends is due to appear at the Esports World Cup in Riyadh, but with the sentiment around the game sitting at an all-time low, there are concerns about how impactful the tournament will be. There’s plenty of money on the line, but the dwindling interest in the game is a constant threat.</p>

With newly added officers and forces, players can discover new events and relationships between officers for an even more authentic experience. The “All Periods Scenarios” feature has also been updated to offer over 55 scenarios, including fictional ones, making it the largest number of scenarios available in the series history. From the end of the Eastern Han dynasty to the final age of the Three Kingdoms period, players can choose any officers and which period they’d like to play, creating numerous possible combinations for an experience unique to each player.</p><p>Through the evolved “All Officers Play” feature, players have the option to take control of the powerful rulers and the officers who serve them or be a free officer and join a vagrant army. This enables players to explore the Three Kingdoms with a fresh and unique experience every time through thanks to the incredible amount of new features and the variety of associations formed both on and off the battlefield highlighted by both “Symbiotic” and “Antagonistic” relationships.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>“Symbiotic” relationships are established when the player interacts with other officers through situations like commands or events and a certain number of “sympathies” occur. When a player is in a “Symbiotic” relationship with another officer, the officer will join and help the player in many situations, including domestics, councils, and battles. On the other hand, if the relationship is “Antagonistic,” the officer will not accept visits from the player and may even hunt them on the battlefield.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_898696"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Another unique strategy element to <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake</em> is the addition of the powerful and unique “Traits.” Helping officers stand out, “Traits” is an ability possessed by some officers with exceptional achievements or memorable anecdotes in history. For example, Cao Cao is able to act twice in council and Liu Bei is able to meet with officers without fail.</p><p>The variety of relationships built up throughout the experience are now dramatically displayed through a number of new elements. Players will be able to check on the constantly changing dynamics of each relationship through the “Relationship Chart.” The “Relationship Chart” not only shows relationships like “Sworn Siblings” and “Spouses” but also depicts special relationships such as “Destined Partners,” “Rivals,” and “Sworn Enemies,” as well as displaying the various “Symbiotic” and “Antagonistic” connections.  As relationships deepen with others, “Linked Forge” may even occur during battles and missions. These special links allow for a better performance beyond individual capabilities in various situations.</p><p>In addition, many events in the game, ranging from major historical incidents to anecdotes of officers can now be initiated by officers through “Tales.” This allows players to selectively participate in the events of their choosing. Additionally, some events offer choices and the player’s decisions will dynamically alter the lives of officers and the Three Kingdoms.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.

            <title><![CDATA[Our Favourite Indie Game of 2023 Is Now On Game Pass]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/favourite-indie-game-2023-tchia/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/our-favourite-indie-game-of-2023-is-now-on-game-pass.925509/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/favourite-indie-game-2023-tchia/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Tchia was first released in March 2023 on PlayStation and PC before being ported to Nintendo Switch in June 2024. Now, it has been released on Xbox Series X|S, and to celebrate the arrival of the game, it has been added to the platform’s Game Pass service, which means that subscribers can get a copy of this stellar indie game for no extra charge.</p>



<p>Last year, our Mike Straw listed Tchia as his <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/straw-2023-video-games-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">number-one game of 2023</a>, and it’s easy to see why. This gorgeous and emotional open-world adventure title has some serious depth to it, and there are plenty of innovative elements under the hood to keep gamers engaged for hours on end, regardless of their interests or age group.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-tchia-is-here">Tchia Is Here</h2>



<p>Tchia comes from Awaceb and is published by Kepler Interactive. It’s a magical, ethereal adventure set across a wide array of islands spread out in a stunning ocean environment based on New Caledonia. Players quickly come to learn that Tchia, a relatively unassuming but adventurous girl, has the power to ‘soul jump’, leaping between inanimate objects and a wide variety of animals at the press of a button.</p>



<p>We sat down last year with the game’s director, Phil Crifo, to learn more:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Indie Initiative Episode 3 - Tchia" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CQFN1iKoFfE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>On the surface, Tchia smacks of titles like The Legend of Zelda, with players being able to explore a wide region by climbing, using a glider, or sailing on a raft. It also has neat mini-games such as rhythm challenges completed through the use of a dainty ukelele. With plenty of customisation options and stacks of side content to explore, Tchia really is well worth the investment – and with it now being on Game Pass, that investment is slim to nil.</p>



<p>Within six weeks of release, Tchia had secured one million sales, which is a testament to the entertainment value wrapped up in this neat little package.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Anger Foot: Hilarious Indie Shooter Is Out Now on PC]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/anger-foot-out-now/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anger-foot-hilarious-indie-shooter-is-out-now-on-pc.925503/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/anger-foot-out-now/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Anger Foot is one of the most bizarre yet wholeheartedly satisfying first-person shooters you’ll ever play. It’s out now on PC and last year, I got the chance to play through a portion of the game at London’s WASD expo – and I loved every second of it. It’s a high-octane, punchy shooter with hilarious elements and some of the most eye-catching, explosive visuals I’ve ever seen.</p>



<hr>







<p>Anger Foot has been developed by Free Lives and published by Devolver. It’s arguably one of the zaniest FPS titles ever made – the game’s description on Steam will paint you a perfect picture of the nature of this game:</p>



<p>“<em>Anger Foot is a lightning fast hard bass blast of kicking doors and kicking ass. Crash through the caffeine-fuelled fever dream of Shit City, putting the boot to a menacing menagerie of merciless gangsters.</em></p>



<p><em>Unleash the world’s deadliest feet on a colourful cast of anthropomorphic enemies. Clearing out slums, sewers, and skyscrapers as you grab new weapons, unlock new sneakers, and upgrade your powers in absurd and wonderful ways. Kick and shoot your way to the exit as you leave behind a smouldering trail of shattered doors, broken bones, and crumpled energy drinks.</em>“</p>



<p>Here’s the launch trailer for the game, which is available now on PC:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Anger Foot Launch Trailer | Out Now on PC" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7kJo0miz08g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It’s such an addictive game that you won’t want to put it down. It focuses on not making mistakes, which means that missing a single shot or kicking the wrong thing could reset your progress, forcing you to wrap the level back again and try something different. The story is brilliant – someone stole your sneakers and you’re willing to tear through a city-wide crime syndicate to get them back.</p>



<p>If that doesn’t sound like fun, I don’t know what is.</p>
