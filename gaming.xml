			<p>The NvRTX branch of the impressive Unreal Engine 5 Zorah tech demo sports some advanced features that even the most powerful GPU on the market cannot handle at native 4K resolution properly.</p>
<p>As shown in a new test video shared by Compusemble, advanced features like Mega Geometry, ReSTiR Global Illumination and Path Tracing and more can tank performance at native 4K resolution even on an<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/"> RTX 5090 GPU,</a> the most powerful GPU currently available on the market. In some scenarios, the demo runs at a whopping 13 FPS, proving how gaming hardware still isn't ready for some of the advanced RTX features NVIDIA has been working on. Things get slightly better with NVIDIA DLSS, and it's only in Performance mode that the RTX 5090 can run the demo at above 30 FPS in the same scenario that tanked performance at native 4K resolution.</p>
<p><iframe title="Zorah Demo: NvRTX Branch vs Stock UE5 - NvRTX Can Run As Low As 13FPS on 5090 Depending on the Scene" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zdbjsO8k8mM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Even though the Unreal Engine 5 Zorah demo cannot be run at acceptable performance at native 4K resolution, there's no denying that some of the technology is impressive. Among the new features that have yet to be implemented in games is RTX Neural Rendering, which can quickly create a neural representation of thousands of textures to save VRAM and RAM much more than the currently used compression tech. More information on Neural Rendering can be found on NVIDIA's <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/get-started-with-neural-rendering-using-nvidia-rtx-kit/">official website.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-1886-announced-2027</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/11-bit-studios-announces-frostpunk-remake-frostpunk-1886-for-2027.1172448/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-1886-announced-2027<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher 11 bit studios has announced&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk: 1886</em>, a remake of the original&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>in Unreal Engine 5 (and, despite what the title suggests, nothing to do with&nbsp;<em>The Order: 1886</em>).</p>

<p>In an announcement <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3645160/view/545607485799530656" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam, 11 bit says the aim with&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk: 1886&nbsp;</em>is to "recreate the experience of the original game in [Unreal Engine 5]", and that the project is part of an effort to "further expand upon&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk</em>" away from the original game's now-defunct Liquid Engine.</p>

<p>This is almost certainly the new&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>game to which 11 bit referred in its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-frostpunk-game-2027-11-bit-studios" rel="nofollow">most recent financial summary</a>; the studio already confirmed a 2027 release for that project, so unless there's another one in the works for the same year, it's most probably&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk: 1886</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frostpunk-1886-remake-original-game-city-view.jpg?itok=R2Vt-VH2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frostpunk-1886-remake-original-game-city-view.jpg?itok=jiUQUZya 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Frostpunk: 1886&nbsp;</em>aims to reimagine the original (pictured here) with new visuals and gameplay mechanics.</figcaption></figure><p>According to 11 bit,&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk: 1886&nbsp;</em>will feature "improved visuals, higher resolution, and all the other possibilities Unreal has to offer", serving as a "great introduction to the world of&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk</em>" but also the perfect game for "die-hard fans".</p>

<p>However, the project won't just be a rebuilt version of&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk</em>. Instead, it'll feature "tons of new content, new mechanics, new events, technologies, and buildings", as well as a totally new path, Purpose, to go alongside Faith and Order.</p>

<p>In addition,&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk: 1886&nbsp;</em>will support expansion via DLC in future, as well as official modding support, which is something that's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-modding-tool-at-launch" rel="nofollow">available for the second</a>&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>but not for the first due to engine limitations.</p>

<p>You can check out the very brief teaser trailer for&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk: 1886&nbsp;</em>below. It doesn't give very much away, and it's really more of a mood piece than a full trailer, but hey, it might help you to get excited for the game.</p>




<p><em>Frostpunk: 1886&nbsp;</em>is due to land on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3645160/Frostpunk_1886/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> sometime in 2027. No console release has been announced yet.</p>

While hundreds of thousands of hopeful gamers will likely be refreshing the websites of <a href="https://buff.ly/340n4Ou">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://buff.ly/BCrRzOM">Target</a>, and <a href="https://buff.ly/dfdT51Z">Walmart</a>, hoping to be lucky enough to successfully push an order through and secure their piece of the first Switch 2 wave, Nintendo also <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0c942683-aa0d-42df-b11a-12e2b25a91dd" href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/heres-how-to-pre-order-a-nintendo-switch-2">asked interested players to register their My Nintendo accounts</a> as interested in pre-ordering the upcoming system to enter into a lottery. However, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa took to Nintendo's Japanese social media accounts to share some bad news regarding the lottery system.</p>

<p>According to a post shared on Nintendo's Japanese X account, Nintendo received 2.2 million interested players in Japan alone. If that number is truly representative of the number of players who want to purchase a Switch 2 in Japan, it would far exceed the initial Japanese sales numbers of the Switch 1, which, according to <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/nintendo-sells-313700-switch-consoles-in-japan-over-launch-weekend/"><em>VentureBeat,</em></a> reached just over 313,000 units in its first weekend. In the console's first month, Nintendo sold 2.74 million units worldwide, meaning that the 2.2 million Japanese registrations nearly reaches that number on its own.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jqQG2xco8eI" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>According to Furukawa, Nintendo cannot fulfill all of those requests at launch. However, if you register through the My Nintendo Store and are not selected to purchase during the first wave, you will have another chance once the company can replenish its supply.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can see the full translation of Furukawa's post from X below.</p>

<div>
<p>Hello, this is Furukawa. We have been procuring many materials and proceeding with production in advance so that we can deliver the Nintendo Switch 2 to you. On April 2nd, we announced details about the Nintendo Switch 2 and started accepting applications for the lottery sale on the My Nintendo Store. As a result, we received an extremely large number of applications, approximately 2.2 million people in Japan alone. However, this number far exceeds our expectations, and far exceeds the number of Nintendo Switch 2 consoles that can be delivered from the My Nintendo Store on June 5th. Therefore, unfortunately, we expect that a significant number of customers will not be selected when the winners are announced tomorrow, April 24th.</p>

<p>In order to avoid the trouble of those who were not selected in the first lottery sale having to reapply, My Nintendo Store will automatically carry over those who were not selected in the first lottery sale to the second lottery sale. However, even including the quantity for the second lottery sale, we cannot fulfill all of the applications we received. We deeply apologize for not being able to meet your expectations despite our prior preparations.</p>

<p>In response to this demand, we are currently working on further strengthening our production system. In addition, starting tomorrow, April 24th, game retailers and online stores nationwide will begin accepting pre-orders or lottery sales for the Nintendo Switch 2 console (please check the information of each retailer for details). The console will also continue to be sold at the My Nintendo Store after the release date (more details will be announced at a later date). With the cooperation of retailers, we will continue to ship the console and make efforts to get as many Nintendo Switch 2 consoles as possible into your hands.</p>

<p>We plan to continue producing and shipping a considerable number of Nintendo Switch 2 units in the future. We apologize for the delay in our ability to meet your expectations, and we appreciate your understanding.</p>

<p>Though Furukawa alludes to it, he doesn't directly say that Nintendo will be unable to fulfill demand through its retail partners. Still, with the company seeing such increased demand in its home country, players worldwide will likely encounter fierce competition and, more than likely, frustration while trying to get their hands on a launch model Switch 2. Nintendo Switch 2 arrives on June 5.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/23/ghost-of-yotei-release-date-set-for-october-collectors-edition-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The follow-up to 2020's <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima/ghost-of-tsushima-review-a-most-honorable-epic">acclaimed Ghost of Tsushima</a>, Ghost of&nbsp;Yōtei has garnered a lot of excitement following its announcement during a PlayStation State of Play livestream last September. The open-world adventure places players in the boots of a new samurai named Atsu 300 years after the events of Ghost of Tsushima. However, developer Sucker Punch Productions largely went quiet following the surprise reveal last year. That changed today, as the studio revealed additional details about Ghost of&nbsp;Yōtei, including the release date.</p>

<p>Players who have been waiting a half-decade to continue exploring Sucker Punch's stunning recreation of feudal Japan can now circle October 2 on their calendars. The game is available in the standard edition for $70, but if you're excited enough to want some bonuses, Sony is also offering a Digital Deluxe Edition as well as a physical Collector's Edition. The Digital Deluxe Edition costs $80 and includes in-game Snake Armor, exclusive armor dye and horse with saddle, a charm, an early unlock of the Traveller's Map, and a sword kit. Meanwhile, the Collector's Edition costs $250 and offers all the Digital Deluxe content (including a digital copy of the game), plus physical items like a sash, a tsuba, art cards, a papercraft ginkgo tree, and a zeni hajiki coin game with pouch.&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>The final inclusion of today's Ghost of&nbsp;Yōtei announcements is a trailer called "The Onryō's List." The story goes that 16 years prior to the events of the game, a gang called The&nbsp;Yōtei Six killed her family and pinned her to a burning ginkgo tree, leaving her for dead. She somehow survived the ordeal and what appeared to be a death sentence from the gang of outlaws and she harnessed that strength and motivation to learn how to fight, kill, and hunt. In Ghost of&nbsp;Yōtei, Atsu returns home with a list of the six names of those in The&nbsp;Yōtei Six, with eyes toward vengeance.</p>

<p>Using the same katana that pinned her to the tree, Atsu embarks on a mission to avenge her family. The story plays out in Ezo, which is known as Hokkaido today. New gameplay mechanics will allow the player to understand Atsu's past to fully come to know how much was truly stolen from her by The&nbsp;Yōtei Six. Sucker Punch claims it has built upon and evolved the way players can explore the massive open world, with more freedom and variety on offer than in Ghost of Tsushima. Atsu can choose which member of The&nbsp;Yōtei Six she wants to pursue first, while also claiming bounties, learning new skills, and exploring the natural beauty of northern Japan.</p>

<p>You can see the new trailer released by Sucker Punch Productions below.</p>

<p>Ghost of&nbsp;Yōtei arrives exclusively on PlayStation 5 on October 2. If you're hungry for more information surrounding the highly anticipated follow-up, Sucker Punch promises to show more in the approach to that date.</p>

			<p>F1 25 is just around the corner – OK, maybe it’s a chicane or chicken – with the latest entry in Codemasters’ long-running motorsport series set to arrive on the 30th of May for PS5, XSX|S and PC. While there are improvements over last year’s entry across the board, from extensive visual updates through to new systems and features that aim to bring the digital version of the sport closer than ever to the real thing, today’s focus is on the returning Braking Point, the F1 series’ central narrative mode, that drops you into the endless drama surrounding the fictional Konnersport team.</p>
<p><iframe title="F1 25 Braking Point 3 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D52QfcK9qJc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A dramatic event sees the Konnersport team thrown into chaos this time around, and given the real-world drama that surrounds F1, they’ve got plenty to draw from, whether its the loss of sponsorship, drivers moving to another team, rookies nope-ing out of contracts on social media, or some wide-reaching breach of the extensive rules and regulations. Either way, things aren’t looking good at Konnersport, and you’re stepping in here to steady the ship.</p>


<p>New to this year’s entry is branching or alternative storylines, and you can decide which of the Konnersport drivers you’re going to take control of, leading to bespoke objectives for that driver, and a unique storyline conclusion. Whether that means there’s a minimum of two endings, or even more, we’re excited to find out, but it’s great to see Codemasters heaping new content into a mode that’s well-liked, but previously hasn’t had the same mileage as the others. It looks as though you’ll want to play through it multiple times to see all of the possibilities, and that’s a great option for those who tire of the long seasons or the high adrenaline and inevitable crashes of competitive online racing.</p>
<p>That’s not where the story ends though, as once you’ve finished with Braking Point you can take your driver into Driver Career or take the position as their Team Principal in My Team, making them the 11th team on the grid. I especially like this, giving the whole storyline some serious longevity and impact, and there’s also some mirroring of Brad Pitt’s forthcoming F1 movie or upcoming Cadillac team, where they will take this 11th spot.</p>


<p>While the on-screen action is at the heart of Braking Point, the team has made some welcome changes to various technical aspects of the mode, including the appearance of an all-new Hard mode to ramp up the challenge, and updating and revising the facial capture for the drivers using Nvidia’s Audio-to-Face technology through the returning interview sequences, making sure that the drama and high-tension moments look better than ever before. It’ll also benefit from all of the other improvements across the board, making it feel as though this is an essential part of the F1 25 experience.</p>
<p>2025 looks to be an amazing year for F1 storylines, and F1 25 hopes to put itself at the centre of that with Braking Point. We can’t wait to finally get our hands on it in the near future.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-stability-performance-improvements-mods/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oblivion-remastered-new-mods-introduce-stability-and-performance-improvements.1172415/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-stability-performance-improvements-mods/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A couple of Oblivion Remastered mods shared online a few hours ago introduce stability and performance improvements to the game, allowing those with more dated systems to run the game with fewer technical issues.</p>
<p>The No More VRAM Leaks Crashes mod, which was released today by SmokerNaruto on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/399?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, is a modified Unreal Engine 5 configuration file that caps texture streaming to the user's GPU VRAM and disables ray tracing and Lumen to prevent crashes on GPUs with lower VRAM capacity, like 4 and 6 GB. However, improvements for 8 GB VRAM GPUs are also expected, so this mod is definitely worth a try for those who are having trouble running the game properly.</p>
<p>Much like stability, performance in Oblivion Remastered is not particularly solid on anything&nbsp;<span>other than a top-end machine. As such, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/280?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LEGEND FPS patch</a> by NBCoo is another mod that is more than worth a try. It</span> introduces some tweaks that can improve performance without significantly impacting the visuals, such as turning off motion blur, bloom, film grain, and even improving water. Some users, however, have experienced slightly worse performance with this mod, so the experience may vary depending on the system configuration.</p>
<p>After months of rumors and speculation, the Oblivion Remastered was finally confirmed to be real this week with a highly anticipated reveal, which came shortly before the game<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/"> launched</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Developed by Virtuos, the game uses Unreal Engine 5's latest version to deliver improved visuals while keeping the Gamebryo engine for its underlying logic to offer gameplay mostly in line with the original, complete with some choice improvements such as revamped UI and more.</p>

			<p>Today, Polish developer 11 bit studios announced <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3645160/Frostpunk_1886/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frostpunk 1886</a>, a reimagining of the original Frostpunk game powered by Unreal Engine 5 technology. The game is currently slated to launch at some point in 2027.</p>
<p>11 bit studios plan to provide a much improved visual experience, but they won't stop there. Fans can expect a lot of new content, mechanics, events, technologies, and buildings. There will even be an entirely new Purpose path in addition to the existing Faith and Order paths. Additionally, the switch from the original game's proprietary Liquid Engine to Epic's Unreal Engine 5 will also bring mod support, a feature that franchise fans have requested for years, to Frostpunk 1886.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the studio also expressed a desire to continue making content for both <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/frostpunk-2-day-after-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frostpunk 2</a> and this reimagining of the original, keeping both updated for a long time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Frostpunk 1886 | New Game Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q9fw6_MvSss?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The studio didn't share any further specifics, but there'll be time for that, given that we will have to wait for a couple of years. Meanwhile, you can refer to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/frostpunk-chilling-good-stuff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our original Frostpunk review</a> (scored 8.5/10 back then):</p>
<p><em>Frostpunk is unforgiving and punishing but that’s why you’ll invest more and more time into it. It takes what you know about city builders and turns it on heads. It’s bleak, and the beautiful design brings life to an otherwise frozen hellscape. The race against the clock is stressful as you try to make sure everyone is alive while the weather gets colder and colder and materials become more and more scarce. Frostpunk is a pleasant surprise that is definitely worth your time if you’re looking for something different and brutally challenging.</em></p>
<p><em>Frostpunk is a challenging city builder where your decisions have dramatic repercussions on the citizens you’re tasked with looking after in a wintery apocalypse. It's a pleasant surprise that is definitely worth your time if you’re looking for something different and brutally challenging.</em></p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC 25</a> is introducing its first paid battle pass, after previously experimenting with a free version of the feature.
</p>
<p>
Timed ahead of the game's Team of the Season (TOTS) event, EA will roll out a premium version of the Season 7 pass priced at 500k in-game UT Coins, or which you can buy for 1000 FC Points (around £9).
</p>
<p>
Access to this 40-tier pass begins today, 24th April, and will reward tradeable packs, Season Point boosters, TOTS items, evolution consumables and retro cosmetic evolutions. Its centrepiece is an exclusive 96-rated Immortal Icon Franck Ribery, the former French winger who spent most of his career at Bayern Munich. 
</p>
<p>
Announcing the Premium Pass, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-25/news/pitch-notes-fc25-premium-pass">EA said</a> that while this iteration of the battle pass wouldn't change, it would be  "monitoring your feedback to make sure we deliver the best experience possible in whatever mode you play in FC moving forward".
</p>
<p>
Anyone with feedback is invited to provide it via the EA Sports Discord, or EA's own direct feedback portal. 
</p>
<p>
On social media, however, the opinions are somewhat mixed. While some players have pointed to the items within the pass making up for its costs - and Ribery alone being worth the coins - others have said that Ultimate Team is already a money-sucking experience, without another additional thing to buy.
</p>
<p>
"Having Players EXCLUSIVE to the Paid Season pass is extremely greedy and is not the path to go down," <a href="https://x.com/Wildcatz442/status/1915300812835737605">wrote social media user Wildcat</a>. "If its packs/cosmetics/SP/kits im sure 99 percent of the community won't mind. But locking a card like that ribery behind a paywall??? Even if its only 500k coins its just greedy as hell."
</p>
<p>
"Don't get the outrage," <a href="https://x.com/NCFC_CJW/status/1915325530091487610">wrote Norwich City supporter Callum</a>, however. "I ain't sticking up for EA but if that Ribery was an SBC everyone would be happy spending 500k on it 😂 Let alone the other rewards (you even get coins back from tradable packs)."
</p>
<p>
EA Sports recently said that its upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-says-switch-2-versions-of-fc-and-madden-nfl-to-have-feature-parity-with-consoles-as-much-as-the-hardware-allows">Switch 2 versions of FC and Madden NFL would aim to have feature parity</a> with other consoles "as much as the hardware allows".
</p>
<p>
"This is a new FC, with some genuine differences on- and off-pitch," our Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-fc-25-review">Eurogamer's EA Sports FC 25 review</a>. "It's also the exact same FC it's always been."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We now know how much those <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-will-have-paid-upgrades-for-certain-switch-games-bringing-enhanced-frame-rates-and-more">previously announced Nintendo Switch 2 Edition upgrades for games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> will cost. However, I am afraid it is not going to be a 'one size fits all' deal.</p>
<p>As shown on Nintendo's official store, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Breath-of-the-Wild-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2787250.html">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> will cost £66.99 on its release, but those who already own the game on the original Switch can upgrade their copy for £7.99. This is the same for its sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Tears-of-the-Kingdom-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2787249.html">Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>However, while <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Kirby-and-the-Forgotten-Land-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-Star-Crossed-World-2787773.html">Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World</a> also retails for £66.99 via Nintendo, its upgrade back is £16.99. So, £9 more than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a>'s upgrade pack.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that while the Zelda games do both have new features arriving with their Switch 2 editions, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/achievements-can-be-earned-in-switch-2-editions-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom">such as Zelda Notes</a>, Kirby does have new content coming, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-closer-look-at-kirby-and-the-forgotten-lands-remixed-switch-2-worlds">takes the form of a remixed campaign known as Star-Crossed World</a>.

			<p>English voice recording for Final Fantasy VII Remake part 3 may have already begun, judging from a recent social media post.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/english-voice-recording-for-final-fantasy-vii-part-3-likely-underway.1172094/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA forums</a>, Cody Christian, who plays Cloud Strife in the Remake trilogy, recently shared an Instagram story with a caption that suggests the voice actor is recording lines for the character. Considering the story was confirmed to have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/">complete</a>d a few months back, it's not unlikely the script has also been finalized, thus allowing the voice recordings to begin.</p>
<p>Very little is known about the third part of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, except that its development started before Final Fantasy VII Rebirth launched last year on PlayStation 5. As already mentioned, it was confirmed a few months back that the plot for the game is complete, and the concept powering the final part of the trilogy is crucial. One of the features that will set the upcoming finale apart from its predecessor is the ability to explore the world with the Highwind airship, a feature the development team is fully committed to delivering without compromises. Hopefully, this means that even the regions that already appeared in Rebirth will receive some shakeup to make it interesting to revisit them.</p>
<p>While Final Fantasy VII Remake fans who own a PlayStation 5 had the chance to experience the second entry in the series last year, PC players were given the opportunity to play Final Fantasy VII Rebirth only this year. The wait, however, was worth it, also thanks to modders who are introducing features not available in the vanilla game, such as additional <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-new-mods-new-playable-characters/">playable characters.</a></p>

			<p>Ever since we learned via rumors and leaks that Oblivion was returning, it was unclear whether it would be a remaster or remake. The initial wording found in Bethesda's internal documents <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> during the Microsoft vs. FTC trial mentioned a remaster, but then we <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found out</a> that Bethesda had enlisted another developer (Virtuos, the same one that's doing Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater) to port the game to Unreal Engine 5 and make several improvements to areas such as combat, leveling, user interface,</p>
<p>Indeed, after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiling and launch</a> earlier this week, many were surprised at the amount of work that had been done. One of them was original The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Design Director Bruce Nesmith, who became Lead Designer of Skyrim and also worked on Starfield before leaving Bethesda in September 2021 to pursue a career as a book author. <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/original-elder-scrolls-oblivion-designer-was-floored-by-new-release-im-not-sure-remaster-does-it-justice/?callback=in&amp;code=ZTGYZMU0ZTETM2I4NS0ZOGU3LTGXMJETMZIXY2IZOGFINWMX&amp;state=e74208805f8a402a906dbd7c2f353923" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to Videogamer</a>, he said this is closer to 'Oblivion 2.0' than a mere remaster:</p>
<p><em>I spent a lot of years working on that game. A lot of blood, sweat, and tears went into it, along with everybody else on the team. And I intimately knew every single scene that they were showing. And they looked amazing.</em></p>
<p><em>I was assuming this was going to be a texture update. I didn’t really think it was going to be the complete overhaul that they’ve announced it to be… I would not have batted an eye at that. But to completely redo the animations, the animation system, put in the Unreal Engine, change the leveling system, change the user interface. I mean, that’s, you’re touching every part of the game. That’s a staggering amount of remastering. It almost needs its own word, quite frankly. I’m not sure 'remaster' actually does it justice. The closest that could come to categorizing it is Oblivion 2.0.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, the new game is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-seems-to-be-rather-well-suited-to-mods-and-one-of-them-adds-ray-reconstruction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavily moddable</a>. While its graphics run on Unreal Engine 5, the game logic is still powered by the original engine, so several original mods are being ported right now. This could pave the way to many further improvements from the already thriving modding community. There are already 270 mods on Nexus, and it's just the beginning.</p>
<p>Do you agree with Nesmith's statement? Vote in the poll and let us know below.</p>

<p>Personally, I have quite a soft spot for the Sims 4 Island Living pack. This is the one set on Sulani, and it gives Sims 4 players the chance to live out their tropical beachy dreams. Please hand me a cocktail with an umbrella in it right now. Cheers! </p>
<p>Another personal favourite of mine from this batch of leavers is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/batman-arkham-knight">Batman: Arkham Knight</a>. "A confident mixture of familiar gameplay and bold storytelling brings Rocksteady's superhero trilogy to a satisfying, memorable close," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-knight-review-4">Eurogamer's Batman: Arkham Knight review</a> from 2015 (has it really been that long?!).</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghostrunner">Ghostrunner</a>, meanwhile, is a fast-paced cyberpunk action game our Bertie called a "constant joy to play".</p>

		<p>11 bit studios has announced Frostpunk 1886, an expanded remake of the original Frostpunk. The name Frostpunk 1886 has been chosen in reference to the in game lore, when the Great Storm first hit New London. Frostpunk 1886 is going to built up in Unreal Engine 5, bringing the original up to new standards along with additional content.</p>
<p><iframe title="Frostpunk 1886 | New Game Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q9fw6_MvSss?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Frostpunk 1886 will introduce new gameplay mechanics, new laws, new content, and a new Purpose path for players to wander down. Additionally, Frostpunk 1886 will have mod support too. That was not possible in the original release of Frostpunk. 11 bit studio may also consider creating new DLC for Frostpunk 1886. Frostpunk 1886 has moved into development, but it will not release until 2027. 11 bit will continue to develop both Frostpunk 1886 and Frostpunk 2.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/03/frostpunk-review/">Frostpunk Review</a></h2>
<p>In our original Frostpunk review, Jason said, <em>“Frostpunk is a horrifyingly playable post-apocalyptic survival game that demands more out of you than most games ever could. Each decision and each sacrifice you make is hard on your city and on you. There are so many impossible choices and no win situations that the game is almost hard to play, but it’s so compelling that you will be unable to step away from it. The only real negative is the sheer overwhelming nature of the world the game is set in, and really that is more of a compliment to the designers than anything else. Frostpunk is a truly harrowing game in the best possible way and one that will have you steeped in the harsh reality of eternal winter for dozens of hours to come.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/blade-runner-unannounced-game-canceled-by-supermassive/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unannounced-blade-runner-game-canceled-supermassive-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a>, Guildford-based game developer Supermassive Games recently canceled an unannounced game based on the Blade Runner IP.</p>
<p>The game was allegedly titled Blade Runner: Time To Live. It would have been a "character-driven, cinematic, action-adventure game" set in 2065. The plan was to make a "compelling story that blends the philosophical themes of Blade Runner with kinetic action-adventure gameplay," with an expected length between 10 and 12 hours.</p>
<p>Blade Runner: Time To Live started pre-production in September 2024 and was being worked on by the team that made <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-quarry-supermassive-big-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Quarry</a>. Pre-production was supposed to be completed in March 2025, while prototyping was scheduled to end around six months later.</p>
<p>The game's release was tentatively planned for September 2027 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. Interestingly, the report also mentions a potential launch on next-generation PlayStation and Xbox platforms. However, it's hard to imagine that Supermassive would already know so much about Sony's and Microsoft's plans that they would be aware of whether the new consoles will be available then.</p>
<p>Blade Runner: Time To Live was projected to have a budget of approximately $45 million, with $9 million set aside for external performance capture and acting talent. Original music production, image rights, usage fees for actors, QA and game testing, localization, and any future DLCs would have to be budgeted separately.</p>
<p>The game would feature a replicant known as So-Lange as the playable character. It would start in New Zurich, with So-Lange tasked to 'retire' a dangerous leader of an underground replicant network called Rev. However, So-Lange would soon be betrayed and left for dead in a hostile environment. In terms of game mechanics, the report says it would have been possible to upgrade skills and abilities.</p>
<p>The reasons behind the early cancellation weren't detailed, although it is said that Blade Runner IP owner Alcon was to blame. Of course, this is just one side of a story that may never fully come to light. It's a shame, though, as Supermassive definitely has the chops to make an interesting adventure game set in this universe.</p>
<p>It's been a long time since there was any game set in this seemingly ripe setting. Thankfully, there's still Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth, in development at Annapurna Interactive since 2022.</p>

            <p>Developer 11 bit Studios has officially unveiled its new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> game.</p>
<p>It's called Frostpunk 1886, and is a revamped version of the original Frostpunk using Unreal Engine 5. However, 11 bit has said this release won't simply be a visual overhaul of the original. Rather, Frostpunk 1886 will include new content for players to discover, as well as new mechanics, laws, and an entirely new Purpose path.</p>
<p>The upcoming release - which is scheduled for 2027 - will also bring mod support with it, with the developer stating reimagining Frostpink in Unreal Engine "allows the game to become a living, expandable platform". That also means, future DLC is indeed a possibility.</p>
<p>All of this, 11 bit says, will offer up a "fresh" gameplay experience for even the "most seasoned" of Frostpunk-ers.</p>
<p>"The title marks the start of a new era for 11 bit studios - one focused on delivering in-house projects more frequently than ever before," the Frostpunk 1886 team said, promising more details in the coming months. Stay tuned!</p>

            <p>There's still no solid release date for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>, but the studio making the fishy survival game have given folks a glimpse beneath the surface of development in a devlog video. There are shots of a bubbly submarine speeder pod, and a brief sighting of a sea creature that does an annoyed underwater bark at you, before headbutting something it doesn't like. We also get some idea of co-op, with footage of two players helping each other out - a feature that'll be new to this sequel.</p>

<p>"We've taken everything that we've learned from our experience on the previous games
and we've poured it into Subnautica 2," says Design Lead, Anthony Gallegos. The video shows the developers testing lots of stuff in Unreal Engine, like building bases, repairing vehicles, and scanning lifeforms. There's a little taster of what it'll be like to build things side by side with a pal - nothing new for survival games but a still novelty for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>. The plan is to allow up to four players. </p>
<p>It's not a long video and it doesn't make huge waves in terms of its revelations but it does cause a few interesting ripples. One new thing in this sequel is that you'll "evolve your genetics to adapt your body for survival" in the water. And we get a hint of how that'll come about - the player scans some slime and finds "useful genetics", which your computerised assistant recommends you expose yourself to. Of course. What could go wrong?</p>
<p>I could get into every little detail hidden away in the video. I'm intrigued by the environments listed in Unreal, for example. The "Shallows" and "Plateaus" sound familiar to those who've played the first Subnautica (one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">best survival games</a>). But the "Observatory" and the "Graveyard"? I would like to know more.</p>
<p>No. No. I should stop. Subnautica is best enjoyed when you <em>don't</em> know what's lurking out in the depths. All the beauty of Unknown Worlds' survival games comes from piecemeal discovery, in the slow methodical exploration that comes from unlocking a slightly swimmier set of flippers or a breathier oxygen tank, letting you go deeper and further than before. The studio has more of these "road to early access" devlogs planned, they say, but part of me wants to shut my eyes and wait. Subnautica 2 is coming out "later in the year", with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-early-access-should-last-2-to-3-years-itll-launch-with-several-biomes-and-some-narrative">a few biomes and an incomplete story</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
