            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cataclismo-sales-120k-two-weeks<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>publisher Hooded Horse has announced that&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo</em>, the base-building strategy game developed by Digital Sun, has hit a pretty impressive sales milestone just two weeks after its initial release.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/HoodedHorseInc/status/1820552533557014698" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on Hooded Horse's X (formerly Twitter) account</a>,&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo&nbsp;</em>has managed to amass 120,000 sales within its first two weeks of launch, which isn't bad for an Early Access strategy-based city-builder. Looks like that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cataclismo-delayed-early-access">delay and Early Access adoption</a> served Digital Sun well.</p>
<p>In the post, Hooded Horse also announces that&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo&nbsp;</em>has racked up a 93% positive review score on Steam, so it looks like players are taking to its mixture of base-building and tower defense.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cataclismo-sales-120k-hordes.jpg?itok=gBJ87Z8X 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cataclismo-sales-120k-hordes.jpg?itok=mzj9L3WF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cataclismo&nbsp;</em>has captured strategy fans' imaginations, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>The publisher says it's "honored" to work with Digital Sun on&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo</em>, and that Hooded Horse "love[s] building and defending castles". I should hope so, given that's&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo</em>'s bread and butter.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://x.com/DigitalSunGames/status/1820746886619230696" rel="noopener" target="_blank">own X post</a>, Digital Sun says that&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo&nbsp;</em>is its fastest game to surpass 100,000 sales, as well as its highest-rated game on Steam.</p>
<p>It's true; a quick look confirms that shop management sim-come-roguelite&nbsp;<em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/606150/Moonlighter/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Moonlighter</a>&nbsp;</em>has an 82% approval rating, while&nbsp;<em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1457080/The_Mageseeker_A_League_of_Legends_Story/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">The Mageseeker: A League of Legends Story</a>&nbsp;</em>sits at 84%. Those aren't bad scores by any means, but they do make&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo</em>'s success even more impressive.</p>
<p>Admittedly,&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter&nbsp;</em>has far more reviews under its belt, but&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo&nbsp;</em>is comparable to&nbsp;<em>The Mageseeker&nbsp;</em>in terms of review numbers, so the increased score is perhaps a bit more telling there.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digital-sun-cataclismo-sales-the-mageseeker.jpg?itok=qVduXvB8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digital-sun-cataclismo-sales-the-mageseeker.jpg?itok=_Ump3hoy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Mageseeker&nbsp;</em>is Digital Sun's next best-reviewed game on Steam after&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo</em>, it's a strategy game in which you must design a base and then defend it against hordes of slavering monsters.</p>
<p>You'll have access to a wide range of pieces from which to build your bases, and when it comes time to defend them, you'll be able to command soldiers with specialist skills and abilities to help you.</p>
<p><em>Cataclismo&nbsp;</em>is out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422440/Cataclismo/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>. Digital Sun says it's aiming to keep the game in Early Access for "around a year", but that this timeframe could change depending on "player feedback".</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fall Guys is now in Fortnite]]></title>
            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/fall-guys-is-now-in-fortnite</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fall-guys-is-now-in-fortnite.945708/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/fall-guys-is-now-in-fortnite<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Bean-based battle royale Fall Guys now exists within <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, with fresh courses built by developer Mediatonic.
</p>
<p>
The addition of Fall Guys as a permanent part of the Fortniteverse comes after Epic Games acquired Mediatonic back in 2021, and after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fall-guys-developer-hit-hard-by-epic-games-layoffs-but-studio-to-remain-open">extensive layoffs at the British firm last year</a>.
</p>
<p>
For a limited time, you can play Fall Guys within Fortnite's battle royale, via an enormous obstacle course currently floating above the map. Enter into it and your in-game character will be turned into a customised Fall Guy bean. There's also a smattering of limited-time rewards. 
</p>

Outside of Fortnite's battle royale, you can play custom Fall Guys levels made by Mediatonic and additional mini-games made by other creators, who have had access to Fall Guys assets ahead of time.

The tie-up appears permanent, with a dedicated Fall Guys row in Fortnite's main Discover menu, and all non-licensed Fortnite skins given a Fall Guys bean character equivalent.
</p>
<p>
"If we started Fall Guys development over today, we'd do it inside Fortnite," Epic Games executive vice president Saxs Persson told Eurogamer earlier this year, when asked if Fall Guys development would ever solely exist within Fortnite. "But we are where we are, we don't have anything to announce right now.
</p>
<p>
"You learn different things when you're separate, but we truly believe the magic of Fortnite is having fun in a game with your friends so the more players there are, the more content there is, the more fun you have. So by that simple measure, it benefits us to have everything in one place."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-goes-gold-set-to-release-as-scheduled/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/BlackMythGame/status/1820649285450649680" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, developer Game Science announced that Black Myth: Wukong has officially gone gold, meaning its development is now complete.</p>



<p>The team added that the game “will be released as scheduled,” and they are actively working on ” the final stages of experiencing, testing, and deploying the game.”</p>



<p>Further, Game Science revealed that a new trailer is coming on August 8, 2024. The anticipated trailer will premiere at 10 AM Beijing time, or 10 PM eastern time. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear Destined Ones,<br>Thank you for your patience! We're thrilled to announce that the full development of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackMythWukong?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackMythWukong</a>  is complete, and the game will be released as scheduled.😉<br>Right now, our entire team is working hard on the final stages of experiencing, testing, and… <a href="https://t.co/KOpj6F6xtJ">pic.twitter.com/KOpj6F6xtJ</a></p>— Black Myth: Wukong (@BlackMythGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/BlackMythGame/status/1820649285450649680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Black Myth: Wukong pre-orders are available now on PlayStation 5, Steam, the Epic Games Store, and WeGame. However, although Black Myth: Wukong went gold, its Xbox version still doesn’t have a concrete release date.</p>



<p>Game Science first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-wont-be-on-xbox-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced the Xbox delay</a> in June 2024. According to the <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-order FAQ page</a>, the developers are still “optimizing the Xbox Series X|S version to meet our quality standards.” </p>



<p>As a result, the Xbox version will not be available at launch with the other platforms. </p>



<p>Game Science said that “we apologize for the delay and aim to minimize the wait for Xbox users.” The devs carefully say they will “announce the release date as soon as it meets our quality standards.”</p>



<p>Microsoft later <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-issues-statement-on-black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">offered a vague statement</a> only hinting at the potential cause for Black Myth: Wukong’s delay on Xbox.</p>



<p>Black Myth: Wukong will release on PC and PlayStation 5 on August 20, 2024.</p>

                <p>Two iconic and popular modern video game horror franchises are finally crossing over: Dead by Daylight and Five Nights at Freddy's.

            <p>

I don't play much Call Of Duty any more. My feelings about the series have settled back from self-righteous fury over its <a href="https://jacobin.com/2022/10/pentagon-first-person-shooter-video-games-military-recruitment-propaganda">Pentagon-sponsored war-fellating</a> to a quieter, regretful sense that there have maybe been enough Call Of Duty games now, and that it would be nice if we could fill that infamous late October/early November release slot with, I don't know, games about witches instead, or maybe just turn it into a public holiday and spend the week lying on a mattress regarding the ceiling. Still: I've skinned and filleted enough COD in my time to know that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a>'s new "omnimovement" system is going to ruffle as many feathers as it smooths. The short version is that it turns you into Max Payne.

As the cumbersome moniker suggests, omnimovement is all about 360 degree responsiveness. It lets you sprint, dive and slide in any direction at the drop of a bullet casing, and lets you rotate freely while prone in the bargain. It sits alongside some new assists - you can set your character to mantle and sprint automatically, and there's a new "corner-slicing" gimmick that sees you peeking around surfaces automatically while aiming. 
</p>
<p>
The idea, Activision claim, is to make the game both look and feel more "fluid" rather than simply upping the tempo. "It was never a goal with Omnimovement to just make things fast," associate design director Matt Scronce <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-omnimovement/">told Comicbook.com</a> in June. "This isn't the fastest Call of Duty game. Our average speeds - because you can sprint in any direction, and on average, you're probably sprinting a little bit more - are a little bit higher. But it was never about making things fast." Perhaps not, but it looks like it's going to give some players the edge at close quarters. Possibilities include diving through windows and rotating as you land to headshot the poor sucker who thought they were ambushing you.
</p>
<p>
A development build of Black Ops 6 leaked this week, and verdicts and footage are flooding in from unscrupulous sorts who've gotten hold of the goods. I won't post any of that filth here, for Activision's lawyers are ever-watchful, but I'll briefly paraphrase the reactions I've read, which run the expected gamut. Some are calling it the second coming of the exosuits introduced by Advanced Warfare. Some compare it favourably to Quake. Some compare it unfavourably to Quake. 
</p>
<p>
There are the usual concerns that the new movement suite will empower or disempower community favourite playstyles or techniques: omnimovement appears to have wrought the ignoble end of slide-cancelling, for example, though this may just be a limitation of the dev build. There are suggestions that omnimovement will create a new skill gap - omnimovement certainly seems built for showboating pros and their streaming audiences. Pretty much everybody I've read agrees it'll take time to bed in, perhaps more time than is usual for a new COD quirk. I'm curious to know what the duty-callers of the RPS commentariat make of such things. We'll have more to say at the end of the month, if not before - the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-early-access-and-open-beta-dates-revealed">Black Ops 6 beta</a> begins on Friday August 30th for selected players.

"Nothing but open fields and water. No thanks," said Electricengineer. "Caldera, but with water," said SideOfFish. "Have they ever received positive feedback about the inclusion of water?" asked DefunctHunk. "Why are they insisting on shoving it in wherever possible?"</p><p>Avalon is not confirmed to be the next Warzone map, of course, but it's unlikely Activision would have the entire thing built with no plans to use it.

		<p>Everyone loves a good giveaway, and so to celebrate the release of Cat Quest 3 on 8th August (which just so happens to be International Cat Day) we’ve partnered with The Gentlebros and publisher Kepler Interactive to giveaway three EU region codes for the game on PS4 and PS5!</p>
<p><iframe title="Cat Quest III - How To Be A Pirate" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ivqrZCbwZUY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cat-quest-3">Cat Quest 3</a> follows in the paw prints of the first two games, as another light action RPG that’s stuffed with cat-based puns. However, where those first two games were a feline twist on medieval fantasy, Cat Quest 3 plunders the high seas of the Purribean for piratical action. You’ll now be able to hop into a boat and blast away at Pi-rat enemies, while still indulging in all the familiar hack and slash action without getting your fur wet on land. Oh, and just as with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/30/cat-quest-ii-review/">Cat Quest 2</a>, there’s full local co-op support for two players!</p>
<p>Keep an eye out for our review later today, but we went hands on with the game a couple months ago and you can <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/20/cat-quest-3-preview-a-purrfectly-piratical-adventure/">read my preview here</a>.</p>
<p>If all of that sounds purrfectly delightful, then enter our giveaway here:</p>
<p><a href="https://gleam.io/Y5Iqc/win-one-of-three-copies-of-cat-quest-3-for-playstation" rel="nofollow">Win one of three copies of Cat Quest 3 for PlayStation</a><br>
</p>

<p>Please note: as these are EU region digital codes, this is only open to UK and EU residents with a European PSN account – sorry, America-land. Winners will be selected at random, with each winner scoring one of the three digital codes for Cat Quest 3 on PlayStation. The competition <strong>closes at 18:00 BST on Thursday 8th August 2024</strong>. Winners will be contacted by email. Our standard terms and conditions apply.</p>
<p>Cat Quest 3 will be launching across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC on 8th August.</p>

            <p>You’re dead at the start of rhythm-combat  <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> Nocturne, just arrived in some sort of afterlife waiting room after the apparent extinction of humanity. You get your bearings, and you soon meet up with another, only slightly irritating, small child. His name is Kimothy, which sounds like something you’d only say as a joke to annoy friends named Kim, and then only once because it would be stupid to say it again. It’s fine! Leaves flutter, rays of sun cavort through trees, and the music is utterly gorgeous. The game opens on twinkly piano and mournful strings, infused with a good dose of stirring JRPG whimsy, and soon transforms into whatever the genre of music is called that makes you want to immediately go on a massive adventure. Potion-punk. Slime-swing. Limit breakcore etc.</p>

<p>Kimothy challenges you to a fight for your soda, and the fun begins. In terms of input, the rhythm combat is simple. Quick presses and lengthy hold attacks come at you via the traditional musical conveyer belt, and you fend them off one key press at a time. Conceptually not too tricky, but actually quite busy. Kimothy bobs up and down clutching his stick and talking about special moves. I do not think the game is going to let me shove that stick up his nose later, but what are we without hope?</p>
<p>Next up, you find a giant mantis. The game tells me I can sneak past, but I am a slave to the rhythm, so I charge right in. He messes me up pretty bad, but I do pull through, and then it’s off to find more things to rhythm at.</p>
<p>“Master an entirely skill based rhythm combat with fierce battles and unexpected challenges,” reads the Steam page, which also offers a demo. Ah, skill based. There’s my problem. “With multiple difficulty options, Nocturne is a game suitable for beginners and veterans of the rhythm genre.” One of the features is “Befriend a giant orange fish”, and I also like the idea of unlocking each defeated enemy in an optional arcade mode for high score. The game got a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/883590/Nocturne_Prelude/">prelude chapter</a> in 2020, and seems to have come a long way since. It’s due out sometime next year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fluid-motion-frames-2-ai-optimization-performance-enhancements-low-latency-frame-gen/">AMD Fluid Motion Frames 2</a> is a decisive step forward over the previous version of the technology, so much so that the tech experts at Digital Foundry found it to be "stupidly good."</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts offered a first look at the new version of AMD's driver-level frame generation, highlighting how in the tested games - Control, Cyberpunk 2077 and Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 - AMD Fluid Motion Frames 2 typically delivered double the base framerate with much better quality than the first version, which turned off in sequences with really fast motion due to the low quality of the interpolated fast frames. As such, the technology can now deliver a high refresh rate experience with acceptable visual quality even on upper mid-range graphics cards like the RX 7900 GRE.</p>
<p>Despite the improvements brought by AMD Fluid Motion Frames 2, some issues still persist, such as visual quality issues for HUD elements, like the aiming reticle in Control. Even so, the technology shows great potential, as it can deliver a great experience in both fast-paced games and slower-paced titles, even with a low base frame rate. In general, quality is better than Lossless Scaling, the application that offers frame generation on any GPU which is set to offer a <a href="https://wccftech.com/lossless-scaling-frame-generation-4x-fps/">4x FPS option</a> in the future, and while it cannot hold up to NVIDIA DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3 Frame Generation for obvious reasons, AMD FMF2 is still great to have for games that are never going to get frame generation in any form, or emulated games.</p>

            <p>
Fans of Konami's original Silent Hill 2 have been sceptical of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s forthcoming remake, but its CEO Piotr Babieno has called for fans to trust the studio.
</p>
<p>
Bloober is known for developing psychological horror games, but despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-developer-is-excited-and-very-confident">its confidence in the remake</a> fans have been less forgiving in their criticism of trailers shown so far.

</p>
<p>
"I am dreaming that gamers will trust us," Babieno told <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/bloober-teams-piotr-babieno-talks-silent-hill-2-criticisms-1235061338/">Rolling Stone</a>, "but I realise that trust is earned through actions, not through words. So that's why we have a policy of not commenting [on the specifics of the game] and raising hopes. We want to show our ambitions through our work, so we can't ask for anything more than 'give us a chance.'"

<p>
Babieno is sympathetic to the importance of the game to fans of the series. He too is a fan, stating playing the game "changed [his] life".
</p>
<p>
"Despite technological progress [in video games]," he said, "so many of us remember [visiting] the town of Silent Hill as one of the most important points in our lives."
</p>
<p>The original game released on the PS2 back in 2001 and has proven iconic for its Pyramid Head and nurse enemies.</p>
<p>
Thanks to conversations between Bloober and Konami, "we found a great balance of what we and our partner had in mind," said Babieno. "It took us a long time to get there, with a lot of creative discussions and hard work, but we are very happy with the result."
</p>
<p>
Constructive criticism from fans has been taken into account, which so far has been "invaluable in refining our project before its release", though the studio's developers also focus "on their creative work with peace of mind" by shutting out other voices.
</p>
<p>
"We tried to make all possible fans happy, but, at the same time, be very faithful to ourselves," said Babieno. "I really hope that when people play for the first time, they will understand that the choices we made were the best possible."
</p>
<p>
Further, work on Silent Hill 2 is ushering in a new era for the studio as it moves towards delivering horror through action and not just the psychological horror and environmental storytelling it's become known for.
</p>
<p>
Silent Hill 2 will therefore function as "a culmination of my work, but, at the same time, a gateway to the new," said Babieno.
</p>
<p>
The remake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-releases-on-ps5-and-pc-this-october">Silent Hill 2 is set for release</a> on PS5 and PC in October, as revealed at Sony's State of Play in May with a new trailer (see above).

You awake to a world of tree trunks that twist like viscera and corroded contraptions powered by luminous goop that’s stored in the balls, uh, big glass orbs. A beam of light soon fills your character with newfound vigour, which is a nice moment of triumph in what otherwise feels like a deeply oppressive rust pit, all unsteady platforms and jagged pipes.</p>
<p>It doesn’t take long before you start spotting examples of the reason <a href="https://x.com/JuhanaMyllys/status/1820138628447707617">Bionic Bay went viral earlier this week</a>. Above your head hangs a painstakingly detailed mass of vents and cables, looming lifelike with dust and shadow and history. I stood and stared because I’d seen how the sausage was made, but I like to think I would have lingered longer than usual anyway. It really is just that impressive.</p>

<p>Your guy is much more athletic the average hapless <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inside">Inside</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/limbo">Limbo</a> trundler, able to pull of leaping aerial rolls, huge dives, and massive jumps. You’ll need them, too. Laser beams, exploding barrels, and other hazards are rife. It’s much closer to a traditional platformer in this sense, but checkpoints are very frequent. Also, your dude has some powerful ragdoll going on, so it’s also just very entertaining to watch him get blasted across the screen into walls. Soon, you’ll get a little gizmo that lets you swap places with environmental objects, opening the game up to clever traversal puzzles.</p>
<p>It’s also just very creative with its challenges. On one screen, you’ll be timing rolls to match a steam vent's emissions of searing liquid that would otherwise melt you. On the next, you’ll be hoisting yourself up on what look like stars sparkling through a crimson nebula. It very much nails the cinematic platformer feel of being a bumbling little dude, very out of your depth at all times.</p>
<p>In that Xitter clip I shared up top, the artist shows off the incredible amount of work that went into that single tree trunk, then shares a clip of the player character sprinting past the trunk in a few seconds. To pour this much work into something so many won’t notice is madness, which is to say it’s the sort of deeply human expression of artistry that keeps me getting up every morning to write about games. Thanks mates! Bionic Bay has a demo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1928690/Bionic_Bay/">here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
This week sees the release of a new Steam edition of Type-Moon and Kinoko Nasu's dark fantasy visual novel and dating sim Fate Stay/Night. I randomly watched one of Stay/Night's many anime spin-offs, Fate Zero, during the pandemic lockdowns. It triggered a short-lived obsession with the Fate series - I even dipped a toe in the long-lived mobile gacha game Fate/Grand Order. As such, I think I'm the nearest thing RPS has to a Fate "expert". Join me for a brief and sporadically informed tour of a universe that has Shaped The Culture like few others.

<span>「Fate/stay night REMASTERED」Release Announcement PV</span>
<template>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IeHShG5Bv-8?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IeHShG5Bv-8?autoplay=1">
</iframe> </template>
</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeHShG5Bv-8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
Originally released in 2004, Stay/Night is the tale of Shirou Emiya, a schoolboy with the obligatory buried hero complex who gets himself embroiled in a war between mages for the Holy Grail. The mages do battle by summoning legendary heroes to duel on their behalf. Shirou somehow manages to pair off with one of the elites - Saber, aka Artoria Pendragon, a blonde-bobbed, gender-flipped King Arthur. 
</p>
<p>
Saber is absolutely ubiquitous within the Fate universe and beyond. Even if you haven't watched, played or read anything Fate-related, you will likely have come across a homage to the character, aka "saberface", in some other anime or manga. You will also likely have encountered a reference to Shirou's schoolfriend Rin Tohsaka, often referred to as the original twin-tail tsundere (a tsundere is a character, generally a girl, who shows affection towards the main character by being abrasive and standoffish).
</p>
<p>
If Saber is the heart of the series, Fate doesn't want for alternative poster children. Period celebs in Stay Night include a flashy take on Irish mythological hero Cu Chulainn whose tendency to get himself killed off is a running franchise joke, and a repulsive, lecherous interpretation of Sumerian king Gilgamesh. As the "first hero in history", Gilgamesh claims ownership of the legendary weapons wielded by every other hero, and is fond of firing those weapons out of a massive golden portal. He'd do well in Total War.
</p>
<p>
Gilgamesh might be an arsehole, but he is certainly a source of spectacle. When Fate heroes fight, it's an absolute bloodbath, especially when it comes to Ufotable's Unlimited Bladeworks adaptations - aka, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fxrebii_44">Unlimited Budgetworks</a>. These see heroes lobbing castles at each other and performing magic attacks that make Final Fantasy summons look like flicked rubberbands. Later Fate stories like the multiple-period Grand Order series spice things up by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pApAiZymeu0">introducing full-on gods and goddesses</a>. That said, the bulk of Fate Stay/Night is about conversation. There's the opportunity to romance Saber, Rin or their extremely hard-done-by schoolmate, Sakura, and each of these romance plotlines broadly corresponds to a different ending for the overarching battle royale plot.
</p>
<p>
Stay/Night isn't a laidback play. It's extremely easy to make the wrong call and perish without warning - you are, after all, a puny human who has fallen in with various juggernauts from the ancient world. The narratives can be very disturbing - the Heaven's Feel plot path, in particular, is a ghoulish history of sexual abuse.</p>
<p>The original game also features some extremely cheesy, male-gazey sex scenes, but these have been removed from the Steam remaster (which is based on the intervening, non-adult Realta Nua adaptation). If the violence is too much, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62c7_zKoSV8">the Carnival Phantasm parodies</a> are a nice, if deeply discombobulating introduction to the fundamental idiocy of a series in which Shakespeare gets to bandy words with Hercules and Jack The Ripper. There's also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQKgbWm4GWQ">a cosy Fate cooking show</a>, in which Saber, Shirou and co bond over omurice and curry. I'm pretty sure there's a Fate-themed everything, at this stage.
</p>
<p>The new edition of Fate Stay/Night is out on Thursday 8th August, and will be available in English, Japanese and Simplified Chinese. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2396980/Fatestay_night_REMASTERED/">Here's the Steam page</a>.

            <p>
Inflexion Games, the studio behind gaslamp fantasy survival game Nightingale, is "not satisfied with where the game is at".
</p>
<p>
That's according to CEO Aaryn Flynn, who spoke alongside art and audio director Neil Thomson in a particularly candid video discussing what's next for the early access game.
</p>
<p>
Since its release into early access six months ago, Inflexion has focused on quality of life changes, bug fixes, and adding in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nightingale-introduces-highly-requested-offline-mode-in-new-early-access-update">much-requested offline mode</a>. Now, the team is looking to better fulfil its original vision and address shortcomings to the experience.
</p>

<p>

"We are not satisfied with where the game is at, we're not satisfied with the overall sentiment, we're not satisfied with our player numbers," admitted Flynn.
</p>
<p>
While the game has an all-time peak of 47,500 concurrent players, it's <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1928980/charts/">currently peaking</a> at just a couple of hundred players each day.
</p>
<p>
Now the team is debating what's core to the game and what it's comfortable adjusting.
</p>
<p>
To that end, a big update is planned for the end of summer. One major change is adding more structure and clearer progression, as the pair admit the game is currently too open-ended and requires players to be self-motivated in setting goals. 
</p>
<p>
Higher build limits are also on the way, allowing players to create larger and more complex structures, as well as more variety in its fantastical realms. Central to the experience is the sense of adventure, so the team is keen to fulfil that promise.
</p>
<p>
Further, the pair thanked the community for its support and noted that all positive and constructive feedback is welcomed.
</p>
<p>
Our Bertie was disappointed with the game after release, noting the fun is always "just around the corner".
</p>
<p>
"Mostly, I've been in dogged pursuit of an excitement that eludes me, hoping it'll be around the next corner I turn, in the next gear tier I unlock," he wrote in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-nightingale-the-fun-is-always-just-around-the-corner">Nightingale impressions</a>. "But every corner seems to just bring another corner, and so around and around I go, getting somewhere but never there."

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> is out relatively soon and looks relatively exciting, if you're into Ubisoft open worlds and pseudo-Uncharted mechanics with pewpews and dribbly aliens. And if you're excited, prepare to get more excited-er - or more exhausted-er - as Ubi have just unveiled Outlaws' DLC plans for season pass holders. Those DLCs will let you meet "notorious gambler" Lando Calrissian and "veteran pirate" Hondo Ohnaka, who I am definitely familiar with.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The game launches on August 30th and both DLCs will be released after the fact. The first DLC entitled "Wild Card" arrives sometime in Fall of this year, while the second "A Pirate's Fortune" drops sometime in Spring of 2025.</p>
<p>In Wild Card, you'll get embroiled in a "high-stakes Sabacc tournament" where you'll meet Lando, who is a legendary gambler and not home to Ornstein and Smough, or those archers who knock you off those pissing rooftops. And in A Pirate's Fortune, you'll meet Hondo "who is looking to settle old scores with a ruthless gang of pirates", and is not a vehicle with a manual transmission, or an old western flick featuring John Wayne.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/SWO_Seasonpass_Roadmap.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Ubisoft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Now here comes the painful bit. To get access to either of these DLCs, you'll need to purchase a version of the game that comes bundled with the season pass. Right now, it doesn't look like you can purchase the season pass separately… which is dastardly. What this means then, is that if you want both of these DLC packs, you'll need to buy the Gold Edition for £95 or the Ultimate Edition for £115 (for reference, the base game costs £60). Subscribe to Ubisoft+ for £15 a month and it'll grant you access, too. Goodness me, those prices.</p>
<p>Edwin tried Star Wars Outlaws at this year's Geoff Fest and thought it felt about as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-feels-about-as-han-solo-ish-as-well-an-ubisoft-open-world-game">Han Solo-ish as, well, an Ubisoft open world game</a>. "Again, I think all of this will probably add up into somebody's idea of a good time, specifically a Star Warrior who's not played any Ubisoft games for a while," he wrote. "Bland and unwilling as the mechanics can be, they're an adequate delivery mechanism for the setting."</p>
<p>For more on those prices and a few extra bits on the season pass, Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws">site</a> has the details. Otherwise, you can follow Star Wars Outlaws over on Ubisoft's <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/3oDeg1rH3qrXBttnBaxN5Y/star-wars-outlaws-postlaunch-roadmap-revealed">site</a> as well.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-vr2-designed-pc-compatibility/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation VR2 was designed with PC-compatibility in mind from the very beginning, SIE confirmed in a new short interview.</p>
<p>As confirmed to Japanese outlet <a href="https://av.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/review/minireview/1614016.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AV Watch</a>, the importance of PC compatibility was known within the headset's development team, and was taken into consideration during its design phase. Once the PlayStation VR2 was out, the team first worked on optimizing the VR experience on PlayStation 5, and then went on to develop PC compatibility, which is finally coming this week with the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-vr2-pc-adapter-system-requirements/">adapter.</a></p>
<p>Besides asking the three questions to an SIE representative, AV Watch also discussed how the PlayStation VR2 headset works on PC. According to the reviewer, the headset is good enough for a PC VR headset but not the best, mostly due to some issues regarding its sweet post and the general image quality.</p>
<p>The PlayStation VR2 PC adapter will launch tomorrow, August 7th, worldwide. You can learn more about the headset by reading Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-vr2-headset-one-cord-to-rule-them-all/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>With a pricetag befitting of next-generation hardware, the PSVR2 headset offers a virtual reality experience that's unique to the PlayStation 5 ecosystem. Only time will tell if the new technology is worth the investment but all of the design changes and new features make me excited for what's to come in the future for PlayStation VR2.</em></p>

<p>A new leak claims that Fortnite’s battle royale will feature a Fall Guys mini-game in the middle of the match.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by reliable Fortnite leaker Hypex, Fortnite’s Fall Guys collaboration will soon feature a mini-game in the middle of battle royale matches. Players can join this mini-game to obtain Epic and Legendary loot for use in the Battle Royale map. The mini-game will work similarly to the Mothership mini-game that players saw during Chapter 2, Season 7, it was claimed.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Players will find Fall Guys <a href="https://x.com/McMistrzYT/status/1820748712454324280" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statutes</a> spread across the Fortnite Battle Royale map. Players interacting with these statues will be transformed into the ‘Fall Guys beans’ and teleported to a Fall Guys map. Check out the leaked screenshots of Fall Guys mini-game maps in the post embedded below.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>

            <p>
Sales of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> games have dropped compared to last year, despite the high profile release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a>.
</p>
<p>
According to its latest earnings report, the company's overall net sales dropped by 18.4 percent year-on-year for the most recent quarter. 
</p>
<p>
This is driven in part due to a decline in sales of new games. By comparison, the same quarter in 2023 saw the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> and the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters.

</figure>
<p>
However, the company has still turned a profit with its games this year on lower development cost amortisation and advertising expenses.
</p>
<p>
What's more, its MMO sub-segment saw a rise in sales and profits compared to last year. This latest quarter does not include the July release of Final Fantasy 14 expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-review">Dawntrail</a>, though clearly interest has risen ahead of its release. Expect a considerable boost to profits in the next quarterly results.
</p>
<p>
Mobile games, meanwhile, have also seen sales decline "due to weak sales of existing titles", presumably including last year's release of free-to-play gacha game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-ever-crisis-turns-square-enixs-best-into-an-avalanche-of-money-grabbing-tactics">Final Fantasy 7 Ever Crisis</a>. However, profits have increased due to "optimisation of operational expenses".

</p>
<p>
Overall, Square Enix is "continuing determined efforts to strengthen the competitiveness and profitability" of its business.
</p>
<p>
At the start of the year, company president Takashi Kiryu announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-reviewing-overall-game-development-to-improve-quality">review of the company's development system</a>, to boost quality and profits. 

</p>
<p>
As part of this, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-abandons-112m-of-in-development-projects-in-an-effort-to-improve-quality">company abandoned £112m of in-development projects</a> that resulted in a loss for the previous financial year. It's now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">"aggressively pursuing" a multiplatform strategy</a>.


</p>
<p>
It's clear, then, Square Enix is in a reset phase and its restructuring has resulted in a profit despite disappointing sales of its existing games.
</p>
<p>
The company also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-impacted-by-unknown-number-of-layoffs-across-us-and-european-offices">laid off staff in its US and European offices</a> as part of "structural reforms".

</p>
<p>
Sales of Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth were not specifically included in this financial report, though previously it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-underperforming-says-industry-analyst">reported sales were "underperforming"</a>. 

</p>
<p>
The third and final part of that trilogy is yet to be fully revealed or a release window provided, but director Naoki Hamaguchi has confirmed the popular card game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogy-finale-will-receive-revamped-queens-blood-card-game">Queen's Blood will make a "revamped" return</a>.

			<p>Black Myth Wukong, the action role-playing game developed by Game Science, has gone gold today and will be released as scheduled later this month.</p>
<p>The development studio itself confirmed the news with a message on <a href="https://x.com/BlackMythGame/status/1820649285450649680">X/Twitter</a>, adding that the entire team is working hard on the final stages of <em>"experiencing, testing and deploying the game."</em> Before the game launches on August 20th on PC and PlayStation 5, the studio will give another look at Black Myth Wukong with a new trailer that will be shared later this week, on August 8th, at 10 am Beijing time. 10 am will also be the time the game will unlock on all platforms it releases, which include Steam, the Epic Games Store, and PlayStation 5 in the West.</p>
<p>Black Myth Wukong was also supposed to be released on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S later this month, but the game was delayed on Microsoft's consoles to allow the developer to better optimize the game on these platforms, although the delay may also have been caused by some sort of <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-comments-on-xbox-black-myth-wukong-delays-doesnt-want-to-comment-on-possible-exclusivity-deals-from-rivals/">deal</a> with Sony. Unfortunately, a new release date has yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Black Myth Wukong launches on PC and PlayStation 5 on August 20th. The game will also launch on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on a yet to be confirmed release date.</p>

            <p>
The remake of cult classic Lollipop Chainsaw will now arrive a couple of weeks earlier, on 12th September here in Europe and in America. 
</p>
<p>
Lollipop Chainsaw RePop, as this new version is titled, was previously announced as launching on 26th September, for Nintendo Switch, PC via Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
</p>
<p>
After some initial confusion, developer Dragami Games has now made clear that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zombie-hack-and-slash-lollipop-chainsaw-repop-gets-september-release-date">RePop is a remaster of the original game</a> by Grasshopper Manufacture, first launched in 2012, and not a full-on remake. 
</p>
<p>
A surprisingly fun hack-and-chainsaw zombie game, it was the brainchild of No More Heroes' Suda51, with a script penned in part by James Gunn - before his days in the superhero space.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Update！Release date of LOLLIPOP CHAINSAW RePOP（Digital）is September 12 in North America,Central and South America, and Europe.<br>And the retail price has been confirmed $44.99.… <a href="https://t.co/NoNaYXVGpg">pic.twitter.com/NoNaYXVGpg</a></p>— 安田善巳 Yoshimi Yasuda (@yasudaD5) <a href="https://twitter.com/yasudaD5/status/1820610762534244625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>
Dragami has said this new version should replicate the original Lollipop Chainsaw as closely as possible - though will sadly not include the game's licensed music soundtrack. 
</p>
<p>Eurogamer gave the original a mixed write-up when it first landed:</p>
<p>"Grasshopper's latest really is a bit of a lollipop: it's sugary, colourful, insubstantial - and perhaps a bit sickly with it," Christian Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lollipop-chainsaw-review">Eurogamer's Lollipop Chainsaw review</a>. "It all makes for an oddball game that struggles to be odd in the right way."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Popular Fortnite leaks sources ShiinaBR have revealed that some new Dragon Ball Z and X-Men characters are soon arriving in the Item Shop.&nbsp;</p>



<p>ShiinaBR posted two tweets today about future collaborations. The first one revealed new Dragon Ball Z skins for Fortnite, this time from the Android Saga, which will feature Android 17 and Android 18. Shiina added in a <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1820742996477784139" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">later tweet</a> that these skins and their respective backblings should be available for purchase from August 10. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While revealing the Dragon Ball Z skins, the Fortnite leaker also leaked upcoming skins from the X-Men franchise. The latest X-Men characters coming to Fortnite include Cyclops, Jubilee and Colossus. All of these characters have their specific backblings and pickaxes too. Similar to the Dragon Ball-Z skins, the X-Men skins are also encrypted, so for now players will need to wait to see the items in their ‘showcase’ state (in-game).</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Dragon Ball Z and X-Men are not new collaborations for Fortnite, and we have received several characters from these two franchises in the past. Regarding Dragon Ball Z, we already have skins like Goku, Vegeta, Goku Black, Beerus, Frieza, Cell, Bulma, Gohan, and Piccolo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With X-Men, there are a similar number of skins in Fortnite for the franchise, including characters like Wolverine, Deadpool, Rogue, Gambit, Mystique, Dark Phoenix, Magneto, Cable, Domino, Storm and Psylocke. Some of these characters have additional variants, too.</p>

            <p>
Chatty gun game High on Life is set to be turned into an animated TV series, with Curb Your Enthusiasm's JB Smoove signed on as producer. 
</p>
<p>
Smoove starred in High on Life game as Gus, one of the game's talking fish/guns, and <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/08/j-b-smoove-produce-star-series-high-on-life-video-game-1236031133/">Deadline</a> reports there's a "good chance" he'll reprise the role in the upcoming animated series as well as producing the project.
</p>
<p>
High on Life launched in December 2022 for PC and Xbox and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/high-on-life-is-now-the-most-popular-thing-on-xbox-game-pass">was the year's biggest launch on Xbox Game Pass</a>, but proved controversial even before release, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/high-on-life-contains-ai-art-and-voice-acting">it emerged the game included AI art and voice acting</a>.

Just weeks after High on Life launched, Rick and Morty creator Justin Roiland - co-founder of the game's development studio <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/squanch-games">Squanch Games</a> - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rick-and-morty-high-on-life-creator-justin-roiland-charged-with-domestic-violence">charged with domestic violence</a> (charges which were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rick-and-morty-high-on-life-creator-finally-responds-to-allegations">later dropped due to "insufficient evidence"</a>). Still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rick-and-morty-co-creator-departs-high-on-life-studio-he-founded-following-allegations">Roiland departed Squanch and was fired from Rick and Morty by Cartoon Network</a>.
</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/high-on-life-is-now-available-on-playstation-4-and-5">PlayStation version of High on Life</a> launched in the summer of 2023 for PS4 and PS5.
</p>
<p>
Smoove is now working with Squanch and his own production company, Alternate Side Productions, to adapt the property into a Rick and Morty-style series.
</p>
<p>
"When Squanch Games originally reached out to JB Smoove (I like to talk about myself in the third person) about voicing a character in their incredible video game High On Life, my first question was what does my character look like? They told me that I would be a fish that shoots... which makes perfect sense to me! As a vegan I feel a fish should have the right to defend itself! I mean right?!" Smoove said. 
</p>
<p>
"And now that I'm partnered with Squanch Games and Striker Entertainment to bring the hilarious High On Life to series it feels like it was inevitable! They invited me to join them in the gaming universe and now I'm helping them move into the TV world! It's a case of a game recognising game! High on Life is wild, weird, and wonderful, and the series is going to be that and more! Get ready to laugh your way through space with some unforgettable characters like myself! We are locked and loaded and ready to go!"
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer was less a fan of High on Life in its review.
</p>
<p>
"A miserable cocktail of ideas from other action-platformers and the worst parts of Rick and Morty," Edwin Evans-Thirlwell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/high-on-life-review-a-mediocre-shooter-with-an-unfunny-attitude-problem">Eurogamer's High on Life review</a>, dubbing it "a mediocre shooter with an unfunny attitude problem".

<p>Black Ops 6 is fast becoming one of the most-leaked Call of Duty games ever. In recent days, we’ve seen full multiplayer matches uploaded to YouTube, streams appear on TikTok, and even a PS4 build of the game has appeared online. Everything from perks to weapons and from movement mechanics to multiplayer maps has been exposed online for all to see.</p>



<p>Activision Blizzard is trying to keep pace with DMCA strikes and takedown notices, but at the moment, it’s like fighting a wildfire with a water pistol.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-months-in-advance">Months In Advance</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 isn’t due to be released until October 25, 2024. However, scores of content have been released online <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-multiplayer-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showcasing the game’s multiplayer</a> platform and everything you’d need to know about it more than three months in advance. </p>



<p>While the multiplayer offering has been plastered online for all to see, little has been revealed regarding the single-player portion of the game or the new Zombies mode.</p>



<p>Most recently, an unfinished, mid-development build of the game was released to repositories online, giving players unparalleled access to an early version of the upcoming first-person shooter. It was arguably the most devastating point in the line of Black Ops 6 leaks that have wormed their way onto social media in recent days.</p>



<p>Toward the end of August, Activision is hosting Call of Duty NEXT, a showcase designed to reveal the future of the ecosystem – and it’s also when the first multiplayer reveal will take place. Unfortunately, the only edge the team will have over the leaks is that the version of the game they’re showing will be much more polished.</p>



<p>Even Warzone hasn’t proven immune to the Black Ops 6 leaks – recently, the ‘2025 map’ known internally as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-new-map-avalon-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avalon was revealed</a> in full.</p>

<p>It was recently reported that JB Smoove is on board to produce and potentially star in an animated show set in the universe established in 2022’s High on Life. The quirky, bizarre first-person shooter was released last year to a positive reception, and since it dropped, many have commented on the game’s potential to be converted into an animated series.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-perfect-for-television">Perfect For Television</h2>



<p>High on Life is an original and entertaining title with a unique story that sees players battle all types of alien lifeforms in a fight to stop humans from being consumed as a potent drug. It’s a humorous and satirical title with ‘Rick and Morty-like’ funnies written into it. </p>



<p>One of the more kooky elements of the game is that all the player’s weapons are sentient lifeforms themselves, each with a unique personality and the ability to influence the player’s actions.</p>



<p>Per the <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/08/j-b-smoove-produce-star-series-high-on-life-video-game-1236031133/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report published by Deadline</a>, JB Smoove is set to produce an animated adaptation of High of Life, working side-by-side with Russell Binder, Mandy Bardisbanian, and Alec Robbins, who worked as the narrative director on the 2022 game. </p>



<p>In a statement, Smoove said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Now that I’m partnered with Squanch Games and Striker Entertainment to bring the hilarious High On Life to series it feels like it was inevitable!&nbsp;They invited me to join them in the gaming universe and now I’m helping them move into the TV world! It’s a case of a game recognizing game!&nbsp;<em>High on Life</em>&nbsp;is wild, weird, and wonderful, and the series is going to be that and more!&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In recent years, the concept of the live-action adaptation has blossomed immeasurably, and that naturally extends to animated adaptations, too. Earlier this year, we saw Fallout released on Prime Video to an overwhelmingly positive reception, and before that, The Last of Us scooped Emmy Awards for the first season of the show that debuted in 2023.</p>
