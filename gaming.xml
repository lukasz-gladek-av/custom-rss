            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grounded-steam-microsoft-account<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new update for downsized survival game&nbsp;<em>Grounded&nbsp;</em>has been released, and if you're not a fan of having to sign into your Microsoft account when you play on Steam, this is the update for you.</p>
<p>Per the update's (admittedly small) <a href="https://grounded.obsidian.net/news/grounded/grounded-patch-145" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patch notes</a>, you'll no longer need to sign into your Microsoft account if you want to play&nbsp;<em>Grounded</em>'s multiplayer modes with your friends.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're not logged into your Microsoft account, you can now host and join standard multiplayer sessions with other players who are already on your Steam friends list, so if you've been hoping to enjoy&nbsp;<em>Grounded&nbsp;</em>without your Microsoft account getting in the way, today's your lucky day.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grounded-microsoft-account-steam-multiplayer.jpg?itok=o2frAHft 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grounded-microsoft-account-steam-multiplayer.jpg?itok=Povo7SAg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Grounded&nbsp;</em>no longer requires you to sign into a Microsoft account to play multiplayer on Steam.</figcaption></figure><p>There is one major caveat, though. If you want to play&nbsp;<em>Grounded&nbsp;</em>cross-platform, or you want to play on shared worlds or in Playgrounds, you're still going to need to sign into your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>As well as this change, Obsidian and Microsoft have also implemented a new switch that lets you toggle between a Crossplay State and a Steam Native State, and you'll need to be in the same state as your friends to see them online.</p>
<p>If you prefer, you can also unlink your Microsoft account from your Steam account completely via&nbsp;<em>Grounded</em>'s Options menu; just navigate to Game, then Unlink Microsoft Account. Again, though, this will prevent you from accessing some of the game's features on Steam.</p>
<p>Naturally, if you're playing&nbsp;<em>Grounded&nbsp;</em>on Game Pass, you'll still need to use your Microsoft account to access it, so there haven't been any changes on that front.</p>

<p>This change comes in the wake of the controversy surrounding Sony requiring a sign-in to a PlayStation account in order to play its games on PC, with&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>coming in for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-account-link">particularly vicious criticism</a> over this decision.</p>
<p>Eventually, Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-backtrack">walked the change back</a>, and the fact that both&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Grounded&nbsp;</em>don't require external accounts will probably set tongues wagging the next time a Sony game hits the PC.</p>
<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Grounded&nbsp;</em>is available right now across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/962130/Grounded/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/grounded/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/grounded/9pjthrnvh62h" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/grounded-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259402/devolver-digital-big-fan-licensed-indie-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Devolver Digital has announced the creation of a new publishing label designed specifically for licensed games. The label, named <a href="https://www.bigfangames.com/">Big Fan Games</a>, is helmed by industry veterans who have worked with brands like Disney, Dark Horse, and more. In a press release, Devolver said that the new company’s goals are “helping independent game developers breathe new life into their favorite movies, comics, TV shows, and cult heroes through the power of video games.” Big Fan already has a number of games on its roster, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/23/17764070/reigns-game-of-thrones-hbo-devolver"><em>Reigns: Game of Thrones</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/11/23791503/a-hellboy-game-that-looks-like-the-hellboy-comics"><em>Hellboy Web of Wyrd</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/18/18682291/john-wick-hex-hands-on-mike-bithell-interview-e3-2019"><em>John Wick Hex</em></a>.</p><p>Licensed games were a big portion of the video game industry in the late ’80s and early ’90s. A lot of games that have been enshrined in older gamers’ imagination as being harder than the games of today were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/4/12375434/disney-video-games-aladdin-the-lion-king-the-jungle-book-gog">licensed platformers like Disney’s <em>Lion King</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/26/4265996/making-ducktales-remastered"><em>DuckTales</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/9/22969751/tmnt-classic-games-bundle-konami-ps4-ps5-ninja-turtles-retro"><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em></a> on the NES. However, their quality started to decline, and soon, licensed games became thought of as little more than interactive commercials. </p><p>Though sentiments regarding licensed games have changed, the team at Big Fan is aware of the stigma, sharing in the press release that the “goal at Big Fan is to nurture fun and inventive games that stand on their own, rather than serving as marketing tie-ins for other media launches.”</p><p>The launch of a label centered on licensed properties seems right on time as those kinds of games are experiencing a new renaissance and attention from the industry’s biggest studios. Respawn Entertainment has seen enormous success with its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/15/20965741/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-xbox-ps4-pc-respawn">duology of</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23697355/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Star Wars</em> games</a>. <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</em> launched in 2022 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/18/23172898/tmnt-shredders-revenge-classic-arcade-game-interviewhttps://www.theverge.com/2022/6/18/23172898/tmnt-shredders-revenge-classic-arcade-game-interview">to critical acclaim</a>. MachineGames is due to release <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24040391/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-gameplay-trailer-xbox-bethesda">a new <em>Indiana Jones</em> video game later this year</a>, while IO Interactive, maker of the <em>Hitman</em> franchise, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575090/james-bond-game-origin-io-interactive-007-project-hitman">is working on a James Bond game</a>.</p><p>Big Fan seeks to keep the trend going, saying that “independent games created in these universes can explore them in new and unexpected ways, and it’s our goal to raise the bar of what fans can expect.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>For reasons that seemingly amount to japery, Google have unveiled a double-sided, endlessly looping keyboard design – but only in Japan, and they’re not actually making it. However, the blueprints for 3D-printing it are freely available on <a href="https://github.com/google/mozc-devices/tree/master/mozc-doublesided">GitHub</a>, which is enough to convince me that someone needs to develop some kind of chaotic party game that uses the Möbius strip-shaped Gboard (good spot, <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/peripherals/keyboards/google-showcases-bizarre-double-sided-japanese-keyboard-which-it-wont-sell-the-keyboard-uses-a-mobius-strip-as-its-foundation">Tom’s Hardware</a>) as a controller.</p>

<p>While the keyboard itself is quite literally a joke – see its tee-hee ho-ho 'trailer' above – I am dead serious that it could be the centrepiece for an enjoyably competitive, 2-4 player button mash-off that would make the average <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-jackbox-party-pack">Jackbox</a> session look like a model UN meeting. The circular, omnidirectional shape makes it perfect for gathering round in a group, and its fully mechanical keys – besides giving the Gboard some cred as a gaming peripheral – should be hardy enough to survive the furious bashing that 'friendly' party games inevitably devolve into.</p>
<p>As for the actual game design... I’ll leave that to the pros, though inspiration is out there. Chiefly, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/play-unique-alt-controller-delights-at-egx-2023-in-london-this-week">Karting Khaos</a>, a simple top-down racer that we hosted at the Future of Play booth at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/egx-london-2023">EGX 2023</a>. Each player gets assigned a kart, but their steering and acceleration controls are randomly assigned across 24 comedy quiz show buttons – producing thrillingly disorganised contests, as racers hunt for their gas pedals and contend with mid-race input scrambles. It’s tremendous fun, and in the course of writing this paragraph, I have become tremendously sad that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamer-has-a-new-parent-company">Gamer Network sale</a> means I won’t be able to hang around the booth playing it again this year.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>Still, bigger picture: a keyboard like this twisting monstrosity could easily allow us to recreate Karting Khaos’ madcap vibe, but in the comfort of our own homes, and without the need for a table-sized controller. Just one about as big as a generous birthday cake, and that can fascinate mathematicians for centuries.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>XR Games, the VR studio behind games like Starship Troopers: Continuum and Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded, has told a number of employees that they are at risk of being laid off.</p>



<p>According to a number of employees on LinkedIn — first reported by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-vr-studio-xr-games-placing-72-employees-at-risk-of-redundancy-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a> — management has said that at least 72 employees are at risk of redundancy. For those that may not know, being at risk of redundancy means that a position is being considered by a company for termination. While it’s not necessarily a set in stone decision, it can be viewed as a writing on the wall type of move.</p>



<p>The moves come as part of a “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/joe-hopson-664381162_opentowork-activity-7246871973954301954-B1a3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive restructuring</a>” at XR Games.</p>



<p>“Multiple redundancies (72 to be exact) are taking place at the company,” QA project lead Tamara Whymark said. “I know the games industry is hard at the moment but I also want to give support for all my colleagues, they’re some of the most talented people I’ve ever met so please keep your eye out for them!”</p>



<p>XR Games recently released Hitman 3 VR: Reloaded to numerous criticisms due to the quality of the game. It prompted the studio to <a href="https://x.com/xrgamesvr/status/1833192314891571244" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release a statement</a> saying that the game’s release didn’t meet their “high expectations”. They also said that they were committed to updating and improving the game to meet those expectations of both players and the company.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to XR Games for comment on the reported layoff plans.</p>



<p>So far this year, the gaming industry as seen <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 13,000 known</a> positions lost across nearly 150 companies. It’s expected that more layoffs will happen as the year comes to a close.</p>

                <p>Fortnite has slowly become the ultimate Celebrity Deathmatch game featuring, collaborations with Pixar, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-update-introduces-iron-mans-stark-industr/1100-6482006/" data-ref-id="1100-6482006">Marvel</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naruto-is-coming-to-fortnite-on-november-16/1100-6497915/" data-ref-id="1100-6497915">anime series</a>, and even real-life celebrities like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-adds-will-smiths-bad-boys-character-mike-lowrey/1100-6495685/" data-ref-id="1100-6495685">Will Smith</a>, Eminem, Lady Gaga, and now--possibly--Shaquille O'Neal. According to a leak by the famous Fortnite leaker <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1840828705150804316" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ShiinaBR</a>, Epic Games has teamed up with the basketball and entertainment icon to release cosmetics based on him to Fortnite on October 4.</p><p>Shaq, who sometimes goes under the alias of DJ Diesel, posted a clip of his latest set to <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@shaq/video/7420143472214297902?lang=en" rel="nofollow ">TikTok</a> Monday night. You can briefly see the screens at the venue showed brief clips of Shaq's apparent in-game Fortnite model (warning for those with photosensitivity).</p><p>"Toronto...last night was EPIC ;)", Shaq posted along with the video, with the not-so-subtle nod to the Fortnite maker.</p><p>Shaq's quasi-reveal is just one of the characters to join up shortly as the game's annual Halloween event, Fornitemare, as Shiina also <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1841030598049018179" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed</a> horror icons like the Saw franchise's Billy the Puppet, Leatherface from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise, and a spooky version of DJ Marshmello are on the way.</p><p>Obviously this is not the first time Epic Games has made skins based on NBA teams or specific players. In 2022, Fortnite released skins of the 30 teams in the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-fortnite-nba-skins-celebrate-75-years-of-the-league-alongside-in-game-all-star-hub/1100-6500732/" data-ref-id="1100-6500732">entire league</a>.

While Max has gone on to have his own successful career in the video game industry, working on titles like <em>Assassin’s Creed Unity</em> and <em>Battlefield 1</em>, it’s impossible to completely escape his father’s shadow.  However, as he told <em>MinnMax</em>, it was actually <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steven-spielberg-star-wars-arcade-colbert-interview-1850185237&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steven-spielberg-star-wars-arcade-colbert-interview-1850185237">Steven Spielberg and his love of video games</a></span> that got Max interested in the medium and the industry. </p><p> “He loves gaming. He’s the one that got me into it. He plays games.

He plays the campaign,” said Max. </p><p>Interestingly, Max explained that his father, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-steven-spielbergs-ambitious-video-game-failed-to-ta-452572284&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-steven-spielbergs-ambitious-video-game-failed-to-ta-452572284">who loves story-focused games</a></span>, never learned how to play games using a controller and is more comfortable using a keyboard and mouse.

I can only do keyboard and mouse.’”</p><p> As mentioned in the MinnMax interview, Max’s father doesn’t come up much at work as people are usually professional and not looking dig for info or stories. But Max Spielberg has shown his upcoming game, <em>Lynked: Banner of the Spark,</em> to his dad for feedback. His father said that the co-op hack-and-slash game that also features town-building and roguelike elements looks great. And while Max’s father doesn’t usually come up during development, Lynked’s art director Eric Kozlowsky pointed out, “You can’t help but feel like [your] doing something right” when Steven Spielberg likes your artwork or designs. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.playlynked.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.playlynked.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Lynked: Banner of the Spark </em>arrives on Steam via early access on October 22</a></span>. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With a total of five characters and eight unique class options (not counting each character’s default classes), you’ll have a total of <em>40</em> possible classes to use in your active party. That’s a lot of choices, especially since you can only use three of them at once!</p><p>Truthfully, it’s hard to say what the “best class” or the “best team” is in <em>Visions of Mana</em>. Each character can fulfill different party roles depending on their class, ranging from pure damage dealers to dedicated supporters. In the end, how you synergize your active team’s abilities and exploit your enemies’ weaknesses will matter more than the specific classes you choose. But if you’d like a little nudge to figure out how you should build your team into the awesome monster slayers you know they can be, consider using the classes we’ve picked here.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Evaluations are based on how each class performs throughout the game, not just their endgame potential. For this reason, skills each class learns in the first two tiers of their Elemental Plot will be typically weighed much higher than tier three and tier four skills.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="536f297973550f2ba50d14c0452be81f" data-recommend-id="image://536f297973550f2ba50d14c0452be81f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rune Knight" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rune Knight" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="536f297973550f2ba50d14c0452be81f" data-recommend-id="image://536f297973550f2ba50d14c0452be81f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rune Knight" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><h3 id="h153157"><a id=""></a><strong>Key Stats</strong></h3><p>Strength, Stamina<br></p><h3 id="h153158"><a id=""></a>Val: Rune Knight Details</h3><p><strong>Rune Knight is your best damage dealer in the early game of <em>Visions of Mana</em></strong>. It’s the first character class you can unlock, and comes right out of the box with two elemental imbuement skills and a great 20 percent attack boost when Val uses said imbuements. Exploiting elemental weaknesses can skyrocket your outgoing damage, so this class will help you tear down even the bulkiest of foes. Val can learn more imbuement skills as he unlocks new classes too, which lets Rune Knight scale well into the mid and late game.</p><p>Once Morley can use his first Chalice to unlock the second tier of his Elemental Plot, Val may fall behind as a main damage dealer for reasons that will become apparent later.

This class gives Val knockback resistance, a damage boost for hitting elemental weaknesses (which we’ve established Val is good at), and a built-in healing option thanks to Dryad’s Elemental Vessel.

Nightblade is one of Morley’s strongest classes from the minute you recruit him, but it’s not terribly impressive at first. However, once you access the second tier of skills in his Elemental Plot, everything changes. A 20 percent critical hit damage increase <em>and</em> an absurd 70 percent critical hit rate buff increases his damage potential to ludicrous heights. Augment his critical hit rate and damage further via Ability Seeds, and all of the sudden you have a lightning-fast attacker who can stack dozens of guaranteed critical hits in a handful of seconds.</p><p><strong>I strongly recommend using Morley as your main damage dealer</strong>. The only downside is that, unless you’re playing on hard mode, a well-optimized Morley might make the game too easy. Even Luna’s Elemental Vessel ability works well with this class, since it can stop enemies in their tracks while Morley unleashes a flurry of powerful attacks. Between great damage and the ability to stunlock several enemies in the game, what more could you ask for?</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6eb1549ed76be5918b8b0a9409679fd4" data-recommend-id="image://6eb1549ed76be5918b8b0a9409679fd4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Grand Diviner" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Grand Diviner" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6eb1549ed76be5918b8b0a9409679fd4" data-recommend-id="image://6eb1549ed76be5918b8b0a9409679fd4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Grand Diviner" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><h3 id="h153165"><a id=""></a><strong>Key Stat</strong></h3><p>Intellect<br></p><h3 id="h153166"><a id=""></a>Palamena: Grand Diviner Details</h3><p><strong>Nobody uses magic like Palamena, and the Grand Diviner class lets her do what she does best</strong>.

This means you can set Palamena to “All-Out Attack” and “Go Wild” in her battle AI and she’ll almost never run out of magic throughout a dungeon.

And of all the classes Julei can pick, High Cleric is the healer-est of them all. With a sky-high Spirit stat and a buff that doubles the healing potential of Julei’s moves, the little sproutling will become easily capable of topping off a party member’s HP with a single spell. But really, because High Cleric gives Julei his most foundational healing and status recovery spells, you’ll want to invest in this class no matter how you build Julei.</p><p>Once Julei does unlock his third tier of skills in his Elemental Plot, the Healing Light + spell massively elevates his usefulness. The ability to functionally heal the entire party’s HP in a single cast is borderline essential for the game’s hardest challenges, and the Strong Roots skill will help him survive one fatal blow per battle. I highly recommend giving Julei resistance to status ailments and strong defenses so he can always bring your party back from the brink.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7bdd9d070fb3ad2acb1abdb36b69d662" data-recommend-id="image://7bdd9d070fb3ad2acb1abdb36b69d662" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Necromancer" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Necromancer" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7bdd9d070fb3ad2acb1abdb36b69d662" data-recommend-id="image://7bdd9d070fb3ad2acb1abdb36b69d662" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Necromancer" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><h3 id="h153171"><a id=""></a><strong>Key Stats</strong></h3><p>Spirit, Stamina<br></p><h3 id="h153172"><a id=""></a>Julei: Necromancer Details</h3><p>Julei’s Necromancer is incredible on paper, but the game provides precious few opportunities for it to really excel.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/smite-developer-hi-rez-studios-holding-layoffs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Hi-Rez Studios, the developers of Smite and Smite 2, is the next studio holding layoffs during a year full of them. </p>



<p>The announcement came via a Twitter post by Hi-Rez CEO Stewart Chisam. In his <a href="https://x.com/schisam/status/1841072179028324382" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lengthy message</a>, he said that the decision to layoff “some team members” comes with a “focus on positioning SMITE 2 for a long and sustainable future.”</p>



<p>“Today, we’re making some difficult but necessary changes to ensure Hi-Rez’s long-term success, with a specific focus on positioning SMITE 2 for a long and sustainable future,” Chisam said.</p>



<p>While there was no mention of just how many people would be let go due to the “internal reorganization and reprioritization”, Chisam says that it will “disproportionately” involve people in marketing and publishing positions. He added that it will impact people from Evil  Mojo, G&amp;A, and Titan Forge divisions of the company.</p>



<p>He also said that the layoffs show a “failure” in his leadership at the company.</p>



<p>“This news has a real human impact at a tough time for workers in this industry,” he said. “Each impacted individual is a talented and dedicated professional who has poured their heart and soul into our games. Letting them go is a heartbreaking decision, reflects a failure in my leadership, and one for which I take personal accountability.”</p>



<h2 id="h-why-the-hi-rez-layoffs-now">Why The Hi-Rez Layoffs Now?</h2>



<p>Chisam says that the layoffs come after a “comprehensive review” of the company’s strategy. The decision was made to put full efforts into Smite 2 moving forward with small teams remaining to support the original Smite and Paladins. He then says that the development team on Smite 2 remains larger than the first game.</p>



<p>“Notably, the core dev team currently working on Smite 2 after these changes is still a significant size: Larger than the Smite 1 team was throughout most of its lifecycle (outside of a period during and shortly after the pandemic),” he said. “The team working on gods and gameplay features (versus skins and monetization/progression/system features) is larger than the SMITE 1 team ever was for such features.”</p>



<p>Chisam closed his statement saying that that he believed the changes were necessary albeit difficult, and that the company will “emerge stronger from them”.</p>



<p>Through the first nine months of 2024, the gaming industry as seen <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 13,000 known</a> positions lost across nearly 150 companies.</p>

fully constructed, you can check out some cool Easter eggs hidden in this plastic bust. For example, there's a Chaos Emerald inside of Shadow, his base contains several gold rings, and he comes with a nameplate to attach to his display. This version of Shadow is based on his very first appearance in Sonic Adventure 2, a 2001 game for the Sega Dreamcast.</p><p>Shadow has starred in several other video games over the decades--including that one 2005 game where he had a cool motorcycle and lots of guns--and he'll be appearing on the big screen in Sonic the Hedgehog 3.

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater celebrated its 25-year anniversary on September 29, 2024. Below, we look back at how it began, and its influence as an unconventional platformer.<br></em></p><p dir="ltr">The 1990s were a wild time for skateboarding. Professionals like Tony Hawk were pushing the limits of what seemed possible by nailing unbelievable stunts for the first time in history--the loop of death, a 16ft ollie between water towers, and the first 900. Little did we know that these stunts and the people behind them would become part of the foundation of one of the greatest platformers of all time: Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.</p><p dir="ltr">The 1999 classic has officially turned 25 this year. Its legacy of incredible arcade gameplay--the one that spawned eight sequels, millions in sales, and countless kickflips and heelflips--is still as prevalent today as it was when the X Games were at the height of their popularity. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater brought skateboarding to a new level of cultural significance as people of all ages, kids especially, found their way to real-world skateboarding after shredding through the digital remains of an old abandoned mall.</p><p dir="ltr">Tony Hawk and other skaters weren't just turning skateboarding into a phenomenon, they were turning it into an extreme sport. Skateboarders were practically superheroes while ollieing through traffic and grinding across power lines in the real world. The Birdman wanted to replicate that feeling in a game when he set out to partner with a studio. The demo from Neversoft made anyone–not just skateboarders–feel like they were superman with a skateboard.</p><p dir="ltr">"Activision called me and I knew right away that was exactly what I wanted to work on," he said in a 2017 interview with <a href="https://www.jenkemmag.com/home/2017/01/13/the-oral-history-of-the-tony-hawks-pro-skater/" rel="nofollow ">Jenkem</a>. "It was already fun to play, you didn't have to know how to skate, and the controls were easier to understand."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4376708-thps1%2B2_ss_launch_screenshots_thawk_108_4k_final.png" data-ref-id="1300-4376708" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4376708-thps1%2B2_ss_launch_screenshots_thawk_108_4k_final.png" data-ref-id="1300-4376708"></a><figcaption>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 remastered the classics</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4376708-thps1%2B2_ss_launch_screenshots_thawk_108_4k_final.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Birdman's romp from a Warehouse in California to a secret military facility in Roswell, New Mexico is seen as one of the best skateboarding games of all time for how it captured the culture of skating with its music and style, but another reason Tony Hawk's Pro Skater became such a sensation was because its exploration and platforming are some of the most invigorating in the genre. The simple movement, especially for a release that came just years after Super Mario 64, was as sharp as any other platformer out there.</p><p dir="ltr">"We never wanted you to accidentally do something you didn't want to do. Even if that was cool. We wanted it to do exactly what you were telling it to do," said Tony Hawk's Pro Skater producer Scott Pease in a 2019 <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2019/8/30/20838769/oral-history-tony-hawk-pro-skater-soundtrack-les-claypool-neversoft-activision" rel="nofollow ">interview</a> with The Ringer. "When you actually physically push that button and then you get snapped into that rail, it feels like you're doing something, versus the game kind of playing itself."</p><p dir="ltr">Sure, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is a sports game, and a skateboarding game if you'd categorize that as a whole genre, but its core mechanics set Tony Hawk besides the likes of Mario, Astro Bot, and the Fall Guys. Like any great platformer, the core of the game is about navigating tricky jumps with precision timing, and chaining your movements together into one impeccably smooth line. Like those heroes and their catalog of wild adventures, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater had its fair share of arcade zaniness.</p><p dir="ltr">Grinding across the top of a movie theater's showtime display in Minneapolis and doing an ollie over a cable car in San Francisco were just a couple of things that you'd never see in the real world unless Red Bull set up a stunt for it. Those were simply challenges and fun things to do while riding around in an open space.</p><p dir="ltr">Each of those early parks was a seamless combination of exploration, platforming, and eventually style-themed challenges where each two minute long run provided a different kind of fun. First you'd just explore to get the lay of the land, then you'd try and find all the secrets, and finally you'd find the fastest and most efficient way to collect everything and earn the most points in a level. It was a recipe for replayability.</p><p dir="ltr">Each following game did a little to make their parks feel more alive. Pro Skater 3 brought pedestrians, Pro Skater 4 brought animals, and Underground actually let you get off your board to explore things up close.</p><p dir="ltr">The original <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</em>, built on the framework of Neversoft's earlier project <em>Apocalypse</em>--which featured Bruce Willis blowing things up--had straightforward movement mechanics. There was a limited set of tricks and the primary way to combine tricks was to grind and wall ride. Later games would improve on this, bringing in the manual, natural ways to combine tricks, and better game development technology that made riding a skateboard in a digital space tighter.</p><p dir="ltr">The combination of fantastic movement and open playgrounds was widely appealing. It made Tony Hawk's Pro Skater a game that almost anyone could jump into. The tricks were important, but the ability to go your own way was the real attraction.</p><p dir="ltr">"A lot of people did say, 'You can't really do that. You can't just make a game that's pure tricks. It's not going to work, no one's done that. It's not real, man, you'd run out of speed.' So we had this big internal debate," Pease said in a separate <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/7/22/5926545/neversoft-tony-hawk-guitar-hero-close" rel="nofollow ">interview</a> with Polygon. "We just started to lean into the natural act of skating in a real environment, going anywhere, exploring, finding your own lines and being creative.”</p><p dir="ltr">The history behind the studios that have made the Tony Hawk Pro Skater series--including the games that would eventually drop the Pro Skater title and the eventual 2020 remaster--have disbanded. Neversoft, the studio behind the 1999 hit, disbanded in 2014. Vicarious Visions, the team behind the 2020 remaster, was folded into other Activision Blizzard teams.</p><p dir="ltr">Even though the team that is behind it is no longer working on the series, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 was a gigantic success. It sold more than a <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/-i-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-1-2-i-sells-1-million-copies-in-less-than-two-weeks" rel="nofollow ">million copies</a> in the span of two weeks. Players have continued to dig into the games create-a-park mode, despite little support for the remasters online modes.</p><p dir="ltr">The love that players--not just skateboarding fans--have for the simple joy of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater gameplay is incredible. They were devastated when reports that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-remake-was-reportedly-rejected-in-favor-of-more-call-of-duty-content/1100-6523189/#:~:text=Tony%20Hawk's%20Pro%20Skater%203,Call%20Of%20Duty%20Content%20-%20GameSpot">remake</a> of the second and third game in the series was rejected in favor of Call of Duty development.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4376709-thps1%2B2_ss_launch_screenshots_thawk_82_4k_final.png" data-ref-id="1300-4376709" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4376709-thps1%2B2_ss_launch_screenshots_thawk_82_4k_final.png" data-ref-id="1300-4376709"></a><figcaption>Hawk grabbing some serious air</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4376709-thps1%2B2_ss_launch_screenshots_thawk_82_4k_final.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Activision has said that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is an "<a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/tony-hawks-pro-skate-25th-anniversary-interview-save-state/" rel="nofollow ">important core</a>" franchise for it today, sparking some hope that more remakes and new games could be in the future. Under new ownership at Microsoft, perhaps it's a franchise that will be revisited. It would be fantastic to see a new game continue to evolve the incredible premise of a skateboarding platformer, but the legacy of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater will forever live alongside Mario.</p><p dir="ltr">"Thanks to Activision, Neversoft (RIP) and all of you that played THPS in those formative years," Tony Hawk said in an Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAgXDa1PI8a/" rel="nofollow ">post</a> to commemorate the games 25th anniversary. "I'm not supposed to tease anything else about the future of the series, but there will be a future."</p><p dir="ltr">There is as much demand for fantastic platformers today as there was in 1999 as Astro Bot, Super Mario Odyssey, and even Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 have shown us. Players, both new and old, would immediately feel right at home on the digital concrete of a new Tony Hawk game, especially if The Birdman is still making sure the game experience lives up to the hype of real-world skateboarding.</p>

I’m dead serious. Games are a form of art—and, in my opinion, one of the most impactful. But if your goal is to create timeless, undying art for future generations to discover, skip this article.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The AI era is here. While doomsday scenarios and tech singularity make for interesting conversations, the real story is how AI is changing the way we create content—just like the Industrial Revolution did for manufacturing. Content is now cheaper, faster, and easier to produce.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this landscape, you have two choices:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Try to produce pixels faster and cheaper than robots.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Become someone who defines what pixels need to be produced, and most importantly, why.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The global entertainment industry is entering a phase where, to maintain at least some control, you must own a cross-media franchise—a fictional universe that can be adapted into commercial entertainment products across multiple media types.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Only 0.1% of companies own cross-media franchises. Another 0.1% can buy them. The remaining 99.8% will have to figure out how to create New IPs with cross-media franchise potential.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Investing in New IP is risky, yes. But the concept of “New IP” itself is often unclear. As a result, we don’t invest in it often enough for patterns to emerge, and when we do, we’re doing it wrong.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">IP stands for Intellectual Property, meaning your tweet, a poem for a loved one, a fantasy book series, a photo, sports performance stats, a video game, a brand mascot, or even a drilling rig design—all fall under this category. However, in the video game and narrative-driven entertainment industries, we often give IP a very specific meaning. Yet, when asked, even industry experts may fumble, mentioning a brand, a cool story, or a bloated production budget with uncertainty. So let me put it straight for you: New IP is a commercial entertainment product designed with the intention to become a cross-media franchise. And that’s what we’ll be talking about here.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s a monumental task to pull off something like a New IP. You and your team will learn a lot and transform along the way. There’s no playbook, but let’s look at the key do’s and don’ts to help navigate your New IP development journey.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>1. In the very beginning, ask yourself what you’ll do if this IP is a success</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. When you develop a new game, you have the odds stacked against you. About 80% of games don’t make it to release. About 19 out of 20 that do release fail or underperform for various reasons. You’ll have to figure that out, but don’t lose sight of the bigger picture. The question that will get you in the right mindset is, what if you succeed? Let me give you an example. You all know the game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Journey</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—a beautiful, iconic indie project that sold millions of copies on multiple platforms. But then what? As a visual commercial entertainment product and as an IP, it’s nothing more than two black triangles over a yellow background. You can’t make a movie or TV series out of that; no comics, books, action figures, or even stickers for messengers. So, don’t find yourself in a situation where all the odds played in your favor, but now you're left with one option: get your act together and make another game—with all the risks associated with it. To avoid that, you need an IP-first mindset. The easiest way to achieve this is to ask yourself from the very beginning: What will I do with it if it succeeds?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>2. Franchise architecture before picking a setting</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Before you start writing lore and going deep into characters, locations, and artifacts, and even before you pick a setting, you need to clearly define the franchise architecture. You need to design the amusement park layout before you pick a theme and start building attractions. If I asked you what the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game of Thrones</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> franchise architecture is, you might say fantasy, dark fantasy, political strategy, episodic structure, or even zombie apocalypse—but those are just the surface. George R.R. Martin used archetypal individual traits like courage, greed, lust, and intellect and applied several modifications to each. For example, courage could be justice-seeking (Starks), bloodthirsty recklessness (Dothraki), or personal gain (Bronn). He then turned these traits into factions represented by characters, creating a system that works like a kaleidoscope: for every instance (scene, chapter, episode, season, storyline), you pick 3-5 of these characters/factions and see how their traits play out. He also applied a constant pressure on the system, called a "main conflict"—for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>GoT</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it was the ancient threat of extinction. This pressure created a perfect "content treadmill." The setting here helps unlock the system’s potential. If you understand franchise architecture, you’ll know exactly what went wrong with Season 8 of the TV adaptation. So start with franchise architecture:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Unit of action</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>GoT</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, this would be character traits. You could use archetypes, species, political systems, galaxies, etc.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rules of interaction</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>GoT</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, this would be character motivations and capabilities. Define what’s possible in your world.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pressure</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>GoT</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it was a global existential threat. Use the highest-stakes conflict or paradox that cannot be ever resolved.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Experiment with these components. You’ll notice you don’t even need a setting at this stage.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>3. The setting is the reason why people will come</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. When building a New IP, the setting is a strategic choice that helps you unlock your franchise architecture. Some systems work best in realism, others in fantasy, alternative history, or the distant future. The goal is to make your world believable and avoid unconscious disbelief. Hundreds of fantasy blockbusters have taught audiences that dragons are real, while sci-fi has trained them to accept teleportation and time travel. The setting also defines who will be attracted to your IP and what they will expect. If you think, "Everyone uses elves in fantasy, but I’m special so I won’t," read the first paragraph and think again.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The most lucrative segment for cross-media franchises is Geeks. They have literally funded the success of 100 titles from IMDb’s Top 250, 194 of the top 250 Metacritic games, and 138 of the top 200 box office titles. Twelve high-demand settings resonate with this audience: Fantasy, Dark Fantasy, Sci-Fi &amp; Multiverse, Cyberpunk, Heroic Adventure, Urban Legend, Post-Apocalypse, Noir/Dark Detective, Action Blockbuster, Myth-Legend-History, Alternative History, and Anti-Utopia &amp; Social Satire. Pick one, but remember that by doing so, you’ll attract people educated by hundreds of successful titles in that setting. They have a mental bookshelf with the setting’s name, packed with the best examples. Your task is to embed what they love most and add innovation on top.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>4. Experience is the reason why people will stay</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. To get your IP to the market, you need a product. In this case, a game. But before thinking about features or your favorite genre, consider your audience. Look at your franchise architecture and chosen setting, and ask: What’s the best way for people to experience what I’ve envisioned? What do you want them to do and feel? Answering these questions will make choosing a genre a conscious decision and may even inspire meaningful innovation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>5. 1-800-WHO-CARES. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">In 2015, Justin Guarini’s viral tweet said: “Starlord: Galaxy. Superman: Earth. Spiderman: NYC. And then there's Daredevil micromanaging the shit out of 10 blocks in midtown Manhattan.” (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://x.com/JustinGuarini/status/624423465420988416">https://x.com/JustinGuarini/status/624423465420988416</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">). The point is, the scale of your world and the problems it addresses are key predictors of adoption and commercial potential. Think of the difference between Lord of the Rings and A Wizard of Earthsea. Both have much in common, but LotR focuses on a larger-than-life struggle between good and evil, while Earthsea is a personal psychological journey. Saving the universe from an evil overlord will always outshine overcoming childhood trauma in Boring, Oregon.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Ubisoft staff asked bosses over the course of several months to delay <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, a new report has claimed, as the need for further time became clear. 
</p>
<p>
"While the announcement was somewhat of a shock publicly, internally, it was expected and desperately needed," <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-context-around-the-assassins-creed-shadows-delay/">Insider Gaming</a> writes, based on the accounts of seven developers working on the project. 
</p>
<p>
The report cites a need for Shadows' developers to be given additional development time to address bugs and better incorporate recent "tweaks" to gameplay mechanics based on playtests and mock reviews (a standard practice where external consultants size-up projects before copies are given to press).
</p>
<p>
Of particular note here is the mention that Ubisoft is taking time to address historical and cultural concerns that have lingered since before the game was publicly revealed and been accelerated since. This includes "changing some of Yasuke's story and how he's portrayed", as well as what sounds like more minor design decisions. 
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft did not respond to Eurogamer's request for comment on the report today. Previously, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-team-acknowledges-elements-that-have-caused-concern-among-japanese-fans">publisher apologised to Japanese fans</a> for elements "that have caused concern" and said Shadows will continue to "evolve" while in development.
</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer previously, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-developer-on-adapting-japanese-culture-social-media-pressures-and-ubisofts-controversial-apology">Assassin's Creed Shadows art director Thierry Dansereau defended the game's creative choices</a>. "It's a video game in the end, so we want to make the best experience as possible for our players," he said.</p>
<p>
Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">ultimately agreed to delay Shadows last month after seeing "softer than expected" sales for Star Wars Outlaws</a>, which has now reportedly just passed the 1m sales mark after launching on 30th August. (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a> notched up 1.8 million players in a week back in November 2020.)
</p>
<p>
The publisher has also embarked on a bid to improve Shadows - which currently sits with a middling user score on Metacritic and which failed to impress in Eurogamer's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">Star Wars Outlaws</a> review - before its arrival to a wider audience on Steam.
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows will now arrive for PC (including Steam), PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 14th February 2025.

<p>A few details have been shared in the report, including the game's PC exclusivity with Epic thanks to a major investment - last year's game was one of the earliest to use its Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>The sequel promises gameplay improvements, more game mode options, a "more commercial" art style and narrative, and "elevated production values".</p>

<p>It will also include full shared-progression co-operative multiplayer as well as a single player campaign.</p>
<p>Hexworks is targeting a 2026 release for the game, with more details expected to be revealed next year.</p>
<p>That's not all. CI Games is working on a further two projects over the next few years, both currently in pre-production.</p>
<p>The first, is Project SGW Evolved, the next in the Sniper Ghost Warrior series. It has a targeted release of 2027 and will have strong appeal to both core and wider audiences though its first-person shooter and survival gameplay.</p>
<p>The second is Project H from Underdog Studio, a new action-RPG with shared systems and development architecture with both Lords of the Fallen and its follow-up. It's targeting a 2028 release.</p>
<p>Overall, CI Games is taking a "player-first development approach", focusing on quality over quantity.</p>
<p>Lords of the Fallen has been a success for CI Games, with 72 percent of company revenue in the first half of 2024 generated from that game. By the end of 2023 (the game released in October), it had sold over 1.3m copies.</p>
<p>However, the game launched in a poor state with plenty of performance issues, as outlined in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lords-of-the-fallen-2023-review">Eurogamer's Lords of the Fallen review</a>.</p>
<p>Since then, Hexworks has made myriad improvements, reaching the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lords-of-the-fallen-final-update-introduces-modifiers-for-rogue-lite-challenge">final stage of its free content roadmap</a> in April this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The first one, aptly called Potato Version, is best used for low-end hardware like the Steam Deck and the actual Nintendo Switch, caps the game's resolution at 576p, allowing the game to run at a smoother framerate. According to the modder, overclocking can lead to a more stable 60 FPS experience. The mod's second version, on the other hand, is best used on powerful machines to achieve smoother and more stable framerates. It can also be used in conjunction with resolution mods to achieve better-looking visuals with smoother performance.</p>
<p>It is a shame that only a few Nintendo Switch users will be able to take advantage of The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Stabilize FPS mod, as a hacked console is required to run mods, but still, it's definitely good to know that some users will be able to enjoy the game on native hardware without the performance issues it is plagued by. While it is more about modernizing the series 2D formula rather than revolutionizing it, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is still a very solid game that all fans of the series will surely enjoy. You can learn more about it by checking out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom brings some new ideas to the table, but in the end, the game is more about modernizing the classic 2D Zelda experience. The attention-grabbing echo copying mechanic has its pros and cons, but where Echoes of Wisdom consistently hits is in the tried-and-true design of its world and dungeons, which are as good as any the franchise has delivered in the past. This may be Zelda's first starring adventure, but past Legends still echo strongly here.</em></p>

<p>Microsoft is sunsetting the production of its HoloLens 2 mixed-reality headset. First reported by <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/microsoft-discontinuing-hololens-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">UploadVR</a>, Microsoft is discontinuing the HoloLens 2, five years after it launched in 2019.</p>



<p>For those that own the headset, it will still receive “update to address critical security issues and software regressions” until December 31, 2027. At that time, all support for the device will stop. </p>



<p>For those with an original HoloLens headset, support for that device ends on December 10, 2024.</p>



<p>As far as the future goes, there are no plans at this time for another HoloLens headset. In 2022, it was first reported by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-hololens-3-metaverse-mixed-reality-strategy-confusion-rivalries-2022-2?ref=uploadvr.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Business Insider</a> that the HoloLens 3 was cancelled at Microsoft. That was followed by multiple rounds of layoffs in the mixed-reality division of Microsoft in the following years.</p>



<p>Instead, Microsoft will focus on supporting the current device for three more years while also focusing more on software and partnerships. Microsoft has brought its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/meta-quest-adds-xbox-cloud-gaming-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Cloud Gaming service</a> over to Meta’s Quest headsets.</p>



<p>Do you own a HoloLens headset? Let us know your thoughts on the HoloLens 2 being discontinued in the comments below, or in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-case-for-seeing-megalopolis.997461/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/francis-coppola-megalopolis-aubrey-plaza<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Francis Ford Coppola’s strange film <em>Megalopolis</em>, which premiered in theaters this weekend, has been extremely divisive. Even if you think you’ll hate it, I think it’s worth seeing. It’s a spectacle that might be the last of its kind.</p><p>I truly don’t think that <em>Megalopolis </em>is all that difficult to understand, but the promotional materials are also not very explanatory, and the film sort of dumps you in without much of an explanation. This is a story about Cesar Catilina (Adam Driver), the head of the city of New Rome’s “Design Authority” and an architect who has recently won a Nobel Prize and gained the power to stop time. The fact that he can stop time is not that big of a deal. As the inventor of the new building material called Megalon, he’s been battling Franklin Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito), the mayor of New Rome, to build his Megalopolis, which he envisions as a utopia, in the middle of New Rome. Their relationship continues to degrade as Cicero’s daughter, Julia Cicero (Nathalie Emmanuel), becomes Catilina’s apprentice.</p><p>Further dragging Catilina down are the Pulcher siblings, Clodio (Shia LaBeouf) and his sisters Clodia, Claudette and Claudine, who are wealthy socialites whom the film repeatedly emphasizes are sleeping with each other. Clodio, Catilina’s cousin, sees him as a rival for the inheritance of their banker uncle, Hamilton Crassus III (Jon Voight). Crassus has also recently married Catilino’s former mistress, Wow Platinum (Aubrey Plaza), who is desperately scrabbling for some form of power.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Megalopolis (2024) Official Trailer - Adam Driver, Giancarlo Esposito, Nathalie Emmanuel" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pq6mvHZU0fc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The movie does have a pretty straightforward plot, but it is mostly about Caesar and Cicero’s circular arguments about what makes a utopia and whether it is worth striving for. But there’s also many tangents: There’s a thirty minute subplot about a pop star embroiled in a sex scandal that features two full songs and is totally irrelevant to the plot. For every twenty minute sequence where Caesar and Julia talk about art and society and fall in love, there was a plot development that made me mutter “what the fuck is happening.” There's a gladiatorial carriage race in Madison Square Garden.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s baffling to watch, but I admire its earnestness and its ambition. If nothing else, it’s a movie worth seeing for an absolutely committed performance from Aubrey Plaza, who plays Wow Platinum like a caged lion. This movie made me truly believe that Plaza is one of the best actresses of her generation.</p><p>This is clearly an old man’s last great message to the world (it ends with a pledge of allegiance to humanity; it is not a subtle film). It’s a kind of big budget movie that hardly gets made anymore, and for reasons that are obvious: Coppola self financed <em>Megalopolis</em> to the tune of $120 million, and it earned $4 million over the weekend. Even while budgets for blockbuster films balloon—<em>Deadpool and Wolverine</em> had a budget of $200 million—the money available for anything outside the mainstream has shrunk. While I’m lucky enough to live in New York, where everything hits theaters for at least a couple of days, even crowd pleasers like Best Picture winner <em>Everything, Everywhere, All At Once</em> <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/everyone-is-seeing-everything-everywhere-all-at-once/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had to scrape its way into a wide release</a>.</p><figure><figcaption>Megalopolis. Photo Credit: Courtesy of Lionsgate</figcaption></figure><p>In a move that has made the fandom-brained mad at him for years, Martin Scorsese pointed out the unfortunate dwindling landscape for movies in an op-ed for the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/opinion/martin-scorsese-marvel.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Times</a> in 2019.</p><p>“Why not just let superhero films and other franchise films be? The reason is simple. In many places around this country and around the world, franchise films are now your primary choice if you want to see something on the big screen. It’s a perilous time in film exhibition, and there are fewer independent theaters than ever,” he wrote. “The equation has flipped and streaming has become the primary delivery system. Still, I don’t know a single filmmaker who doesn’t want to design films for the big screen, to be projected before audiences in theaters.”</p><p>Francis Ford Coppola comes from the same cohort as Scorsese, and is from a generation of filmmakers for whom showing their movies in a theater was a foregone conclusion. While Scorsese has had a few of his films financed by Netflix—films I wish I could have seen in a theater—Coppola has been disillusioned by the studio system entirely, opting instead to sell a portion of his vineyard to self finance this bizarre film.</p><figure><figcaption>Aubrey Plaza as Wow Platinum in Megalopolis. Photo Credit: Courtesy of Lionsgate</figcaption></figure><p>Like Catilina, Coppola is someone who experienced a lot of success early. While Catilina ends <em>Megalopolis</em> empowered to make his utopia a reality, Coppola has lived in the shadow of his explosive early works like <em>The Godfather</em> and <em>Apocalypse Now</em>. As his work got more personal and more experimental, audiences recoiled. The only reason why <em>The Godfather III</em> exists is because Coppola’s passion project <em>One From the Heart</em> tanked, leaving Coppola in debt. As the years went on, he became less and less interested in making movies in order to make money; instead, he’s been grasping towards some ideal of cinema itself, a process that involves telling Aubrey Plaza “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/29/movies/aubrey-plaza-megalopolis-my-old-ass-agatha-all-along.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In the next take, you’re a spider</a>.” He is a kind of filmmaker who comes to set without fully formed ideas, asking his actors to improvise the movie along with him as he goes. At this point in time, studios seem especially unwilling to finance a hundred million dollar experiment. In order to get <em>Megalopolis </em>made and shown in a theater as it was intended to be seen, you kind of just have to be Francis Ford Coppola, and there’s only one of him.</p><p>It’s probably really good that we no longer let young men go to <a href="https://variety.com/2019/vintage/features/apocalypse-now-production-1203309358/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">warzones to shoot movies in grueling productions that last over a year</a>; one of the flaws of auteur theory is that it valorizes the idea of a “great man” who is enabled to hurt other people in the name of great art. I’m glad that that style of filmmaking is widely extinct, but I also long for the kind of art that level of freedom over a production creates. If <em>Megalopolis</em> is the last peek into the mind of this weird crank, then it’s a lovely send off. I doubt I’ll ever see anything like it ever again.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>We are in a golden age for indie horror right now. Titles like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/03/crow-country-review-scream-park-fun/">Crow Country</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/04/signalis-review/">Signalis</a>, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/12/hollowbody-review/">HollowBody</a> have taken the genre into new directions whilst clearly showing reverence for the games that inspired them. In an era of flashy remakes and increasing focus on graphical fidelity it is nice to have games that concentrate on the looks and feel of the PS1 classics. The latest entry in this field is Becrowned, a true retro survival horror that more than borrows from Konami’s Silent Hill series.</p>
<p><iframe title="Becrowned – Official First Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Er73I15tbls?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The central protagonist is a man named Richard Torrance, but with he demo starting <em>in media res</em> rather than being the opening section of the game, there’s not much more to say about him than that. The Steam page describes him as a ‘man of strong will and unbreakable character’ which sounds like the beginning of a hubristic journey to me. There seems to be some kind of Dante-esque story with definite themes of punishment and regret which has always worked for the more psychologically infused Silent Hill over the action focus of Resident Evil.</p>


<p>That being said, there is plenty of combat included in the Becrowned demo, including a familiar feeling boss fight. The sense of familiarity is exacerbated by the demo being set in a hospital, further bringing it into direct comparison with its predecessors. The staccato movement of the enemies and their inhuman appearances are straight out of the Masahiro Ito playbook and fit right into the dark and grimy environments. You find both melee weapons and guns to fight off these foes but ammo is limited – although not as severely so as in some other games.</p>


<p>There doesn’t seem to be inventory management at play here, which seems to be a common shift in the current generation of indie horror. I can see the generic appeal of juggling items but it isn’t something I miss when games remove the limitation. Puzzles involve finding items and unlocking blocked areas with a couple of really well designed examples in the demo. One puzzle in particular requires you to interpret a poem in order to rearrange a bookshelf filled with Gothic classics – not surprisingly, as an English Literature lecturer this felt laser targeted to my interests.</p>
<p>Graphically, Becrowned looks suitably dingy and hellish, although the devs have shared some more expansive and open environments on social media, so there may be a welcome variety in the full game. Most of the demo takes place in very tight corridors but it is possible to dodge enemies in traditional survival horror fashion. The retro aesthetic is further achieved through a VHS-esque filter that gives the grainy effect that we know and love. Sound effects are creepy and atmospheric with unpleasant slapping footsteps and inhuman screams.</p>

<p>While my experience with the game was a positive one, there are some notes of caution to raise. Rather than being loosely inspired by Silent Hill, Becrowned currently needs to find more of an identity of its own. HollowBody managed this through the futuristic British urban setting and I’m keen to find out how 13th Street Studio will push this incredibly solid foundation into something that stands on its own merits. The reliance on radio static and the hospital setting feels like an overzealous tribute to Konami’s series. Running felt a little clumsy at times and there seems to be an overly punishing stamina system in place which makes dodging through groups of enemies a little hit and miss. There are also some balancing issues to work through, especially with one enemy having a spit attack with an overpowered range and damage, whilst the boss fight could benefit from a little more signposting (and possibly not being a one-hit kill).</p>
<p>I enjoyed my time playing through the demo a couple times. The first time I took my time to fully explore and think through the puzzles whilst trying to collect every item I could, whilst the second was more of a speed run. The latter is helped by the puzzle solutions being static rather than randomised so you can sequence break to some extent by opening coded doors out of order – doing so too liberally will result in you not gaining the essential firepower you’ll need for the boss fight though.</p>
<p>Becrowned truly captures the essence of classic Silent Hill and will make for a really interesting comparison to the Bloober Team remake coming out soon. With a little more confidence in finding its own identity it could even look to compete with these classics.</p>

			<p>It's been a short time since the South Korean publisher Krafton decided to save Tango Gameworks, acquiring the studio in August after Microsoft decided to shutter it just a few months prior. While Krafton has acquired Tango Gameworks, the only IP they acquired along with it was Hi-Fi Rush, which happened to be a BAFTA-winning rhythm game that reached three million players. The decision to shutter Tango Gameworks came as a huge surprise to many, especially after making a game as successful as Hi-Fi Rush. Tango Gameworks is also responsible for The Evil Within and Ghostwire: Tokyo, but unfortunately, those IPs were not acquired by Krafton.</p>
<p>Krafton now has a dozen studios under its belt, which includes Bluehole Studio, Neon Giant, PUBG Studios and now, Tango Gameworks as it's 13th acquisition. However, they aren't planning to stop there with acquisitions, and want to continue to expand their library.</p>
<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/we-dont-want-to-just-replicate-successful-games-behind-kraftons-acquisition-of-tango-gameworks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussion with GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Maria Park, the head of Corporate Development over at Krafton it was explained how the acquisition came to be and what it meant for Krafton as well as for Tango Gameworks.&nbsp; Park explains that in an attempt to diversify their portfolio, they have met with 200 to 300 studios in the last quarter alone in an attempt to find new developers to invest in. As a result, this led to the acquisition of Tango Gameworks, where they immediately flew over to Tokyo to meet with Tango.</p>
<p>While with most acquisitions, a lot of the staff are either axed or left of their own free will, Krafton has made efforts to keep on as many of the pre-existing staff from the company as possible. Out of 100 Tango employees, at least 70 to 80 are moving over to work at Krafton, with some of the positions being backfilled. However, they expect that the numbers will end up at around 100 by the end of the year or the beginning of 2025.</p>
<p>In the interview, it's stated that Tango was <a href="https://wccftech.com/we-dont-think-hi-fi-rush-2-is-going-to-make-us-money-says-krafton-ceo/">already working on Hi-Fi Rush 2</a> by the time Krafton started talking with them. When it came to getting the IP from Microsoft, they were surprised that they were lucky enough to obtain it. "We spoke with Phil Spencer directly, and we have their direct support. He has been incredibly accommodating to the needs of the Tango team."</p>
<p>Park states that they have been doing thorough research into the Japanese market for a year. "It was hard to find small to medium-sized studios who are in pursuit of their own titles. a lot of them were work-for-hire studios. This was one of the rare opportunities."</p>
<p>As a result, acquiring Tango is the first significant investment in the Japanese video game market, and they are making sure to be cautious. "We'll continue to pursue opportunities in the Japanese market for sure, but it's not like we'll be actively investing in a high number of studios over a short period. Yes, there'll be more to come for sure."</p>
<p>While the acquisition has taken a while, most of the team from Tango was onboarded in early August, and Krafton were talking to Microsoft once or twice a week during August to make sure that the acquisition went smoothly.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/devolver-announces-new-publishing-label-for-licensed-indie-games.997425/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/devolver-big-fan-games-licensed-indies<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Devolver Digital has announced a brand new publishing wing called Big Fan Games, which is dedicated to publishing indie games based on existing licenses.</p>
<p>In a press release, Big Fan says that it thinks there's "room for a new approach" when it comes to licensed games. The studio says its goal is to give indie studios the chance to "make the call", take risks, and explore unique game ideas that "aren't dictated by spreadsheets".</p>
<p>The publishing label will be staffed by a "small but passionate team of industry veterans" with experience working with intellectual properties like&nbsp;<em>Dune</em>,&nbsp;<em>Hellboy</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, and&nbsp;<em>John Wick</em>, among others.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hellboy-web-of-wyrd-big-fan-games.jpg?itok=UR11cj8P 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hellboy-web-of-wyrd-big-fan-games.jpg?itok=-ypaxQHH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Big Fan Games is now the retroactive publisher for&nbsp;<em>Hellboy: Web of Wyrd</em>, among other games.</figcaption></figure><p>Per <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/devolver-launches-big-fan-games-a-publishing-label-dedicated-to-movie-tv-and-comic-book-adaptations" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an interview with GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Big Fan currently has "six active projects in development", although the studio is tight-lipped about what those projects are and what they're based on.</p>
<p>The studio says its aim is to release around four or five games a year, and it's also taking suggestions from indie developers and studios regarding licensed projects they might be working on.</p>
<p>Retroactively, the publishing label has also claimed a number of games previously published by fellow Devolver subsidiary Good Shepherd, including&nbsp;<em>Hellboy: Web of Wyrd</em>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/john-wick-hex"><em>John Wick Hex</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em>Reigns: Game of Thrones</em>.</p>
<p>Judging by a <a href="https://www.bigfangames.com/news/big-fan-working-in-partnership-with-rebellion-to-create-games-based-on-the-iconic-2000-ad-universe-copy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">rather strange official announcement</a>, it's also apparent that Big Fan is now the publishing label that will be working alongside Rebellion to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/good-shepherd-rebellion-2000-ad">create a game based in the&nbsp;<em>2000 AD&nbsp;</em>universe</a>, best known for authoritarian anti-hero Judge Dredd.</p>
<p><em>John Bi</em></p>

<p>Given that we don't currently know what projects are in the works at the studio (except for the aforementioned <em>2000 AD&nbsp;</em>game, of course), it's difficult to guess whether or not that's true, but stay tuned to find out more about what Big Fan is up to.</p>
