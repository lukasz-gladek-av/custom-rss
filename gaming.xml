<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/no-rest-for-the-wicked/" id="2611">No Rest for the Wicked</a> is currently an action role-playing game in Early Access. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/moon-studios/" id="1402">Moon Studios</a>, known for the Ori series, plans to increase the game’s price from $40 to $60 after it leaves Steam Early Access and launches version 1.0.</p>



<p>The game is currently on sale at 40% off. Thomas Mahler, Creative Director of the game, <a href="https://x.com/thomasmahler/status/2016906516754808905?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweeted </a>to explain the sale and reiterate plans to move the game to $60 once it’s released in full.</p>



<p>“I’’m not trying to do any FOMO marketing here, but yes: when we hit 1.0, No Rest for the Wicked will move to $60, because it’s a premium title,” he said.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Since I’m getting a lot of messages about this, just to clarify:</p><p>The current 40% sale is a one-time promotion to celebrate and support No Rest for the Wicked Together.

<h2 id="h-mahler-compares-no-rest-for-the-wicked-to-baldur-s-gate-3">Mahler Compares No Rest for the Wicked to Baldur’s Gate 3</h2>



<p>Furthermore, he explained that the game launched in Early Access at $40 because he did not feel it was right to charge early supporters full price before it was properly ready. </p>



<p>He compared his strategy to that of Baldur’s Gate 3, which launched into Early Access at full price, explaining that he was never a fan of that approach.</p>



<p>“BG3 launched into Early Access at full price, and personally, I never loved that approach. If you support a game early, you should get some extra love,” he’d add.</p>



<p>Those interested can currently pick up the game on <a href="https://t.co/QiT6by7r2R" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam </a>for $23.99.</p>

            <guid>1420486</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="7bd695591b7e3"><a title="Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream Hugh and Bubbles" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7bd695591b7e3/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-hugh-and-bubbles.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well folks, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> Nintendo Direct has won over many hearts, with its bizarre humour, huge amount of freedom and flexibility with customisation, and even a a dramatic romantic storyline.</p>
<p>We fell in love with Hugh Morris, the clown-like character from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_0kl1WiSPg">Nintendo of America presentation</a> (who doesn't want to talk about monster trucks, sadly). But when we announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-moves-in-on-switch-1-this-april">our love for him</a>, a lot of people were quick to ask, "wait, <em>who?</em> What about Bubbles?"</p>
<p>Many readers were then quick to point out that the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNtYngxAs1k">Nintendo UK version</a> of the Direct had an entirely different set of characters and Miis, with slightly different storylines playing out between the cast.</p>
<p>Regional variants for Nintendo Directs are pretty common, but that's usually for general Directs. Japan often gets trailers for games we don't, and vice versa. And while the content in both the UK and US Directs is largely the same, the stars are sometimes very different.</p>

<p>Bubbles the Clown is one such example, but he's not the only UK-exclusive character: Rosa is your best friend instead of Jess in the UK stream, and Forian is a gym rat in Blighty while Patrick loves the guitar in the USA.</p>
<p>Hey, Carlo's in both of them! But he's presented a bit differently depending on what Direct you're watching: in the UK, he's very nosy and active, while the US version is a barista. And at least Mocha the Bear remains in tacts on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Other changes are a bit more subtle — the Hot Dog costume is featured in the American Direct, but a Wizard and Bee costume take centre stage in the UK. More grocery items are shown off in the US Direct, and different rooms and decors are highlighted in both versions. And instead of your best friend trying to get in on the romance in the ferris wheel, the UK version makes sure the alien is a part of the action.</p>
<p>Reader Suketoudara also pointed us towards <a href="https://youtu.be/xDKM6ygU1BE?si=J_4prQRZJMfn8yex">a video by rockheadHD</a>, comparing the localisation of both the US and UK versions of the game. And they're pretty different!</p>
<p>The most-obvious place is during the News Report segment where the newsreader talks about the stories on-air in slightly different ways, depending on which version you're watching. Whether this is the case in the full release, we'll have to wait and see.</p>

<p>Otherwise, of the European streams appear to use the UK version (with subtitles, of course), but as you're probably expecting at this point, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMgPZ0h3B4U">Japan's version</a> was also slightly different to ours.</p>
<p>Once again, the cast of characters are very different to the English-language streams — we picked up on Rika, Daisuke (who plays guitar like Patrick), and <em>another</em> variation of Carlo, this time a painter.</p>
<p>The grocery store was where many of the biggest differences were, with food items like pizza, coffee, and escargot replaced by octopus, juice, and rice bowls.</p>

<p>The content of all three Directs we've highlighted is otherwise the same, bar these examples we've pointed out. And they're all delightful and tonally weird in their own ways. We've only spotted a handful of small differences in all of them, and there's bound to be tons we've missed, so let us know if you've spotted anything that stands out to you!</p>
<p>You won't have to wait long to live the dream on Switch, as Tomodachi Life: living the Dream comes out on <strong>16th April 2026</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/category/nintendo/" id="3">Nintendo </a>issues a statement on image-sharing features in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream/" id="3535">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/nintendo/" id="22">Nintendo </a>recently held a dedicated Nintendo Direct for the upcoming Tomodachi Life sequel headed to the Nintendo Switch family of consoles. In addition to announcing the game’s April 16 release, the presentation showcased how players could customize their Miis and the island they inhabit.</p>



<p>However, Nintendo has issued a statement regarding limitations to image sharing in the upcoming game.</p>







<h2 id="h-nintendo-is-committed-to-creating-experiences-that-are-welcoming-for-everyone">Nintendo Is Committed to Creating Experiences That Are Welcoming for Everyone</h2>



<p>Following the Nintendo Direct, the official <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/71317/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo blog</a> issued a statement saying that restrictions have been placed on certain image-sharing features to create a safe environment for all players.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>While these moments are often fun for players, we recognize that out-of-context scenes may be misunderstood or may not reflect the spirit in which the game is intended to be enjoyed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nintendo did, however, decide to expand players’ ability to express their gender and sexuality through their Tomodachi Life Mii characters. Players can now choose to make characters non-binary and date anyone of any gender. This follows a 2014 statement promising that future efforts would aim to design a more inclusive gameplay experience after players questioned the omission of same-sex relationships in the original Tomodachi Life.</p>



<p>The trailer released on January 29 showed that certain characters will experience heartbreak multiple times in Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream, while others may find marriage after bonding over monster trucks. Truly different strokes for different folks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Mandy Patinkin</strong>, a star of both the Broadway stage and the big screen, has been named as the latest addition to the cast of <strong>Amazon's God of War TV series</strong>. It's another casting choice that deviates from the original games, as Patinkin will play <strong>Odin</strong>, replacing <strong>Richard Schiff</strong>, who played the character in <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong>.</p>



<p>It's the second casting announcement today, confirmed in a report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/mandy-patinkin-cast-odin-god-of-war-tv-series-1236702507/">Deadline</a>, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/severances-olafur-darri-olafsson-tapped-to-play-thor-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/"><strong>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson</strong> was tapped to play <strong>Thor</strong></a>. Patinkin joins Ólafsson, <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-tv-show-amazon-prime-ryan-hurst-kratos-cast/"><strong>Ryan Hurst </strong>as <strong>Kratos</strong></a><strong>,</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/warm-bodies-star-teresa-palmer-tapped-to-play-sif-in-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series/"><strong>Teresa Palmer </strong>as <strong>Sif</strong></a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-series-max-parker-heimdall-thor-mimir/"><strong>Max Parker </strong>as <strong>Heimdall</strong></a>, and is hopefully not the last casting announcement we see for a while, especially with <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-god-of-war-tv-show-begins-filming-march-2026/">filming reportedly set to start in <strong>March 2026</strong></a>.</p>



<p>It's also not the casting announcement we expected to see after Ólafsson, since <a href="https://nerdbot.com/2026/01/14/god-of-war-finds-their-live-action-kratos/">a recent rumour</a> that correctly identified Ólafsson, Palmer, and Parker's casting ahead of their actual confirmation pointed to <strong>Alastair Duncan</strong> reprising his role as <strong>Mimir</strong>. Hopefully, that casting is accurate, as Duncan's performance is beloved by fans of the <strong>God of War (2018)</strong> and <strong>God of War Ragnarok</strong> games.</p>



<p>Beyond Mimir, we're still waiting to find out casting choices for characters like <strong>Baldur, Freya, </strong>and most significantly, <strong>Atreus</strong>. We also don't know if characters like <strong>Brok</strong> and <strong>Sindri</strong> will be included, though hopefully we'll know soon as more concrete details about the plot are revealed, beyond the confirmation that this show will pull from the Norse-based games, rather than the original Greek-based games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-dev-returns-with-a-cozy-rpg-about-haunte-1847912361"><em>Haunted Chocolatier</em></a> is the next game from the creator of <em>Stardew Valley</em>, one of the most successful and adored cozy RPGs ever made. Not surprisingly, fans are getting antsy to hear more about the upcoming release. But the wait is leading to <a href="https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-concerenedape-haunted-chocolatier-update-1851778392">all sorts of speculation,</a> so developer Eric “ConcernedApe” Barone recently took to the game’s website to dispel the unfounded rumors in a new blog post.</p> <p>“Hey everyone, good news: I’ve been very productive lately on <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em>,” he <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2026/01/28/update-im-still-working-like-always/">wrote this week</a>. “Yep, it’s taking a while to finish the game. That’s oaky. I know, I know, I shouldn’t have announced the game so early. But I had my reasons.” From there he went on to debunk some popular fan myths and set the record straight on<em> Haunted Chocolatier</em>‘s development.</p>

 <h2>1.<em> Haunted Chocolatier</em> will not be abandoned and added to <em>Stardew Valley</em> instead</h2> <p>He promised this wouldn’t happen, but said that even if he did end up abandoning his new game it would be absurd to think it would get added to the existing one. They were made in different engines and “you can’t just copy and paste <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em> into <em>Stardew Valley</em>.”</p> <h2>2. Ideas for <em>Haunted Chocolatier </em>are not being tested inside <em>Stardew Valley</em></h2> <p>Barone once again reiterated that these are “separate” games even if they might share the same aesthetic. Furthermore, he said he doesn’t want to spoil anything being worked on in <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em> by teasing it early in <em>Stardew Valley</em>.</p>

 <h2>3. He’s not working on <em>Stardew Valley</em> to avoid working on <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em></h2> <p>Barone maintained that the only reason he keeps releasing new <em>Stardew Valley</em> updates is because it’s still an incredibly popular game, not because anything with <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em> has gone awry.</p> <h2>4. <em>Haunted Chocolatier </em>doesn’t have a 2030 release date</h2> <p>The developer previously said he “hoped” that <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em> would be out in the next five years. That was taken by some to mean it won’t be out before then. He re-confirmed there is no actual set release date and it will just be done when it’s done, like all good things worth waiting for.</p>

 <p>Welp, glad that’s all settled. The <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em> subreddit can go to sleep now until the game is out, or better yet just keep playing <em>Stardew</em> Valley.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> launched last year with many, myself included, praising the game’s combat and open world, but criticizing a myriad of technical problems and performance issues. Since then, Gearbox has continued to update the game, and the studio has a big roadmap planned for 2026 that includes level cap increases, cross saves, and more.</p> <p>On January 29, <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/en-GB/borderlands-4/update-notes/">Gearbox pushed out a new major update for <em>Borderlands 4</em></a> across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. This update adds a new photo mode, something people have been asking about for a bit now. Finally, you can take gorgeous cinematic images of yourself blasting apart rippers and aliens with a four-barreled assault rifle. Alongside that new feature came a long list of various tweaks, changes, and fixes as you might expect from a big update for a modern game in 2026. The bigger news, however, is what’s coming to <em>Borderlands 4</em> over the next few months.</p>

 <p><a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/2026-roadmap/">In a blog post,</a> Gearbox outlined its roadmap for 2026, and it includes some previously teased features as well as some new additions that should make any<em> Borderlands 4</em> player happy. First, Gearbox <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pearls-roadmap-takedown-dlc-free-update-2000621708">reconfirmed that Pearlescents</a>, a higher loot rarity level seen in past games, would be added to <em>Borderlands 4</em> when the game’s first expansion, “Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned,” arrives in March. And you won’t have to buy the DLC to start finding these rarer pieces of loot once they’ve been added to the looter shooter in an upcoming update. This is also when the game’s first new Vault Hunter, C4SH, will be added.</p> <h2>The biggest news from<em> Borderlands 4</em>‘s 2026 roadmap</h2> <p>Meanwhile, Gearbox confirmed that it is working on three highly requested features for <em>Borderlands 4.</em> The studio didn’t share release dates or windows for when to expect these three features in its new roadmap, but they will arrive in 2026.</p>

 <ul> <li> <blockquote><p>Level cap increases are coming in future updates for “all players.” Gearbox added that it looks “forward to seeing even more build variety and interactions made possible by the additional skill points!”</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Cross-platform saves will be added later this year, allowing players to bounce between platforms without having to restart a new character. Hopefully Gearbox has plans for people like me who have high-level characters on two different platforms.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Shared world progression between characters is also coming. Gearbox is going to add an option in a future patch that will let you share all your open-world progression, like extra backpack slots, discovered Vault Fragments, and vehicle unlocks, across all your characters. I do hope this is optional, as I’d like to return to <em>Borderlands 4</em> one day and be able to start all over with a new playthrough and not inherit all the upgrades I unlocked before.</p></blockquote> </li> </ul> <p>Besides all that, Gearbox has also promised more free events. Though if they are anything like the <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-halloween-event-borderlands-4-sucks-bad-horrors-of-kairos-2000638842">not-so-great Halloween event from last year,</a> I’m not sure how excited I am about that. Also coming in 2026 to<em> Borderlands 4</em> is more endgame content, including a new raid boss and a super-hard-to-complete Takedown mission in Q2 2026. (<a href="https://x.com/EpicNNG/status/2016921486435520663?">This was previously teased for a Q4 release</a>, so it appears to have been moved up, which is nice.) Gearbox says it’s working on “additional endgame activities that’ll add a new layer of challenge and mastery to existing content.”</p>

 <p>So <em>Borderlands 4</em> isn’t “dead” as so many on the internet like to claim. The real question is whether all this new content and free updates will arrive on time and be worth the wait. For now, I’m going to go take a cool screenshot of me shooting Claptrap with a rocket launcher using that new photo mode.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-pricing-revealed-for-all-editions/</link>
            <guid>1420453</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The prices for all four editions of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wwe-2k26/" id="3461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K26 </a>have leaked ahead of the official start of pre-orders on January 30.</p>



<p>WWE 2K26 will be released in four versions, and according to a new report from billbil-kun of <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/wwe-2k26-switch-2-plateformes-date-de-sortie-ce-que-lon-sait-60917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dealabs</a>, the prices for the upcoming game have been released. The Standard Edition, which includes only the base game, will be priced at $69.99. The King of Kings Edition, the second-tier “Deluxe” edition, will be priced at $99.99.</p>



<p>Then, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/attitude-era-edition-of-wwe-2k26-revealed-pre-orders-soon/" id="171784" rel="nofollow">Attitude Era Edition</a>, the “Premium” Edition of the game, will release for $129.99. Finally, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-reveals-monday-night-war-edition-cover/" id="171836" rel="nofollow">Monday Night War Edition </a>will provide access to the most content throughout the game’s lifecycle and will be priced at $149.99.</p>



<p>In addition to providing players with more content at no additional cost, all higher-priced tiers will grant access to the game on March 6. Reportedly, this is 7 days earlier than when players who purchased only the standard tier will be able to play.</p>







<h2 id="h-wwe-2k26-leaves-last-gen-consoles-behind">WWE 2K26 Leaves Last-Gen Consoles Behind</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>After years of the current WWE game line releasing on both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, the ESRB rating for WWE 2K26 confirms that this year’s release will be limited to current-gen consoles.</p>



<p>Ironically, while WWE 2K26 leaves the past behind with its console releases, much of the game’s marketing has been rooted in WWE’s past. The Attitude Era and Monday Night War Editions focus heavily on the peak of WWE popularity in the late 90s and early 2000s.</p>



<p>Also, all three covers for the higher-priced tiers feature WWE Legends, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-king-of-kings-edition-cover-features-triple-h/" id="171834" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one legend in particular on all three covers: Triple H.</a></p>







<h2>WWE 2K26’s Showcase Focuses on CM Punk</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>As first reported by Insider Gaming, this year’s 2K Showcase campaign focuses on CM Punk. Players will get to relive some of CM Punk’s greatest moments from his WWE career.</p>



<p>Also, fans can experience fantasy scenarios that may have occurred if CM Punk not left WWE in 2014 before returning in 2023. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-cm-punk-showcase-mode/" id="169985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[No Rest For The Wicked Will Cost As Much As Baldur’s Gate 3 When It Leaves Early Access: ‘I’m Not Trying To Do Any FOMO Marketing Here’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/no-rest-wicked-co-op-free-steam-sale-early-access-ps5-2000664252</link>
            <guid>1420444</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last year, Moon Studios boss Thomas Mahler was threatening that his company <a href="https://kotaku.com/ori-moon-studios-no-rest-for-the-wicked-review-mahler-1851780166">might have to shut down</a> if players didn’t stop review-bombing his new action-RPG&nbsp;<em>No Rest for the Wicked</em> on Steam. Now his team is celebrating a major turnaround after a recent update brought multiplayer co-op to the top-down Soulslike. With a fresh spotlight on the Early Access project, Mahler took the opportunity to confirm that while the game is currently steeply discounted, it’ll cost as much as<em> Baldur’s Gate 3</em> once it’s fully released.</p> <p>“I’m not trying to do any FOMO marketing here, but yes: when we hit 1.0, <em>No Rest for the Wicked</em> will move to <span>$60</span>, because it’s a premium title,” he <a href="https://x.com/thomasmahler/status/2016906516754808905">wrote on X</a> on Thursday. “We’ve announced this a long time ago and repeated it several times.” He compared it to the hit <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-based CRPG which remained full-price throughout Early Access. Unlike that, <em>No Rest for the Wicked</em> is typically $40 in its own Early Access period. At the moment, it’s even cheaper than that thanks to an ongoing Steam Sale. It’ll be 40 percent off until February 5.</p>

 <p>“The reason the game launched at <span>$40</span> was simple: <span>Early Access players should get a discount</span>,” Mahler wrote. “<em>BG3</em> launched into Early Access at full price, and personally I never loved that approach. If you support a game early, you should get some extra love. I’m only saying this now so nobody’s surprised or upset later. If you’ve been on the fence about <em>Wicked</em>, the current sale is genuinely a good time to jump in.”</p> <h2>A free-to-play Steam weekend coup</h2> <p>And a bunch of players clearly have been. <a tabindex="0" role="button" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1371980/view/518610613985871419"><em>No Rest for the Wicked</em>‘s Together update</a> went live just last week on January 22. In addition to the usual bevy of quality-of-life improvements, bug fixes, and re-balancing, it brought full, shared-world co-op to the game that transformed the otherwise grim and solemn affair into something much more social. In addition to fighting through a brutal and bloody fantasy setting together, players can also fish, forage, and partake in other, more chill distractions.</p>

 <p>New players have been flocking to the game ever since with an major influx of positive Steam reviews over the weekend when the game was briefly free-to-play. It peaked at over 60,000 concurrents and was temporarily the best-selling game on Steam. Mahler said the game’s been selling tens of thousands of new copies every day since.</p>

 <p>It’s a far cry from last summer’s ominous warnings that the <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/ori-blind-forest-will-wisps-sexism-toxic-moon-studios-m-1848673622">Ori and the Blind Forest</a></em> maker might not be “around in a couple of months to do anything anymore” if existing players kept complaining about the direction of the game. The game is currently slated to arrive on PlayStation 5 when it hits 1.0, but so far there’s no set timeline for when that will happen.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“AI is Theft, I Have to Use It, Otherwise I’ll Get Fired”: GDC Reports One-Third of Game Workers Are Using GenAI for Daily Tasks]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ai-is-theft-i-have-to-use-it-otherwise-ill-get-fired-gdc-reports-one-third-of-game-workers-are-using-genai-for-daily-tasks/</link>
            <guid>1420423</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The <strong>GDC State of the Game Industry Report 2026</strong> is <a href="https://gdconf.com/news-insights/">officially out</a>, offering insights into the video game industry based on responses from over <strong>2,300 game industry workers</strong>. Respondents answered questions about everything from <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/i-cant-fully-trust-anywhere-now-gdc-reports-1-in-4-devs-have-been-laid-off-in-last-2-years/">industry layoffs</a></strong> to popular game engines and platforms, and the current, longstanding hot-button industry topic, <strong>Generative AI (GenAI).</strong></p>



<p>For some people in the video game industry, GenAI tools are the latest technological innovation that will revolutionize the game development process. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-ceo-claims-we-should-assume-every-game-company-now-using-ai-game-devs-say-no/"><strong>Everyone will use them if they aren't already</strong></a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-ceo-tim-sweeney-doesnt-think-digital-game-stores-should-have-generative-ai-tags/">they'll be as commonplace as anything else</a>. Others think <a href="https://wccftech.com/theres-no-point-using-ai-for-any-creative-endeavor-says-game-developer/"><strong>there is absolutely no place for them</strong></a> in game development, not even if you're trying to ride that middle lane where you think <a href="https://wccftech.com/probablymonsters-interview-ethical-ai-storm-lancers-switch-2/">it'll be helpful for some things</a>, but nothing can <a href="https://wccftech.com/ai-can-speed-up-game-development-human-intention-is-what-makes-our-stuff-special/">replicate or replace the <strong>"<em>human</em>"</strong> element in creation</a>.</p>



<p>While <strong>one-third (35%)</strong> of respondents said they don't personally use GenAI for their jobs, a <strong>majority (52%) said GenAI tools are used</strong> at their studios, which has also resulted in more studios creating policies around its use. Only <strong>15% of respondents</strong> said their company did not have a policy on the use of GenAI tools, with <strong>78% confirming that there is policy language</strong> of some kind at their studio. The remaining <strong>7%</strong> said they were unsure.</p>



<p>Policies are also getting more specific, with <strong>22%</strong> of respondents saying that only specific tools are allowed and not others. Most are using LLMs like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/apple-healths-integration-with-chatgpt-health-reportedly-allows-for-fallacious-and-inconsistent-diagnoses/">ChatGPT</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/apples-gemini-siri-deal-is-worth-at-least-5-billion-for-google-indicating-that-the-deal-would-last-through-2030/">Google Gemini</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-comments-gaming-copilot-ai-controversy/">Microsoft Copilot</a></strong>, which lines up for what they're using these tools for. "<em>Research or brainstorming</em>" was the most common response, with second going to daily tasks, including writing emails, code assistance, and prototyping. Only <strong>5% of respondents</strong> said they used GenAI tools for "<em>player-facing features</em>," <strong>10%</strong> for procedural generation, and <strong>19%</strong> for asset generation. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GDC-State-of-the-Game-Industry-2026-Report-GenAI-1.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: GDC</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>For some respondents, it's clear that these tools are essential, more for their efficiency than anything else. "<em>We are a small team, so it is making us capable of achieving more than we would without it</em>," said one respondent who is an executive working at an indie studio.</p>



<p>But even with this increased use and necessity, as the report reads, "<em>it appears the more the game industry professionals know about Generative AI, the less they like it</em>."  <strong>52% of respondents</strong> believe GenAI tech is having<strong> a negative impact on the video game industry</strong>. It's a <strong>30% bump</strong> compared to last year's GDC survey, but even within the negative majority are people who use it because they have to, or feel like they have to for their work. "<em>AI is theft</em>," begins one response from a developer in Ukraine. "<em>I have to use it, otherwise I'm gonna get fired</em>."</p>



<p>What's more interesting than looking at the percentages, though, are some of the quotes from individual developers who answered positively, negatively, or with mixed reactions about GenAI tools and tech.</p>

</figure>



<p>Again, it should be noted that this annual survey is just a sample size; it's not a complete picture of the industry, and there's still a lot to be figured out with where GenAI tech lands not just in video games and video game development, but in other industries around the world.</p>



<p>At least with its increased use, more studios are writing guidelines as to how it should be used, and most of its use doesn't seem to make it to our actual monitors when we sit down for a night of gaming. That will likely continue to be what players care about the most, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/gamers-not-opposed-to-ai-exploitation-slop-bobium-brawlers/"><strong>Studio Atelico</strong> told Wccftech in a recent interview,</a> "<em></em><em><strong>I strongly believe that what players and people in general are opposed to is not actually AI, but rather the exploitation of people and 'slop.'"</strong></em> </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/meowgun-review-boomer-shooter-retro-fps-cats-quake-2000664236</link>
            <guid>1420414</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are many, many, <em>many</em> retro-themed first-person shooters, aka <a href="https://kotaku.com/cruel-boomer-shooter-retro-fps-pc-steam-2025-review-1851737479">boomer shooters</a>, on the market. Some might say there are too many. I’m inclined to agree with that, if only because there’s a lot of crap and slop out there pretending to be solid throwbacks to fast-paced FPS action. <em>MeowGun: Hell Denizen, </em>out now on Steam, isn’t one of those disappointing games.</p> <p><em>MeowGun’</em>s biggest strength is that, like some other <a href="https://kotaku.com/dark-souls-morrowind-doom-engine-mohtra-review-pc-steam-fps-boomer-shooter-2000647667">great retro shooters</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/wrath-is-a-retro-shooter-done-right-1841067258">including <em>Wrath</em></a>, it is built using an open-source version of a classic FPS engine. In this case, <em>MeowGun</em> uses FTEQW, which is an excellent open-source version of the original <em>Quake</em> engine. And as is usually the case with these boomer shooters built on the tech of the past, it helps make <em>MeowGun</em> feel fantastic.</p>

  <p>Every gun in <em>MeowGun</em> is snappy, loud, and deadly. You move fast, but always feel in control. And blowing away demons with pistols, shotguns, bombs, and grenade launchers is a joy. It helps that <em>MeowGun’s</em> developers understand that people play boomer shooters to blow shit up and kill lots of enemies while sprinting through various levels that should never be too big. I also appreciate that <em>MeowGun’s</em> starting pistol is quite powerful and proves useful in fights for picking off enemies or saving ammo. This ain’t a peashooter you’ll never use after you get a new weapon.</p> <p><em>MeowGun’s</em> voice acting is at times distracting, especially as the main character–a half cat/half demon woman named MeowMeow–speaks almost entirely in movie quotes and pop culture references. And they start to repeat pretty quickly. Thankfully, I was often blowing up so much shit that I rarely could hear these lines. But if a talking protagonist is too much for you, <em>MeowGun</em> might be a grating experience. On the other hand, if you love cats, there are small and very adorable kittens to find and save. Yes, before you ask, you can pet the cats you save. Oh, and there’s a dedicated button to make your character meow. I’ll let you decide how that makes you feel.</p>

 <p>To be clear: <em>MeowGun: Hell Denizen</em> isn’t some revolutionary first-person shooter that I’m going to come back to year after year to enjoy. But it is a damn good retro FPS that understands what people want out of these kinds of games: Lots of enemies to kill, fast music, satisfying guns, and short load times. And <em>MeowGun</em> delivers on all of that and costs less than $15. In 2026, I can’t ask for much more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ravensburger has teased a potential <em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> expansion. The tabletop studio's most recent social media posts hint at new horrors to overcome in the cooperative board game. Horrors that may come straight from the cursed lands of Ravenloft.</p><h2>The <em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Expansion Tease</h2><p>Ravensburger's tease of the next <em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> expansion came from a social media post <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ravensburgerglobal/p/DUDpTJ_DPZz/?hl=en" rel="nofollow">on Instagram</a>. The post is enigmatic, showing the board game's logo, the tagline, "something new is coming in Fall 2026" and artwork of a creepy jester puppet holding a needle.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>It is an interesting choice of monster to showcase. The original <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-details-on-horrified-dungeons-dragons-emerge-from-dungeons-deep" rel="nofollow"><em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> game already featured monsters so iconic they are pop culture staples. The Beholder. The Mimic. The Red Dragon. By contrast, this figure is more obscure.</p><p>However, based on the appearance, artwork, and weapon, it is clear this monster is from Ravenloft, <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons'</em> gothic horror setting. The creature is a Carrionette, first featured in the fifth edition supplement, <em>Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft</em>. Carrionettes are toys gifted sentience by the loving craft of their maker.&nbsp;</p><p>The horrifying twist is they crave a mortal life. So much so they will ambush unsuspecting people, pull out their soul with a golden needle, and then take over their body. If you can imagine a creepy Pinocchio or a fantasy version of the serial killing doll Chucky, you have an idea to the danger the Carionette holds.</p><p>With this in mind, it's a strong possibility other Ravenloft residents may show up in this Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons expansion. A mummy lord from the deserts of Har'Akir. The life-force stealing Jiangshi from the liminal city of I'Cath. Bluetspur's resident Vampire Mindflayers.</p><p>For <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> diehards, there is the possibility the expansion may include it's most iconic monster: the First Vampire, Strahd Von Zarovich. That may be wishful thinking for two reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>One, if Strahd was in the expansion, he would be on the box. It would just be savvy marketing given his long storied history with the fantasy RPG. Second, the Horrified series centers on regular people escaping monsters, and the Dark Lord of Barovia has been slaughtering larger-than-life heroes for centuries. It would be a bit much.</p><p>At the time of writing, further information on the <em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> expansion is minimal. Since the release isn't until Fall, there is plenty of time for Ravensburger to provide more info.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

<p>Two more castings have been made in the upcoming God of War series on Prime Video. One is a star of Severance. The other is a legendary actor.</p>



<p>As the Prime Video <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/god-of-war/" id="106">God of War</a> series continues to take shape, two additional casting decisions have been announced. <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/mandy-patinkin-cast-odin-god-of-war-tv-series-1236702507/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline </a>reports that the legendary Mandy Patinkin, known for playing Inigo Montoya in The Princess Bride, will be in the upcoming series playing Odin. Odin is known as the “All-Father.” The Ruler of the Norse Pantheon is also the father of Thor and Heimdall. It was previously confirmed that Max Parker will play Heimdall. However, we now know who will play Thor.</p>



<h2>Thor Will Be Portrayed by a Severance Star in the Forthcoming God of War Series</h2>



<p>Ólafur Darri Ólafsson, known for his role as the stern and violent, when necessary, Mr. Drummond on the Apple TV series Severance, will portray the God of Thunder, according to <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/olafur-darri-olafsson-cast-thor-god-of-war-1236702443/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>. Furthermore, the series will portray Thor as a former soldier of Asgard and Odin’s former right-hand man. He is dealing with some confidence issues and is struggling with alcohol as a means of coping.</p>



<p>Ryan Hurst, the series’ Kratos, previously voiced Thor in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/god-of-war-ragnarok/" id="107">God of War: Ragnarök</a> video game. It has also been confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-live-action-series-has-reportedly-secured-another-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Teresa Palmer will play Thor’s wife, Sif,</a> in the series.</p>







<h2 id="h-prime-video-s-god-of-war-is-already-renewed-for-season-2">Prime Video’s God of War is Already Renewed for Season 2</h2>



<p>Without even having filmed a single episode, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amazon-god-of-war-director-second-season-greenlit-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon renewed the series for a second season</a>. Production is expected to begin in February 2026. The first two episodes are to be directed by Frederick E. O. Toye, who previously directed the video game–to–TV adaptation Fallout.</p>



<p>As of now, there’s no word on when the series will premiere. Insider Gaming will continue to monitor the story and report any and all updates.</p>

<p>Get ready to kid the kids to the vacant lot. A new Backyard Baseball game is coming this year.</p>



<p>Playground Productions has officially announced a new Backyard Baseball game will launch in Summer 2026. It’s the first new game in the Backyard Sports series since Backyard Sports Baseball 2015 for iOS and Android. With a likely release for console, it would be the first for major platforms since Backyard Sports: Rookie Rush in 2010.</p>







<p>Details on the game itself weren’t revealed, but Playground Productions says that information will come in the near future.</p>



<p>To hold over until more news comes, Playground has released Backyard Sports: The Animated Special on YouTube. The nearly 12-minute show features an all-star cast of Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Ego Nwodim, Donald Faison, Adam Pally, and more. </p>



<p><strong>“In a high-energy new animated special from Playground Productions, the beloved 90’s video game franchise “Backyard Sports” returns as superstar Stephanie “Bubbles” Morgan is in crisis after losing her gotta-have-it, never-play-without-it lucky bubble gum,”</strong> the show’s description reads. <strong>“With just 30 minutes until game time, the Backyard kids embark on a wild, time-sensitive mission to track it down and save their season.”&nbsp;</strong></p>

            <guid>1420354</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Straight to the End of the Line.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is 22 years old, which as you can imagine means that people have cracked that game wide open with weird glitches, skips, and tricks. Over the years, speedrunners have found ways to break San Andreas that got an any% speedrun of it down to a little under three hours, but recently an absolutely buckwild bug was found that cut that time down even further, to under an hour. Buckle up, folks, because this is one heck of a wacky speedrun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First, some context. San Andreas has been broken and rebroken many times over the years across its multiple versions, and there's one specific "trick" that's upended the speedrunning landscape multiple times. It actually originated in GTA: Vice City, where a <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/gtavc/guides/0h9mr" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trick known as Script Stack Underflow</a> (SSU) was found that chopped an any% run down to around eight minutes. <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-grand-theft-auto-san-andreas-speedrunning-trick-sh-1838953554" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Way back in 2019</a>, San Andreas runners found something similar that they called "Arbitrary Jump in Script", or AJS, specifically in the Window Store remaster of the game. This overly-complex trick essentially let speedrunners jump straight to the end of the game by doing a long series of very specific things such as killing a drug dealer, parking a bike in a very specific place, answering the phone at very specific times, and diligently avoiding vending machines at all costs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While involved, it demonstrably worked, with the end result being the game executing a "JUMP" command to the start of End of the Line Part 3, the final mission. Ever since then the speedrunning community has had to split the category into any% and any% no AJS, because watching a run with AJS is fun exactly once and then you really just want to watch a proper, action-packed, multi-hour San Andreas speedrun. For a long time, this skip was limited to the Windows Store version of the game, though it was later found in the Definitive Edition remaster with some significant setup differences.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well now, speedrunners have figured out how to do AJS in the original PC version of San Andreas. It is <em>also</em> completely different in how it's set up, and is somehow even wackier than any of the versions that have come before. u/Vitosi4ek on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/speedrun/comments/1qpv1ji/a_skip_the_whole_game_strat_has_been_found_in_the/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has a really nice breakdown of all the steps involved</a> (though some runners have already found ways to smooth out certain bits of it). These include: winning $10,000 on horse betting, making a clone of yourself, doing stunt jumps on a superbike, betting in the casino with negative money, changing your clothes, doing a dance minigame, running two Mission at the exact same time, and a lot more. All of this will hopefully, if the game doesn't crash, send you to the start of End of the Line Part 3, and let you finish the game right there.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every GTA Game Ranked</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This glitch was literally just discovered, and in that time the world record run for an any% of GTA: San Andreas has dropped down to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zll2qkggyCU" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">53 minutes and 46 seconds by creezyful</a>. It's very likely that this time will get even more shaved off in the coming days and weeks as speedrunners continue to optimize. This has also resulted in the community splitting any% off from any% no AJS, so audiences can still enjoy a roughly three-hour run of San Andreas and all the hyjinks involved in that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's wildly impressive to me that people are still managing to crack games this old open even more than they've already been, and make their guts do ridiculous things. Just this past AGDQ, I watched someone run arbitrary code execution in The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, something I'm pretty sure they didn't know how to do the last time the game was at the show. Video games, man!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, that does mean it'll probably be a long time before we get a run of GTA 6 that goes that fast.

Starting today, Amazon has dropped the price of the <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wBAAb?object_uuid=a0d375b8-6481-4348-a869-c9ce41beeb48&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SteelSeries Counter-Strike 2 Dragon Lore Limited Edition wireless gaming mouse</a> to just $56.76 after a massive 62% off discount. Historically speaking, the price of this mouse was fixed at $150 since it first released last July... until today. The Dragon Lore Edition gets points for its gorgeous design, but it also happens to be an excellent performer for any gamer looking for a lightweight mouse with top-of-the-line accuracy and precision.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">SteelSeries CS2 Dragon Lore Edition Mouse for $56.76</h2><div id="234911"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234911" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>SteelSeries CS2 Dragon Lore Edition Wireless Gaming Mouse</h3></p></div></span></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong></strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/aX4Z6Z?object_uuid=a0d375b8-6481-4348-a869-c9ce41beeb48&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a> is offering 50% off the matching mousepad. </li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The SteelSeries CS2 Dragon Lore Edition is based off the venerable Aerox 3 wireless mouse but with a snazzy facelift. Instead of the "holey" honeycomb pattern, the CS2 Edition is kitted with a solid shell adorned with an intricate red and gold dragon illustration that replicates the legendary rare AWP skin in Counter-Strike. Art aside, I actually prefer the solid mouse cover; mice with a bunch of holes in its shells don't feel as sturdy, naturally, and accumulate dust faster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite losing the honeycomb shell, the CS2 Edition mouse is still very lightweight at 71 grams while still providing all the features you'd want in a premium gaming mouse. It can connect wirelessly two ways: over 2.4GHz WiFi with the dongle (the preferred choice for PC gaming) and Bluetooth. The PixArt co-developed 18K dpi "TrueMove Air" optical sensor offers true 1:1 tracking. The battery lasts up to 200 hours per charge. The mouse buttons are mechanical with a nice clicky sound and are rated for 80 million clicks. At under $60, this is a steal.</p><div data-cy="paragraph"><p><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

    <article>
      <p>It's perhaps the least surprising collaboration of 2026. Time Magazine (owned by<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clykvypl9gxo?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>Marc Benioff</u></a> and<a href="https://time.com/7339621/person-of-the-year-2025-ai-architects-choice/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>doing stuff like this</u></a>) has teamed up with Darren Aronofsky (already<a href="https://animationobsessive.substack.com/p/the-real-history-of-perfect-blue?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>well known for copying the work of others</u></a>) on an AI-generated web series about the American Revolution that finally answers the question nobody was asking: what if<a href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/coke-ai-holiday-ad?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>that Coke ad</u></a> had muskets in it?</p><p>Aronofsky is Executive Producer on the series <em>On This Day… 1776</em>--presumably because slop spat out by a mutated autocorrect doesn't need a director--and the way Time describe this thing is wild:</p><blockquote>If&nbsp;<em>On This</em>&nbsp;<em>Day…1776&nbsp;</em>manages to make the American Revolution feel like something that’s actually alive, it’s likely because the project has two things going for it. One is a new technology. The arrival of the U.S.A.’s semiquincentennial coincides with advances in artificial intelligence that leave behind sepia tints and costume drama and let storytellers generate a world that feels vibrant, richly textured, and immediate.</blockquote><p>You will not be surprised to learn that the series feels neither vibrant, richly textured or immediate. It looks like shit. Because it was made by a computer, and not a human director--even one as derivative as Aronofsky--every scene is cartoonishly ghastly. Objects and characters are unable to maintain their shape, and there are AI-generated irregularities throughout that nobody has either noticed or cared to remove.</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:mxmvdqokiwgrxxgkhbvvxqj6/app.bsky.feed.post/3mdlfdingcc2k" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreiahklorddirvzg2qwnkcenkj3gbeukzoqd4oiw54vzsaf2jy56je4"><p lang="en">Finally we’ll see the story of how the nation of Aamerleda was founded</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:mxmvdqokiwgrxxgkhbvvxqj6?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Allosaur (@allosaur.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:mxmvdqokiwgrxxgkhbvvxqj6/post/3mdlfdingcc2k?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">2026-01-29T18:14:13.101Z</a></blockquote></figure><p>I don't want you to think you have to watch this.

The project also takes its “of-the-moment” feel from the headlines. In the first episode, dated Jan. 1, George Washington, visiting the hillside outside Boston where irregulars hold the high ground above British forces, asks them to shout out where they’re from. (You’ve never heard “Delaware!” proclaimed with more defiant pride.) And in the second installment, Jan. 10, Ben Franklin recruits Thomas Paine to articulate the overarching principles that can unite them. “Here in America,”&nbsp;<em>Common Sense&nbsp;</em>declares, “the law is king.”<p>In the story of how the United States of America came together for the first time,&nbsp;<em>On This Day…1776&nbsp;</em>has the cure for what ails us.</p></blockquote><p>The defining thing about AI today isn't the slop or the copyright infringement issues we've been facing for years, it's the increasing desperation with which it's being forced on us by an elite who knows we don't want it, but knows they need us to have it anyway so they can maintain the charade that their overcommitted tech companies are making a line go up.</p><p>Even by the standards of copywriting, even by the standards of self-promotion, what Time has written here has about as much credibility and basis in reality as a White House press briefing. <em>1776 </em>doesn't have the "cure for what ails us", it's just more of the same poison.</p><p>Oh, and for anyone who doesn't want to leave behind "sepia tints and costume drama", but does want to revisit the events of 1776 and watch some stuff made by humans, you should watch HBO's fantastic John Adams series if you haven't:</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GEtajI8Tmsw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="John Adams | TRAILER  | HBO Films"></iframe></figure><p>Or, for a more recent and comprehensive retelling, there's Ken Burns' epic series:</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lruEtNTN9oY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="The American Revolution | A Film by Ken Burns, Sarah Botstein &amp; David Schmidt | Official Trailer"></iframe></figure>

            <title><![CDATA[Darren Aronofsky’s AI Movie Is As Bad As It Sounds: ‘Slop About The Forming Of The Country That Is About To Crumble’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/darren-aronofskys-ai-movie-is-as-bad-as-it-sounds-slop-about-the-forming-of-the-country-that-is-about-to-crumble-2000664225</link>
            <guid>1420315</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Darren Aronofsky, who directed <em>The Whale</em> and <em>Mother!</em>, teamed up with Google DeepMind and production house Primordial Soup to produce a series of shorts that dramatize the founding of the United States. It feels like a test of whether the guiding hand of one of Hollywood’s biggest auteurs can bend an ugly and fiddly plagiarism machine to his own creative ends and produce something that doesn’t make you want to hurl. I don’t think it will be controversial to say it fails spectacularly.</p> <p><em>On This Day… 1776</em><em>&nbsp;</em>is an episodic series of YouTube videos that each focuses on a different point leading up to the American revolution. The fact-based vignettes are made with SAG voice actors and AI visuals, including a “combination of traditional filmmaking tools and emerging AI capabilities.” <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/darren-aronofsky-revolutionary-war-ai-series-1236488180/">The stated goal</a> is “reframing the Revolution not as a foregone conclusion but as a fragile experiment shaped by those who fought for it.”</p>

  <p>Each new episode will drop on the 250th anniversary of the actual events depicted in it. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sV52AUVGc6I">first one</a> is dated January 1 and has George Washington raising a Continental Union Flag in Somerville, Massachusetts. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZDnL_a0YfQ&amp;pp=2AZi">The second</a> is dated January 10 and has Benjamin Franklin urging Thomas Paine to write what would become his Common Sense pamphlet. There’s also a trailer previewing the series if you want to get the gist without having to imbibe the full eight minutes of horror.</p> <p>What Aronofsky and company have achieved with their AI tools is a series of brief human interactions and heavily edited transitions which convey a linear narrative without any major glitches. <em>On This Day… 1776 </em>establishes the vibe of a History Channel promo and gestures at the quality of an educational reenactment series a middle school teacher might pull out when they’ve given up, but little else. And all the familiar artifacts of slop are still present and accounted for.</p>   <p>People’s faces look like they’re melting even when they’re not moving. Background scenery often includes the kinds of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mattbaume.bsky.social/post/3mdlgk7rrcc2t">nonsensical details</a> (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zackzwiezen.com/post/3mdlkffqjns2v">why so many buttons?</a>) you only get from genAI hallucinations. And the voices don’t even match up with the lips most of the time. But most of the slop sensibility emanates from more subtle places. The voices don’t modulate in ways that feel lively or engaging. The camera pans and zooms like its being controlled by a drunken sloth. And the edits are are still so manic it feels like the entire visual experience is anxiously trying to get to the end before it all visually implodes.</p>
