		<p>Capcom has announced that is doing a collaboration with K-pop group Aespa, along with virtual idol Naevis. The collaboration with Aespa will consist of a new outfit for Juri which will release on July 4th. This outfit will be only be available for a limited time, with that timeframe being a year. After that it will be gone. You can see the the outfit and hear some of Aespa’s Whiplash track in the trailer below.</p>

<p>Naevis is a virtual idol that began as a sidekick for the group Aespa, before being spun off to be a solo artist. Naevis’ has been confirmed as a real time commentator. It is worth mentioning that being a virtual idol means that Naevis is not a real person, and has been created using generative AI. The option to use Naevis as a real time commentator in Street Fighter 6 will also be available from July 4th.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/30/street-fighter-6-review/">Street Fighter 6 Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Street Fighter 6 review, Nick said, “Street Fighter 6 doesn’t need recommending to hardcore fighting fans – you all already know how incredible it is – but do I recommend it for more casual players? Street Fighter 6 has a real sense of community, welcoming all players old and new, teaching new tricks and providing something for those that just want a bit of fun. This is truly a fighting game for everyone.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-devs-to-host-performance-talk-amid-ongoing-efforts-to-improve-stability.1232547/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>To everyone's surprise, members of the Monster Hunter Wilds development team will give a talk on performance optimization later this month while the game continues to be affected by all sorts of technical issues.</p>



<p>As confirmed on the <a href="https://cedec.cesa.or.jp/2025/timetable/detail/s67ad32469773b/">CEDEC 2025 official website</a>, programmer Yuichi Ito and AI Engineer Takanori Nakamura will host a talk on July 24 during this year's edition of Japan's largest annual conference for game developers regarding the challenges of optimizing the latest entry in the series and how the team reportedly managed to <em>"maintain stable operation"</em> while realizing the game's core features, a statement many will inevitably find funny, at the very least, considering how the game doesn't run well on anything other than the very top end PC hardware and with upscaling and frame generation on top.</p>



<p>A few months since launch, Monster Hunter Wilds' performance is just as disappointing as it was back in February. <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-nvidia-dlss-4-amd-fsr-4/">Title Update 2</a>, which went live yesterday, introduced some VRAM utilization improvements but has not addressed the many issues the game still has on this front. The new update also introduced some stability issues that are causing crashes on a variety of system configurations, but these, at least, will be addressed soon with a new 1.020.01.00 patch announced today. The patch will also address another issue in the PC version of the game that may cause unstable performance when equipping ranged weapons.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. You can learn how the game still manages to be a great new entry in the series despite the performance issues by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review</a>.</p>

            <p>A new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> mod put together over the course of a 40 hour-long charity modathon will see you beamed up by aliens you're investigating on behalf of a quirky conspiracy theorist. Its creation alone has <a href="https://donate.tiltify.com/9bfd5162-8a13-4012-908f-e64b4598976d/details">raised over $5,800</a> (about £4.2k) for the American <a href="https://www.alz.org/">Alzheimer's Association</a> so far.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-elder-scrolls-voice-actor-is-teaming-up-with-top-fallout-4-modders-to-livestream-a-48-hour-modding-jam-for-charity">wrote about the plans to livestream this mod's creation</a> last month. The team behind Fallout 4's popular <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21872">Sim Settlements mod</a> are behind it, having teamed up with Wes 'Sheogorath' Johnson, a number of other voice actors and a group of prominent Fallout modders to make a cool thing with a bunch of moving parts in one weekend.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Their creation, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/94745?tab=description">Transmission Zeta</a>, is now available to download via Nexus Mods. It looks like a fun time, though you might not dig the questline it offers if you're not down for plenty of silliness and Fallouty meta humour.</p>
<p>In line with what viewers voted for during a <a href="https://x.com/simsettlements/status/1932626360859820127">June 14th planning stream</a>, that questline is all about aliens. The Zetans from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> Mothership Zeta DLC have returned to The Commonwealth to get up to some abduction antics, along with various other cameos from across the Fallout series. You'll investigate with the aid of Clark, a zany conspiracy theorist voiced by Johnson, and the mod's fully-voiced follower, a vault dwelling con artist called Arlen.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>The 40 hour Modathon is over, and you raised just shy of 10k across our events - and there's still one more to go!</p><p>Amazing work from all the modders who poured themselves into this!</p><p>Join <a href="https://twitter.com/GopherGaming?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GopherGaming</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/WesJohnsonVoice?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@WesJohnsonVoice</a> tomorrow to watch the reveal of what we've assembled! <a href="https://t.co/c7CsW4Xb63">pic.twitter.com/c7CsW4Xb63</a></p></div>— simsettlements (@simsettlements) <a href="https://twitter.com/simsettlements/status/1939538383539417571?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 30, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>As you play through the quests and explore a new dungeon, one of which is called "V.A.T.S in Spaaace!", you'll gain some custom alien-themed weapons and armour made by modders Neeher and Niero. There's also a player home in the form of a houseboat with its own robot butler that modder Elianora's cooked up.</p>
<p>In order to start the mod's questline once it's installed, the modders write that you'll need to "simply pass through any load screen by fast traveling or entering and exiting a building", at which point a strange new radio station will pop up on your Pip-Boy. If you're not in the mood for modding or just want to get a taste of what you're in for, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0v7JSrvqB8">YouTuber Gopher</a> has livestreamed a playthrough of Transmission Zeta as part of the modathon.</p>
<p>If you are planning on playing the mod, you'll need version 1.10.163.0 or greater of Fallout 4 and all of its DLC aside from Far Harbor and the high-res texture pack.</p>
<p>Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to investigate this weird blue light that's just begun beaming down from the heavens outside my house.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-fallout-4-quest-mod-has-you-investigating-alien-abductions-for-an-iconic-elder-scrolls-voice-actor]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><span>Although&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/" target="_blank">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>&nbsp;is not focused on combat, the new entry in the series by Kojima Productions introduces new tools and a slew of improvements that make </span>it more fun and convenient to take on all sorts of enemies, ranging from human enemies to BTs. Stealth has been likewise been improved, and the game now provides you with so many tools to clear enemy camps without getting spotted by the enemy.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, it doesn't take long to notice how fighting enemies and sneaking around still feels  a little cumbersome. Sam's mobility is still quite limited, and is only partially improved by equipping a Battle Skeleton, and enemies seem to be able to spot the porter no matter how careful you are, often turning camp clearing into a head-on combat affair, which doesn't feel great for the same reason sneaking doesn't. As such, you will eventually start avoiding enemy camps completely.</p>



<p>However, there's <strong>a way to make stealth and combat way more enjoyable in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</strong>, and it's so game-changing that it's really surprising to see how the game doesn't highlight this during what essentially is the long tutorial sequence in Mexico. This trick improves things to much that it makes the game feel more like the sequel to Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain that we never got.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Before infiltrating an enemy camp, find a safe spot some distance away, <strong>hold the Triangle button to drop your entire backpack</strong>, and try moving around. You will instantly notice how agile Sam is without cargo encumbering him. The difference is really night and day: you can now sprint and slide faster, and consistently double jump after sprinting if you have a Battle Skeleton equipped. Not having cargo on your back also makes it harder for enemies to spot you, meaning that you will have a much easier time sneaking into camps and taking enemies down one by one without getting spotted.</p>



<p>One may argue that dropping the backpack will leave you with a limited number of items that you can use, as only those Sam is carrying in his suit will be available, but this is hardly a problem. The contrary. If you have infiltrated an enemy camp already, you will have noticed how many resources, tools and weapons can be found scattered around, and you can just pick them up on the spot and use during your current infiltration. In many ways, this mirrors the premise of the Metal Gear Solid games where Snake has to procure almost everything he needs to complete his mission on site.</p>



<p>While leaving your backpack behind doesn't help a lot against BTs, as they rely on sound to spot Sam and taking them on directly doesn't reward you in any significant way, leaving your cargo behind helps a lot during boss battles. The increased mobility makes it easier to dodge enemy attacks, and Sam's evasive maneuver, which can be used while aiming, becomes way more useful. As such, always drop your backpack before fighting most enemies, and you will have a much better appreciation of the mechanics of <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, and a much better time overall.</p>

Another <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:o7fzbrxgcaoek5sjkxq3acq3/post/3lsm3lzvb3s2b" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">player posted</a> a more egregious example where the chatbot prompt agreeing to translate text to Brazilian Portugese was left visible in the subtitles.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-slam-the-alters-after-discovering-evidence-of-undisclosed-gen-ai-in-images-text-and-translation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer reports</a> that errors were present in subtitles in other languages too, all appearing in the same section of the game. Handong Ryu, who was responsible for the majority of the game's Korean translation, said that "the same section of the Korean localisation shows clear signs of having been run through an LLM without proper editing," and that it was "a part of the game I had no control over."</p><p>11 Bit Studios has now posted a statement on Bluesky explaining how the sloppy AI inclusions made it into the final game, alongside a screenshot showing exactly where the AI-influenced asset can be found.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/altersgame/status/1939707458152448118" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">We’ve seen a wide range of accusations regarding the use of AI-generated content in The Alters, and we feel it’s important to clarify our approach and give you more context.

"A few licensed movies that the alters can watch in the social area of the base were added at the final stage of development," the statement reads.

Due to extreme time constraints, we chose not to involve our translation partners and had these videos localized using AI to have them ready on launch."</p><p>"The alternative was to release those specific dialogues in English only, which we believed would be a worse experience for non-English-speakers," the statement continues.

            <p>The team over at Halo Studios will be giving us the "official scoop" for what it's been working on this October.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Halo Studios - née 343 Industries - laid out further details for this year's Halo World Championship event. Here, the developer addressed the "fair amount of speculation" that has been making the rounds recently regarding what it has been working on.</p>

<p>"We don't usually comment on such matters, but this time we want to enter the chat and share a little more perspective for Halo fans who might be on the fence about whether to attend this year's event," the <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/halowc25-june">post on Halo Waypoint reads</a>.</p>
<p>The studio went on to confirm that, while speculation can be "fun" at times, those looking to get the official word of what is going on "won't want to miss this year's Halo World Championship". That is taking place in Seattle, between 24th - 26th October.</p>
<p>In the same post, Halo Studios noted during last year's event <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/halo-developer-343-industries-rebrands-confirms-multiple-new-games">it introduced Project Foundry</a>, its experimental look at how the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-halo-on-unreal-engine-5-means-for-ps5">Xbox flagship franchise will look developed in Unreal Engine 5</a>.</p>
<p>As for what the studio could be working on right now, the latest blog post affirmed multiple projects were in the pipeline. One of those projects may well indeed be the rumoured Halo Combat Evolved remaster, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-new-trailer-for-gears-of-war-reloaded">which even Xbox head Phil Spencer teased last month</a>. Then there was the chatter earlier in the year that<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-reportedly-getting-halo-and-another-big-xbox-game-with-microsoft-set-to-be-a-very-big-supporter"> Xbox was planning on bringing Halo to Switch 2 at some point</a>.</p>
<p>Who can say for sure. For now, we will just have to sit tight, and wait to see what October's Halo World Championship event has in store for us all. Stay tuned!</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/the-official-scoop-on-whats-happening-with-halo-will-arrive-this-october]]></content:encoded>

			<p>It seems like Red Dead Online is suddenly getting some new content, and it's also zombie-themed. The update set to go live later today at 5 AM Eastern Time will <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RedDeadOnline/comments/1logs5w/monthly_discounts_and_bonuses_july_1st_to_august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">include</a> the so-called Strange Tales of the West, a set of four new Telegram missions where players will aid author Theodore Levin in investigating the unknown. They'll be able to track down undead plagues, rogue automations, swamp beasts, and more by collecting Mr. Levin’s letter from any Post Office or their Camp’s Lockbox, or simply by launching Telegram Missions from the Player Menu.</p>



<p>Telegram Missions, including the new Strange Tales of the West, are paying out 3X Gold, RDO$, and XP.

<p>Red Dead Online never really took off as much as GTA Online did. Arguably, the much slower pace worked well for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/red-dead-redemption-2-living-outlaw-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">single player masterpiece that is Red Dead Redemption 2</a>, but not nearly as well in online multiplayer. It's been three years since Rockstar openly <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-online-support-seemingly-slowing-down-to-focus-on-gta-vi-and-gta-online/">acknowledged</a> that they would focus more on making content for the much more successful GTA Online, and it's been a while since RDO got anything new, which is why its fans are now positively surprised. Plus, the zombie theme certainly appears to be a nod to Undead Nightmare, the acclaimed expansion released for the first Red Dead Redemption game.</p>

            <p>"Mark Tyburn dreams of building the perfect video game," reads the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BETTER-PARADISE-One-Aftermath/dp/B0FCYSK8VD">sales blurb</a> for Rockstar co-founder Dan Houser's novel A Better Paradise: Volume One: An Aftermath, a title so resplendent with drive-by colons that you could easily guess this man spent thirty years working in videogames. "Kurt Fischer dreams of being a rich and successful executive. Daisy Tyburn dreams of having the ideal father. John Tyburn Smith dreams of fitting in. NigelDave just dreams of becoming human."</p>
<p>PleaseDon'tLetThatBeATypo, I immediately prayed to every god I knew the name of, and a few I made up on the spot. <em>Please let NigelDave be real</em>.</p>

<p>NigelDave is real. He's some sort of sentient AI, I think. And without really knowing anything about the setting, I actually quite like the idea of an AI picking two blokey first names in a sort of Ford Prefect, nicely inconspicuous way. He only wants to be loved, he says.</p>
<p><em>
I</em> love you, NigelDave.</p>
<p>A Better Paradise is Houser's multimedia project, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dan-houser-a-better-paradise-video-game-novel-grand-theft-auto-writer/1100-6532850/">note Gamespot</a>. Produced by his company Absurd Ventures, it's got its own <a href="https://www.absurdventures.com/abetterparadise/audiofiction">audiofiction series</a> starring Human Traffic's (and The Walking Dead's) Andrew Lincoln. Absurd Ventures also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-co-founder-dan-housers-new-studio-is-making-an-open-world-action-adventure-game">announced last year</a> they were making an "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> action-adventure" set in the same universe.</p>
<p>A few of the novel's other characters also have voiced intro videos online. Here's a quote from Daisy Tyburn who, may I remind you, "dreams of having the ideal father". <em>The statistically perfect dad</em>. What's the Bechdel test but for before the character has spoken?</p>
<p>"<a href="https://youtu.be/sGLPNgVSpYQ">I watch the people</a>, and the people are like robots and the robots are like people. People watch their screens and the screens watch people."</p>
<p>Gods, it's like reading Candide all over again. No one man should have access to such a dangerous combination of wit and prescience.</p>
<p>"Set in the near future, A Better Paradise tells the story of the ill-fated development of an ambitious but addictive video game project that goes very wrong," continues the blurb. "As the software they developed starts to produce unexpected and disturbing results, the project is shut down and abandoned. Until now."</p>
<p>The book is out this year, October 14th. Here's a <a href="https://youtu.be/7GGKr1uCFAc">13 minute analysis of Grand Theft Auto 6's beer bottles</a> to keep you going in the wait for that game's release, currently slated for May 26th, 2026.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grand-theft-auto-and-red-dead-redemption-writers-new-novel-is-about-ill-fated-game-development]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Metroid Fusion" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c7dc67aedaf6b/metroid-fusion.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has added two new batches of Switch Online icons from the <strong>Metroid</strong> series – specifically <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/metroid_fusion">Metroid Fusion</a>.</p>
<p>You'll need to boot up and play both games in order to unlock the icons. Super Metroid is part of the SNES app on Switch, and Metroid Fusion is part of the GBA app. The latter will require a membership to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack, so make sure you're all signed up if you're particularly keen on these.</p>
<p>The Super Metroid icons include Samus herself alongside iconic enemies like Ridley, Kraid, and the Metroid. Meanwhile, the Fusion icons include Samus in her lovely blue and yellow Fusion Suit, flanked by enemies like the X Parasite and the Core X.</p>
<p>Bizarrely, Nintendo has opted not to include S-AX in any of its forms, which seems a bit odd to us, but never mind.</p>
<p>This is nice little treat for fans while we await more news on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, that's for sure. The game is scheduled to launch this year, but we've yet to receive a specific date. A recent blunder saw Nintendo install a giant poster in the London Underground stating that Beyond was "Out Now", but this <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendo-fixes-its-metroid-prime-4-blunder-and-its-no-longer-out-now">has since been replaced</a>.</p>

In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2183900/view/500577186633221225" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community update</a>, the companies said Year 2 will bring new PvE missions, enemies, weapons, and more unannounced content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 2 came out in September 2024, and as part of its first anniversary, a “large-scale” update is planned to release in September. Patch 10.0 sounds like a big one for Space Marine 2, but it’s worth noting that Patch 9.0 is due out beforehand. 9.0 was meant to add a new PvP mode, but that’s now delayed to 10.0, which means 9.0 will add only balance changes.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We do know a little about this new PvP mode, however. The twist here is it’s Chaos vs Chaos set on a new map, and, most interesting of all, you’ll be able to take control of the Helbrute. The Helbrute, for the uninitiated, is a variant of the Chaos Dreadnought, an evil death-dealer piloted by a Chaos Space Marine trapped within its plated metal chest. You might remember the Helbrute from the Space Marine 2 campaign, where it came off worse in a scrap with the Ultramarines’ Brother Valtus. Alongside this new Chaos-themed PvP mode are new Chaos armours, which are much-requested by fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, 10.0 adds the new Power Axe melee weapon, which has its own moveset and execution animations.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has announced that prices of original Nintendo Switch systems and associated products in Canada will change on 1st August 2025, “based on market conditions.” The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> line up is unaffected.</p>
<p>While they don’t say so in quite so many words, the implication is that prices are rising for the previous generation of Nintendo console – they wouldn’t pre-announce a price drop like this.</p>


<p>This looks like a full readjustment of pricing in Canada, including <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/06/nintendo-switch-oled-review-it-all-comes-down-to-the-screen/">Nintendo Switch – OLED Model</a>, Nintendo Switch, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/19/nintendo-switch-lite-review/">Nintendo Switch Lite</a>, physical and digital Nintendo Switch games and Nintendo Switch accessories. Amiibo and Nintendo Switch Online will also see price changes.</p>
<p>A lot of this could be put down to the fallout from trade wars and disputes with Canada’s closest neighbour, the United States of America. Since the start of the current administration, Canada has repeatedly tussled with Trump over tariffs, with new levies being announced, paused, pulled back, reannounced and more. That’s in addition to the global tariffs that Trump put in place as well. This uncertainty has had a huge impact on pricing around the world, but while <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/01/xbox-series-xs-console-prices-are-jumping-up-around-the-world-games-to-hit-80-this-winter/">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/14/ps5-price-increases-hit-uk-eu-aus-nz-but-at-least-the-disc-drive-is-getting-cheaper/">Sony</a> announced price increases earlier this year, Nintendo has avoided making similar changes in the run up to the Switch 2’s launch – not least because of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/nintendo-switch-2-edition-game-upgrade-prices-set-at-8-and-17-depending-on-the-game/">how much criticism they took</a> over pricing the new console, games and upgrades.</p>

<p>Could this herald more price increases for other countries? Certainly, and we’ll just have to wait and see what these price changes actually end up being.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you regularly browse Amazon US, you might have noticed that some Nintendo products sold directly by Amazon have seemingly disappeared from the online store. Now, Bloomberg has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-30/amazon-lost-right-to-sell-nintendo-switch-2-amid-sales-dispute?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MTMzNDU2NiwiZXhwIjoxNzUxOTM5MzY2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWURHWDRUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJBRDcxOUY5NDBGRTk0MzNBOERCNzI2OEJDOTY3NzY3QyJ9.E71nPDnc5HCRuSL_hpDTIu53pBJ6k8Jxef68-H6UgOs&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a> a report on why that's happened.</p>



<p>According to Bloomberg's sources, the issue presented itself when Nintendo noticed that certain third-party sellers on Amazon were undercutting official products. They would essentially purchase the products in Southeast Asia, where they were presumably cheaper, and then sell them in the United States via Amazon.</p>



<p>In an attempt to reassure Nintendo, Amazon offered to attach labels to products to guarantee their authenticity. However, the proposal wasn't deemed enough of an assurance to Nintendo, and the Japanese company ultimately decided to remove its products from Amazon in the US.</p>



<p>When Bloomberg asked Amazon for a comment prior to publishing the story, a spokesperson simply commented, “The claims made by Bloomberg regarding our relationship with Nintendo are inaccurate,” without providing any further details on the subject.</p>



<p>Whatever the case, the fact remains that the issue prevented Amazon from participating in the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2, which turned out to be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fastest-selling console in history</a> with its over 3.5 million units sold in the first four days since the launch date (June 6), going <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-selling-twice-as-fast-as-the-og-switch/">twice as fast</a> as the original Switch when considering the same timeframe. </p>



<p>What's perhaps even more impressive is that even without selling directly on Amazon US, by far the biggest online store in the country, the Nintendo Switch 2 still <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-set-another-record-by-selling-1-1-million-units-in-its-launch-week-in-the-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold</a> 1.1 million units across the United States in the launch week, beating the record previously established by Sony's PlayStation 2 in October 2000. By the way, Nintendo products (Switch 2 included) are regularly available in several countries, such as Japan itself, the United Kingdom and Canada. However, Amazon US makes up two-thirds of the store's global sales.</p>

<p>The Switch title received a free update last month</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Alongside Switch 2's launch last month, Nintendo rolled out multiple free Switch game updates. One of these was for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/game_builder_garage">Game Builder Garage</a> – which not only included visual optimisations but also added Joy-Con 2 mouse support.</p>
<p>Now, timed in with this update and the game's fourth anniversary, the Game Builder Garage community has held its very own "fan-made Nintendo Direct" <a href="https://youtu.be/4XpotaYRQRY">hosted by VideoDojo on YouTube</a> (<em>thanks for the heads up, Giovani Vitti</em>).</p>
<p>It showcases 20 minutes of community-made games (and demos) available now and coming soon, and even features an entire segment dedicated to Game Builder Garage creations made by the game's community in Japan.</p>
<p>Some of the games here channel Nintendo's IP and there's even a recreation of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and many other fan-made surprises. You can see just how far the community has pushed this game-maker in the full video above.</p>
<p>And here's a quick list highlighting some of these games. You can find out more about each project by scanning the QR codes displayed throughout the presentation.</p>

<p>Natsume previously announced it would be releasing a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/harvest_moon_the_lost_valley_and_harvest_moon_skytree_village">Harvest Moon</a> double pack on the Switch at the beginning of this month, but it seems there's been a slight delay.</p>
<p>Instead of the 3rd July 2025 release, it seems farming and life simulation fans will now have to wait until <strong>31st July 2025</strong> for this game to arrive. Natsume didn't reveal the reason behind the delay but did <a href="https://x.com/Natsume_Inc/status/1939746378286039510">issue an apology on social media</a>.</p>
<p>Here it is in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hi, farmers. We are very sorry to share that Harvest Moon: The Lost Valley &amp; Skytree Village will now be released on July 31.

On one side, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-surging-sparks-is-the-best-scarlet-and-violet-set">Surging Sparks</a> cards are going through a steep correction. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other hand, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-151-cards">Crown Zenith</a> cards are showing early signs of what could be a long-term value surge. The bottom line? If you're a collector or investor, <strong>now is the time to buy into both.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m picking up what I can from both sets. The current dip in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-surging-sparks-booster-bundle-shining-fates-amazon-restock-latest">Sparks</a> is a glimmer of hope for long-suffering 2024-2025 collectors. And <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-card-packs">Crown Zenith</a> is a train I want to be on before it leaves the station. Let's go into more detail:</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Card Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/pixel-9-15-1751288444113.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Game Freak / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with Surging Sparks. A handful of top cards have taken noticeable hits in the last few weeks. <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJB7d?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Pikachu ex - 247/191</strong></a>, for example, has dropped a whopping 51% since early April, falling from $113.38 to just $56. That’s a steep decline, no doubt, but it's important to put it in context. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’re seeing more sealed product become available every week, and as supply rises, prices are naturally correcting. <a href="https://zdcs.link/9l37AE?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Hydreigon ex - 240/191</strong></a><strong> </strong>has also taken a 34% hit, now sitting at $49.60, while <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1ODK?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Milotic ex - 237/191</strong></a> is down 26% to $99. Even the alternate-art <a href="https://zdcs.link/aoGOLg?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Pikachu ex - 238/191</strong></a> is feeling the pressure, dropping 22% to $294.99, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QWY75n?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Latias ex - 239/191</strong></a> has slipped 23% to $193.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But this isn’t panic selling or lost interest in Surging Sparks, it’s the result of increased availability. Collectors and resellers aren’t willing to overpay for cards that are easier to find. If anything, that creates opportunity. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These aren’t bad cards; they’re just correcting from an inflated early market. For anyone who missed the initial wave or hesitated at launch prices, <strong>this correction is your window</strong>.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Card Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/30/pixel-9-17-1751289091092.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Game Freak / The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Crown Zenith</em> is telling a very different story. Cards from this set, particularly the stunning Secret Rare VSTARs, are starting to heat up. <a href="https://zdcs.link/aMJn7r?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Giratina VSTAR (Secret) GG69/GG70</strong></a> has jumped 24% this month, climbing from $152.78 to $199.99. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/QqwnAG?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Origin Forme Dialga VSTAR (Secret)</strong></a> shot up 22% in just a few days, now holding at $84.99. Its counterpart, <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEgBo4?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Origin Forme Palkia VSTAR (Secret)</strong></a>, surged 17% nearly overnight to $73.37. Even secondary stars like <a href="https://zdcs.link/av4oL2?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Mewtwo VSTAR - GG44/GG70</strong></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVXG4L?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Arceus VSTAR - GG70/GG70</strong></a> are each up 11% from their recent lows.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're at a pivotal moment in the Pokémon TCG timeline. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review">Scarlet and Violet</a> era is drawing to a close, and with the Mega Evolution era moving in after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-revealed">Black Bolt and White Flare</a> sets later this year, we’re about to enter the next generation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That transition turns <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/13/pokemon-sword-and-shield-review">Sword and Shield</a>-era sets like Crown Zenith into the odd category of not-so modern Pokémon cards. If historic price climbs tells us anything, <strong>cards become more valuable two generations out</strong>. We’ve seen this pattern with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/pokemon-x-y">XY</a> and early <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/15/pokemon-sun-and-moon-review">Sun &amp; Moon</a> sets, and I expect Sword and Shield to follow suit alongside old <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-brave-mega-symphonia-sets-announced-for-2025">Mega Evolution</a> Pokémon.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Sealed Product Price Comparison</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the pricing here by Amazon is insane, but there's some deals to be had when comparing these products to TCG Player. For example, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7YM4?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prismatic Evolutions Super-Premium Collection</a> is a massive 56% below <a href="https://zdcs.link/92xEG5?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">market value</a>, so go with Amazon on that one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other end of the scale, TCG Player has <a href="https://zdcs.link/aRnm1k?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Cynthia’s Garchomp ex Premium Collection</a> at a massive 48% below <a href="https://zdcs.link/zjpXZv?object_uuid=37a2f74f-95fa-44fc-b649-3acc77e8de70&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon's current price</a>, which is very close to MSRP. I've compared all the prices in the carousel above, but another pro tip is clicking through to eBay to see if there's any new bargains to be had.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Last Weeks Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the Scarlet &amp; Violet era winds down with the upcoming <em>Black Bolt</em> and <em>White Flare</em> sets, collectors are already looking backward in anticipation of what’s next—namely, the long-awaited return of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deals-for-today-mega-evolutions-fast-charging-and-a-few-smart-picks">Mega Evolutions</a>. Following the reveal of Mega Symphonia and Mega Brave for Japan’s August launch, classic Mega cards are seeing renewed interest. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Build &amp; Battle promos like Ethan’s Typhlosion and Misty’s Gyarados stumbled, and Illustration Rares like<strong> </strong><a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Charizard ex (SIR)</strong></a> and <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Eevee ex (SIR)</strong></a> cooled off from post-launch highs, classic Mega EX cards soared. <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>M Alakazam EX (Full Art)</strong></a> jumped over 400% since March, while <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>M Rayquaza EX (Full Art)</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>M Gengar EX</strong></a><strong>,</strong> and both <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>M Charizard EX - 12/83</strong></a> and <a href="https://null/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>M Charizard EX (Full Art) - 101/108</strong></a> are climbing as collectors prepared for a full-blown Mega revival.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking for more TCG discussion and market watch?

<p>Part of a new event feat. Aespa</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Following its Switch 2 release and the news of "five million global sales", <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> has now announced its latest collab.</p>
<p>It's teaming up with the South Korean K-Pop group Aespa. Fighting fans can expect themed collab items, a limited-time Outfit 4 for Juri, and last but not least the virtual artist and idol Naevis, who will be added to the game as a new commentator.</p>
<p>These collab items will be made available across all versions of the game including the Switch 2 on <strong>4th July 2025</strong>. Juri's new outfit is available for "one year only", so get it while you can.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Starting Friday, July 4, 2025, a special collaboration outfit with aespa will be released as Outfit 4 for Juri, available for one year only!"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As part of this special collaboration, the game's online Battle Hub will also be getting transformed with aespa-themed decorations. And if you log in during this event you can receive special times like new titles, device wallpapers and photo frames.</p>
<p>Last week, Capcom confirmed Sagat would also be returning in August, with his Fighting Pass content scheduled to be made available on the same date as this new collab. Capcom has also revealed its next batch of outfits, which you can take a look at in our previous coverage.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Think Peekaboo with bullets.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pubg-blindspot"><u>PUBG: Blindspot</u></a> is a cheeky little <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pubg-battlegrounds"><u>PUBG: Battlegrounds</u></a> spin off that's currently in development, and was playable on the show floor at IGN Live. It's a 5v5 top-down tactical shooter that has a classic team deathmatch mode - one we got hooked on even in the chaos of the gaming show floor - and a Demolition mode, that will see teams using traps and obstacles to outwit the enemy. It's been compared to a top-down Rainbow Six Siege and with good reason: to rack up the kills you're going to need to use your brain as well as your trigger finger. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>1. Think 'Peekaboo with bullets'</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Forget all your FPS muscle memory, this is a top-down strategic PvP game where your cunning is as important as your reaction times. You're dropped into a map full of corners, windows, doorways - basically anything you can think of to make line of sight a key part of gameplay - and you have to hunt down your opponents before they pop one in your back. You can see the whole map, but you'll only see enemies if they're in your cone of vision or your teammates, which sounds simple until someone snipes you through a window while you're focused on the doorway at the end of a corridor. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>2. Demolition Mode is on the way </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While we didn't get to play the Demolition Mode, it sounds like a step up in complexity from the 5v5 deathmatch, adding a greater need for planning and teamwork. Production Director Seungmyeong Yang explained more about it at IGN Live. "Demolition Mode can commonly be found in other games such as Counter Strike or Valorant," he said. "In this Demolition Mode there is an attacking team and a defending team, and the defense team basically tries to block the attacking team from coming in and the attacking team tries to breach the building. It was really fun to see how the gamers react, they seem to really enjoy the game!" Demolition Mode is the inspiration for those Rainbow Six Siege comparisons, albeit it from a whole new top-down perspective. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">PUBG: Blindspot at IGN Live</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>3. Start your WASD warmups </strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The keyboard and mouse controls are more like a twin-stick shooter set up, and it's going to take your brain a second to catch up to how they work. You control movement with WASD and your cone of vision with the mouse, while to aim and fire weapons you hold down the right mouse button. That will slow your movement, though, so it's always a balance between moving quickly to avoid enemy detection and choosing when to take your shots. Once you've mastered that you can focus on being more accurate, using the mouse wheel and keyboard to go for head shots, body shots, or aiming specifically at any crouched enemies. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>4. Character choice is key</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Like any team game, who you have in your five-person kill crew is going to matter. The build I played had 10 characters to choose from, each with pleasingly distinct looks and loadouts to keep things interesting. I'm not exactly a subtle operative, so I gravitated towards those with weapons that could cause carnage up close and personal, like bearded cowboy Collision, who packs a Winchester 1300 shotgun and booby traps; or Kayak, who has a semi-automatic O12 combat shotgun and a remote sticky bomb. Support players can go for Fanatic with her P90 and First Aid Kid, or sniper Buddy with her scanning drones. Some you might want to play just because of their character designs - I'm not usually one for Toxic Gas Grenades, but Dropdown has a sort of Dystopian Harley Quinn vibe that's hard to resist. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>5. You can play it in August</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There's no official release date for the full game, but there is a PC beta planned for August. Keep an eye on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3143710/PUBG_BLINDSPOT/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official Steam page</u></a> for updates. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rachel Weber is the Senior Editorial Director of Games at IGN and an elder millennial. She's been a professional nerd since 2006 when she got her start on Official PlayStation Magazine in the UK, and has since worked for GamesIndustry.Biz, Rolling Stone and GamesRadar. She loves horror, horror movies, horror games, and French Bulldogs. Those extra wrinkles on her face are thanks to going time blind and staying up too late finishing every sidequest in RPGs like Fallout and Witcher 3.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/5-things-you-need-to-know-about-pubg-blindspot]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Death Stranding is a fascinating game about connection, post-apocalyptic society, and finding meaning in the face of extinction.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Valve has added a new performance monitor to Steam that can help you understand why a game may or may not be running smoothly. Not only does it break out a game’s overall frame rate, it can tell you how many of those frames were generated by techniques like Nvidia’s DLSS or AMD’s FSR, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/500576552635859540?utm_source=SteamDB">according to a post</a>.</p><p>The change is included as part of an update to the Steam Client that’s available now, though Valve notes that this “first version” focuses on “Windows users and on the most common GPU hardware.”</p><p>The company says the new performance monitor currently offers up to four different levels of detail: a single FPS value, FPS details, CPU and GPU utilization, and “FPS, CPU, GPU &amp; RAM Full Details.” The more you choose to show, the more of your screen will be taken up by the performance monitor.</p><p>Steam previously offered a simple FPS counter, but separating out generated frames from the frames fully rendered by your graphics cores can help you better understand key differences between what you see and how a game feels. “Frame generation can’t help with things like input latency that matter to competitive gamers, but it can make things look visually smoother on today’s high refresh rate monitors,” Valve says <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/3462-CD4C-36BD-5767">in a detailed support document</a> about the performance monitor. </p><p>In practice, what that should mean is that you can see whether your game feels like it’s running at just 30 fps because it actually is running at 30 fps inside the game engine, even though you’re seeing a visually smoother image due to Nvidia and AMD’s added “fake frames.” (It’s a whole debate in the PC gaming community, and it appears Valve isn’t taking sides here.) </p><p>Valve has already given handheld gamers a taste of these quick insights by building tools <a href="https://github.com/flightlessmango/MangoHud">like MangoHud </a>into the Steam Deck and SteamOS, which similarly let you monitor your CPU, graphics, RAM, and carefully ration out your battery life. But having a way to do so built into desktop Steam will make the insights much more accessible to many more gamers.</p><p>Valve says that it has plans to “add some additional pieces of data to the performance overlay going forward, to detect certain common bad hardware performance scenarios, and to show a larger summary of your game’s performance in the overlay itself when you hit shift-tab.”</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/695543/valve-steam-performance-monitor-frame-generation-frame-rates]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i%E2%80%99m-getting-real-tired-of-not-being-able-to-trust-that-a-video-game-doesn%E2%80%99t-have-ai-crap-in-it.1232334/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some video games have been trying to use generative AI for years now,<a href="https://kotaku.com/hawken-reborn-impressions-steam-pc-505-games-mech-1850447998" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> and for the most part people simply have not been having it</a>. Why would we? It's lazy, it's ugly, it's an ethical black hole and it's being driven by an executive class desperate to lay off even more workers. While earlier and more brazen attempts at employing the tech were obvious, lately it's becoming more common for studios to slide a little AI-generated content in without drawing attention to it.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Jurassic World Evolution 3</em><a href="https://aftermath.site/jurassic-world-evolution-3-ai-removed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> launched with some AI-generated character portraits, then got bullied into removing them</a>. <em>Clair Obscur</em>, which will be a lot of people's game of the year, appeared to<a href="https://x.com/nyanomancer/status/1917435885429150176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> quietly launch with some AI-generated art then just as quietly patch it out</a>. I was <em>going </em>to review the city-building grand strategy game <em>Kaiserpunk</em> until I saw they were using AI-generated images for their dialogue sections, after which I promptly uninstalled it.</p><p>The latest culprit is <em>The Alters</em>, which has found to have shipped not only with AI-generated placeholder text in-game, but also employed AI-generated translations in some of its side content as well. None of this was disclosed prior to the game's release; it was all discovered later, by players, and has prompted an <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/11bitstudios.bsky.social/post/3lstiwaoxcc2i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explanation </a>of sorts from the developers which <em>tries </em>to calm everyone down, but which has just made things worse, because if it took people discovering these specific instances to find that 11 Bit had used AI-generated content in the game's development, how do we know there's not more of it?</p><p>This is a HUGE BUMMER.<a href="https://aftermath.site/the-alters-impressions-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I really liked this game</a>! And obviously didn't notice any of that on my playthrough, because I never stopped to read those screens and I played the game in English. To which I guess you could say, well, does it really matter if they slipped some AI stuff in there if I didn't notice it? Especially when, as developers 11 Bit <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/11bitstudios.bsky.social/post/3lstiwaoxcc2i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">say</a>, it only constitutes "0.3%" of the overall text in the game?</p><p>Yes, it fucking does. I am not just against the employment of this tech for obvious, superficial reasons. All generative AI content is built on theft; surely writing some gibberish, or pasting some lorem ipsum, would have been preferable here? And <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/11bitstudios.bsky.social/post/3lstiwaoxcc2i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saying there were "time constraints"</a> involved in rushing AI-generated translations into the game is no excuse, either. Translators are highly skilled workers; using reputable ones costs a studio money, and takes time, but it avoids situations like <em>all</em> <em>this</em>, not to mention it’s just the right and professional thing to do.</p><p>Any studio making use of generative AI is sending a very clear message: they don't care about the cataclysmic effects AI is having on their own industry, they don't care that so much of AI content is slop, they don't care that millions of people out there who are their prospective fans and customers are <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/generative-ai-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wholly opposed</a> to its use. I don't want to write about a game with AI in it, I don't want to support studios that use it and I don't want to spend a second of my time on it.</p><p>What's particularly grating about the situation with <em>The Alters</em>, aside from the fact it's absolutely coloured my enjoyment of what's an otherwise smart and interesting video game, is that the practice is becoming more common and harder to spot, and it’s increasingly just wearing us down.<a href="https://newsocialist.org.uk/transmissions/ai-the-new-aesthetics-of-fascism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Much like the nascent fascism that it has quickly grown to be the representative aesthetic of</a>, it feels like the hope with generative AI is that no matter how much you may hate it, the goal is to bombard you with its horrors and its excesses so frequently that you become numb to it. The more you see of it, the more you'll accept it as normal and the more you'll grow to if not enjoy then at least tolerate it, no matter how reluctantly.</p><p>Where you used to be able to spot generative AI a mile off, we're now needing days and even weeks after release for its use to become known. In some cases you can't even<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3862463747997849618" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> rely on Steam's AI disclaimers</a>, because neither <em>Clair Obscur</em> or <em>The Alters</em> used them. It's getting to the stage where I just can't trust video games, and it means I'm starting to approach every game I play dubiously, every piece of key art and character portrait guilty until proven innocent, clouds hanging over every image and line of dialogue.</p><p>This isn't wearing down my opposition to AI-generated content, but it <em>is</em> wearing me down when it comes to approaching and enjoying video games. It is deeply unhealthy to bring so much scepticism into every new game I play, but if I'm going to take a principled stand here, what choice do I have? I do not want this shit in my games, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/generative-ai-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you don't want it either</a>, and I don't want to play or talk about games that contain it as a result. Yet I just did, and after really liking the game too, and so here I am writing <em>this</em>. This is getting <em>exhausting</em>.</p><p>I'd like every individual and team responsible for sneaking AI content in their games to know that whatever time or money you think you're saving, and however harmless and peripheral you think it's being implemented, you're doing immeasurable damage, because not only are people going to ultimately turn on your game, but you're playing your part in them wearing out on <em>all </em>games.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/squid-game-season-3-hwang-jun-ho"><h3>Squid Game Season 3’s Hwang Jun-ho Storyline Sucked</h3></a><p>I’m just happy I don’t have to see actor Wi Ha-joon putz around on that damn boat anymore
