This is further bolstered by rising incomes among consumers, high enthusiasm among developers, and robust support from regional governments. This raises the questions—what's driving growth in the region, and where is this emerging industry headed next?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To learn more about the inner workings of the Chinese games industry, Game Developer spoke with several experts like China Independent Game Alliance (CIGA) founder Simon Zhu, Li Shen, former Tencent Games China and Epic Games China chief technology officer, and Siyuan Xia, the co-founder of Chengdu-based Leenzee Technology and director of soulslike action-roleplaying game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Single-player game development is becoming sustainable in China">Single-player game development is becoming sustainable in China</h2><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/dungeons-of-hinterberg-publisher-curve-games-acquired-by-nazara-technologies" target="_self" data-discover="true">Dungeons of Hinterberg publisher Curve Games acquired by Nazara Technologies</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Chinese developers have historically been reluctant to work on single-player games. The challenges of premium single-player production are immense, and the popularity of free-to-play titles makes those kinds of games a better business prospect. Zhu gave us a brief history lesson on how free-to-play offerings became the norm for many decades. "If you recall, 1995 was a landmark year that saw the birth of The Legend of Sword and Fairy series," notes Zhu. The franchise, which combined elements of Chinese mythology and wuxia (Chinese martial arts), was a huge hit for nearly a decade.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Unfortunately, even with the series' popularity, piracy was so rampant back then that the single-player market could not truly flourish. It wasn't until the online game boom in the 2000s that China's video games market and history truly began—which was then dominated by free-to-play games. We had to wait until March 2015 when the PlayStation officially entered the Chinese market for single-player console games to be formally introduced to gamers. Even then, single-player games still occupied a small niche until Steam's emergence significantly expanded access."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Studios and publishers also have to contend with the disparity in gauging the success of a single-player title compared to a free-to-play offering. "The fate of the former is often determined on launch day—(making those projects riskier ventures)—while the latter has more room for recovery if issues arise on the first day," Xia tells us. It all boils down to how each team adapts, just as how the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wuchang</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> team had adjusted to a new development cycle to make the overall rhythm and work process more manageable.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/voice-actor-union-hits-back-after-fortnite-debuts-controversial-ai-powered-darth-vader" target="_self" data-discover="true">Voice actor union strikes back after Fortnite debuts controversial AI-powered Darth Vader</a></p><p>Image via Lenzee/505 Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Experts are indeed well aware of the opportunities brought about by breakthrough titles opening doors to a wider audience, though these are uncharted waters for many studios in the country.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Shen (who now heads his own investment company, Re³ Lab) also adds that Chinese players and developers have always had interest in single-player games, but it wasn't until </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Black Myth: Wukong</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> sold millions of units globally that publishers became more willing to invest.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Other single-player offerings, such as S-Game's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Phantom Blade: Zero</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and Leenzee's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, also hope to capitalize on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Black Myth: Wukong</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s success. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wuchang</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, while set during the fall of the Ming Dynasty, even shows a glimpse into the culture and history of the Bronze Age Ancient Kingdom of Shu given that the studio is just an hour away from the archaeological site of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://edition.cnn.com/style/china-sanxingdui-relics-exhibition-nationalism-palace-museum-hong-kong/index.html">Sanxingdui</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/trump-administration-cuts-funding-for-the-strong-museum-of-play" target="_self" data-discover="true">Trump administration cuts funding for the Strong Museum of Play</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wuchang</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and other games wear their cultural identity proudly on their sleeves, and Xia emphasizes its importance. "I believe Chinese games are gradually forming a distinctive identity in global markets. Cultural outreach isn't an overnight phenomenon but a long-term evolution fueled by collective efforts. For our part, we aspire to contribute foundational work through our endeavors.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Shen echoes this sentiment as well. "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Black Myth: Wukong</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was hailed as 'China's first AAA breakthrough' and I believe this instilled pride not just in the developers, but across the industry as well. Many view their work as challenging the Western-dominated games landscape and elevating Asian cultural representation. This collective mission drives innovation and a deeper exploration of local/regional narratives."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That said, there's also a balancing act between highlighting cultural uniqueness and navigating geopolitical sensitivities, as Shen points out. "Look at </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Phantom Blade: Zero</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, for instance," says Shen. "It garnered nine million views on Bilibili (essentially China's own version of YouTube), but it required rebranding for Western audiences."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Challenges and opportunities in a fluctuating market">Challenges and opportunities in a fluctuating market</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The experts we spoke with agreed that Chinese game developers benefit from unique comparative advantages—and struggle with some disadvantages. "Chinese companies, owing to their experience in making online free-to-play games, are global frontrunners in commercial design and operations, excelling at creating monetization models, balancing numerical values, and guiding user behavior," says Zhu. "Sadly, game design and overall quality may fall short, particularly in narrative and script writing. The industry still suffers from limited experience in game design, insufficient market insight, and inadequate industry exchange."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Shen agrees that China has achieved world-class capabilities, particularly when it comes to mobile game platforms and substantially profitable products in the domestic market. "Unfortunately, increasing production costs and market competition raise the barrier to entry for commercial games," says Shen. "This has made some developers grow increasingly conservative in genre selection, prioritizing production polish over innovative differentiation."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zhu also shares the stark differences between Western and Chinese industries, particularly when holding events and expos. "To give you an example: The Game Developers Conference (GDC) in the United States has long been established as a key platform for industry exchanges and B2B meetings. The event hosts approximately 1,000 sessions, with an access pass that costs around 10,000 RMB (approximately $1,350), yet it manages to draw attendees from across the globe, fostering an excellent environment for communication and networking."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In contrast, the events I organize in China offer tickets at about 500 RMB (approximately 70 USD), which already includes a one-day access to the WePlay Expo. Despite this, we still face challenges in ticket sales and in engaging local speakers, some of whom are hesitant to share their expertise. I believe that this is due to the general public's understanding of the games industry and culture, especially since China's video game history and cultural integration only span around 20 years. The disparity with overseas markets is notable, but it also indicates substantial growth potential."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Crunch culture, too, remains a controversial topic in China. "Long hours are common especially during project deadlines," says Shen. "Some studios adopt a 9-9-6 schedule–i.e. 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week. While labor reforms are underway, intense competition and a culture of 'dedication' [to your work] tend to normalize overtime as well."</span></p><p>Image via CIGA.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While government guidelines do exist, enforcement remains inconsistent as it depends on each company or organization. "Our company, Leenzee, does not encourage overtime since we view that as inefficient and counterproductive," notes Xia. "In spite of this, some team members still voluntarily stay late. For them, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wuchang</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the first Chinese-developed single-player game that they've worked on, and there's an emotional attachment to it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In CIGA, we have consistently eschewed the practice of crunch or overtime, even going so far as to avoid rigid clock-in/clock-out times," explains Zhu. "The reality is that crunch, feeling compelled to stay until the boss leaves, or project pressures that lead to mandated overtime—these are all outdated formalities. They do not enhance inefficiency or quality. Instead, they only lead to increased stress and dissatisfaction among team members. Knowing how much the younger generation values work-life balance, I'm optimistic that outdated practices wane as the attitudes of newer generations continue to shift and the work environment evolves."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a period of growth for Chinese game development, one might think there were fewer layoffs going around. That's not true, says Zhu. "I'm based in Shanghai, the city that's at the forefront of the industry," he says. "In the last two years, numerous companies have experienced layoffs, including the termination of entire projects, teams, or subsidiaries. The approach differs from company to company, with some offering compensation to affected employees."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Shen points out that unlike many other game development communities, China benefits from a strong social safety net reinforced by unemployment insurance and state-backed retraining programs. "Though specifics depend on regional policies," he clarified, noting it's not a perfect solution.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Local governments are investing in game development">Local governments are investing in game development</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Regional policies that often play a huge role in supporting game development in China. Most games that are set to be published in the country require a license from the National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA), with key steps that include content review (i.e. cultural sensitivity or historical accuracy) and technical compliance. However, each regional administrative district may have additional programs in place to aid companies and studios.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The Sichuan Provincial Government has been highly supportive of our work," says Xia. "Since </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> takes place in Chengdu and parts of Sichuan Province, the government even helped us locate more cultural heritage locations available for digital preservation through our scanning process."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Depending on the regional policies, the initiatives might include tax breaks for cultural projects or grants for technology/R&amp;D," adds Shen. "Also, games recognized as key to 'digital cultural industries' have mandates to integrate traditional themes, and there might even be state-backed campaigns to export games globally as cultural ambassadors."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zhu, meanwhile, gestured to the 'tech park' we were in, one of several in the city that was built by Shanghai's administrative government. "This entire complex is home to several tech companies, both large conglomerates and startups, and most only pay a small expense for rent," says Zhu. Zhu also adds that local governments across the country have policies that help address game incubation, operations, local releases, and international distribution.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's no denying that China is the largest video games market in the world. While challenges, such as a lack of experience in making single-player games and a reluctance to risk on day-one launch revenue, do exist, experts remain hopeful. Developers, project leads, experts, and the government all contribute toward a collective effort to drive the expansion and global reach of the Chinese games industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Rising incomes and increased demand for high-quality content will continue to drive growth," says Shen, arguing that there's a brighter future ahead.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zhu, meanwhile, remains steadfast in CIGA's support of the indie games community.

			<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 set in the Ultra Quality mode via the NVIDIA App can deliver better performance than DLAA with a negligible impact on image quality, as highlighted by a new comparison video.</p>
<p>The comparison video shared today by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a> puts The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, Cyberpunk 2077, The Witcher 3, STALKER 2 and Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 running at 1440p resolution with NVIDIA DLSS 4 in DLAA, Ultra Quality Mode, and Quality Mode side by side, highlighting how Ultra Quality Mode, which can be used in any supported game by using the DLSS Override - Super Resolution option and setting it to 77% input resolution, delivers better performance than DLAA with a negligible impact on image quality that is definitely hard to notice in motion in all the game featured in the comparison. The fact that Ultra Quality mode seems to work so well makes it baffling that it isn't an official option available in games.</p>

<p>After its launch earlier this year, NVIDIA DLSS 4 has been implemented in over 125 games and apps, and the list is expanding every week with new games. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-and-other-rtx-updates-shown-off-for-upcoming-and-existing-pc-games/">In the coming weeks</a>, F1 25, Dune: Awakening, MindsEye, and FBC: Firebreak will launch with NVIDIA DLSS 4 support, followed by the Soulslike Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, which launches on July 24th.</p>
<p>The release of NVIDIA DLSS 4 coincided with the launch of Multi Frame Generation, which is exclusive to the RTX 50 series cards, and the new AI Transformer Model, which delivers better image quality than the previous CNN model in the same modes. More information on the latest iteration of the upscaler can be found on its <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/technologies/dlss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">Stellar Blade</a> is getting a sequel, developer Shift Up has confirmed. In the company's latest<a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/irdata.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=254&amp;page=1&amp;code=irdata_eng"> investor relations presentation</a>, a chart showing how the studio plans to grow going forward confirms plans for a Stellar Blade sequel, seemingly set to release sometime before 2027.</p>
<p>The chart also confirms plans for Shift Up's next game, an action RPG currently codenamed Project Witches, and plans for Stellar Blade's "platform expansion," which, if Xbox owners want to keep pie-in-the-sky hopes, could mean an Xbox version. But it is likely just referring to the PC version that is due next month.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>No Xbox version aside, a sequel is exciting news for fans of the 2024 action hit, especially if the studio is able to complete the game and release it sometime before 2027. Though that release window should be taken with a grain of salt for now, seeing as how there's always the chance for things to change or slow down development, no matter the studio or the project.</p>
<p>After being one of the most popular games in 2024, Stellar Blade will continue to be a part of the conversation with its PC launch this coming June 11, 2025. Though not for entirely positive reasons, unfortunately, as its release is currently marred by the fact that it is <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-doesnt-require-a-psn-account-to-play-on-pc-but-its-still-blocked-in-130-countries-on-steam/">not available to purchase on Steam in 130 countries</a>, despite not having any PlayStation Network sign-in requirements.</p>
<p>Shift Up has released a statement saying <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-dev-is-working-with-sony-to-resolve-pc-region-locking-claims-denuvo-doesnt-impact-frame-rates/">it is working to fix the issue as soon as possible</a>, though it's unclear if the problem will be resolved by launch.</p>

            <p>
I think it might be time to stop letting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/gearbox">Gearbox</a> head Randy Pitchford tweet about his own games. Just last month, he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/borderlands-4-gets-an-earlier-release-date-as-accidentally-revealed-by-randy-pitchford">accidentally shared</a> the fact that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> was getting an earlier than expected release date ahead of an official announcement; he put that one down to time zones. This time his overly eager attitude towards posting hasn't revealed any information about Borderlands 4 he wasn't meant to, but it is something that could maybe, just potentially, be viewed as ever-so-slightly out of touch.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Last week, when another Twitter user expressed concern over the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> potentially being $80 (a price point hasn't been set just yet), Pitchford first noted that this is not his call. To be fair to him, I imagine this'll come down to other people at Gearbox as well as Borderlands' publisher 2K. 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">A) Not my call. B) If you’re a real fan, you’ll find a way to make it happen. My local game store had Starflight for Sega Genesis for $80 in 1991 when I was just out of high school working minimum wage at an ice cream parlor in Pismo Beach and I found a way to make it happen.</p>— Randy Pitchford (@DuvalMagic) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1922454876803551555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Then, Pitchford thought he'd follow it up with this little nugget: "If you’re a real fan, you’ll find a way to make it happen. My local game store had Starflight for Sega Genesis for $80 in 1991 when I was just out of high school working minimum wage at an ice cream parlor in Pismo Beach and I found a way to make it happen."
</p>
<p>
Now, here's the thing. For a huge portion of people, even $60 is unthinkable for a game purchase, let alone $80. Second of all, have you seen the economy recently Randy! It's not great! The Borderlands series is more than 15 years old, a lot of your audience will be regular people with jobs struggling to make ends meet. Not exactly sure you thought through this one all that much, buddy.
</p>
<p>
Again, no idea if Borderlands 4 will be $80 or not, at a recent PAX East panel (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-gamers-express-concern-about-borderlands-4-potentially-costing-80-gearbox-chief-randy-pitchford-says-if-youre-a-real-fan-youll-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen">IGN</a>) Pitchford even said he doesn't know how much it'll be. I just think we could perhaps take a little more tact, especially seeing as we don't know whether $80 games will work or not yet.

While a generous dodge makes it easy to escape many of these attacks, the window for a perfect parry and follow-up counter attack is much, much narrower. </p><p>  <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, and its team at Sandfall Interactive, seemingly love to exploit that by playing around with the speed of attacks, accelerating or deaccelerating an enemy’s movements to trip players up, or occasionally separating an attack into separate parts that don’t move in sync. </p><p>Take the Robust Sakapatate for example.

My feeds have recently been full of people similarly parodying the game’s enemy attack animations. </p><p>There’s an element of FromSoftware-level trolling in<em> Clair Obscur</em>’s combat. The <em>Dark Souls</em> franchise is notorious for baiting players into letting their guard down and then squashing them. It wasn’t uncommon in<em> Elden Ring</em> for bosses to keep an attack going with extra swings just when it looked like it was safe to reset, and <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>was even worse in that regard.</p><p><em>Clair Obscur</em> engages in a similar dance, albeit one much more circumscribed by the turn-based format. There’s no 3D arena to move around in. You can jump, dodge, and parry, but are otherwise, for all intents and purposes, glued to an invisible rollercoaster whose tracks have been blown out at precise points. Needing to be able to memorize where those obstacles are independent of an enemy’s visual fake-outs can make <em>Clair Obscur</em> a mean game at various points, but also a very satisfying one. The trolling can also be so borderline silly at times it’s hard not to laugh. </p><p>This is why even though <em>Clair Obscur </em>has a similar failure screen to <em>Dark Souls</em>’ “you died,” dying in a fight feels more like getting pranked than being defeated.

This will be available in two different colors--white and lime green--and the company says that it has also aimed to make it ergonomically appealing.

            <p>Microsoft has acknowledged it has supplied AI technology to the Israel Ministry of Defense (IMOD) but has stated it "found no evidence" the technology had been used to "target or harm people in the conflict in Gaza".</p>
<p>Microsoft <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/05/15/statement-technology-israel-gaza/">published a statement last week</a>, where it admitted to providing IMOD with "software, professional services, Azure cloud services, and Azure AI services, including language translation". It added: "As with many governments around the world, we also work with the Israeli government to protect its national cyberspace against external threats".</p>
<p>The statement follows reports of Israel using AI in its conflict in Gaza, which has resulted in thousands of Palestinian deaths. As reported by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/03/israel-gaza-ai-database-hamas-airstrikes">The Guardian</a> last year, the Israeli military employed its own AI system, called Lavender, with intelligence sources claiming Israeli military officials permitted large numbers of Palestinian civilians to be killed.</p>
<p>As Microsoft has now acknowledged, there were concerns from its employees and the public regarding the use of its Azure and AI technologies by the Israeli military. In response, it has conducted an internal review, alongside an external firm the company has omitted to name.</p>
<p>"Based on these reviews, including interviewing dozens of employees and assessing documents, we have found no evidence to date that Microsoft's Azure and AI technologies have been used to target or harm people in the conflict in Gaza," the company said.</p>
<p>"Our relationship with the IMOD is structured as a standard commercial relationship," it continued. "Like all our customers, the IMOD's use of our technology is bound by Microsoft's terms of service and conditions of use, including our Acceptable Use Policy and our AI Code of Conduct. These require customers to implement core responsible AI practices - such as human oversight and access controls - and prohibit the use of our cloud and AI services in any manner that inflicts harm on individuals or organisations or affects individuals in any way that is prohibited by law."</p>
<p>Microsoft noted it does occasionally provide special access to its technologies beyond the terms of its commercial agreements. It did this in the weeks following 7th October 2023 by providing limited emergency support to the Israeli government to help rescue hostages, but with "significant oversight and on a limited basis".</p>
<p>It also noted militaries "typically use their own proprietary software or applications from defense-related providers for the types of surveillance and operations that have been the subject of our employees' questions. Microsoft has not created or provided such software or solutions to the IMOD."</p>
<p>The company also acknowledged it does not have visibility into how its customers use its technology on their own servers, typically the case for "on premise software". As such, it does not have visibility to the IMOD's government cloud operations.</p>
<p>"In sum, Microsoft has long defended the cybersecurity of the State of Israel and the people who live there," the statement concludes.</p>
<p>"We similarly have long been committed to other nations and people across the Middle East. Our commitment to human rights guides how we engage in complex environments and how our technology is used. We share the profound concern over the loss of civilian life in both Israel and Gaza and have supported humanitarian assistance in both places. The work we do everywhere in the world is informed and governed by our Human Rights Commitments. Based on everything we currently know, we believe Microsoft has abided by these Commitments in Israel and Gaza."</p>
<p>Last year, a group of current and former Microsoft employees launched the <a href="https://noazureforapartheid.com/petition/">No Azure for Apartheid petition</a>, which currently has 1527 signatures. The group has now called for Microsoft to make this investigation public.</p>
<p>"It's very clear that their intention with this statement is not to actually address their worker concerns, but rather to make a PR stunt to whitewash their image that their relationship with the Israeli military has tarnished," said former employee Hossam Nasr to Israeli newspaper <a href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2025-05-17/ty-article/microsoft-says-it-provided-ai-to-israel-for-gaza-war-but-denies-use-to-harm-palestinians/00000196-dbd0-d9a9-a99e-fbd5a6f80000">Haaretz</a>. Nasr was fired in October for helping to organise an unauthorised vigil for Palestinians killed in Gaza at Microsoft's headquarters.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-confirm-theyve-supplied-ai-tech-to-the-israeli-military-for-use-in-gaza-following-bds-xbox-boycott">RockPaperShotgun</a> reported, the international Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement called for a boycott of Microsoft products last month in protest against the company's reported connections with the Israeli military. Back in February, the <a href="https://www.ap.org/news-highlights/best-of-the-week/first-winner/2025/as-israel-uses-u-s-made-ai-models-in-war-concerns-arise-about-techs-role-in-who-lives-and-who-dies/">Associated Press published a report into the use of AI technology by the Israeli military</a>, including Microsoft and OpenAI.</p>
<p>Similarly, the developer of indie role-player <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indie-developer-pulls-game-from-xbox-in-support-of-pro-palestine-boycott">Tenderfoot Tactics removed the game from sale on Xbox</a> in support of the boycott.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/20/stellar-blade-2-in-development-shift-up-confirms/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> sequel is in the works, developer Shift Up has confirmed in an investor relations presentation, and it could be coming pretty soon.</p>
<p>One slide in particular outlines a timetable that extends from 2024 through to 2027, showing two entries for Stellar Blade with “Platform Expansion” related to an impending PC port of Stellar Blade, and then a larger block labelled “Sequel”.</p>



<p>In other words, a sequel is well on its way and should be released by 2027.</p>
<p>A sequel to Stellar Blade obviously makes a lot of sense, when you consider the positive critical reviews and healthy sales that it had. The game currently sits at 81 on Metacritic and was able to quickly sell 1 million units within its first two months on sale for PS5, and the IR presentation states that it has made 68.1bn KRW (that’s ~ £365 million). A PC version is set to be released shortly on 11th June, which is only going to bolster those figures.</p>

<p>The original game took around five years to be released from its first teaser as Project Eve in 2019, through to the game’s launch in 2024 (though it was originally intended for 2023). Game sequels can often be quicker to develop, as the initial burden of conceptualising gameplay, building up a technical foundation, and staffing a full team has already been done. Importantly, a 2026 or 2027 target would put Stellar Blade within the PS5 generation still, meaning that Shift Up wouldn’t have to consider going through all the pain of gearing up for a new game engine and new console generation.</p>
<p>Stellar Blade is a good, solid action game from Shift Up, blending together high action a la Bayonetta and Nier Automata, and some great PS5 visuals. We said in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/24/stellar-blade-review/">Stellar Blade review</a>, “Stellar Blade is a pretty enjoyable game to swing your hairband sword at, so long as you don’t mind the obvious sexualisation. There’s a few rough areas, but nothing to spoil things overall and there’s plenty of interesting story to uncover as you fight your way through giant monsters with circular saws for heads and weird tentacles for legs.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/randy-pitchford-says-a-real-fan-will-find-a-way-to-pay-80-for-borderlands-4-if-that-ends-up-being-the-price/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-is-more-vertical-and-lets-you-go-anywhere-and-thats-why-it-doesnt-have-a-minimap/">Borderlands 4</a> doesn't have an official price yet, but there's plenty of speculation that it will go the way of <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/">Mario Kart World</a> and sport an $80 price tag. When asked about the price at <a href="https://wccftech.com/gearbox-announces-new-risk-of-rain-2-expansion-and-digs-into-more-details-on-borderlands-4-at-pax-east-2025/">PAX East,</a> Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford gave a long answer about why pricing isn't his call to make, and how those on the publishing side are weighing all the options when it comes to pricing.</p>
<p>Pitchford was much more curt when responding to a fan on X, though. He reiterated to someone pleading with him not to make Borderlands 4 $80 that the price was not his call and that a "<em>real fan</em>" would find a way to buy it, even if it ends up being $80.</p>
<p>Commenting on Pitchford's post about the Creator's Voice video for Borderlands 4, <a href="https://x.com/oldgoldsot/status/1922412081023783167">X user oldgoldsot wrote</a>, "<em><span>Randy, this game better not be 80 dollars. Don't take that risk, alot of gamers aren't gonna pay 80 dollars and feed this notion of constant increase of the price tag You are the CEO, you have some say with the price when it comes to your publisher</span></em>."</p>
<p>Pitchford's response boiled down to telling users to pull up their bootstraps if the $80 price tag is too high for them.</p>
<p>"<em><span>A) Not my call. B) If you’re a real fan, you’ll find a way to make it</span></em><span><em> happen</em>,</span><span>" <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1922454876803551555">Pitchford wrote</a>. "</span><em><span>My local game store had Starflight for Sega Genesis for $80 in 1991 when I was just out of high school working minimum wage at an ice cream parlor in Pismo Beach and I found a way to make it happen.</span></em><span>"</span></p>
<p>It's not the best reply, if only because Oldgoldot's original complaint is more to do with the idea that players, like themselves, will vote with their wallet against games jumping up to $80. Whether they were a 'real fan' had nothing to do with it, and they didn't believe that Pitchford had absolutely no say when it came to pricing, as the chief executive officer at Gearbox.</p>
<p>Nintendo was the first to break the $70 ceiling by bumping up Mario Kart World to $80, followed by Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-xs-price-increase-europe/">increasing the price of its games and hardware</a>. PlayStation has bumped up the price of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-is-considering-a-ps5-price-increase-in-the-us-in-response-to-tariffs/">services and hardware across the world</a>, and while it hasn't seemingly done the same with its games, keeping <a href="https://wccftech.com/pre-order-the-ghost-of-yotei-from-amazon/">Ghost of Yotei at $70</a>, it's realistically only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Take-Two might have held back with <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-launches-on-august-8th-for-only-50-new-gameplay-trailer-released/">Mafia: The Old Country</a> with a much lower-than-expected price of only $50, and it might hold back again with Borderlands 4, opting not to jump up to $80 but stay at $70. Regardless, it's unlikely that it will cost less than $70. When <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-3-leaked-september-13th/">Borderlands 3</a> launched in 2019, it did so at the then-standard $60 price. So players should expect to pay at least $70 for Borderlands 4.</p>
<p>But they shouldn't have to expect to be told to "<em>make it happen</em>" by studio bosses when the prices go up, especially when everything, including the cost of things more important than video games, is going up.</p>

He says he’s “not dying out here” in the middle of the Seattle warzone. But the irony is that homeboy probably <em>is</em> dying out here, and in the next episode.</p><p>In the preview, we see a clip of Ellie (Bella Ramsey) and Jesse running up the aisle of the theater that the group has made into their home base while in Seattle.

As he and Ellie run into the theater lobby, Abby, who found the group’s hideout, shoots Jesse right in the face, killing him instantly. Based on the preview, it looks like this scene is in the finale, unless the show decides to handle Jesse’s fate differently.

"There's nothing woke about it. [Ciri]'s a cool character from The Witcher, and they're gonna focus on that character, and that's awesome."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Cockle has voiced Geralt throughout CD Projekt's The Witcher series, and is set to return as the beloved monster slayer once again in The Witcher 4 — though not as its main character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/geralt-is-in-the-witcher-4-and-that-is-indeed-doug-cockles-voice-in-the-trailer-cd-projekt-confirms">despite Geralt continuing to have some sort of presence</a> in The Witcher 4, the confirmation last year that his adoptive daughter would be taking centre stage for the next game (and presumably the whole of the next The Witcher game trilogy) sparked an inevitable outcry of the series going "woke" from a minority online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We can't just have Geralt for every single game for The Witcher ad nauseam, out through eternity," Cockle continued, explaining why his character should be taking a well-earned rest. "We've seen the end of Geralt's journey. Blood and Wine was supposed to wrap up that journey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I celebrate Ciri. I celebrate her being the protagonist.

"There's a whole rich world of stuff to explore with Ciri, that they didn't do when they put her into Witcher 3, because the story was about Geralt. But she hints at it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If you think it's woke, read the damn books — they're good, first of all. And secondly, you won't think it's so woke anymore."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt's games are set loosely after the finale of Sapkowski's novels, though Sapowski himself has always distanced his work — and the rather definitive finale he wrote for his characters — from The Witcher video games that continue Geralt's story some time later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Without spoiling story elements from the final novel that may be explored in The Witcher 4, it's fair to say that Sapkowski, like CD Projekt, also saw Ciri as a pivotal character — and one that is happy to pick up the action when Geralt needs some downtime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN previously discussed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-the-lore-you-need-to-know">the return of Geralt in The Witcher 4 with CD Projekt franchise and lore designers Cian Maher and Marcin Batylda</a>, who explained how the already established timeline of events all makes sense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

The tone looks to be far darker and there's a lot more to the gameplay this time around, but much like Summerfall Studios' first game, Malys looks like a visual delight and features characters I desperately want to get to know.</p><p dir="ltr">"There was an initial question, do we want to do this more as a visual novel, more like Stray Gods?" Summerfall creative director David Gaider told me during an exclusive gameplay preview of Malys. "Because Stray Gods did not have much in the way of gameplay, we wanted to try something that has more gameplay to prove that we're a studio that can do something that's fun and still narrative-driven but that has a very strong gameplay loop at its heart."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4497724-ss_ec565deb0246e301b95f662a1cf89d0e99f83c18.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497724" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4497724-ss_ec565deb0246e301b95f662a1cf89d0e99f83c18.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497724"></a><figcaption>Even the weaker demons can pack a punch.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4497724-ss_ec565deb0246e301b95f662a1cf89d0e99f83c18.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In Malys, you play as a former priest turned exorcist named Noah. He's striving to cross the entirety of a city to reach a major demon waiting for him on the other side, but lesser demons block his path. Each confrontation has a chance of wearing on Noah's will, and if it is fully depleted, he collapses, only to awaken back at the start of his journey with a time reset. These time loops allow Noah to better prepare for future runs and gain the trust of citizens, but he isn't the only one who remembers everything that transpires with every loop: A mysterious celestial, a powerful occultist, and a seemingly friendly masked demon are immune to the time rewinds, too.</p><p dir="ltr">I desperately wish I could have stolen the controller from Gaider during the hour-long preview and played the game myself--Malys looks very fun, leaning into the type of roguelite deckbuilding formula I've come to love in games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/slay-the-spire/" data-ref-id="5000-465459">Slay the Spire</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/inscryption/" data-ref-id="5000-517014">Inscryption</a>. The gameplay seems pretty intuitive. You need to protect Noah's will (essentially his health) while chipping away at the health bar of the demon in front of you, with cards pulled at random every turn offering different choices.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4497725-ss_dc5d57312d7a2b0e5d85faeb8683745bdb770480.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497725" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4497725-ss_dc5d57312d7a2b0e5d85faeb8683745bdb770480.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497725"></a><figcaption>Building your deck during a run will determine what type of strategy you can implement.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4497725-ss_dc5d57312d7a2b0e5d85faeb8683745bdb770480.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"I always liked the idea of a card game as something that builds a story," Gaider said. "You can think of the exorcism as this little contained narrative--if I'm playing salt cards [to damage the demon] and the compel [cards to weaken it, I'm] building an image in my mind of what is happening during this exorcism. Then, when we add the VO, so that [when] the demon does something and the host cries out, 'Please help me,' and then Noah plays a card [that causes] you to hear him [chanting] in the background, 'I summon the Lord's minions,' it is a story... There's the story you're being told, and then the card game is a sort of story."</p><p dir="ltr">Further complications add an intriguing strategic element to the gameplay. Each card has a cost to be played, and you can only earn the resource to play cards by burning cards in your hand. Each turn becomes a question of which cards you want to burn and which you want to play, with resources carried over between turns, so you could burn multiple cards and choose to not use the rest of your hand, reserving resources for the next turn. And as much as each demon wants to take down Noah, they're not above fighting dirty, and plenty of them will attack the mortal host they're occupying, presenting yet another person you need to protect. If any humans die, Noah's night gets reset.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4497726-ss_231053d868ec933b566caec2eba3264675af43d1.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497726" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4497726-ss_231053d868ec933b566caec2eba3264675af43d1.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4497726"></a><figcaption>Lydia the Witch is the most intriguing patron, but I have questions about the unnamed Angel as well.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4497726-ss_231053d868ec933b566caec2eba3264675af43d1.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">More and more considerations get added the further you make it into the city, with options to unlock more cards and artifacts, the latter of which inform passive abilities that Noah brings to the fight, sort of like having a character class. Certain demons hide their true identity, forcing Noah to uncover it first to be able to hurt them--a process that's aided by the time loop nature of the narrative. As a player, you begin to remember which demons are where and what their weaknesses are, which can make subsequent showdowns easier for you to overcome and inform the direction you take across the city. Another big factor to consider are the three patrons: supernatural individuals who can aid Noah on his quest in exchange for faith (currency). There's the unnamed Angel, the Witch known as Lydia, and the Collector--a masked demon named Gideon.</p><p dir="ltr">"All three of them have a reason why they use faith as their currency system," Gaider said. "They will take your faith, [and] in exchange they will give you things. The Collector gives you access to the rarest cards that you're not going to find anywhere else. And [they] can also upgrade your cards. The Witch offers you curios, which are basically [Slay the Spire's] relics. You get a curio and it can give you modifiers that remain for the rest of your run... [And the Angel is who] you're going to [if you] need that healing. And there are a few holy-based cards that only the Angel can offer you as well. So there's a reason to go to all three of them, but they don't like each other. They're diametrically opposed to each other, so they don't like you allying with the other characters. There is an element of [having] no choice that comes down the line, [and that's] the strategy: You've got to work out your path and figure like, 'Okay, if I go down this left path rather than the right [and don't meet the Angel], what if I end up in need of healing? That might be an issue.'"</p><p dir="ltr">The designs for all three patrons and Noah are as excellent as the reimagined gods in Stray Gods, which makes sense seeing as art director Benjamin Ee has returned for Malys. The bigger surprise are the designs of the demons, which are grotesque monstrosities that look nothing like anything from Stray Gods. If Malys is, as Gaider said, the team's attempt to prove they refuse to be typecast as a visual-novel studio, I'm convinced. Parts of Malys look like Stray Gods--the designs of the humans, and the focus on choices--but so much of it stands in stark contrast to Summerfall's first project. I'm sold on the gameplay; here's hoping the story elements are also pretty good!</p><p dir="ltr">Malys is set to launch for PC in 2025.</p>

		<p>The unthinkable is happening in Helldivers 2 right now, as the Illuminate invasion has reached Super Earth itself, giving players the daunting task of defending Managed Democracy on its homeworld.</p>
<p><iframe title="Helldivers 2 - Heart of Democracy | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uwDx7-HTk0s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“The worst nightmare of all those who fight for Managed Democracy has been made a grim reality,” reads the announcement.</p>
<p>“Despite the valiant efforts of our Helldivers to push back the fleet, the Illuminate have reached Super Earth. Now they are swarming our cities, terrorizing citizens, and destroying our infrastructure. It’s time to rise up and take arms and fight for the precious foundations and soil of Democracy manifest. Helldivers, return to our planet and defend what is rightfully ours.”</p>
<p>While human settlements were featured in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> since the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/helldivers-2-omens-of-tyranny-is-out-now-a-new-faction-and-trucks/">Omens of Tyranny update</a> introduced the first Illuminate enemies at the end of last year, the urban sprawl of Super Earth will take that to the next level. Battles on Super Earth will feature huge skyscrapers, busy streets and even playgrounds that you’ll have to fight the Illuminate scourge from.</p>

<p>The one goal is to repel the Illuminate invasion by fighting to gain ground, battling alongside less elite SEAF troops who will fight autonomously, but can also be ordered to follow Helldivers around – salute them and they’ll join your fight – and activating Planetary Defense Cannons to blast away at the Illuminate fleet.</p>
<p>Players should be more powerful than ever thanks to the primary weapon customisation that was added last week alongside the expanded surplus options. These were already being put to use against new Illuminate enemies including the Crescent Overseer and the freaky Fleshmob.</p>
<p>It’s not clear how long the game’s community will have to try and stave off the Illuminate attack, but should they fail, this will be the end of the first campaign in the game, which started with the launch back in early 2024. Don’t worry, the galactic map will reset if that happens.</p>
<p>The update does also have some fixes and tweaks, so here’s the patch notes for Helldivers 2 version 1.003.002:</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li>Crash fixes</li>
<li>Fix for some corpses flinging the Helldivers great distances</li>
<li>Audio fix for the Stingray</li>

</ul>
<h2>Fixes</h2>
<p><strong>Resolved Top Priority issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Attempting to purchase a Master of Ceremony item in the Super Store when on PlayStation 5 while using the “Quality” visual setting will no longer change page</li>
<li>Crash Fixes, Hangs and Soft-locks:</li>
<li>Fixed a crash that could occur when trying to enter the Weapon Customization menu on certain weapons</li>
<li>Fixed crash that could happen when killing illuminates that were about to spawn</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Weapons and Stratagems</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-new-chicago-city/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Cyberpunk 2077 sequel codenamed Project Orion is going to feature a second city to explore besides Night City, according to information provided by the creator of the Cyberpunk universe.</p>
<p>As reported by Polish publication <a href="https://www.cdaction.pl/newsy/cyberpunk-2077-tworca-potwierdza-nowe-miasto-w-kontynuacji-to-chicago-ktore-poszlo-w-zla-strone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CD-Action</a>, Mike Pondsmith recently talked with TVGRY during the Digital Dragon 2025 event, revealing that, while he is not as involved in the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel as he was with the original game, he gets to see scripts, check out new cyberwar, and talk with the various departments at work on the game, including the environment design people. From these people, he probably learned that the second entry in the series will feature a second city besides Night City, which he described as having the feel of "Chicago gone wrong", rather than the Blade Runner-inspired atmosphere of Night City. While unable to share more, Mike Pondsmith added that he sees this city working for the game, so it will definitely be interesting to see how it will fit in the story and the universe.</p>
<p>Though we probably won't see the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel Project Orion anytime soon, the franchise by CD Projekt Red entered the spotlight once again last month, when a Nintendo Switch 2 port of the game was announced alongside the Nintendo system. Despite the technical differences with the other consoles, the port seems to be holding up quite well and could offer a much better on-the-go experience than the Steam Deck, judging from some <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-early-comparisons/">recent comparisons.</a> With CD Project Red putting so much <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-run-effort-play-well/">effort</a> into the port, including the entirety of the game on the retail edition's cartridge, it wouldn't be surprising to see the game become one of the most popular Nintendo Switch 2 launch releases.</p>
<p>The Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, Project Orion, is currently in development for yet-to-be-announced systems. A release date has yet to be confirmed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/campfire-cabal-expeditions-still-alive<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>franchise steward Campfire Cabal has confirmed that it isn't dead, and that a new game in the series is in the works, despite the past couple of years of "radio silence".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://campfirecabal.com/still-alive/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> rather appropriately titled "Still Alive" on the official Campfire Cabal website, the studio says that it "never stopped" working on the newest entry in the series, but that it did go through some hardships as a result of the turmoil currently facing the gaming industry.</p>

<p>Campfire Cabal says that although it was never shut down, it did have to "say goodbye to many of [its] colleagues", leaving a "compact team" behind to work on the new&nbsp;<em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>game, which began production back in 2022.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/expeditions-rome-campfire-cabal.jpg?itok=QEv5XgYq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/expeditions-rome-campfire-cabal.jpg?itok=OrkX9C0d 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Expeditions: Rome&nbsp;</em>is still the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>series, at time of writing.</figcaption></figure><p>The studio goes on to say that it "received the green light to scale back up and transition into full production" on the latest&nbsp;<em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>game in March this year.</p>

<p>According to Campfire Cabal, the next&nbsp;<em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>game will be set in a "new period of our history" and "a new part of the world for the series", and it will represent "another step up in quality" from&nbsp;<em>Expeditions: Rome</em>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Campfire Cabal, the studio was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/campfire-cabal-is-new-development-studio-from-expeditions-rome-developers" rel="nofollow">founded all the way back in 2022</a> to steward the&nbsp;<em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>series of historical RPGs, following the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/expeditions-rome-developer-logic-artists-closing-down-to-make-nft-games" rel="nofollow">disbandment of original developer Logic Artists</a> to pursue NFT game development alongside new parent Dynasty Studios.</p>

<p>As it stands, there are three games in the&nbsp;<em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>series: 2013's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/expeditions-conquistador" rel="nofollow"><em>Expeditions: Conquistador</em></a>, which kicked off the franchise, and its two followups&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/expeditions-viking" rel="nofollow">Expeditions: Viking</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/expeditions-rome" rel="nofollow"><i>Expeditions: Rome</i></a>.</p>




<p>If you're wondering where 2024's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/expeditions-mudrunner-game-announced" rel="nofollow">Expeditions: A MudRunner Game</a>&nbsp;</em>fits into things, well, it doesn't. It's a completely unrelated title, so don't worry about fitting that one into your schedule if you're looking to complete the series.</p>

<p>In any case, it looks like the&nbsp;<em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>series will continue its explorations, although we don't know where or when. Stay tuned for more.</p>
