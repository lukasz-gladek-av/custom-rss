            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenimax-qa-union-strike<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>ZeniMax Workers United, a gaming union consisting of quality assurance workers from across the studios of Bethesda's parent company, is going on strike today over what it alleges to be excessive outsourcing of QA on parent company Microsoft's part.</p>

<p>As revealed in <a href="https://x.com/ZeniMaxWorkers/status/1856714377992278336" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, the union wants Microsoft to "meet [it] at the bargaining table over key issues like remote work options and outsourcing", <a href="https://x.com/ZeniMaxWorkers/status/1856714480413003983" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">demanding</a> "job security and improved working conditions".</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/bethesda-strike-zenimax-xbox-microsoft" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Inverse report</a>, QA test lead Rhyanna Eichner says ZeniMax Workers United members are "all really looking forward to coming together and spending time together", and that "this is what needs to be done to move on".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-elder-scrolls-online-zenimax-workers-united-strike.jpg?itok=iLZ6m1w6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-elder-scrolls-online-zenimax-workers-united-strike.jpg?itok=Dg4PltUN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>ZeniMax Workers United comprises QA workers of all stripes from across Bethesda's offices.</figcaption></figure><p>Eichner also says that the union is striking over its parent company's remote work proposals, which she says are not good enough. She says Microsoft has "continually given us their first proposal again and again", and that it's obvious to her the union's "different mobilization tactics have not worked".</p>

<p>Senior QA tester Juniper Dowell adds that many employees would be forced to consider alternative employment if they were required to be at the office five days a week because they were hired under remote working conditions.</p>

<p>Dowell says that while striking "isn't fun or ideal", there's a "satisfaction in having a concrete physical action" to help the union and its members "fight for better work conditions". She's hoping that Microsoft and ZeniMax will "stop dragging their feet and meet us at the table".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bethesda-zenimax-workers-united-strike-starfield.jpg?itok=mv-ewWrh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bethesda-zenimax-workers-united-strike-starfield.jpg?itok=OoFPjxfo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>ZeniMax Workers United wants to negotiate for better remote working policies and less QA outsourcing.</figcaption></figure><p>ZeniMax's union isn't the only one to go on strike in recent months. Last week, employees at French studio Don't Nod <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-employees-strike" rel="nofollow">went on strike</a> following the announcement that almost 70 jobs at their studio could be at risk, with remote working policies also on the list of issues employees raised.</p>

<p>Gaming giant Ubisoft also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter" rel="nofollow">faced a strike in October</a>, again in part over remote working policies, as well as what the employees involved perceived to be inadequate salaries.</p>

<p>ZeniMax Workers United's strike will last a single day, running between 10am and 6pm local time. We'll have to wait and see whether Microsoft and ZeniMax pay enough attention for negotiations to truly begin.</p>

It seems it’s more that the company is worried they’ll play with it the wrong way. “By the time you notice, it’s already covered in drool...”</p><p>I have three cats, and I can’t say this has ever proved an issue. My ten-year-old is far more likely to cover the screen in that inexplicable sticky residue all children exude, even more so than Archie, the giant, lumbering ginger. Although, in fairness, I don’t own a slavering St. Bernard or Mastiff, leaving those ghastly tendrils of slobber everywhere they go. I wouldn’t want one of those playing <em>Zelda</em> on my device.</p><p>The tweet continues, “Pet saliva and urine can cause the device to malfunction due to water exposure. If you have pets, be careful about where you place your Switch.”</p><p>“Pets” seems to be doing rather a lot of work, trying to cover up for the real culprits here: <em>dogs</em>. Just name them, Nintendo. Stop trying to be all woke and refusing to profile. We’ve also got a pet corn snake, and I’m not in the least concerned about Cornflake running my Switch under the faucet.</p><p>However, according to the image accompanying the warning, it looks like Nintendo might be more concerned about rabid foxes than anything else.</p><p>Look, it’s good advice. You <em>should</em> stop your pets from peeing on your electronic devices. You also shouldn’t put them through the washing machine, run them over with your car, or drop them into a volcano.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The company is teaming up with TiMi Studio Group, known for its work on Call of Duty Mobile and Pokemon Unite.</p><p dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Outlanders is being described as an open-world survival game, offering solo play as well as co-op for up to four people. The announcement trailer--seen below--interestingly enough doesn't showcase any combat for the title, instead focusing on mobility. The video sees a player paragliding across the map, swimming, sliding, utilizing a grappling gun, climbing a cliff, and even being shot out of a cannon-like device.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">A core aspect of the Monster Hunter franchise is taking on giant creatures and then craving them up for parts to build new armor as well as weapons. Monster Hunter Outlanders will feature "the traditional hunting experience," per a press release, though this aspect isn't really shown in the debut trailer.</p><p dir="ltr">“Monster Hunter Outlanders not only offers players an authentic hunting experience, but it does it in a massive open world featuring the community and social systems players are looking for today," said TiMi producer Dong Haung in the press release.</p><p dir="ltr">The game is coming soon to mobile devices, though no specific launch date is listed. In the meantime, there will be several playtests for Monster Hunter Outlanders.</p><p dir="ltr">The next mainline entry for the series is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-launching-in-february/1100-6526679/" data-ref-id="1100-6526679">Monster Hunter Wilds, which will launch February 28, 2025</a>, on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.

            <p>Following the passing of Sylens' original actor Lance Reddick last year, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-horizon-adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> has recast the role.</p>
<p>In the latest Horizon outing, the character is voiced by Tim Russ, Eurogamer can confirm.</p>
<p>Russ has been in the industry for many years, and is known for his roles in the likes of Star Trek: Voyager where he portrayed Vulcan Lieutenant Commander Tuvok, and as doorman Frank in Samantha Who?</p>

<p>Sylens features in both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>, which Lego Horizon Adventures is based on, and its sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a>. Series developer Guerrilla is yet to comment on who will replace Reddick, who portrayed Sylens in both mainline games and their respective DLC, longer term.</p>
<p>Reddick <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/actor-lance-reddick-star-of-destiny-and-the-wire-has-died">passed away in March last year</a>, aged 60. Following his passing, players discovered a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lance-reddick-memorial-added-to-horizon-forbidden-west-dlc">memorial situated on an island visited in Horizon Forbidden West's DLC Burning Shores</a>, which served as an homage to the late actor.</p>
<p>"In honour of Lance Reddick, we created a memorial to commemorate the profound impact he had on us all," Guerrilla wrote at the time.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Lance, for everything you brought to the role of Sylens: your gravitas, energy, wisdom and more. An incomparable talent and friend. We miss you terribly."</p>

<p>As for Lego Horizon Adventures, we just awarded the game two out of five stars.</p>
<p>"It's a decidedly joyless kind of game, the sort that's better to look at than actually play with, and one that does little to bridge the gap between its two main subjects," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-horizon-adventures-review">Eurogamer's Lego Horizon Adventures review</a>. "I still don't know why it exists or who it's for, and there's little evidence to suggest that Guerrilla or Gobo know the answer either."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Amazon’s Prime video service have released a new trailer for<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/secret-level/"> Secret Level.</a> The fifteen episode series features fourteen dedicated to a specific game, and one for “various PlayStation Studios games” which we know will feature Kratos from God of War as he was seen briefly in the first trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Secret Level - Official Trailer | Prime Video" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SvY9Uq7I30Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Let’s address the elephant in the room: Concord is still listed, although not shown in the trailer. Well, I don’t <em>think</em> it’s shown in the trailer, given that barely anyone played the game before it was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/29/sony-permanently-shuts-down-concord-and-developer-firewalk-studios/">deleted from history</a> it’s rather hard to judge.</p>
<p>The cast list has also been revealed and there are some big names; Arnold Schwarzenegger (The Terminator Franchise), Kevin Hart (Jumanji), Keanu Reeves (John Wick), Temuera Morrison (The Book of Boba Fett, Chief of War), Ariana Greenblatt (Barbie), Heaven Hart, Emily Swallow (The Mandalorian), Gabriel Luna (The Last of Us, Terminator: Dark Fate), Ricky Whittle (American Gods, Land of Bad), Patrick Schwarzenegger (The White Lotus), Merle Dandridge (The Last of Us), Claudia Doumit (The Boys), Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje (Lost, The Union), Clive Standen (Vikings, The Morning Show), Laura Bailey (The Legend of Vox Machina), and Michael Beach (The Perfect Couple, Tulsa King).</p>
<p>The games covered include: Armored Core, Concord, Crossfire, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Exodus, Honor of Kings, Mega Man, New World: Aeternum, PAC-MAN, , Sifu, Spelunky, The Outer Worlds, Unreal Tournament and Warhammer 40,000. The first set of episodes will drop on December 10th with additional episodic drops until December 1th, so I would guess that means two episodes a day.</p>

<p>“Secret Level weaves a tapestry of iconic games across multiple mediums, to tell a series of unique and captivating stories,” said Vernon Sanders, head of television, Amazon MGM Studios. “Created and led by Tim Miller, Blur Studio, and Supervising Director Dave Wilson, each episode will take our global Prime Video customers on a brand new journey with breath-taking animation and imaginative storytelling.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/13/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Last year, I visited Japan for a few weeks, soaking in the culture, the nature and way too many plates of curry. Giant billboards advertised the latest niche gacha game, and multi-floor department stores dedicated huge displays to current and upcoming game releases unlike anything I’d ever see back in America’s dried out and dour shopping culture. The single most mind-blowing display of gaming reverence and promotion, though, was when I walked into a Lawson convenience store in Osaka that had been converted from front-to-back with a Dragon Quest theme. The signage outside was made of slime smiles, when you walked into the store you’d hear the crunchy NES sound-effect of an opened door from the original game play, and half the store was dedicated to selling merch related to the franchise. Dragon Quest has had a lasting impact not just on gaming, but on Japanese culture as a whole. Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, above all else, is a reminder and a celebration of that.</p>
<p><iframe title="DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D Remake - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dRx4TbtpcRw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For people outside of Japan, it can be hard to notice that influence, and a lot of that is simply due to the Dragon Quest series not being nearly as impactful or consistent overseas. Mainline entries like Dragon Quest IX on the Nintendo DS or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/26/dragon-quest-xi-s-echoes-of-an-elusive-age-definitive-edition-review/">Dragon Quest XI</a> have certainly made an impact on gamers worldwide, but for Dragon Quest III and what is essentially this franchise’s equivalent of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/">Final Fantasy VII</a>, there hasn’t been a widely accessible or brushed up release until now with this remake.</p>


<p>Of course, with HD-2D in the title, it’s clear that this isn’t a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/06/final-fantasy-vii-remake-review/">Remake</a> or Rebirth moment for Dragon Quest. The bones of this game are the same as they were in 1988 – you’re a young adventurer boy or girl, tasked with forming a party of companions and setting off into the world to vanquish the demon Baramos and save the world. It’s without a doubt a clichéd story that’s been adapted and twisted and parodied for decades, but what’s important here is that Dragon Quest III is ostensibly the game that invented that kind of story in the first place.</p>


<p>As a remake, Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake isn’t doing a whole lot to reinvent that story, flesh it out or turn it into some kind of meta-commentary. There are some additional Episodic story scenes you can access throughout your journey, but they serve to flesh out some of the already existing characters and story threads – like getting a deeper look into the adventures of your famous father Ortega. As a protagonist, you’re a blank-slate, and the same goes for your customisable companions.</p>
<p>Each character class has a unique set of sprites and can be customized with their own names, hair colour, and personality-types, but with no spoken dialogue from your comrades, that final element only affects their stat-growth on paper. Still, that didn’t stop me from telling a story in my mind where my scatterbrain cleric Kikuri kept wasting her MP and missing attacks because she was nursing a perpetual hangover/drunken stupor like her Bocchi The Rock anime namesake.</p>

<p>A new gameplay feature that helps amplify that sense of self-driven storytelling is the ability to Recall conversations. Anytime someone says something you’d like to keep in mind for later, instead of having to jot down a note in your notebook you can just press the start button to save that entire conversation in-game for later access. In a game like Elden Ring, the natural experience of remembering characters wants and objectives can be hard to keep track of the deeper you get into the game. A quality-of-life feature like Recall makes that process a bit easier without hampering the self-guided nature of the journey at all.</p>
<p>Lots of other quality-of-life features have made their way into Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, like the introduction of multiple difficulty options that can be swapped at any time. This isn’t a particularly difficult RPG by traditional standards, but certain tricky bosses or lengthy dungeon back-tracks definitely had me relying on a temporary drop in difficulty to get through them a bit more swiftly.</p>
<p>There’s also a brand new vocation called Monster Wrangler for your companions – it starts out as a pretty standard brawler type with good physical attributes, but eventually turns into a bit of a Blue Mage style character. By capturing and recruiting monsters, you can learn skills from them for the Monster Wrangler. On top of the really fun skill variety, having the added layer of monster-capturing on top of every enemy encounter made battles a lot more enticing and exciting. Your recruited monsters also feed into the newly expanded Monster Arena side-mode, a huge upgrade from the monster-battle gambling of the original game. It feels like a huge love letter to Dragon Quest Joker, the iconic Pokemon-inspired spinoff series, to have these Monster Wrangler and Monster Arena elements worked into the game – and it’s impressive how seamlessly they fit into your grand adventure.</p>

<p>The biggest change and upgrade in Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake, without a doubt, is the shift in visuals to an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/07/26/octopath-traveler-review/">Octopath Traveler</a> inspired blend of 3D environments, realistic lighting, and traditional pixel-art sprites. It’s done incredibly well, and the mix of old-school elements like the sprite art and chunky sound effects combined with the flashy new visual touches creates such a fun contrast. Particle effects have been given a wild modern upgrade too, leading to incredibly satisfying moments in battle where your spells and abilities summon huge gusts of wind and searing fireballs.</p>
<p>My only issue with the HD-2D treatment is that, in a lot of locations and times of day, the bloom lighting can be a bit too distracting – I nearly had to wear sunglasses from how bright the sun was reflecting off my parties sprites.</p>

<p>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake is a lovingly-crafted celebration of gaming’s most iconic franchises. Rather than reinvent that wheel and change the game for modern audiences, Square Enix has highlighted and elevated the elements that made this such an iconic game all those decades ago, while slipping in a treasure trove of quality-of-life features that make it an even smoother experience to either dive into for the first time ever or return to yet again.</p>

			<p>Fallout TV series creator Jonathan Nolan and Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer appeared earlier this week at the Paley International Council Summit during a panel titled Source Code: How Hollywood and Videogames Are Leveling Up Together.</p>
<p>At some point during the conversation (transcribed by Inverse), Phil Spencer <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/fallout-season-2-jonathan-nolan-interview-phil-spencer-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the outstandingly successful Fallout TV show might have actually benefited from not having another game launch in the same franchise at a similar time. The executive pointed out that the strategy is much more in-depth and long-term than merely using the adaptation to incentivize fans to buy a new game.</p>
<p><em>We didn't have a new game lined up for the launch. I actually think that gave us some creative liberty that we wouldn't have had if we tried to coordinate the production of two very different creative processes to land at the same time.</em></p>
<p><em>The play is much more long term than trying to drive some gift buying.</em></p>
<p>Fortunately, the days of tie-ins, when games were often rushed out of the door simply to be released alongside big-budget movies, are behind us. This has led not only to greater creative freedom but also to much better overall quality, as the creative process cannot be rushed. Plus, Fallout games did <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-show-popularity-got-bethesda-at-least-80-million-says-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get</a> a massive boost in sales anyway when the TV show dropped on Amazon Prime Video, even if they weren't newly released.</p>
<p>During the panel, Jonathan Nolan briefly discussed the show's <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-officially-renewed-by-amazon-for-second-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second season</a>, saying it will rely even more on flashbacks than season one.</p>
<p><em>For the most part, in games, it’s a little harder grammatically to flashback, right? Some games can do it very well. There are a couple of memorable flashbacks in Call of Duty and other franchises. But for the most part, you kind of lock the user into that first-person point of view across both space and time. In a show, you can flashback and you can explore that world beforehand. It’s one of the things I love the most about season one and we will be doing more of that in season two.</em></p>
<p>Fallout TV season 2 will start filming soon in California.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[GOG Preservation Program Aims to Make Your Games "Live Forever"]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gog-preservation-program-aims-to-make-your-games-live-forever.1034688/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GOG has announced the GOG Preservation Program, an initiative that aims to keep certain games playable forever no matter whether their developers are still supporting them or not.</p>

<p>Over on the official Preservation Program <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/gog-preservation-program" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, the company warns that "time is erasing the games that shaped you", but that "we can fight back" through the program, which "ensures classic games remain playable on modern systems".</p>

<p>According to GOG, games that belong to the initiative will be DRM-free and eligible for "dedicated tech support", so even if something does go wrong, you'll be able to get help to fix it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gog-preservation-program-games.jpg?itok=8mrmRJ9h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gog-preservation-program-games.jpg?itok=jt7K9zVg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The GOG Preservation Program currently covers 100 games, and more are coming.</figcaption></figure><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1856698605563793789" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">followup thread on X</a> (formerly Twitter), GOG says that the initiative features "updated, improved, or quality-tested builds", and that if you see the Preservation Program stamp on a game's GOG page, that means you'll be able to enjoy it on your PC "hassle-free".</p>

<p>Games currently included in the program include the likes of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-3-classic-gog-re-release" rel="nofollow">original three&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>games</a>, the original&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>and its&nbsp;<em>Hellfire&nbsp;</em>expansion, and&nbsp;<em>Heroes of Might and Magic 3</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Kain: Defiance</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>, and more.</p>

<p>GOG cites the Video Game History Foundation as saying that "87% of games created before 2010 are inaccessible today", a sobering statistic that demonstrates just how necessary an initiative like this really is.</p>




<p>You'll also find an FAQ on the Preservation Program's website that provides more information about the initiative. It includes info like what to do when a stamped game doesn't work, as well as whether classic GOG games are necessarily worse than those included in the Program (the answer being no, of course).</p>

<p>GOG says it wants "hundreds of games" to come with the GOG Preservation Program stamp by the end of 2025, so you can expect lots more games to be added to this initiative as time goes on. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Instead, the company opted to work directly with smart TV manufacturers to integrate that functionality. The company’s much hyped Xbox mobile gaming store is also still MIA. Still, it sounds like Spencer thinks the overall market is trending away from walled gardens, whether on Xbox, iPhone, or beyond.</p><p> “I think the ball is moving in the right direction,” Spencer said. “I think this idea of open platforms, where users have more choice, creators have more choice, you see the momentum, right?” </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Union employees at Bethesda have gone on strike across multiple locations in the United States.</p>



<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/bethesda-strike-zenimax-xbox-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Inverse</a>, “hundreds” of employees have walked off the job in both Maryland and Texas. It’s claimed that the strike is due to the company not addressing remote work concerns as well as the recent outsourcing of quality assurance. The latter being something the union never agreed to.</p>



<p>The report claims that the union is “looking to limit the percentage of quality assurance testers the company outsources in comparison to the number of full-time workers present in its bargaining unit”.</p>



<p>The union, which is the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-game-studios-union-microsoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest video games union</a> in the United States, is also looking for a more flexible remote work policy after employees are being denied remote work requests.</p>



<p>“They have continually given us their first proposal again and again, and it’s become obvious that our different mobilization tactics have not worked,” Bethesda Quality Assurance Test Lead Rhyanna Eichner told Inverse regarding the company’s negotiations with the union.</p>

<p>“Striking isn’t fun or ideal, but there’s a satisfaction in having a concrete physical action we can do to fight for better work conditions,” Senior Quality Assurance Tester Juniper Dowell told the outlet. “Hopefully, we can convince them to stop dragging their feet and meet us at the table.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft and Bethesda for comment on the strike. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

<p>Valve has released an update for Steam that officially ends support for Windows 7 and 8 operating systems. </p>



<p>The update, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/4472730495692571025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released on November 5</a> that includes the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steams-game-recording-feature-is-now-out-of-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ability to record games</a> within Steam, forces those who wish to continue to use Steam to either upgrade to Windows 10 or 11. Or, if you don’t want Windows at all, you can move to MacOS or Linux.</p>







<p>“This version of the Steam client will no longer run on Windows 7 or Windows 8,” the update reads. “Users on these OS versions will not automatically update to this new version of the Steam Client.”</p>



<p>In it’s FAQ page on the support ending, Valve says moving on from the old operating systems has to do with the security of its users.</p>



<p>“This change is required as core features in Steam rely on an embedded version of Google Chrome, which no longer functions on older versions of Windows,” Valve said. “In addition, future versions of Steam will require Windows feature and security updates only present in Windows 10 and above.”</p>



<p>They continued: “Computers running these operating systems, when connected to the internet, are susceptible to new malware and other exploits which will not be patched. That malware can cause your PC, Steam and games to perform poorly or crash. That malware can also be used to steal the credentials for your Steam account or other services.”</p>



<p>It’s also worth noting that Steam will also no longer work on MacOS 10.13 or 10.14.</p>



<p>Are you one of the holdouts still using Windows 7 or 8? Will this finally get you to upgrade? Let us know down below.</p>

With the release of Lego Horizon Adventures this week, it has been confirmed--in that spin-off game at least--that Sylens does appear and is voiced by Star Trek Voyager actor Tim Russ.</p><p>A deuteragonist in the games, Sylens is similar to Horizon's hero Aloy in several ways, as he also explores the secret history of the world following a cataclysmic event that saw machines rise to the top of the food chain. Russ is no stranger to the Horizon series, as he'd previously played the character Jetakka in Horizon Forbidden West. In Lego Horizon Adventures, he appears as "DJ Sylens" (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-horizon-adventures-recasts-late-lance-reddick-with-star-trek-actor-tim-russ" data-target="true"

ready to share details at the time.

            <p>GOG has announced a new Preservation Program.</p>
<p>This initiative from the PC platform aims to maintain games' compatibility with modern and future systems.</p>
<p>"Time is erasing the games that shaped you. Forgotten, incompatible, unplayable," the <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/gog-preservation-program">GOG Preservation Program</a> page reads. "We can fight back."</p>

<p>At the time of writing, GOG has confirmed 100 games are currently part of the program. "By maintaining these iconic titles, GOG helps you protect and relive the memories that shaped you, DRM-free and with dedicated tech support," the team wrote.</p>
<p>In addition, GOG shared a number of preservation stories, including <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_3_complete_edition">Heroes of Might and Magic 3</a>, which first released over two decades ago.</p>
<p>GOG "revived" it 10 years ago, and an update today fixed non-playing intros in Russian and French versions of the game, validated stability and "verified compatibility" with Windows 10 and 11.</p>
<p>Other titles include the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/original-resident-evil-available-now-on-gog-2-and-3-on-their-way">recent Resident Evil Bundle</a>, which comprises the original game in the series as well as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a> and Resident Evil 3.</p>

            <p>The PlayStation-published <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-horizon-adventures">Lego Horizon Adventures</a> doesn't include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> support at launch.</p>
<p>If you pop over to the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP9000-PPSA14632_00-LEGOHZNADVENTURE">PlayStation store</a>, the game doesn't have the PS5 Pro Enhanced label attached to it, which other games do. Rather, the soon-to-be-released brick-based romp will instead offer players two different graphics modes on its debut: Performance and Fidelity.</p>
<p>Performance mode will provide a higher frame rate. Fidelity, meanwhile, gives a lower frame rate but - as the name suggests - higher fidelity. These modes are used in countless other games, as well.</p>

<p>It may well be that developers Guerrilla and Studio Gobo release a patch for Lego Horizon Adventures that adds that shiny, PS5 Pro 'Enhanced' label at a later date.</p>
<p>For now, however, Eurogamer has verified that the game's Perofrmance and Fidelity modes are the only ones offered on both the base PS5 as well as the PS5 Pro.</p>

<p>On the PlayStation 5 Pro's announcement, it was revealed several titles would be patched up to that PS5 Pro Enhanced level, which will ensure these games take full advantage of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-announces-digital-only-playstation-5-pro-costs-700">PlayStation 5 Pro's improved features</a>, such as advanced ray tracing and a GPU that enables up to 45 percent faster rendering.</p><p>Many of the games listed at this time were from Sony's own first-party studios, such as Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/insomniac-games">Insomniac Games</a>, The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> and Bluepoint's Demon's Souls.

<p>As for Lego Horizon Adventures, we just awarded the game two out of five stars.</p>
<p>"It's a decidedly joyless kind of game, the sort that's better to look at than actually play with, and one that does little to bridge the gap between its two main subjects," our Katharine wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-horizon-adventures-review">Eurogamer's Lego Horizon Adventures review</a>. "I still don't know why it exists or who it's for, and there's little evidence to suggest that Guerrilla or Gobo know the answer either."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-handheld-confirmed-but-years-away</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-handheld-officially-confirmed-by-phil-spencer-but-its-years-away.1034637/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-handheld-confirmed-but-years-away<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox head Phil Spencer has officially confirmed that an Xbox handheld is in the works, although that announcement does, as you would expect, carry several pretty heavy caveats.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>, Spencer said that the "expectation" is that Xbox would create some kind of hardware in the handheld category. Bloomberg says that Xbox is "working on prototypes", but that the final release of any kind of Xbox handheld device is "a few years out".</p>

<p>An Xbox handheld (that is to say one created officially by Xbox, rather than one simply <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/logitech-and-tencent-cloud-gaming-handheld-images-possibly-leaked" rel="nofollow">designed to play</a> Xbox cloud games) has long been rumored, but this is the first official confirmation we've had from anyone on Xbox's side.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/asus-rog-ally-xbox-handheld.jpg?itok=qhbTOxyk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/asus-rog-ally-xbox-handheld.jpg?itok=gnSjnz5M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There are handheld devices that play Xbox games on the market, but we now know that an official Xbox handheld is in the works.</figcaption></figure><p>Rather than focusing on the handheld, Xbox engineers will instead work to improve the Xbox app on existing devices. Spencer told Bloomberg there was room for improvement with regards to the Xbox app, and that any potential handheld needs to be "informed by learning and what's happening now".</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Spencer reveals a couple of other interesting tidbits regarding Xbox's strategy. He reiterates that there are no "red lines" dictating which games could or couldn't come to non-Xbox platforms, but says that it's too early to talk about whether&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>could go multiplatform.</p>

<p>Spencer also confirms that Microsoft and Xbox are still looking at more acquisitions, which puts recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">sweeping layoffs</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="nofollow">studio closures</a> at Microsoft into somewhat stark relief if you ask me.</p>

<p>Then again, Xbox arguably has a history of saying seemingly contradictory things after making big decisions. Remember when Matt Booty said Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-smaller-games-comment-hi-fi-rush" rel="nofollow">needed "smaller games"</a> right after closing two studios that would have been ideally situated to make them? Me too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/redfall-xbox-arkane-closure.jpg?itok=p9SgA1Jz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/redfall-xbox-arkane-closure.jpg?itok=34aX7k45 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Even after closing two studios earlier this year, Microsoft still says it's considering more acquisitions.</figcaption></figure><p>Spencer also confirms in the Bloomberg interview that the planned Xbox mobile store, which was originally announced in May with a July release window, has been delayed.</p>

<p>He says that an approach in which Microsoft simply hopes that "if we build it, they will come" won't work, and so the challenge is trying to figure out how to get consumers to find the Xbox store amongst stiff competition.</p>

<p>It should be noted that this is distinct from Xbox allowing you to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-android-app-games" rel="nofollow">buy and play games via its own app</a>, a feature that Xbox president Sarah Bond announced would be implemented following <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-google-victory-play-store" rel="nofollow">a ruling in an Epic-Google lawsuit</a> that also proved favorable to Microsoft.</p>

		<p>Christmas just wouldn’t be Christmas if it didn’t start in November and include a weird advert from PlayStation that shows no games or consoles, so deck those halls and jingle those bells because the ad has arrived.</p>
<p>This year we see lots of young people jumping about, sliding down ramps, and generally engaging in physical activity, the complete opposite of sitting in front of a games console and killing aliens. It’s ‘aspirational’ I guess, maybe you could infer that anything is a game and PlayStation is here to make that true, but as your PS5 is securely tethered to you sofa I think that’s a bit of a stretch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Play Has No Limits | PS5" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KiNPo7KvWCM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It does makes you miss the good old days when Sony used to mash up characters from thirty games in a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPctTR3y5Qc"> one advert .</a> I’ve just looked and that happened thirteen years ago so now I feel very old and so should you.</p>


<p>These videos are usually packed with Easter Eggs but there just a couple in this new advert. The bus stop at 28 seconds in has 1994-2024 on it, 1994 being the launch year of the PS1. The one that is getting everyone excited is 46 seconds in when a departure board is shown with and at the top is a date and time, 03 12 20:24, so December 3rd this year which is exactly 20 years on from the PS1 launch.</p>

<p>Sony are rumoured to have State of Play in December so some are guessing is that will be the date, it is a week before The Game Awards so Sony could get some big reveals out before the news is swamped with other announcements.</p>
<p>That appears to be it, there are no signs for games in the background, the graffiti does not reference anything, the shops are generic, not even a hint of Crash Bandicoot, all the things Sony usually does in these adverts are missing this year.</p>
<p>Probably the most boring PlayStation advert in history, I bet it cost a fortune to make.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-outlanders-mobile-rpg</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-outlanders-is-an-open-world-mobile-rpg-from-tencent-and-capcom.1034622/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-outlanders-mobile-rpg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom and Tencent subsidiary TiMi Studio Group have announced&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Outlanders</em>, an open-world action RPG set to be released for mobile devices.</p>

<p>The two studios describe&nbsp;<em>Outlanders&nbsp;</em>as an "open-world survival game set in the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>universe", and you'll be able to do all of the things you'd expect from a&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>game, including discovering ecosystems, crafting gear, and hunting alongside your friends.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Outlanders&nbsp;</em>yet, but TiMi and Capcom say they will be conducting "several play tests in advance", although those don't have dates yet either, unfortunately. The goal with the game is to create a mobile experience you can enjoy "with friends, anytime and anywhere".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-outlanders-gliding.jpg?itok=CKAskoKS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-outlanders-gliding.jpg?itok=Q6GMqsIK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Outlanders&nbsp;</em>is an open-world mobile survival RPG from TiMi and Capcom.</figcaption></figure><p>The screenshots TiMi and Capcom have released so far show a game that looks...well, a lot like a traditional&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>game. Expect open-ended areas to explore, monsters to take down, and lots of elaborate, ostentatious armor and weapons to build from monsters' remains.</p>

<p>The two studios are promising "natural environments [and] ecosystems" to discover, so like classic&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>, you'll probably be able to observe monsters as they go about their daily lives before you start your hunt.</p>

<p>If you're interested in&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Outlanders</em>, you can sign up for email announcements via the <a href="https://monsterhunteroutlanders.com/en/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">newly-created official website</a>, which also displays some rather evocative concept art.</p>




<p>The reveal of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Outlanders&nbsp;</em>comes as Capcom gets ready to release&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, the next mainline entry in the franchise, which is scheduled to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date" rel="nofollow">arrive across PC and consoles in February</a>.</p>

<p>It's shaping up to be a pretty big success already; an open beta was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta" rel="nofollow">held earlier this month</a>, and the beta alone <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records" rel="nofollow">broke the series' Steam player count record</a> despite not being a full game.</p>

<p>We don't yet have an official release date or window for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Outlanders</em>, so watch this space for more info as and when we get it.</p>

As Steam was on the rise and digital distribution was clearly to become the future of gaming, a Polish company that had just released its first game—a relatively obscure RPG called <em>The Witcher</em>—wanted to get in on the act. The goal was updating and preserving classic gaming, and selling it without any form of DRM. Over the years, GOG seemed to drift away from this origin, and shift its focus to trying to compete as a distribution platform for AAA gaming, going head-to-head with Valve’s behemoth. But today marks a big change.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196599" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Tactical RPGs, Creepy Circuses &amp; More New Releases | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="128" data-playlist="196599,195891,196131" data-current="196599"><div><p>Tactical RPGs, Creepy Circuses &amp; More New Releases | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196599/196599_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22154.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Starting today, GOG is launching what it’s calling <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gog.com/en/gog-preservation-program&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gog.com/en/gog-preservation-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The GOG Preservation Program</a></span>. It’s a self-aware determination to return to the company’s roots, with a long-term commitment to preserve and maintain classic games for the foreseeable future. There are 100 games currently listed, with a pledge to use the company’s “own resources to maintain games’ compatibility with modern and future systems.” At a time when game preservation is becoming increasingly vital, and on far more people’s minds, this seems like a pretty positive step.</p><h2 id="h62125"><a id=""></a><strong>How It Started</strong></h2><p>16 years ago, the world of PC gaming was very different. In 2008, the number one issue anyone would name when it came to digital games was DRM—digital rights management. These anti-piracy measures were grossly ineffective, doing almost nothing to prevent piracy, but instead causing legitimate customers to have far worse versions of a game—versions that required online checks to launch, refused to be installed on multiple devices, or just flat-out didn’t work properly. GOG arrived right at the peak of players’ fury, and offered a service that sold games that promised there would be <em>none</em> of this. Versions that just downloaded the files to your hard drive, that you could copy and share if you felt compelled to, but would never fail to launch because of an abandoned server, or because you bought a new PC.</p><p>At the same time, GOG was releasing games that had been unavailable and unplayable on PC for years. Classic titles that dominated the ‘80s and early ‘90s, that were designed to run on MS-DOS and didn’t know what to do with Windows, were suddenly available again, and were sold DRM-free with scans of the original manuals, and updates that meant they’d run straight from the .exe without issue.</p><p>The site became known for restoring lost games, a way to play <em>Wing Commander</em> and <em>Ultima II</em>, <em>King’s Quest</em> and <em>Rise of the Triad</em>. An early deal with Ubisoft to release DRM-free versions of its classic games (an ironic situation, given Ubisoft was at the forefront of crippling DRM in newer games) helped the project gain traction, and by 2014 it had deals with companies like LucasArts to make everything from <em>Star Wars: TIE Fighter</em> to <em>The Secret of Monkey Island</em> available.</p><h2 id="h62126"><a id=""></a><strong>How It’s Going</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="16e998ba573b4584e5b817e5fa1fe922" data-recommend-id="image://16e998ba573b4584e5b817e5fa1fe922" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1012" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Max sat at the wheel of his car." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Max sat at the wheel of his car." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

For whatever reasons, for whatever ambitions, in my view GOG changed its sights, wanted to be selling the big-name AAA titles, and took its eyes off that original purpose.</p><p>In 2019, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/facing-financial-pressures-gog-quietly-lays-off-at-lea-1832879826?_gl=1*4o9j2y*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTQzNTAyMi4xMDQuMC4xNzMxNDM1MDI1LjU3LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/facing-financial-pressures-gog-quietly-lays-off-at-lea-1832879826?_gl=1*4o9j2y*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTQzNTAyMi4xMDQuMC4xNzMxNDM1MDI1LjU3LjAuMA..">according to a <em>Kotaku</em> story by Jason Schreier</a></span>, the company was in real trouble. Deep into its push to be a AAA store that competed with Steam, there were lay-offs, at the same time as the company abandoned its so-called Fair Price Package, through which GOG would repay customers who were charged higher fees due to regional price differences. One former employee said at the time that he was told, “we’re dangerously close to being in the red.”</p><p>As someone who, throughout the first half of the 2010s, regularly used GOG to find classic games and would frequently check the site to see what new titles had been rescued from the past, I drifted away, too. That the games were DRM-free still felt like a big deal, but the convenience of Steam, the improvements in DRM tech, and the shifting nature of all digital ownership made GOG feel so much less essential. I’d once seen it as the site that let me play classic point-and-click adventures, but now when I looked at it, I just saw the same big-name games that are splashed across every other store.</p><p>“The market is different today,” GOG’s senior business development manager, Marcin Paczyński, told me by email, when I asked what was driving the decision to refocus. “Most platforms continue to leave these classics behind, or don’t give them the care they deserve, so the games we set out to protect are disappearing again.”</p><h2 id="h62127"><a id=""></a><strong>Where It’s Going Next</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="3acf2caa3a4a8d0fa667f75ad95eec12" data-recommend-id="image://3acf2caa3a4a8d0fa667f75ad95eec12" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="781" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Jagged Alliance screenshot with an apposite quote about wanting back-up." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Jagged Alliance screenshot with an apposite quote about wanting back-up." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Madlab Software / GOG</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3acf2caa3a4a8d0fa667f75ad95eec12" data-recommend-id="image://3acf2caa3a4a8d0fa667f75ad95eec12" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="781" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Jagged Alliance screenshot with an apposite quote about wanting back-up." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The new moves by the site are giving me great hope. If DRM was the main issue in 2008, games preservation feels like the most vital topic of 2024. As we watch major publishers just wiping older (and even newer) games from existence, while abandoned servers and forgotten consoles make ever-more games we own unplayable, people are getting really riled up. It seems like a very smart move for GOG to step into this space and loudly declare its intentions.</p><p>The GOG Preservation Program promises to begin with 100 games, and keep adding to the list, pledging long-term support of all of them. Those currently included have, GOG say, been tested “on the most popular PC configurations,” and “work flawlessly,” but the company encourages its community, which is rather sweetly referred to as “restless,” to keep pestering if updates break things.</p><p>The 100 games are an eclectic bunch, with games like <em>Diablo</em>, <em>Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura</em>, <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>, <em>Roller Coaster Tycoon Deluxe</em>, <em>Fallout</em>, <em>Blade Runner</em>, and <em>Alpha Protocol </em>in the mix. They reach as far back as the ‘80s, and as recent as <em>Mad Max</em>. The criteria for inclusion is that a game needs maintenance, and that GOG can commit to maintaining it themselves. The company aims to have “hundreds of games” stamped with the commitment by the end of 2025.</p><p>“It’s a renewed commitment to our mission,” says Paczyński, “offering improved, well-supported editions of the classics that defined gaming, while continuing to deliver DRM-free new releases.”</p><p>Paczyński reiterates the importance of no DRM to GOG, explaining that not having it is vital to preservation. “When you buy a DRM-free game on GOG, you can download and safeguard its offline installer any way you want. DRM-free keeps you out of the reach of platforms’ rules and policies and untethered to some central server suddenly switching off. We still strive to get as many DRM-free titles as possible on GOG, regardless of when they were first released.”</p><p>I ask how far ahead the plan goes. What if GOG is zapped by aliens and disappears—what happens to the games it’s preserving without them? “We’re dedicating significant resources and long-term planning to ensure that each game in the program receives continuous updates and care—we know it’s a commitment.” He repeats that the DRM-free nature of the games means the installers survive the site. “Whatever happens to us, ever, your games are always safe.”</p><p>“It will stick,” Paczyński adds. “Today, we made several bold commitments, so we are truly serious about this. GOG’s reputation is on the line here—we’re all-in on this!”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Our platform continues to grow, on console, on PC, and on cloud. It’s just going to be a strategy that works for us.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s pretty clear at this point that Xbox console exclusives are no longer a priority for Microsoft’s gaming business, but are there some Xbox games that are considered so sacred that they will never launch on PlayStation?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-13/microsoft-s-gaming-chief-is-still-looking-for-acquisitions-sees-future-growth" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a>, Spencer said every Xbox game is up for grabs when it comes to making the multiplatform jump. “I do not see sort of red lines in our portfolio that say ‘thou must not,’” he said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo on PlayStation would perhaps be the biggest Xbox game to go multiplatform so far, given its association with the console over the years.
