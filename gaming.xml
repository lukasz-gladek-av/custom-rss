            <p>JDM: Rise Of The Scorpion is a free prologue for JDM: Japanese Drift Master, a racing game about - who could guess - drift racing in Japan. It's got an open world set in rural towns to burn rubber around as well as several story missions to play. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1364930/JDM_Rise_of_the_Scorpion/">download it from Steam now</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Does "prologue" just mean this is a demo? Well, it's certainly designed to demonstrate the world and driving of the full game, but its story is also acting as an actual prologue, telling a separate story about a different protagonist than Japanese Drift Master proper. In Rise Of The Scorpion you play as "rebellious high schooler Hatori", who seems like an idiot jerk and I turned against him within just a few brief manga pages. Big "villain of the main game" vibes.
</p>
<p>There's plenty to like about Rise Of The Scorpion otherwise. Its setting around the fictional Haikama Lake is lovely, peppered by small towns and back roads. It's a very different ambiance than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/night-runners-prologue-demo-is-a-stylish-throwback-to-playstation-racing-classics">the urban permadark of Tokyo-set Night Runners Prologue</a>, another recent racing game demo.
</p>
<p>The bucolic beauty matters because though I've seen every Fast and the Furious movie, and subjected myself to Tokyo Drift <em>twice</em>, to my great shame I've never mastered the art of drifting in video game cars. I'm so bad at drifting that in four attempts I couldn't even finish the first mission in Rise Of The Scorpion. I instead had fun playing it as JPM: Japanese Parking Master, and pulling up outside kissas and sushi restaurants in different spots where I could admire the trees, vending machines, the overhead electricity cables.
</p>
<p>If I'd got further, perhaps I'd have seen more of the game's systems, which include cars that can be modded, a day/night cycle, and weather.</p>
<p>Apparently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1364930/view/4334237198185367692">there are a bunch of driving assists</a>, switched off on startup, that might have helped me. I'll give it another go and hopefully get good enough to be able to make progress when the full game releases, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1153410/JDM_Japanese_Drift_Master/">via Steam</a>, sometime later this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I've got a real soft spot for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trombone-champ">Trombone Champ</a>, a rhythm game about tooting along to music that works perfectly with the mouse. I'm also a huge fan of Beat Saber, a rhythm game in which you slice at blocks that whizz towards you in VR.
</p>
<p>You can see where this is going. Trombone Champ: Unflattened transports that 2022 tooting into 2024 virtual reality.

<p>This is a no brainer: yes, I will hold my hands in front of me as if holding a trombone, and parp most virtually. Unflattened seems to add a lot more than the shift in perspective, however. You can customise your trombone by spraypainting it different colours, there are collectible cards, there's a narrative mode, and there are 50 tracks to play.
</p>
<p>The VR port is being handled by Flat2VR Studios, who previously made a VR version of FlatOut, among others. It's due to be released this autumn for all the primary VR headsets, including via Steam.
</p>
<p>Hopefully it also includes mod support. Most of my love of Trombone Champ is born from what the community has done with it, whether the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/trombone-champ-is-best-experienced-via-videos-by-its-creative-modders">running jokes and growing ambition of Gloomhonk's custom tracks</a> or the good-spirited competition of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-trombone-champ-championships-are-a-wellspring-of-community-creativity-whether-or-not-you-bone-the-trom">Trombone Champ championships</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>GTA: San Andreas is one of the most popular video games of all time. It was released in 2004 by Rockstar Games, but even today, it remains a top-tier title enjoyed by thousands of gamers worldwide. It’s a sandbox title that can be explored at will, and there are hundreds of hours of content wrapped up in the game. That’s why we’ve assembled a guide highlighting the best San Andreas cheats and codes, so you can push that concept further than ever.</p>



<p>If you’ve been looking for the top cheat codes for San Andreas, look no further than this page. We’ve listed the best cheats for GTA San Andreas below for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC platforms.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-cheats-on-san-andreas">How to Use Cheats on San Andreas</h2>



<p>Using San Andreas cheat codes is simple. If you’re playing on a console with a controller, you simply press the buttons in the order that they’re written when playing the game. If you’ve done it right, you’ll see a message pop up saying ‘Cheat Activated’. If you’re playing on a PC with a keyboard, you’ll have to type in the corresponding letters and numbers to activate the cheat code.</p>



<h3 id="h-how-to-turn-off-cheats-in-san-andreas">How to Turn Off Cheats in San Andreas</h3>



<p>Turning off San Andreas codes couldn’t be easier – you just need to re-enter the code that you’ve just typed or tapped in, and that’s it. If you’re successful, you’ll see the message ‘Cheat Deactivated’ appear.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-san-andreas-cheats-safe">Are San Andreas Cheats Safe?</h2>



<p>If you cheat in GTA San Andreas and then save the game, you’ll be given a warning about the potential corruption of your save file. However, as someone who has cheated thousands of times in GTA San Andreas over twenty years, I can say that I’ve never had any issues with my game when using cheats.</p>



<p>That doesn’t mean that you won’t have issues, of course – but it’s unlikely.</p>

<p>These San Andreas codes will work on Xbox 360, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/team-falcons-esports-world-cup-club-championship/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Even though there are still eight days left in the Esports World Cup schedule, Team Falcons has earned so many Club Championship points that no other organisation can knock them off the top spot. To that end, the Esports World Cup Foundation has announced that ‘no matter what happens now’, Team Falcons has won the $7 million grand prize in the Club Championship.</p>



<p>Presently, the organisation sits on a whopping 4160 CC points, with Team Liquid sitting in second place with 1760. It’s such an immense gulf that fans knew what was going to happen from a very early stage, but not everyone is happy for Team Falcons’ victory.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-host-with-the-most">The Host With The Most</h2>



<p>Team Falcons is playing on home turf, given that the organisation hails from Saudi Arabia. The team’s chairman, Mossad Aldossary, was just competing in the EA FC portion of the EWC but failed to qualify for the playoffs. From the outset, Team Falcons busied itself with assembling a roster in more games than any other organisation, which gave it a serious advantage right off the bat.</p>



<p>As we approach the final week of the tournament, the organisation has <strong>won </strong>the Call of Duty Warzone and Free Fire tournaments and wound up placing high in the Apex Legends and ML:BB events. It also scraped points in Dota 2, ML:BB Women, Overwatch 2, and Fortnite.</p>



<p>Now, the Esports World Cup Foundation has confirmed that no matter what, Team Falcons is the unequivocal winner of the EWC:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Many fans have taken to social media to claim that Team Falcons ‘bought the win’, signing some of the best players in their respective games and fielding an overwhelming number of rosters that few organisations could compete against.</p>



<p>This means that Team Falcons will lift the first Club Championship trophy and walk away with a massive $7 million prize, on top of what it earned in the various games it competed in.</p>



<p>Speaking on stream, Chairman Mossad Aldossary said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I want to thank everyone – all of our fans, all our supporters, all of our employees, everyone that worked hard. Now, finally, we can say it’s home – it’s home, it’s home, it’s home.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He did stress that he and his organisation did it for the ‘Saudi people’, and that the trophy ‘won’t leave the country’. Some might call it patriotic, but others are suggesting it was nothing short of predictable.</p>



<p>What’s incredible is that there are still so many games yet to wrap up at the event:</p>



<ul>
<li>Modern Warfare 3</li>



<li>EA FC</li>



<li>Tekken 8</li>



<li>PUBG</li>



<li>Rocket League</li>



<li>ESL R1</li>
</ul>



<p>Are you surprised that Team Falcons won the Club Championship? Let us know.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-minecraft-seeds-java-survival-seeds">Minecraft</a>'s Realms servers have been down for most of the past four days. Mojang's official account for reporting service status updates noted that "intermittent failures or slowdowns" began on August 13th, and despite similarly intermittent reports of uptime in the days since, the servers remain inaccessible to most players today.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Realms is a paid subscription service that grants access to a private multiplayer server for Minecraft's multiplatform Bedrock Edition. It lets between three and 10 players (depending on subscription tier) join the same Minecraft world, with the owner able to install mods from Minecraft's paid marketplace.
</p>
<p>"You may experience intermittent failures or slowdowns connecting to Realms. We are actively working to resolve this," the Mojang Status account <a href="https://x.com/MojangStatus">tweeted on Tuesday</a>.
</p>
<p>By Wednesday, the service was said to be "up and running", albeit with some latency issues, according to the official account. Players in the replies disagreed, with hundreds noting that they were still unable to play. There were further statements that the team was continuing to work on the issues until yesterday, when Realms was declared to be "back up and running globally. It has been running healthy for more than the last hour. You should be able to see, manage, and play on your Realms again. Thank you again for patience as we worked through the issues."
</p>
<p>Within hours, another tweet noted that connectivity issues and latency had since increased again. That brings us up until this morning, around eleven hours ago, when Mojang confirmed they were "still hard at work to restore the service globally."
</p>
<p>I tried to connect a couple of hours ago to my own Realms account and it's still down for me.
</p>
<p>The connection issues seemingly began with the release of Minecraft update 1.21.20, which amended how Realms invite links work, as well as aiming to fix several Realms bugs and Minecraft bugs more generally, <a href="https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/29110275666957-Minecraft-1-21-20-Bedrock">as per the patch notes</a>. A second update, 1.21.21 was released the following day <a href="https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/29279683879949-Minecraft-1-21-21-Bedrock">solely to improve "reliability of connecting to Realms."</a> I guess it didn't work.
</p>
<p>Minecraft is a true marvel, but the infrastructure that surrounds the Bedrock edition often feels like it's held together by sticky tape and greed. I hate every second I have to spend managing my Realms account, and yet it's a price I'm willing to pay so I can play Minecraft cross-platform with my kid. I'm less willing to pay the price of £6.69 a month for a Realms server that doesn't work for days at a time, however.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Whenever there’s a new RPG on the horizon, there’s usually one question on everyone’s mind. Does it offer character creation? Most of us want to play as a character we design, not a fully-voiced protagonist that no one relates to. With that said, here’s an overview of the Dragon Age: The Veilguard character creation!</p>



<h2 id="h-character-creator-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard">Character Creator in Dragon Age: The Veilguard</h2>



<p>In Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the first step in your journey is character creation. You will have an opportunity to design your protagonist from the ground up, selecting their defining features and traits, including skin tone, scars, tattoos, hairstyles, beards, eye color, and so much more. But such choices are purely cosmetic and don’t alter gameplay. The most important decisions you’ll make during character creation include the race, faction, and class of your main character.</p>



<h3 id="h-race">Race</h3>



<p>Like in Dragon Age: Inquisition, Dragon Age: The Veilguard features four distinct races to select from, including:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Human</strong></li>



<li><strong>Elf</strong></li>



<li><strong>Dwarf</strong></li>



<li><strong>Qunari</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The Human is the most basic race in all of fantasy lore, essentially a stock character selection for those who don’t feel too adventurous. Elves are the oppressed race of Thedas and, as such, will endure unique dialogue from others who look down upon the people. Dwarves, the iconic fantasy race, are short and stocky craftsmen and merchants. They have no connection to the Fade, however, and as such, cannot become mages. Lastly, the Qunari are unique to the world of Thedas. They’re horned giants who follow their religion strictly, while many take on the role of mercenaries across the land.</p>



<h3 id="h-faction">Faction</h3>



<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard features <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-factions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">six unique factions</a>, all of which serve as origins for our main character, and do influence the world and story in the game. These six include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Antivan Crows</strong></li>



<li><strong>Grey Wardens</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lords of Fortune</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mourn Watch</strong></li>



<li><strong>Shadow Dragons</strong></li>



<li><strong>Veil Jumpers</strong></li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-class">Class</h3>



<p>Lastly, you will choose your class, which affects your overall playstyle in combat encounters. There are three to select from:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Warrior</strong></li>



<li><strong>Mage</strong></li>



<li><strong>Rogue</strong></li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-is-the-main-character-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard-voiced">Is The Main Character in Dragon Age: The Veilguard Voiced?</h2>



<p>Following the reveal of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-voice-actors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game’s voice actors</a>, we do know that Dragon Age: The Veilguard features a fully-voiced protagonist. During character creation, you can select from one of four voices: two male and two female. </p>



<p>As the character does have a voice, we fully suspect that voice will play an integral role in the game’s cutscenes and stories. For those who were hoping for a silent protagonist, maybe next time, unfortunately.</p>

Alongside that release date, we also got the details on <em>The Veilguard</em>’s special edition, only it’s not called the special edition and it doesn’t even include the game. It’s called “Rook’s Coffer” and it includes all the sorts of stuff you traditionally might have found in a pricey special edition, but you have to buy the game separately. It’s the latest example of this obnoxious trend, and we’ve<em>&nbsp;</em>got feelings about it. Also, we share our thoughts on how <em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em>is handling its DLC (pretty well!) and on some hands-on time we spent with <em>Splitgate 2 </em>(we have concerns).

I barely had time to consider my loadout before I was brusquely pushed into the match. Once the action began, everything became a bit of a blur before coming to an abrupt stop mere moments later. Bullets flew, people spilled out of portals, and within about two minutes, the first round was over before I could even make sense of the changes <em>Splitgate 2 </em>was making to the gameplay I’d loved in the original. - Moises Taveras <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-preview-impressions-1851624294&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-preview-impressions-1851624294">Read More</a></span></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now until August 19th, for instance, the Windows-based gaming handheld is available at <a href="https://howl.me/cmTzQhkZw2e">Best Buy</a> with a Z1 Extreme chip for an all-time low of $499.99 ($150 off). That’s almost half the price of its successor, which costs $799.99, rendering it a good alternative if you’re on a tighter budget. The lower-end model with the Z1 chip is also on sale for <a href="https://howl.me/cmTBM70duIl">$379.99 ($120)</a>, though, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/18/23879024/asus-rog-ally-600-z1-gaming-handheld-steam-deck">given the performance downgrades</a>, we’d recommend sticking with the Extreme configuration.</p><p>At this price, the standard Asus ROG Ally offers good value, even if it didn’t impress us as much as ROG Ally X when it comes to comfort, performance, or battery life. It’s still more powerful than Valve’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513517/steam-deck-long-term-test-valve">Steam Deck</a>, though, thanks to its Z1 Extreme chip and enhanced performance when the handheld is plugged in and engaged in “Turbo” mode. It also features a quieter fan and a larger 1080p display with a 120Hz variable refresh rate, the latter of which is surprisingly smooth for its size.</p><p>Unfortunately, its battery only lasts a mediocre four hours at best, which is disappointing given it’s designed to be a portable gaming PC. It’s also held back the Windows 11, which isn’t well-designed for small, handheld-like devices. That said, Valve is working on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot">adding support for SteamOS</a> on rival handhelds&nbsp;like Asus’ ROG Ally, so perhaps we could see it running an alternative operating system down the line. </p><p><h5><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719210/asus-rog-ally-review">Read our Asus ROG Alley review</a>.</h5></p><div><p>The ROG Ally is Asus’ first crack at a Steam Deck rival. It’s a Windows-based PC gaming handheld with a seven-inch 1080p, 120Hz touchscreen and integrated gamepad controls.</p></div><div><div><h2>Verge Deals on X<!-- --> <!-- --> / </h2><p>Join nearly 50,000 followers and keep up with the best daily tech deals with @vergedeals</p></div><p><a href="http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud">Follow us!</a></p></div><p><h3>A few more weekend discounts</h3></p><div><ul><li>If you’d like to dive even deeper into the <em>Alien</em> universe after watching <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24219417/alien-romulus-review"><em>Alien: Romulus</em></a><em> </em>this weekend, a few retailers are currently discounting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/3/6897307/alien-isolation-review"><em><strong>Alien: Isolation</strong></em></a>, a video game that takes place 15 years after the original <em>Alien </em>film. The base game is on sale for $8.99 ($21 off) at the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0177-CUSA00363_00-ALIENISOLATIONP4">PlayStation Store</a>, while <em><strong>Alien: Isolation Collection</strong> —<strong> </strong></em>which comes with all seven DLCs — is available for PC starting at $8.99 ($41 off) from <a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-13797872?sid=verge081624&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Falien-isolation-collection">Fanatical</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsub%2F79549%2F">Steam</a>.

Before the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24086715/sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-4-earbuds-review">Momentum True Wireless 4</a> took their place, the third-gen earbuds were some of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds">best you could buy</a>, offering top-notch sound quality, solid active noise cancellation, and wireless charging. The newer earbuds offer better sound and improved day-to-day reliability, but at this price, the last-gen pair remain a great value (especially now that they offer multipoint).</li><li>You can buy a refurbished<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/1/23745238/roborock-ecovacs-deebot-new-robot-vacuum-models-price-specs-release-date"><strong>Roborock Q Revo</strong></a> — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22997597/best-robot-vacuum-cleaner">one of our favorite robot vacuums</a> — from <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F404828310164">Roborock’s eBay storefront</a> for $447.99 with offer code <strong>HOTSEASON20</strong>. That’s about half the price the Robovac typically sells for in new condition. The Q Revo is a highly capable cleaning machine, one that features a pair of oscillating mops that scrub floors remarkably well. It can also fill its own reservoir, clean and dry up its own mopping pads, and even self-empty. It lets you set virtual keep-out zones, too, which <em>almost</em> makes up for the fact it lacks AI obstacle avoidance.</li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
