This option is available to Game Pass Ultimate subscribers and lets them play a large library of games across multiple devices, including tablets, phones, and TVs. However, as of 4:30 p.m. ET today, Xbox doesn’t seem to have a timetable for when streaming will be back up and running for everyone.</p><p>On December 26, about an hour after the outage started, Xbox support tweeted out that the company was “aware” that “users may be experiencing issues launching Cloud Gaming titles.” The account told people to check on the official Xbox status page for updates. Since then, things haven’t improved much. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/XboxSupport/status/1872673740628140318&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/XboxSupport/status/1872673740628140318" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On December 27 at 10 a.m. ET</a></span>, the company posted a follow-up claiming that users might see a long wait time displayed when launching a game on the cloud, but that this wait time wasn’t accurate. However, checking the comments on the post and elsewhere, it still seems like people can’t even connect and play games on their phones or other devices. As of 3:30 p.m. ET, the Xbox support page states: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“We’re close to resolving the issue.”</a></span></p><p>I expect the issue will be resolved, likely a few hours after this post goes live (or sooner). But the timing couldn’t be worse. </p><p>This holiday season, Xbox really pushed the idea that its cloud streaming option <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/IYBSNQLsBKk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/IYBSNQLsBKk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">could replace a console</a></span>. You didn’t need an Xbox if you were a Game Pass subscriber with phone or a smart TV. You could just stream all those games instantly. And as a result, I imagine that this Christmas season saw a lot of kids and teens get Game Pass subs so they can <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cloud-streaming-owned-games-50-list-pc-1851704063?_gl=1*1le1ck1*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNTMzMDI5NS4xODMuMS4xNzM1MzM0MjYyLjU1LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cloud-streaming-owned-games-50-list-pc-1851704063?_gl=1*1le1ck1*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNTMzMDI5NS4xODMuMS4xNzM1MzM0MjYyLjU1LjAuMA..">stream games without their parents having to buy a pricey Xbox</a></span>. </p><p>A lot of people are probably experiencing cloud streaming for the first time this holiday season and, well, this outage is a very blunt reminder that while you can stream games on your phone, it ain’t an Xbox. An Xbox can work without an internet connection, and it can play your games offline. A phone can’t. Maybe Xbox should make that more clear in all those cute ads promoting every device as an Xbox? </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4</a> did huge numbers when it was released in June 2023, with positive reviews, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-passes-666-million-in-sales-sets-new-blizzard-record/1100-6515145/">impressive sales numbers</a>, and over 12 million players. But for those who finished the game's campaign and dove into its endgame content, the real meat of an ARPG like Diablo, it was clear something was amiss.</p><p dir="ltr">Item progression was frustrating and often felt like a chore. There were few endgame activities and little reason to do them. Seasonal updates added new mechanics and smaller fixes but didn't solve the underlying structural issues players had with the latest entry in Blizzard's legendary loot-chasing franchise. It carried echoes of Diablo 3's 2012 launch, when players quickly became frustrated by its endgame loop (and its real-money auction house). Was Blizzard repeating the same mistake twice?</p><p dir="ltr">What a difference a year makes. Whereas it took around two years for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-3-went-from-disastrous-launch-to-a-hell-of-a-good-time/1100-6503426/">Diablo 3 to become great</a> with the addition of its Reaper of Souls expansion, Diablo 4 today is vastly improved to the one of last year or even just seven months ago. Whereas I quickly fell off Diablo 4's endgame loot grind at launch, I'm now hooked thanks to free updates that overhauled itemization and revamped its difficulty. Diablo 4's endgame loop is now extremely satisfying, and I'm continuing to chase those smaller upgrades and highly coveted Mythic Unique items that could take my character ever slightly further--something that felt like a fool's errand a year ago.</p><p dir="ltr">Many of the biggest changes came alongside Diablo 4's appropriately named <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-diablo-4-loot-reborn-update-will-make-its-items-and-players-more-powerful-than-ever/1100-6523061/">Loot Reborn update</a> in May. Items gained fewer affixes but ones that were more useful, making it easier to parse at a glance whether an item may be useful or not. Legendary Aspects, once a chore to find and replace, became an almost automated process, with salvaged Legendary items automatically having their Aspects added to the in-game codex for easy imprinting on future items.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4410659-diablo4masterworking.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4410659" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4410659-diablo4masterworking.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4410659"></a><figcaption>Masterworking gives players a reason to grind out endgame activities.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4410659-diablo4masterworking.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The addition of two new itemization systems, Masterworking and Tempering, is what truly took Diablo 4's items and its endgame into overdrive. Tempering allowed players to add certain affixes to items in order to hand-craft the perfect weapon or piece of armor. Masterworking, meanwhile, pushed players to upgrade a Tempered item into the ultimate version of itself.</p><p dir="ltr">Loot Reborn proved to be a game-changer, not only because of the agency it gave players when it came to gearing up, but also for giving reasons to continue deep into Diablo 4's endgame. The addition of The Pit, a new timed endgame dungeon where materials needed to Masterwork items could be found, additionally gave players more goals to chase.</p><p dir="ltr">Just as these systems overhauled Diablo 4's items and endgame, the game's 2.0 update, released alongside its first expansion in October, pushed things even further. Blizzard dropped the game's confusing World Tier <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-completely-changing-how-it-handles-difficulty-taking-a-page-from-diablo-3/1100-6526194/">difficulty system and instead replaced it with one more akin to Diablo 3</a>. It reorganized the endgame to form a more satisfying endgame progression loop, with Masterworking materials shifting to be found in Nightmare dungeons, and Glyph XP moving to The Pit. A new roguelite endgame activity introduced in Diablo 4 Season 5, Infernal Hordes, became a permanent fixture in update 2.0, giving players more options when it came to choosing how to spend their endgame time.</p><p dir="ltr">All of those changes are without even mentioning the additions that came as part of the paid Vessel of Hatred expansion. It added a new region to explore, continued the game's story, introduced an additional endgame activity in the Kurast Undercity, brought recruitable Mercenaries into the fray, tossed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-getting-diablo-2-style-runewords-so-you-can-make-your-own-spells/1100-6526197/">Runewords into the build-customizing equation</a>, and added a brand-new (and very overpowered) class: the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/two-hours-with-diablo-4-vessel-of-hatreds-spiritborn-reveals-a-diablo-class-unlike-any-other/1100-6525108/">Spiritborn</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4410660-diablo4infernalhordes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4410660" data-ratio="0.56256983240223" data-width="1790" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4410660-diablo4infernalhordes.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4410660"></a><figcaption>Infernal Hordes adds some roguelite flair to Diablo 4's endgame loop.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4410660-diablo4infernalhordes.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Now, when it comes to the endgame, players have choices. Do I need to Masterwork my gear more? I can run Nightmare dungeons or Infernal Hordes. Maybe I need to upgrade my Glyphs, so I'll hit up The Pit for a bit. If I'm looking for runes, a particular type of item, or materials, I can do an Undercity Tribute run with that specific goal in mind. Or if I'm looking for a certain Unique or Mythic Unique item, I can target-farm one of the endgame bosses for a higher chance of finding what I'm looking for. Diablo 4's endgame now lets me easily work towards whatever goals I have for my character and gives me options when doing so.</p><p dir="ltr">Many of these endgame activities feed into each other. Running The Pit will give me tributes to use for the Undercity. Doing Undercity can give me boss-summoning materials. Defeating those bosses will give me Infernal Horde keys, which I can then use to gain Masterworking materials. It all feeds into itself in a satisfying endgame loop that keeps me playing, slaying, and upgrading, something that was definitely not the case when Diablo 4 launched.</p><p dir="ltr">That's not to say there's no room for improvement. Though there is now much more to do in Diablo 4's endgame, there are few real challenges or reasons to keep pushing after a certain point. Most dedicated players will be able to easily clear higher-levels of The Pit or defeat the game's Torment bosses on the game's highest difficulty, after which gear upgrades simply allow players to clear those activities slightly faster. Doing things faster can be fun (and makes for efficient farming) but can lose its luster after a while without additional goals to pursue. Bugs also continue to be an ongoing issue, and Blizzard could benefit from putting a bit more polish on updates before releasing them out into the wild (something the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4s-first-ever-public-test-realm-is-live-now/1100-6522348/">public test realm, also introduced this year</a>, does help with).</p><p dir="ltr">Diablo 4's road of refinement likely won't be coming to an end anytime soon, but I am impressed at how far it has come in a relatively short amount of time. Even though Vessel of Hatred proved to be an excellent addition, it was this year's free Loot Reborn and 2.0 updates, more than the paid expansion, that transformed Diablo 4 from just "okay" into a great ARPG worthy of the Diablo name. It's fitting that Diablo 4 found its footing just ahead of Grinding Gear Games releasing the highly anticipated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/path-of-exile-2-release-date-early-access-and-eveything-we-know/2900-5988/">Path of Exile 2 into early access</a>. Suddenly, the battle to be the top ARPG in the genre Blizzard invented is heating up. If Diablo 4's 2025 is anything like its 2024, next year will be a banner year for the genre, and I can't wait to see what's in store.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/squid-game-event-rumored-to-have-additional-premium-pass-in-cod-black-ops-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's rumored that Call of Duty will be receiving an additional premium pass for the Squid Game event that is coming soon to <a href="https://wccftech.com/eight-of-octobers-best-selling-games-were-new-releases-black-ops-6-on-top/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and Call of Duty: Warzone. The event was officially teased yesterday, where it's said that those who participate in the event will be able to get skins of operatives themed around the hit TV show, as well as blueprints of weapons and other content that fits the Squid Game theme. The crossover event is set to begin on January 3, but more details haven't been released.</p>
<p>This is already causing quite a stir from both Squid Game fans and Call of Duty fans, with some saying that they're completely missing the point of the TV show. The TV show is all about living in a dystopian, capitalist world where people are willing to fight to the death for money. The show just recently got a second season, which was released yesterday on Netflix.</p>
<p><iframe title="Call of Duty x Squid Game 2 Trailer | Call of Duty: Warzone &amp; Black Ops 6" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lzXgt2aR_IM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The rumor of the premium pass comes from a user called <a href="https://x.com/xFleXy_/status/1872710285649428579" target="_blank" rel="noopener">xFleXy_ on X</a>, where they posted a screenshot of a message that pops up when you load the game. The message reads as the following:</p>
<p><em>Squid Game arrives in Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone. Explore an exhilarating Event Pass, where the Premium Track route allows for more incredible rewards, including the Front Man Operator. Plus, a myriad of LTM's will feature signature sinister takes on Red Light/Green Light mechanics.</em></p>
<p>A lot of people also have issues with the game having premium battle passes due to the fact that a significant amount of people who purchased the game would have paid at least $70 for it rather than playing it via Xbox Game Pass for the long haul. Seeing a paid game with a ton of microtransactions is never a great feeling, and it makes more sense for the event pass to be in Call of Duty: Warzone, as that is the free-to-play Battle Royale set in the CoD universe.</p>
<p>It hasn't been specified how much this pass will cost as of yet, but as the event looms closer, there will most likely be new details given about the event and the rewards that you will be able to obtain by participating.</p>
<p>Will you be getting the battle pass for the Squid Game event?</p>

Fans of The Pokemon Company's enduring card game should watch for these collections. They will contain unique cards and special physical products for hardcore Pokemon fans.</p>

<h2>The Pokemon TCG Collections Announcement</h2>

<p>According to a post <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2024/12/three-tcg-collections-releasing-in-2025-with-new-unique-items-including-lenticular-card" rel="nofollow">on Pokebeach</a>, three new <em>Pokemon TCG</em> collections will be available in North America in 2025.</p>

This set is notable since it will bring back Owners' Pokemon cards. The Collection Box will contain three promo cards, one jumbo card, four booster packs, a code card, and a Polaroid-style postcard.</p>

<p>The last time a Polaroid was included in one of these boxes was part of the 2001 <em>Southern Islands</em> set.</p>

<p>The second of these Pokemon TCG collections is a new Premium Collection box coming April 11. The box will contain six boosters, two promo cards, a photo sticker, a backdrop card, and an acrylic standee sheet.</p>

<p>The post mentions how these products will work isn't entirely clear. However, acrylic stands have been released at Japan's Pokemon Centers before featuring different characters. There's a chance they may operate similarly, letting fans have little dioramas of beloved characters on display.</p>

This will contain five boosters, a code card, three promo cards, and a jumbo lenticular card. This is major since the last time a lenticular card was released, it was in promotion of the 2004 <em>Pokemon Destiny Deoxys</em> movie.</p>

<p>This is different from the lenticular posters contained in certain <em>Pokemon TCG</em> marketing kits. While nice bits of promotion, these promo items aren't real cards.</p>

<p>The <em>Pokemon TCG</em> is one of the most popular trading card games in the world. Its popularity has only grown thanks to the massive success of the mobile game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-dena-revenue" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em></a><em>.</em></p>

Along the way, they run into Kwai Jun-Fan (Allen Deng). While trying to escape capture on top of a moving train, Jun-Fan is moments away from being thrown off the train until Uatu intervenes by knocking the bad guys to the ground after insinuating that a tragic end for the young boy happens in other timelines.

The reason Uatu decided to interfere is because Ultron had gained a multiversal-level consciousness in the previous episode, smashing through the barrier that separates Uatu from the multiverse and proceeding to whoop his ass. </p><p>In this season alone he broke his oath saving Jun-Fan, and in the preceding episode he willed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-daredevil-born-again-thunderbolts-ironheart-mcu-1851637009&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-daredevil-born-again-thunderbolts-ironheart-mcu-1851637009">Riri Williams</a></span> (Dominique Thorne) to not succumb to the tragic fate he’s watched her fall victim to over and over again when battling Mysterio (Alejandro Saab).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-could-be-bringing-haptic-motors-to-xbox-controllers/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Microsoft could be brining updated technology to future Xbox controllers in the form of haptic motors. First found by <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/microsoft-patents-movable-haptic-controller/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tech4Gamers</a>, a recently <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=US444401677&amp;_cid=P22-M4Z00G-73974-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">filed patent</a> suggests Xbox controllers will get new haptic feedback features sometime soon.</p>



<p>According to the patent’s abstract, the new motor features a housing, connector, and haptic motor. Upon activation, the haptic motor will “move relative to the housing to generate the haptic feedback”.</p>



<p>In the patent description, it’s claimed that the haptic motor can be “dynamically” tuned for device optimization. What’s more is that it’s said that the motor can create two types of vibration in order to increase the depth and feel of the feedback. Based on the full contents of the document, it’s suggested that players would get a more personalized experience with the new motors.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>“The concepts described herein enhance a haptic response of a device by incorporating haptic subcomponents into a moving or flexible mechanical architecture of the device that allows for the haptic motor to move relative to a housing of the device,” the patent reads. “This allows for a lower cost, weight, size, and energy consuming haptic component to perform similar to a larger haptic component, or to enhance the haptic response of the larger haptic component.”</p>



<p>With these new moveable and adjustable haptic motors, it seems to be Microsoft’s answer to the popular DualSense controller introduced this console generation from Sony. Microsoft has been developing its new Sebile controller for a while now, and this could be the start of finding out some of its features.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xboxs-new-sebile-controller-breaks-cover-in-this-new-patent-and-we-now-know-what-that-the-weird-grippy-trousers-are-for" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jez Corden of Windows Central</a>, this new controller isn’t likely to launch before the next generation of Xbox hardware.</p>



<p>What do you think of Microsoft adding a new haptic motor to Xbox controllers? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

<p>Following the positively stellar month of February, a relatively quiet month in March, and now looking forward to the upcoming summer, one would expect April to be relatively tame. Well, that’s correct. The biggest video game releases in April 2025 don’t overly impress, with a few remasters and plenty of niche titles, but don’t expect much in the way of AAA.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-hottest-game-releases-of-april-2025">The Hottest Game Releases of April 2025</h2>



<p>It appears April is the month of visual novels and niche role-playing games, with a heavy dose of action-adventure tossed in for good measure from the indie and AA scene. For those of you who have spent time awaiting The Last of Us Part II on PC, that’s the big release for the month, and it’s not even a new one!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</strong> (PC) – April 3, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Koira </strong>(PC/PlayStation 5) – April 17, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</strong> (PC/PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – April 24, 2025</li>



<li><strong>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</strong> (PC/Nintendo Switch) – April 24, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Tempest Rising</strong> (PC) – April 24, 2025</li>
</ul>



<p>Along with this small handful of titles, Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time launches on Nintendo Switch sometime in April 2025, though we don’t have an official release date yet.</p>







<h2 id="h-looking-forward-to-may-2025">Looking Forward to May 2025</h2>



<p>As of publishing this piece, May is a relatively quiet month with only a handful of titles, most of which are TBA currently, but we suspect more will come as we delve into the year further.</p>



<ul>
<li>Sonic Wings Reunion</li>



<li>Revenge of the Savage Plenty</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-pc-game-of-2024-best-new-pc-games-this-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>PC gaming in 2024 was nothing short of extraordinary. This year, developers pushed boundaries, delivering games that dazzled with immersive visuals, innovative mechanics, and stories that kept players glued to their screens. From blockbuster titles redefining beloved genres to indie gems that captured hearts with their creativity, the lineup was packed with unforgettable experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we look back on the year, these are the standout PC games that left their mark and reminded us why gaming on PC is truly unmatched. Let’s dive into the best PC games of 2024 – the ones that raised the bar and set new standards for the industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before we get into it, it’s worth mentioning that these are games that are either exclusive to PC or released first on the platform.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-pc-game-of-2024-winner-hades-2">Best PC Game Of 2024 Winner — Hades 2</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The game may have released in “early access” in May, but Hades 2 feels like anything but an early access title. The game takes so much of what made the first game great, and adds to it in ways that make it nearly perfect.</p>



<p>Set after the events of the original game, Hades 2 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">puts players in the role of Melinoë</a>, the Princess of the Underworld and sister of Zagreus, the first game’s protagonist. Guided by her mentor, Hecate, Melinoë’s mission is to stop Chronos, the Titan of Time, who has risen to challenge the gods and mortals who once opposed him.</p>



<p>While the game has a lot of similarities to the orginal, the addition mechanics and features put it over the top. Hades 2 adds a new  Magick Bar that players use for various moves that you recharge as you play. There’s even a new sprint ability that opens up a new world of movement and agility while you play. Hades 2 also introduces multiple pathes to the surface: from&nbsp;Erebus&nbsp;to Tartarus or&nbsp;Ephyra&nbsp;to&nbsp;Mount Olympus.</p>



<p>What makes the game even better, is that it can be completed in under 20 hours if that’s your cup of tea. However, if you are a completionist who needs to do everything in a game, then Hades 2 can teak you nearly 60 hours to do everything. It’s really up to how you want to play.</p>



<h2>Best PC Games of 2024 Nominations</h2>



<p>While Hades 2 stood out as the best PC game of 2024, that doesn’t mean there weren’t other great options for players. From action to city-building, there was something for every type of game this year. Here are some of the other top PC games to release over the last 12 months.</p>



<h3>I Am Your Beast</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Released in September, I Am Your Beast is another excellent game from Strange Scaffold. You play as former government agent Alphonse Harding who is asked to do “one last job”. After turning it down, you find yourself against the same group that tried to recruit you in the first place.</p>



<p>The game features fast-paced action that has made it popular for speed running. It also has some of the most violent yet enticing gameplay you’ll find from any game, let alone an indie title. I Am Your Beast features 25 levels that make you feel like you are playing a modern version of classic Doom and Duke Nukem 3D just in shorter bursts. Those short bursts — the levels take only a couple minutes to get through — helps with that feeling of wanting to keep coming back for more.  It’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1876590/I_Am_Your_Beast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a great hook</a> that gives you that “just one more level” feeling every time. It’s a game that becomes hard to put down once you get started.</p>



<h3>UFO 50</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Dozens of games within a single game make for a great game. Yeah, you read that right. UFO 50 features 50 different games from various genres. The game acts as a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1147860/UFO_50/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">“showcase” of the games</a> developed by UFO Soft for the LX-I, LX-II, and LX-III consoles during the 1980s. While the fictional showcase is a cool concept, it’s the games you can play that make it just so good. </p>



<p>Bushido Ball takes a simple concept like Pong and adds samurai swords, ninjas, and shot abilities. Then there’s the RPG Grimstone that feels like the old Final Fantasy games. My favorite, however, is the Metroidvania Mini &amp; Max. It takes a number of great concepts from the genre, and makes t hem easy and accessible. It’s one of those games that even as a standalone game would be considered a good indie game.</p>



<p>No matter what you’re into, there’s bound to be a game in UFO 50 to feed your appetite. Of course, there’s also the hidden 51st game that’s just as much fun as the first 50.</p>



<h3>Frostpunk 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>A highly-anticipated city-builder, Frostpunk 2 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601580/Frostpunk_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released in September</a> to mass acclaim from most players and critics. The game is set 30 years after the “Great Storm” of the first title, and sees players take on the role of the “Steward” following the death of the original Captain. As you play, you have to handle population issues, resource scarcity, and the transition into a new era. Building upon the first game, Frostpunk 2 also lets you build a bigger city with districts that serve specific purposes.</p>



<p>As you expand and create districts, you also have to manage factions with different ideologies, leading to potential conflict among citizens. Lastly, there’s a council that represents the different factions that you present your laws and regulations to. You function more like an actual government in Frostpunk 2 than any city-builder I’ve played before it, and it sets a stage for what I believe future games in the genre should strive for.</p>



<p>This PC game was so well received that it even won the Best Gameplay award at the Gamescom Awards 2024. It’s so much more than your typical city-builder that Frostpunk 2 is a game that you can easily get lost in for hours at a time. </p>

			<p>A team of modders is working to add multiplayer to Insomniac's Marvel's Spider-Man on PC, and they've got a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu8e-Q2l_ek" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trailer</a> to prove it already works. The original game, of course, offered no such feature, and neither did the sequel, despite some <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-co-op-mode-teased-by-miles-morales-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short-lived rumors</a> and the fact that you do actually collaborate with the other Spider-Man (both Peter Parker and Miles Morales are playable <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-spider-man-2-ultimate-incarnation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the game</a>, and you can swap between them while in the open world), but only as an NPC.</p>
<p>However, Insomniac did at least toy with the idea several times. Back in 2021, the studio was <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniac-games-new-multiplayer-game-pve-melee-combat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruiting</a> for a multiplayer game with PvE (player versus environment) melee combat. That turned out to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/spider-man-the-great-web-trailer-leak-spider-gwen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spider-Man: The Great Web</a>, a cooperative multiplayer game that leaked as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniac-games-hacked-by-a-ransomware-attack-data-surrounding-marvels-wolverine-surfaces-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insomniac's hack</a>. The game would have allowed five players to take the roles of various members of the Spider family, including Spider-Gwen.</p>
<p>Let's go back to Marvel's Spider-Man, though. Modders <a href="https://wccftech.com/spider-man-remastered-code-includes-co-op-multiplayer-mode-references/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identified</a> multiplayer references in the game's code as early as two years ago. There might have been some hooks they're now using in the project. The team has shared the following FAQ on its Discord:</p>
<p><em>When is this mod coming out?</em><br>
<em>No release date as of yet.</em></p>
<p><em>Is there PVP?</em><br>
<em>No, it currently isn't a feature to fight other players in Multiplayer but it may get looked at in the future.</em></p>
<p><em>What is the Player Limit?</em><br>
<em>The Player Limit in Spider-Man Multiplayer is 16 players.</em></p>
<p><em>Is this a mod for MSM1 or MSM2?</em><br>
<em>This is a mod for MSM1, however we will look into porting to MSM2 once it releases.</em></p>
<p><em>Does the main story work?</em><br>
<em>Some main story missions do work but we're working on free roam content currently and will look into main story more at a later date.</em></p>
<p><em>Do mods work?</em><br>
<em>Yes.</em></p>
<p><em>Can my friends see my mods?</em><br>
<em>Friends can see your suit mods so long as you both have the same suit mods installed. If you don't then the person who doesn't have the suit mod installed will not be able to see the person with the suit. Additionally if you use animation mods it's better for all players to have it installed.</em></p>
<p><em>How long has this mod been under development?</em><br>
<em>This mod has been in development since August 2024.</em></p>
<p><em>How does connecting to players work?</em><br>
<em>You create a lobby, and then other players can either join via a Steam invite or you can add the host's IP and join that way.</em></p>
<p><em>What platforms are supported?</em><br>
<em>Steam and Epic Games Store versions are the supported Marvel's Spider-Man copies in which multiplayer will work.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Spider-Man Multiplayer Trailer (Mod)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nu8e-Q2l_ek?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Now, there's many ways this could go wrong. Mod teams blow up all the time, either due to insurmountable technical hurdles, internal drama, or just plain old real life commitments (they're not professionals, after all). Sony could also kick the Marvel's Spider-Man multiplayer mod to the curb to prevent it from being released. Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-multiplayer-mod-creators-attacked-by-nintendo-through-copyright-strikes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did it</a> for the Breath of the Wild mod, effectively killing it.</p>
<p>Still, there are plenty of instances where this actually worked<span><span>—more or less.&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-together-reborn-co-op-mod-is-finally-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skyrim Together</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/sekiro-online-mod-pvp-coop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sekiro multiplayer</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://wccftech.com/just-cause-3-multiplayer-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Just Cause 3 multiplayer</a> are some of the most famous examples of multiplayer mods successfully added to single-player only games</span>.</span> Another interesting project to keep track of is '<a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CyberMP</a>,' which plans to introduce multiplayer to Cyberpunk 2077.</p>

			<p>While 2024 didn't see the release of new entries in staple franchises like Devil May Cry or Bayonetta, the past 12 months were still very good for action games fans thanks to the release of a variety of very solid games coming from both veterans of the genre and newcomers that left more than a few players surprised with the high level of competence shown in their debut titles, so high that it is almost difficult to tell that they haven't been developed by studios with more experience in the action games genre.</p>
<p>Here are the five best action games released in 2024 on PC and consoles, alongside a few other games that, while not as good as the best five, definitely deserve to be mentioned for their quality and for what they brought to the genre as a whole.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPGs</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2024-full-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indies</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2024-the-return-of-the-strongest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2024-a-bloody-massacre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a></em></p>
<h2>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-who-needs-sands-time/">9</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Prince-of-Persia-The-Lost-Crown-header.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Prince of Persia series has always been at the forefront of the action games genre, but for a very long time, the series has been away from the spotlight. The long-dormant franchise, however, was finally brought back this year with Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, and what a way to come back it is. Returning to the roots of the series, the game developed by Ubisoft Montpelier is an amazing Metroidvania game featuring an engaging story and extremely solid gameplay mechanics that make it not only one of the best action games released in the past few years but also one of the best Metroidvania games ever released. Here's what I had to say about the game in my review.</p>
<p><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown couldn't have brought back the series after its more than a decade-long hiatus in a better way. With an engaging story, well-crafted Metroidvania mechanics, and a touch of character-action games features in its combat system, Sargon's adventure will be remembered by fans for a long time, even with its minor issues.</em></p>
<h2>Stellar Blade (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">9</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Stellar_Blade-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Much like with Black Myth Wukong, the hype surrounding Stellar Blade was definitely bigger than what one may have expected for a debut title of a developer who had released only mobile games up until this point, but in the end, like for Game Science's first game, Korean studio Shift Up proved they had what it takes to make a compelling action game. While the over-sexualized character design may be offputting for some players, there's no denying that the Korean developers knew what they were doing, enriching the obvious inspiration from Yoko Taro's NieR series with some light RPG and Soulslike mechanics that make the game a joy to both look at and play. Here's what Kai Tatsumoto had to say about the game in his review.</p>
<p><em>No butts about it, Stellar Blade is a marvelous feast for the eyes and a technically impressive action RPG. Those who find the hyper-sexualized Eve offputting will find little redemption in finding some modesty for the playable heroine, but at the same time, those already accustomed to the years following Bayonetta’s release and 2Booty memes will find the character designs enjoyable, to say the least. Stellar Blade is a fantastic action title and one PlayStation exclusive you’ll have to play after the kids go to bed.</em></p>
<h2>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/">8</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Hellblade-II.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Ninja Theory released quite a few games over the course of the years, but none managed to become commercial successes, except for Hellblade: Senua's Saga, a narrative-focused game that offered solid action combat in the vein of the previous titles developed by the studio. With Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, Ninja Theory doubled down on everything that made the original game so unique, keeping the oppressive atmosphere and combat system and turning it up to eleven with one of the most impressive visual showcases of the generation powered by Unreal Engine 5. A remarkable game that is definitely not for everyone, but one that is worth experiencing for those looking for an extremely immersive experience. Here's what Alessio Palumbo had to say about the game in his review:</p>
<p><em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II keeps virtually the same scope and structure of the independent triple-A game made in 2017 by Ninja Theory. The story is just as poignant, the visuals are stunning, and the experience is one that every Game Pass user should check out for themselves. However, those hoping for a more traditional game in the vein of the God of War reboot will inevitably be disappointed, and this is unlikely to have nearly that level of success, which is what Microsoft still desperately needs.</em></p>
<h2>Black Myth Wukong (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">8.5</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/black-myth-wukong-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Right from its out-of-the-blue announcement in late 2020, it was clear how Black Myth Wukong was going to be an extremely popular game, as the trailer showcasing the pre-alpha build reached 2 million views on YouTube and over 10 million views on Chinese video-sharing website Bilibili in just 24 hours. Being the very first PC and console game by an unproven developer, however, there was the chance that all the hype could have been for nothing, but Game Science proved detractors wrong by releasing a solid action game inspired by FromSoftware's Souls series. While being based on the popular Journey to the West novel may have contributed to the game's huge popularity, especially in China, Black Myth Wukong is definitely a game that fans of the genre should experience, even if it doesn't exactly attempt to break the mold to offer anything innovative. Here's what I had to say in my review:</p>
<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong stands out as one of the strongest debut games released in recent times. While not groundbreaking in any way, it masterfully blends elements from several popular franchises to deliver an engaging action RPG experience that ranks just below the very best in the genre. Although stuttering issues and minor gameplay flaws hold it back slightly, these shouldn't deter any action RPG or action game fan from picking it up. The Journey to the West has rarely been this enjoyable.</em></p>
<h2>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-coming-back-to-life/">8</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Dead-Rising-Deluxe-Remaster.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Dead Rising is among the many CAPCOM series that were put to the side following the disappointing performance on the market of their latest entry, but the Japanese publisher has been showing over the past few months that it is finally willing to bring some of these franchises back to their former glory. In this regard, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster couldn't have brought back Frank West's iconic first adventure in a better way, as exploring Willamette Parkview Mall and killing zombies with all sorts of makeshift weapons has never been so much fun.</p>
<p>While the basic experience feels a little dated, and the visual remaster leaves something to be desired in some ways, the quality-of-life improvements make this remaster-meets-remake a game that is worthy of experiencing both for veterans of the franchise and newcomers. Here's what I had to say about the game in my review.</p>
<p><em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is a solid remaster that enhances the original game with some welcome gameplay and quality-of-life improvements that go a long way to make the experience more enjoyable than ever. However, the remaster falters in the visual department, with dull colors that pale in comparison to the vibrant visuals of the original. Still, there's plenty to like in the Deluxe Remaster, as Frank West's journey to Willamette remains as engaging as ever, though the mostly faithful recreation of the original gameplay feels a little dated compared to its sequels.</em></p>
