            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This past Friday, the video games industry, and more specifically, <strong>Xbox </strong>and <strong>Microsoft</strong>, entered a new era. <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-phil-spencer-retires-sarah-bond-resigns-asha-sharma-takes-over-xbox/">A post-<strong>Phil Spencer</strong> and <strong>Sarah Bond</strong> era</a>, with the announcement of Spencer's retirement and Bond's resignation. Former Microsoft CoreAI chief executive officer, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-xbox-ceo-targeted-supposedly-using-ai-bot-x/"><strong>Asha Sharma</strong>,</a> took Spencer's place, while <strong>Matt Booty</strong> stepped into a new role as Xbox's chief content officer.</p>



<p>As the industry and consumers wrap their heads around the sudden shake-up, a new report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/883015/microsoft-xbox-new-ceo-shakeup-notepad">The Verge</a> looks to provide some insight into why it happened the way it did. Why is Sarah Bond leaving Microsoft instead of being <a href="https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-retire-following-next-gen-xbox-launch/">the one to replace Phil Spencer?</a> What does this new leadership mean for Xbox's future and its whole 'everything is an Xbox' initiative? Well, according to The Verge, the answer to those questions begins and ends with Sarah Bond and her departure.</p>



<p>Bond is pinpointed as the one who was pushing Xbox's 'Play Everywhere' campaign <a href="https://wccftech.com/sarah-bond-xbox-palworld/">more than anyone else</a>, and that its 'This is an Xbox' marketing strategy was the result of a few key people leaving Microsoft, leaving Bond directly in charge of the platform's marketing team. When the new campaign started to air, and those loyal to the platform on the consumer side were taken aback and even offended by it, they weren't the only ones.</p>



<p>The report claims that the campaign "<strong><em>offended many Xbox employees internally</em></strong>," and that the pivot away from a dedicated console to a broader approach focused on cloud and mobile was something that Bond championed under Spencer. It also adds that Bond's departure comes as a relief to employees remaining at Xbox, who claimed that she was "<em>tough to work with, and built a team structure that meant if you didn't follow the vision or questioned it, <strong>you were out</strong></em>." </p>



<p>That said, she was still praised by her colleagues for the ability to get big deals across the finish line, including the "<em><strong>crucial</strong></em>" role she played in securing the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-has-been-acquired-by-microsoft-for-70-billion/">Activision Blizzard King</a></strong> deal. But that's about all the praise the report mentions for Bond. </p>



<p>Everywhere else, she's reported to be the one behind Xbox's devaluing of its own hardware, and now that she and Spencer are out, Sharma's job is to usher in "<em>the return of Xbox</em>," which seems to include major changes and the admittance that what the team had been trying has not been working. </p>



<p>According to sources from the report, when it became clear that Bond's strategy under Spencer wasn't working after <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reports-a-9-overall-drop-in-xbox-revenue-for-q2-fy26-hardware-down-32/">declining hardware sales</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-revenues-see-113-million-decline-amid-hardware-sales-drop-and-limited-gaming-content-and-services-growth/">Xbox revenue dropping</a>, staff believed that the departures felt inevitable. </p>



<p>The report also adds that the author has "<em>the impression from sources that Microsoft wants a turnaround and is worried about losing Xbox, as it's one of its only remaining successful consumer brands</em>." Again, that's just a feeling the writer has based on their conversations with their sources at Xbox, but it's a more positive one than coming away from those talks with the feeling that Sharma is really here to start cutting away at Xbox to make more room for <a href="https://wccftech.com/satya-nadella-admits-transition-into-the-ai-era-could-be-messy-but-does-not-want-microsoft-to-be-left-behind-in-the-tech-race/">Microsoft's AI push</a>.</p>



<p>As much as this report sets the blame at Bond's feet, where it may very well deserve to rest, the buck stops with Phil Spencer before it stops with her. In a company as big as Microsoft, you'll almost never be able to say that someone acted alone in their mistakes; there's almost always someone else complicit to them. </p>



<p>If this report is accurate in its claims that Sharma's tenure will turn over a new leaf for Xbox, then the test of that commitment to players will likely come with the reveal of the next major first-party Xbox title, and whether or not it is actually a game exclusive to Xbox.</p>

			<p>Over the past few months, video gaming has become a rather expensive hobby, with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-ps5-pro-price-increases-us-tomorrow/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">hardware</strong></a> and game prices rising consistently, risking pricing out more and more gamers as the worldwide economic situation remains challenging. However, not every publisher is set to increase prices, and some, like <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a></em></strong>  publisher <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Kepler Interactive</strong>, are set to continue employing a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">pricing strategy</strong> that is respectful of gamers' money and time.</p>



<p>Speaking with the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BBCNews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BBC</a></strong>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Kepler Interactive's CEO Alexis Garavaryan</strong> commented on the company's pricing strategy, which has <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"kind of taken the opposite action"</em> to what most major publishers have done in recent years.</p>



<p>Elaborating further, <strong>Garavaryan</strong> said: <em>"When we decide on a release and when we price our video games, we try to think what do we think the price should be and then we price it lower so that when players buy a game from us they feel like they're getting a bargain. We want them to feel like we are respectful of their money, respectful of their time and that fundamentally every time they buy a game from us they're getting a great deal."</em></p>



<p><em>"We're excited for players to be able to play five, six different experiences with the same amount of money than a traditional AAA game would bring them,"</em> <strong>Kepler Interactive CEO</strong> concluded, delivering <strong>a small ray of hope</strong> amidst the general <strong>price hikes</strong> that show no sign of stopping.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Clair Obscur’s publisher on challenging game prices | BBC News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WHu37zviJIg?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Looking at the smashing success of <strong><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></strong>, whose art style is so convincing that some <strong>authorities in the Middle East</strong> believed the game's artbook <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-art-direction-is-so-authentic-it-triggered-a-national-antiquities-investigation/"><strong>belonged in a museum</strong></a>, <strong>Kepler Interactive's</strong> strategy has a high chance to make many of the games it will publish in the future quite popular. </p>



<p>While reaching the <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-most-awarded-game-wccftech-awards-elden-ring/"><strong>same level of popularity</strong></a> as the game developed by <strong>Sandfall Interactive</strong> will be a tall order, gamers have shown time and time again how they are willing to embrace all sorts of gaming experiences if they are of <strong>high quality</strong> and are <strong>priced accordingly</strong>. Hopefully, other publishers will follow suit and prevent video games from becoming something only a few can enjoy.</p>

Schelling will "lead the franchise team, as well as the overall strategy", according to Ubisoft. He's previously served as producer on games like <em>Black Flag </em>and <em>Valhalla</em>.</p><p>Joining Schelling at the helm of <em>Assassin's Creed </em>is Jean Guesdon, who was creative director on both <em>Black Flag </em>and <em>Origins</em>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-firered-leafgreen-switch-price-release-date-2000672803</link>
            <guid>1443868</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Pokémon FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen </span></i><span>are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-fire-red-leaf-green-switch-pokemon-direct-price-2000671938"><span>getting Switch ports on Friday, February 27</span></a><span>. The 22-year-old Game Boy Advance remakes are widely considered the “definitive” editions of the original games thanks to quality-of-life changes and added areas and quest lines. The games aren’t readily available right now, so you’d think this announcement would have been met with universal excitement. But that wasn’t the case, as the $20 ports were deemed too expensive by some. Nevertheless, the games are </span><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Nintendo-eShop/Charts/Nintendo-eShop-charts-1396788.html"><span>topping the eShop charts</span></a><span> already.</span></p> <p><span>I gotta admit, I do find the pearl clutching about the $20 price tag a bit surprising, but in my experience, it’s impossible to have discussions about video game pricing because everyone’s perception of what a dollar is worth is so different. As the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-pricing-indie-steam-peak-content-warning-2000658886"><i><span>Peak </span></i><span>devs explained</span></a><span>, video game pricing is all weird, vibes-based psychology that some companies have figured out and others just kind of ignore.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>$20 is what you might pay for a nice meal that you’ll eat and then forget about, and here it gets you a 30+-hour game. But hey, I don’t know your economic situation, so I can’t speak to what $20 in your bank account means. I’m not here to judge anyone’s perception of money, I’m more concerned about how these conversations don’t seem to take that economic disparity into account.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">i lowkey dgaf them pokemon game ports cost 20 dollars i have a job why should i care</p> <p>— lil (@adifying) <a href="https://twitter.com/adifying/status/2024824271076233711?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="qst" dir="ltr">lol <a href="https://t.co/L4e7BSIGOL">https://t.co/L4e7BSIGOL</a></p> <p>— TAHK0 ☕️ (@TAHK0) <a href="https://twitter.com/TAHK0/status/2025167322160529765?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">How are both sides of this argument so fucking annoying <a href="https://t.co/moOgMlk9tT">https://t.co/moOgMlk9tT</a></p> <p>— Lost Levels Fan (@LostLevelsFan) <a href="https://twitter.com/LostLevelsFan/status/2025016667923730885?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">whispers: *i actually think $20 for firered is pretty reasonable* 😬</p> <p>— Bob Wulff (@BobWulff) <a href="https://twitter.com/BobWulff/status/2024920916556185689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is literally all you are getting with Pokémon Fire Red and Pokémon Leaf Green.</p> <p>No changes, no online support.</p> <p>This is easily emulated on extremely low powered machines.</p> <p>$20 for a 20 year old Rom and Emulator is a wild price, buy what you want but don't defend it please. <a href="https://t.co/l3OfqiUz00">pic.twitter.com/l3OfqiUz00</a></p> <p>— Protomario (@Protomario) <a href="https://twitter.com/Protomario/status/2025614936450150869?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 22, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">People would have complained if FireRed and LeafGreen was put on NSO because they would have wanted to buy it separately. </p> <p>Even if they were $5, people still would have complained.</p> <p>Free or nothing</p> <p>— Johniibo (@johniibo) <a href="https://twitter.com/johniibo/status/2025702770762793441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 22, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pokemon Fire Red costs 13 Costco hot dogs.</p> <p>Hard decisions man.</p> <p>— Pory (@pory_leeks) <a href="https://twitter.com/pory_leeks/status/2025737366540009950?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>I remember once talking to someone about the </span><i><span>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition </span></i><span>remasters, and they flatly said the collection’s $60 price point placed it out of their budget…but $50? That could be the sweet spot. A mere $10 could be the difference between them playing some of their favorite games again on modern hardware and not doing so.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen </span></i><span>were $40 when they launched in 2004, but now if they’re anything short of free on Nintendo Switch Online, it’s the type of greed they talk about in the Bible. The irreconcilable way conflicting people talk about video game prices is born from those economic discrepancies, not everyone makes the same money, but also some people will just view any old game that costs money as a ripoff. It’s an unwinnable, unsolvable problem because everyone’s economic background is different, influenced by factors beyond their control, and is all based in a society that is wringing every cent out of all of us at any given moment. But that truth won’t stop the arguments from continuing, with anyone willing to pay $20 for an old game being deemed a shill and anyone unwilling being called poor. Whatever the case, many people are clearly willing to pay $20 to go back to Kanto again.</span></p>

<p>Iconic Capcom, PlatinumGames, and now Clovers dev Hideki Kamiya has commented on Resident Evil Requiem’s leaks, which arose after the game’s physical street date was broken by well over a week.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" id="2693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is 2026’s first major AAA game. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/capcom/" id="87630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capcom</a>‘s franchise returns to a decimated Raccoon City. The hype has been huge, and the expectations are bigger than a skyscraper made entirely of El Gigantes. Unfortunately, countless buyers were able to get their hands on the game early, and it began a huge wave of Requiem spoilers.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s not uncommon for a game’s physical street date to be broken, resulting in copies of the game being distributed days before launch, but Resident Evil Requiem went out roughly 10 days or more before launch. Leaks were inevitable, and social media was flooded with story spoilers and much more very quickly.</p>

<p>Hideki Kamiya has shared his thoughts on the leaks and used a previous experience to summarize his thoughts. Here’s what he said, according to Google Translate:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I remember back with Bio2, the late-game plot twist got totally scooped by some photo weekly mag, right… For your own selfish satisfaction, you’re trampling all over the feelings of users who were looking forward to it, and the feelings of the creators who poured their all into making it—a detestable act that destroys everyone’s happiness and deserves a thousand deaths… May you be cursed to never play games again…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new leadership team has been announced for the Assassin’s Creed franchise, including a head of brand, a head of content, and a head of production excellence. </p>



<p>Since the announcement of <span>Ubisoft’s&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-assassins-far-cry-rainbow-six-billionare/" target="_blank">restructuring</a>&nbsp;and the future of&nbsp;</span>the Assassin’s Creed franchise, fans have been waiting for more clarity on the way forward. We have recently discovered that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-confirms-far-cry-and-assassins-creed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two Far Cry games</a> and several Assassin’s Creed titles are currently in development. Additionally, we have been informed about the leadership behind these projects.</p>







<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-franchise-gets-new-trio-as-leadership">Assassin’s Creed Franchise Gets New Trio As Leadership</h2>



<p>Announced through a new post on <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/2025967126498910596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), three seasoned leaders have been revealed to carry forward the Assassin’s Creed Franchise. They will be responsible for driving the Assassin’s Creed brand’s long-term vision, creative ambition, and continued growth. </p>



<p>Martin Schelling will take on the role of Head of the Assassin’s Creed Brand and will focus on the “overall strategy and long-term vision of the brand.” Schelling has a “profound understanding of Assassin’s Creed” thanks to being a part of leadership in games like Revelations, Black Flag, Origins, and Valhalla. Most recently, he served as Ubisoft’s Chief Production Officer. </p>



<p>Then we have Jean Guesdon, who will serve as Head of Content for the Assassin’s Creed franchise and will be responsible for leading overall creative direction, supporting individual games, and guiding the future. Guesdon has been the creative director for both Origins and Black Flag. </p>



<p>Last but not least is François de Billy, who has been named as the Head of Production Excellence in Assassin’s Creed’s new leadership. François de Billy will be responsible for strengthening production practices and execution across the brand. He was previously the Production Director on Valhalla and Origins. </p>



<p>The trio will be joining the rest of the Assassin’s Creed leadership team in the coming weeks, including Andrée-Anne Boisvert, Producer for Assassin’s Creed’s cross-brand initiatives and Head of Technological Excellence, and Lionel Hiller, VP Brand and Go-to-Market Strategy. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[My First Sports Video Game Is A Rugby Game, And I Am Full Of Regret]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/rugby-20-oh-no/</link>
            <guid>1443841</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>A cool thing about being alive is that there’s always new stuff to learn about. In the past couple years, I’ve gotten into knitting, <a href="https://aftermath.site/failing-on-a-bike-trip-taught-me-too-much-about-myself/" rel="noreferrer">bikepacking</a>, playing the <a href="https://aftermath.site/learning-new-stuff-as-an-adult-rules/" rel="noreferrer">ukulele</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/oh-no-a-mandolin/" rel="noreferrer">mandolin</a>, and learning <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/irish/" rel="noreferrer">Irish</a>–all things I’d never thought about until I stumbled into them, but which now play various roles in my life. Thanks to the wonders of technology, there’s never been a better time to try to learn something new, with websites, <a href="https://aftermath.site/best-active-forums-internet-today/" rel="noreferrer">forums</a>, Discord channels, YouTube, and even video games all just a click away. Recently I have decided to get into rugby, and over the weekend I started wondering if video games could teach me more about this very confusing sport. The answer so far: no, and also dear god what have I done.</p><p>My quest to Become A Rugby Guy started when <a href="https://gothamrfc.org/?ref=aftermath.site#new-page"><u>NYC’s gay rugby team</u></a> kept coming across my Instagram feed. They make the game look <em>really</em> fun and the team seems super welcoming, even holding multiple “intro to rugby” events to teach newcomers like me the sport. Two of my favorite things are being on teams and doing stupid shit outside, so of course I want to do this, but I’ve run into a couple problems. One is that I’m 44 years old, and also about five feet tall and 110 pounds; as much as the team insists rugby is for every body, I’m hard-pressed to figure out what use my particular tiny body could actually <em>have </em>to the sport. But the more pertinent problem is that I have a knee issue that surfaced when I was training for the New York City Marathon in 2022, in which a badly-positioned kneecap is wearing away the cartilage of my left knee. While this hasn’t stopped my running yet, my doctor expressly discouraged me from playing any sport that requires lots of sudden changes of direction, which appears to be a large part of what rugby is.&nbsp;</p><p>To cope with the fact that I probably can’t play a sport I’ve only recently discovered a desire to play, I’ve been watching the current Six Nations rugby tournament the last few weekends. After an evening spent with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smnuRhNtT2E&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>explanatory</u></a> YouTube videos, I grasp maybe 40% of the game–I understand the core concept and some of the intricacies, even if I almost never understand why penalties are called or what makes a play “good” beyond “that guy ran really fast” or “that dude didn’t want to be tackled, but that other dude tackled him anyway.” This past weekend’s games were particularly gripping; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2026/feb/22/george-ford-england-ireland-six-nations-2026-rugby-union?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Ireland trounced England</u></a>, and just when it seemed like things could be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2026/feb/04/the-guardian-view-on-welsh-rugby-enduring-an-existential-crisis-with-cultural-roots?ref=aftermath.site"><u>looking up</u></a> for Wales, Scotland came from behind to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/live/ckglnpng09lt?ref=aftermath.site"><u>clinch things</u></a> in the final minutes. It’s been very gender-affirming to become the kind of man who torments his neighbors at 9am on Saturdays by yelling things at sports, but it’s also had me itching for more rugby.</p><p>So, much like my <a href="https://www.idlethumbs.net/3ma/episodes/civil-war-midlife-crisis?ref=aftermath.site"><u>ill-fated foray</u></a> into the <a href="https://aftermath.site/civil-war-middle-age/"><u>Civil War</u></a>, I turned to video games. There’s actually a fair number of rugby games out there, but apparently they are largely terrible. If <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rugbyunion/comments/etno9m/why_does_the_new_rugby_games_suck_so_bad/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>online</u></a> <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/heres-why-rugby-video-games-fail-and-how-to-fix-them/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>fans</u></a> are to be believed, this is in part because rugby is particularly hard to simulate in a video game, with more moving pieces than football or soccer, as well as the usual <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lexluddy.xyz/post/3mfhjvdjb7s2z?ref=aftermath.site"><u>licensing and budget challenges</u></a> that face many sports games. Searching for “rugby” on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search?sort_by=_ASC&amp;term=rugby&amp;supportedlang=english&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Steam</u></a> brought up a bunch of indie games that seem to be various levels of actually existing, as well as a long-running but largely reviled <em>Rugby [Insert Year] </em>series. That series seemed the most legit, but most of its games cost $40-$60, far too much money for anything plastered with so many negative reviews. But there was one available entry in the series people didn’t seem to totally hate and that only cost $20, which is the creatively-named <em>Rugby 20</em>.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n4_nZfhOKnE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Rugby 20 - Official Trailer"></iframe></figure><p>Here is where I should note that I do not play sports games. The last time I picked up something that could be considered a traditional sports sim was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1SyOGP0Vzk&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Tengen World Cup Soccer </u></em></a>for the Gear Gear in 1993. I remember being <em>obsessed </em>with it, and playing it in the car while my far more athletic sister played real soccer, but it was so long ago and I was so young that I feel like I can’t really count it as an introduction to the genre. I’ve never played a <em>Madden</em> or <em>FIFA</em>, and if I’m really honest I don’t even entirely understand <em>how </em>you play them. So I knew getting into a sports game, one I knew going in was going to be bad, would be a challenge, and that getting into a game focused on a sport I barely understand was going to make the whole thing worse.</p><p>But I didn’t truly consider how <em>much </em>worse. <em>Rugby 20</em> has a sort of tutorial, where it teaches you the button presses for passes, tackles, rucks, lineouts, scrums, and kicks. Some of these make sense: you pass by hitting the shoulder buttons, though it took a few rounds of the tutorial for me to understand the game’s particular idea of timing. Tackles I… sorta get, though the timing remains a bit baffling and the tutorial made it weirdly hard to run at the opponent I intended to tackle, though there’s also an “advanced” tackling mechanic whose timing I can’t grasp at all. Scrums are super complicated for no particular reason I can discern, featuring a lengthy series of button presses and stick flicks. I’ve actually been pretty adept at getting possession during in-match rucks by doing the thing the tutorial tells you <em>not</em> to do, which is throwing all my guys into the pile. As far as I’m concerned kicks basically don’t exist: there’s no indicator for where your kick is going to go, and while I did OK enough at it in the tutorial, in actual matches the ball seems to dribble away from my foot no matter what I do. Similarly, I have zero idea what the game wants you to do in lineouts, and basically I just watch them happen while half-heartedly tapping buttons so I can pretend I’m playing while the other team gets the ball.</p><figure><figcaption><span>These guys are in a maul, which the game doesn't explain at all (Aftermath/Eko Software)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There’s also a whole universe of other mechanics the game doesn’t explain at all, and which my nascent knowledge of rugby makes even more impossible. There are “set” plays the game tutorializes but which I somehow cannot figure out how to make happen in a match, and of course because I don’t understand rugby I don’t understand at all what they are and why I would even use them. A ton of button prompts come up in a match that refer to rugby concepts I’ve never heard of. There’s menus full of team management that I can’t wrap my head around because I keep having to watch YouTube videos about what the various rugby positions are, and also because despite clicking every available button I cannot figure out how to swap out my guys or how to add guys to my team in the game’s career mode. (I did do a pretty good job designing my imaginary team little uniforms though, which I bet my guys would look really cute in if I could figure out how to get some guys.) My players all have stats that mean nothing to me, and there are numbers affixed to the teams you can pick that mean nothing to me either. Some of the loading screens have rugby trivia, which is a really neat idea but I have no idea what the questions are even referring to, given that my rugby knowledge is made up of Six Nations and a couple New Zealand matches I watched online.</p><figure><figcaption><span>What (Aftermath/Eko Software)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My first match, playing as Connacht against London Irish (I’ve never heard of either of these teams, and picked Connacht because it’s a place-name I know from learning Irish) was a 0-15 disaster in which I mashed every button on my controller and shouted nonsense as little enemy players scored. “Oh, that’s a terrible pass!” the virtual announcers declared at one point, though this did not dampen my enthusiasm for the fact that I had figured out how to pass. I was a bit relieved to find that, as shit as I am kicking, the computer-controlled teams are <em>also</em> shit at it; in the matches I played all day Sunday, an opposing team only kicked a conversion once, and otherwise missed the posts only slightly less badly than I do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I eventually got lucky in a match by playing against a computer-controlled team prone to fouling for whatever mysterious sports game reason, which meant I frequently got possession of the ball. I used this opportunity to run around like an idiot making bad, frantic passes, which continued to not endear me to the virtual commentators. I did, however, manage to eke out a 10-5 win, which was a <em>major</em> triumph even if the only strategy I have at my disposal is to pass all the way to the outside and then just sprint like hell for the try line.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Hey but look it worked (Aftermath/Eko Software)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite my hopes, <em>Rugby 20</em> isn’t teaching me very much about rugby beyond the one part I already know, which is that someone gets the ball and then runs. If anything my knowledge is devolving, since I’m so focused on whatever guy I’m controlling that I don’t pay attention to the rest of the field the way I can when I’m watching a match. (Also, seeing the game’s rendition of a lineout up close has made me even <em>less </em>certain precisely what the rules of a lineout are.) None of this is helped by the fact that the game just <em>feels weird</em> to play, but I can’t tell if all sports games feel like this or it’s just <em>Rugby 20 </em>in particular. So the mild sadness I feel watching rugby because I can’t play it is now compounded by a general annoyance at trying to play its video game version, which I guess is “fun” in a kind of frustrating, confusing, “I am going to sit here until I figure this out/ oh, I lost all day to sucking in a video game” way.</p><p>I guess in addition to finding it gender-affirming to watch sports, it is also a bit gender-affirming to play a sports game, so that’s cool at least. But, much like Civil War battles, a rugby video game does not yet appear to be a good way to learn about rugby, nor does it appear to be a good way to learn about sports games. If for some reason you’ve played this unholy concoction of a game and have some tips, let me know. </p>

<p>As covered by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-description-appears-to-spoil-a-major-unannounced-character">IGN</a>, the description comes from UK cinema firm <a href="https://www.everymancinema.com/film-listing/327878-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie/#coming-soon">Everyman</a>, with The Super Mario Galaxy Movie featured in its 'Coming Soon' section. If you really don't want this spoiled ahead of time, then we urge you to look away now.</p>
<p>Okay, ready..? Here's the description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"After defeating Bowser and saving Brooklyn, Mario faces Wario and Bowser Jr.'s evil alliance. Now, alongside his friends and Yoshi, he must stop their plans for world domination."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, Wario is seemingly in the Mario Galaxy movie. Not only that, but it seems like he and Bowser. Jr have joined forces for what Everyman describes as an 'evil alliance'.</p>
<p>There were definitely rumblings of Wario's appearance during the first official trailer after a voice coming from the Megaleg boss sounded like it might belong to the flatulent, greedy treasure-hunter. Now it seems like he may well appear after all.</p>
<p>Of course, it could just be completely wrong, too. We'll just have to see, but chances are this is accurate and we can expect to see Wario causing all sorts of mischief in the upcoming movie.</p>

<p>We delved into a lot of topics, including <strong>WWE 2K26’s changes to the series’ core stamina and reversal mechanics</strong>, the game’s <strong>massive 400 slot roster</strong>, added match types, new “Ringside Pass” approach to DLC, why Visual Concepts knew The Island wouldn’t wow everyone last year, the challenges of developing a new game every year in only nine months, the difficulty of bringing back nostalgic features from the past, and more. Scroll on for the full interview.</p>

<h2 id="h-grappling-with-reversal-spam"><strong>Grappling with Reversal Spam</strong></h2>



<p><strong>In press releases, it was mentioned that you updated the stamina and reversal mechanics for WWE 2K26, although I didn’t notice a big change while I was playing. That may be a “me” issue. There’s a good chance I just didn’t catch on to the changes. Can you describe how stamina and reversals have been updated this year?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Bryan Williams: </strong>Yeah, absolutely. Honestly, the fact that you didn’t see it front and center is a good thing, because we wanted it to be kind of a subtle change and you might have seen it and not even noticed. So basically, what we did this year as a way to mitigate constant spamming of reversals, especially when you're playing with skilled opponents, <strong>we tied the ability to reverse moves with a character’s stamina</strong>, which is indicated above their head with a little yellow [circle].</p>



<p><strong>Oh, okay, I did see that.</strong></p>



<p><strong>BW: </strong>It’s also on the character HUD. Like, a gold bar around the Vitality meter. And so the more reversals that you do, the more stamina you're consuming to where, once you have completely exhausted yourself, you will enter a “Winded” state, which is represented by the Stamina meter turning purple.</p>



<p><strong>I did notice the meter turning purple and didn’t know why. Okay, this is all starting to come together for me here.</strong></p>



<p><strong>BW: </strong>Once it's purple, you're now on cooldown. You can no longer reverse during that period of time until the purple depletes, and then you're back up to your full stamina. We wanted to give players the ability to gauge and control the best times to reverse. Maybe it's, like, I'm going to eat this light attack, because I'm going to save up my stamina because [my opponent has] a finisher ready or a signature. I'm on the lookout to reverse that, rather than some of these other moves. So, i<strong>t gives you more decision-making moment to moment</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Lynell Jinks: </strong>Yeah, <strong>there’s definitely more strategy to playing defense now</strong>, right?</p>



<p><strong>BW: </strong>And it's not too punishing.&nbsp;[You’re not] going to be there for an extended period of time. Maybe you'll eat one or two attacks before you're able to reverse again. […] Once you're in that state, you don't feel completely nerfed as far as what you can do. It lasts just long enough.</p>



<p><strong>Have you changed the timing or on-screen indicators for reversals at all?</strong></p>



<p><strong>BW: </strong>The windows themselves? No, that is what it was.<strong></strong></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFwwe2k2617.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-new-wwe-2k26-match-types"><strong>New WWE 2K26 Match Types</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Let’s focus a bit more on specific match types. I liked how the I Quit match minigame changes based on how much damage you’ve received to specific body parts. I wouldn’t mind if that system was used for submissions in all match types.</strong></p>



<p><strong>LJ: </strong>That's good to hear. It took a while for us to dial that in. We tried a few different things. The concept was always there, but the actual implementation of it, and the understanding, took a while. I would say, almost to the very last minute [laughs].</p>



<p><strong>BW: </strong>I'm glad you picked up on it, how the green wedges indicate the limbs of your opponent's body, which is something different than we’ve done before.</p>



<p><strong>Yeah, going in, I was wondering, “How is an I Quit match going to be different from a standard Submission match?”</strong></p>



<p><strong>BW:</strong> The thing with the submission match is that, depending on the submission you have applied, [you’re] usually targeting one or two body parts. You work that body part enough, and you're going to get that submission. But <strong>in an I Quit match, you're dealing with someone's full physical being. We wanted it to be that you really had to spend time working over your opponent</strong>. So having those wedges represent the arms, the torso, the head, the legs, made all the sense to us. No, you can't just work the arm and be satisfied. You really got to put a total beatdown on your opponent to force him into that verbal submission.</p>



<p><strong>For the Inferno match, I got lit up more than I lit any opponents on fire. What are the different ways to light somebody on fire?</strong></p>



<p><strong>LJ: </strong>The whole purpose of the match is to eliminate someone by lighting them on fire. Once you enter the “Inferno” state, when the meter reaches full max, right? Once you're there, you basically initiate the mini game to throw them out of the ring into the fire.</p>



<p><strong>I noticed you don’t actually see anybody get lit on fire. Just the loser getting the fire extinguisher afterward. Is that due to a content restriction?</strong></p>



<p><strong>BW: </strong>Well, yeah, our rating is Teen. I'm not sure that constitutes actually seeing the full body on fire. So, you know, we allude to it.<strong></strong></p>



<p>But going back to your previous question, this is the second time that the Inferno match has been in our franchise. And for me, <strong>what separates this version and makes it that much better is the ability to exit the ring. You can leave the ring and fill up the ring with weapons, or the new thumbtacks, or tables</strong>. And we’re talking about other ways to win […] once you hit Inferno, you can do the default way of eliminating by trying to force [opponents] out through the ropes, or into the corners, but if you’re clever, you get a table in the ring, set that bad boy up, light it on fire, and put the opponent through it.</p>



<p><strong>Oh, okay, that counts as a win?</strong></p>



<p><strong>BW: </strong>Yeah. We also have a fireball Payback, which we introduced a couple of years back. And if you're in there with a character such as Aleister Black, who has fireballs as one of his default Paybacks, <strong>once you reach the Inferno state, you're able to throw a fireball in your opponent's face and win that way</strong>. So, there are some clever bits about it. But <strong>the coolest thing is being able to leave the ring and add weapons, which we were never able to do previously</strong>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFwwe2k2618.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-letting-players-tell-their-own-stories"><strong>Letting Players Tell Their Own Stories</strong></h2>



<p><strong>You’ve also added new start-of-match actions, and some of them have obvious gameplay benefits, but for others, it’s not as clear. Is there some sort of benefit to all of them?</strong></p>



<p><strong>BW: </strong>Those are largely there for the storytelling of a match. Like, for the player who has the story of a match imagined in their head. If it's two friends going out there, you’ve got the handshake, although even then you have the option to do a cheap shot.<strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>LJ: </strong>Yeah, even doing a stare down to recreate iconic moments, like the Rock staring Hogan down at ‘Mania, right? It's a way for us to breathe that storytelling and drama into regular matches without having to go through a pre-canned Showcase cutscene or something you only experience in Universe or MyRise. This happens in Exhibition. They happen in regular matches, and you feel like, “Oh, I feel like I can author my own story” by choosing one of these actions and seeing how that plays out. They can be gameplay interactions that can start the match off in a different way, or maybe you’re just “Yep, I wanted a cool moment to break things up,” right?</p>



<p><strong>I do get the sense you’re focused on bringing more roleplaying to WWE 2K, even in the Exhibition matches. Would you say that’s accurate?</strong></p>



<p><strong>LJ: </strong>For sure. And you also have the rival reactions now. When you go into the game options, you enable reactions, you'll get Universe-style cut scenes within Exhibition. So, like we were talking about, being able to tell your story or breathing the pro wrestling drama aspect into a fighting game, right? <strong>I would say we do a really good job of telling stories and breathing drama into specific modes in our game,</strong> like MyRise, Showcase, Universe, but in Exhibition it was missing. We knew that. And so, these are ways we're injecting those opportunities to tell stories within the Exhibition without the intimidation factor of, “Oh, I gotta go set up Universe or go to Showcase or MyRise to experience ‘pro wrestling’ drama”.</p>



<p><strong>BW:</strong> And the rivalries develop. It makes the decisions and the outcomes of your exhibition matches count. <strong>The game remembers, and your allies and rivalries form based on that</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>I appreciated some of the new weapons and other plunder that’s been added. The shopping cart in particular feels like it must have been a lot of work, given how you can put opponents in it and push them around…</strong></p>



<p><strong>LJ:</strong> &nbsp;You wouldn't believe how hard it is to simulate how hard it actually is in real life to move a shopping cart around with somebody in it [laughs].</p>



<p><strong>BW:</strong> God bless our engineers and our animators for the work that they did on that, because we all knew it was gonna be worth the effort.</p>



<p><strong>LJ:</strong> It was a <em>lot</em> of work.</p>



<p><strong>BW:</strong> This is one of the things that Lynell has always been a big fan of. Looking back at some of the older games in the franchise, where you had these elements… vehicles and being able to put your opponents in things, and he was, like, “We’ve got to get back to that. It's okay to reintroduce some of these kinds of out-there weapons, objects, and vehicles.” <strong>This is just the start with the shopping cart. This is something we want to push even further in the future</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>It’s interesting that you’re looking back at those earlier games for inspiration, but it sounds like even relatively small things like the shopping cart aren’t always easy. How do you balance satisfying that fan nostalgia with the demands of modern game development?</strong></p>



<p><strong>LJ: </strong>We look at a lot of the older games that people have a strong affinity for and there's that nostalgia factor that keeps itching, right? You're, like, “Man, it's not scratching that itch. These new games are just missing something that the old games had,” and we're aware of that, and we're trying our damnedest to breathe that stuff back into modern-day games. But also, <strong>gaming has evolved, and I think we’re trying to touch on that with The Island, with the Ringside Pass, with MyFaction</strong>. We want to make sure that all the choices we make as developers lead to fans having fun again in our game while also being rewarded for playing.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFwwe2k2619.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-learning-to-live-with-another-battle-pass"><strong>Learning to Live with Another Battle Pass</strong></h2>



<p><strong>You mentioned the Ringside Pass, which has generated some debate…</strong></p>



<p><strong>LJ:</strong> For a lot of people, the <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k26/ringside-report/ringside-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ringside Pass</a> is polarizing. It’s, like, “Man, they're just adding different ways to unlock content.” Like, no, we're asking you to play the game too. You earn RXP by playing different modes, or getting a four star match, or whatever. It's just a different currency that we're asking you to collect to get the things you want.</p>



<p><strong>BW:</strong> You're getting XP just from playing all aspects of the game. So whether you're a diehard MyGM guy or Universe person, everything you're doing in that mode, you're just accumulating XP. I don't think there's anything in the game you do where you’re not [getting XP]. So yeah, <strong>we've heard some grumblings, and I get it</strong>. It's different, it's a different thing. But, you know, different does not equal going back. And <strong>I think when people get their hands on WWE 2K26, they'll realize that whatever they thought it was, like, “Oh, this isn't bad at all. I can't believe I was so upset about this</strong>.”</p>



<p><strong>I guess the question people have is if there’s a benefit to the battle pass approach compared to the in-game unlocks + traditional DLC approach of the past?</strong></p>



<p><strong>LJ:</strong> <strong>The main thing that we're asking people to do is, at least for the free tiers, is just play the game and then feel rewarded</strong>. We’ve given you something to chase; there's a purpose, rather than a lot of matches not mattering. It's like, no, everything matters now. Everything you do can be part of chasing a tier and unlocking something special. Yeah, there's a traditional DLC model that everyone is used to that's still there. We're not taking that away from anybody. But, hey, all those rewards that were locked behind a mode that you probably weren't interested in… let’s just say if you weren’t a MyFaction fan or you weren’t an Island fan, but you like the rewards, you can still earn some of those things now by just playing whatever you want.</p>



<p><strong>Okay, so it’s more of a general XP you’re earning across all modes now, instead of specific unlocks for each mode.</strong></p>



<p><strong>LJ: </strong>Yeah. We know that every mode might not be your cup of tea.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFwwe2k2620.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-birthing-a-game-in-nine-months"><strong>Birthing a Game in Nine Months</strong></h2>



<p><strong>On the topic of different ways to play, it does seem like you’re really spreading the new features across the modes this year.</strong></p>



<p><strong>LJ:</strong> Every mode in our game has a huge, loud fan base that we're trying to please. And every year we hear it, “This is gonna be a copy and paste.” Like, we never copy. There's so much that goes into our, I always say, our nine-month development cycle.</p>



<p><strong>Only nine months?</strong></p>



<p><strong>LJ:</strong> <strong>Everyone thinks it's a year, but no, we have a couple months to plan what we're gonna do, lock that down, and then nine months from there, we’ve got to submit to first party</strong>, Microsoft, Sony, to make sure that we have enough time to tune the game and everything is right by the time it hits consumers hands and so that's not a lot of time with a huge roster that just grows year over year over year. And anytime we cut anyone, due to whatever reason, it’s, like, “Argh, we can’t believe you guys cut…” and sometimes it’s out of our hands. But hey, there's 400 characters. And also the community, the community creations, our users, the things that they're able to create are amazing, amazing. You're seeing superstars that we don't have the rights to show up on day one, and they look phenomenal. On par with what we’re doing.</p>



<p><strong>Speaking of community creations, I didn’t get to delve into the create-a-wrestler much. Can we expect some new features there?</strong></p>



<p><strong>LJ:</strong> Yeah, we’ve brought body morphing back. And going back to our discussion about why some features fall by the wayside and us trying to bring them back, the reason why we took it out was not because we hate people. <strong>We had to take it out because it was buggy as hell, right</strong>? It created some of the worst bugs that we've ever had in a game in [WWE] 2K20, and we're like, until we figure this thing out, we need to remove it, because it's destroying the user experience. Yeah, some people are really good at it, but it's creating a ton of issues that are making the game look bad and it's creating a bad experience for the user. And so now we brought it back and it's more powerful than ever. If you want to create something that looks funky or like a monster, go ahead, but if you want to create something that's realistic that we weren't able to with our preset body types, now you're able to.</p>

<h2 id="h-letting-go-of-last-gen"><strong>Letting Go of Last-Gen</strong></h2>



<p><strong>This year, you’ve finally left the last-gen systems, the PS4 and Xbox One, behind. Has that opened up some new possibilities for the series?</strong></p>



<p><span><strong>LJ:</strong>&nbsp;One of the benefits of not having to support the old gen systems anymore is, of course, <strong>lighting and shadowing have made huge improvements</strong>, but <strong>the biggest thing I would say for us</strong>, because it has gameplay implications, <strong>is the picture-in-picture window for Royal Rumble</strong>.</span> Sounds so small and simple. Why hasn't that been in the game? Well, because we couldn't render a different window at a different perspective in real time. And now you can. You see entrant 20’s coming, you see them running down the ramp, and it looks freaking awesome.</p>



<p><strong>What spurred the decision to drop last-gen for WWE 2K26? Why now?</strong></p>



<p><strong>LJ: </strong>Some of the decisions are kind of made for us. When you look at what our core audience is playing? What platform are they playing on? And is it worth the amount of effort to support these older consoles when the majority of our users are playing on the new consoles? And also, <strong>there’s a climate change about what people's expectations are for current-gen graphics</strong>. And again, it's a nine-month cycle, and we don't have the resources and time to invest in supporting two different systems that are working on two different engines. If we get rid of this because of these limiting factors, we can invest in this instead and improve the graphics or improve our tech.</p>



<p><strong>What are some of the things you may anticipate doing in future years now that last-gen is finally in the rearview mirror?</strong></p>



<p><strong>LJ:</strong> One of our last big barriers is figuring out, <strong>could we ever increase our playable superstars from eight to ten or twelve or whatever</strong>? I would say the improvements that we've been able to make this year, as far as collision, like dynamic interactions with ledges and slamming someone on the steps, our ragdoll physics – all those things have an impact on CPU and even GPU in some cases. Thumbtacks, that has an impact on GPU, right? So, like, these are all things the newer-gen consoles let us do. <strong>Not only do they have an impact visually, but they also have an impact from a gameplay standpoint</strong>.</p>



<p>I think we're scratching the surface on those things. <strong>We have a large, huge list of things that we want to try</strong>. And like I said, games are evolving so fast. And like I said, the industry is evolving too and seeing what other games are doing, it's interesting. And I feel like, even borrowing inspiration from WWE or even the older games, right? Like, hey, maybe it's time that we start looking at some of these older features that people used to like back in the day, and maybe now can we do it in an efficient way on these next-gen consoles and also make it look pretty? So, there's never a shortage of ideas.</p>



<p><strong>BW:</strong> The thing about the nostalgia for some of the older games, like Smackdown! Here Comes the Pain or a Smackdown vs. Raw 2007, we see all that. But anytime we bring something back, to Lynell’s point… I was there, working on some of those games, and there was still some jank. Like with the motorcycle in 2009 [laughs]. <strong>People remember that something was there or that they could do something, but I think they also kind of forget that it didn't look all that great</strong>. They just enjoyed the fact that it was there.</p>



<p><strong>LJ:</strong> There’s a huge disconnect from quality back then…</p>



<p><strong>…to what people expect now.</strong></p>



<p><strong>BW: </strong>Yeah. It’s 2026. So, when we do bring these features back, or just elements of those older games, we want to bring those things back in a way that meets the quality expectations that, not just our fans, but fans of games in general, have for this hardware that we're working with. And so, <strong>all those things come together to where it's, yeah, we're bringing it back, not just for nostalgia's sake. We're doing it because we know it's gonna be fun, and we know we can now make it look good, feel good, sound good at the same time</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>How has the Nintendo Switch 2 been to work with? Is it fitting in with the other current-gen systems?</strong></p>



<p><strong>LJ: </strong>It is. And we know that that audience is a little different, and so <strong>we introduced a different way to play that game, with a single Joy-Con, where it's more like casual, more fun</strong>, and the jury's out, right? If we feel like there's a bigger audience for that on the other consoles, maybe that's something that we adopt, as far as having a more accessible mode. But like, we look at that console, we're like, hey, let's try to have parity as much as possible. But we know that the audience is a little different.</p>



<p><strong>BW:</strong> We were just talking about the last-gen consoles, and yeah, we dropped them, but we also picked up Nintendo, which we're glad to have back. I mean, Nintendo, they need a good wrestling game too.</p>



<p><strong>I guess if you’d kept last-gen, you would have been juggling three balls.</strong></p>



<p><strong>LJ: </strong>Yeah, and we do a mobile game too!<strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>Moving on to MyRise, I only got a small taste, but it does seem a bit more grounded in WWE 2K26. I felt like last year’s MyRise was kind of disconnected from actual WWE programming. I like how this one started off with the Raw after WrestleMania, which is, of course, a big date on WWE fans’ calendars. Was bringing things back down to earth a goal this year?</strong></p>



<p><strong>LJ: </strong>Every year, we try to come up with a different idea, and we try to listen to the fans as much as possible, right? Within reason. And we know some people love the fantasy stuff, some people love the dark stuff, some people love the humor. Some people love it to be just grounded in WWE, right? And so the good thing about it is that every year we get a new crack at it and a chance to do something different.</p>



<p><strong>BW:</strong> And that just speaks to pro wrestling fans in general. I've got friends who can't stand the comedy stuff in any wrestling, but then I've got friends, that’s their favorite part of the show. And so, just balancing all those different flavors together. I mean, I think Sean and his team, the MyRise team, do a great job.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFwwe2k2622.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-the-island-is-a-work-in-progress"><strong>The Island is a Work in Progress</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Last year, The Island was a big focus, and I think it’s fair to say the reaction to it was mixed. At least that’s what the vibe online was. I don’t know what kind of engagement you guys saw with it. What are you bringing to it in WWE 2K26 that might change that response?</strong></p>



<p><strong>LJ: </strong>We knew [The Island] wasn't going to wow everyone in its first year, because the expectation that <strong>NBA 2K</strong> had set with <strong>The City </strong>was really high. And they had, like, seven to ten years to craft what it is now. We're starting at level one here. <strong>There's no way that we're matching what they can do</strong>. But they set a good target for us to chase, right? I think the main thing for us was like, let's just get it out there. Let's see what people say. We know where we need to improve, where we're falling short.</p>



<p><strong>Fair enough. I definitely didn’t think The City, or I guess it was just The Neighborhood to start, would last long term when NBA 2K first rolled it out.</strong></p>



<p><strong>LJ: </strong>We're like, okay, let's focus on community, right? Let's focus on teaming up. With the MyTag, where you can team up with one of your friends and go through towers and earn a championship belt on the leaderboards. Adding that competitive aspect and that community to it. And the first thing we ask you to do when you join the island this year is to choose a faction. Okay, now I have an allegiance to this faction, and when I play through these towers, I'm earning more faction points towards my faction, and so you get that sense of community, and that's what we're trying to build with this online world. <strong>It's almost like an MMO, right? And I would say there's some really good progression elements that we've added to this year's mode</strong>, but also there's some cool things that haven't been seen or announced yet that we're adding, not only from a ringside pass standpoint, from a gameplay standpoint, that is gonna kind of… set things on fire.</p>



<p><strong>BW: </strong>And, I mean, for those who stayed with The Island in WWE 2K25, by the time we released that final boss fight match with Roman Reigns, that was a testament to the team's ability to just commit to this idea of The Island. I look back at what The Island was when we released 2K25, then where we left it after all the post-launch content was done, and it’s, wow, this thing really populated itself.</p>



<p><strong>LJ: </strong>And I would say, from a storytelling standpoint, there's a huge visual upgrade to how we tell stories within The Island. There are actual cut scenes and models that are talking, rather than the two portraits, which was all we could do [in WWE 2K25]. It’s, like, “Oh wait, this is like the rest of the game now.” It doesn't feel like we cut corners. And it’s not like we thought, “Yeah, this is the coolest way to do this.” It was the only thing that we could get off the ground in the first year. It's not what we wanted, but it's the only thing we could do.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-s-in-a-400-slot-roster"><strong>What’s in a 400 Slot Roster?</strong></h2>



<p><strong>So, there are 400 superstars in WWE 2K26. That’s a lot! I’m not sure if I can even name 400 wrestlers, and I’ve watched a lot of wrestling!</strong></p>



<p><strong>LJ: </strong>[Laughs] Imagine having to work on the movesets for all of them? And the attire?</p>



<p><strong>BW:</strong> I don’t have to imagine! [Laughs].<strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>How are you getting to that number? Are you counting a lot of alternate versions of wrestlers? How deep are the cuts going?</strong></p>



<p><strong>BW: </strong>Well, first of all, you have MyRise, The Island… those two modes alone have their own cast of characters.</p>



<p><strong>So, some of those WWE 2K original characters are being included in the total number?</strong></p>



<p><strong>BW: </strong>Yeah. And like, with MyFaction, there are the different versions of superstars. Like the retro CM Punk or, like, Dusty Rhodes with the polka dot attire. But even just a base roster, it's almost like we have this collection of action figures that we take out.<strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>LJ: </strong>Speaking of action figures, we still have the Mattel partnership! And then we have some other cool partnerships that we're going to announce and debut at a later date. So, yes, we're taking care of the simulation part. You know, that's home base for us. But that doesn't mean that we can't explore what we’re talking about with The Island and the fiction and the fun, and bring some of that nostalgia from the older games. We're bringing some of that back, and we're bringing it back in a big way.</p>



<p><strong>BW:</strong> And we’ve got AAA talent now. Let’s not forget about them.</p>



<p><strong>Yeah, I guess WWE’s sphere keeps growing, so the sandbox you guys can play in keeps growing</strong> <strong>too</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>LJ:</strong> We can’t play with everything, not everything, but they allow us to do a lot, right? Which leads to our huge roster.</p>



<p><strong>BW:</strong> It’s amazing how it blows up each year.</p>



<p><strong>500 roster slots next year?</strong></p>



<p><strong>LJ:</strong> Oh God, don’t say that.</p>



<p><strong>Sorry, I know you guys don’t need any extra work. Thanks for taking the time to answer my questions again this year.</strong></p>



<p><strong>LJ: </strong>Nice to talk to you again.<strong></strong></p>



<p><strong>BW: </strong>It’s always a pleasure!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The next Nacon Connect's time and date have been revealed, and the publisher will be showing off games from its upcoming catalog, including <em>Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss</em>, <em>The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu</em>, and <em>Endurance Motorsport Series: Cthulhu Rising </em>(at least, I hope so).</p><p>As revealed via a new teaser trailer, Nacon Connect 2026 will take place on March 4th at 11am PT (that's 2pm Eastern and 7pm GMT). Nacon says it will include game announcements, new gameplay footage for existing titles, and more.</p><p>Specifically, in a press release, Nacon names the aforementioned three games, as well as upcoming RPG <em>Edge of Memories</em>, as feature titles for the presentation. There's no mention of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/terminator-survivors-delayed-multiplayer-canceled" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="40d94db3-1851-4626-9b66-e2ef8936ec01" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">recently-delayed <em>Terminator: Survivors</em></a>, though, so it could be a while before we hear more about that one.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Nacon is really hoping you like Cthulhu for this year's Nacon Connect.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As well as the aforementioned games, we'll also be getting a glimpse of "new projects" which Nacon says will "enrich [its] catalog". That seems to me like a curiously shareholder-focused way of putting it, but in any case, we'll get to see new Nacon games. Hooray!</p><p>It's likely that in addition to everything outlined above, Nacon will be showing new gameplay footage for <em>GreedFall 2: The Dying World</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/greedfall-2-release-date-march" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3f57a6c2-60c6-43d7-9e2d-1e4c4532b06a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">set to leave Early Access in March</a>. Whether it'll drum up enough hype for the RPG for a big sales boost remains to be seen, however.</p><p>This is also the first Nacon Connect since the publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nacon-wrc-games-2027-2032" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1f3b1134-585a-4a3b-9274-678fe5c4558f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">took over the <em>WRC </em>game franchise</a> from EA and Codemasters back in May, and with the first new title in that series apparently due for 2027, now seems like the ideal time to reveal it.</p>
<p>We'll find out exactly what's being revealed at this year's Nacon Connect when the showcase airs on March 4th at 11am PT/2pm ET/7pm GMT. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Nacon.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

This seems like a great entry-level OLED for your gaming desktop or laptop setup; it has a similar 111 pixels per inch (PPI) as its competitors, it has a three-year warranty that protects against burn-in from normal use (when you use its panel protection settings), and its 16:9 aspect ratio makes it ideal for PC and console gaming.</p><p>The benefits of QD-OLED over IPS and TN panels commonly used in monitors are immediately obvious when you compare them side-by-side. QD-OLED offers deeper blacks (no more black appearing as hues of gray) and better contrast with more color and brightness accuracy. Games and movies will look better than ever. Google Docs? Not so much. Brightness and text clarity are areas where this tech falls behind; viewing a huge, white Google Doc on this and other OLEDs will make it appear somewhat dim. And, while newer OLED monitors boast clearer text thanks to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/854183/oled-gaming-monitors-rgb-stripe-lg-samsung-display-ces-2026">vertical RGB stripes</a> in their panels, you might notice some fringing around letters with this monitor (and many others on the market) if you look closely.</p><div><p id="other-verge-approved-deals"><h2>Other Verge-approved deals</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Sony has discounted a fleet of PS5 games and accessories on its PS Direct site, and you’ll also find many of them on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0C1QJ6VHY,B0CCGYBSW8,B0CMK3MS2X,B0D5SM3K4Q,B0CJGPSXG4,B0F19GPDW3,B0C7WQRCPB,B0CTVK7GBM,B0DX42RXMS,B08QFPS48J,B09Z7JZW4P,B0DJ7W2WXV,B09SW6GCGL,B0B61YDF5V,B0CP4DCK45,B0B3QWRQL8,B0DD8TMP2Y,B0CP4DCK45,B08QFWWJ8K,B098G34GBT,B0CPYSPHR1,B08QFZCGVJ,&amp;pf_rd_r=DGZ43G35FX5SV32W84R3&amp;pf_rd_t=Events&amp;pf_rd_i=deals&amp;pf_rd_p=b1ab93f1-0f27-4035-81c4-56aebad2af1c&amp;pf_rd_s=slot-14&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsearchpage.jsp%3FbrowsedCategory%3Dpcmcat1487698928729%26id%3Dpcat17071%26qp%3Dsellerid_facet%253DSeller~bby%255Ebrand_facet%253DBrand~Naughty%2BDog%255Ebrand_facet%253DBrand~Sony%2BInteractive%2BEntertainment%255Ebrand_facet%253DBrand~Sony%255Ebrand_facet%253DBrand~Santa%2BMonica%2BStudios%255Epercentdiscount_facet%253DDiscount~All%2BDiscounted%2BItems%255Eplatformcompatibilitymv_facet%253DCompatible%2BPlatform~PlayStation%2B5%255Eplatformcompatibilitymv_facet%253DCompatible%2BPlatform~PlayStation%2B4%255Ebrand_facet%253DBrand~Climax%2BStudios%255Ebrand_facet%253DBrand~Insomniac%2BGames%255Ebrand_facet%253DBrand~Team%2BNinja%255Ebrand_facet%253DBrand~Lucid%2BGames%2BLimited%26ref%3D388%26st%3Dcategoryid%2524pcmcat1487698928729" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fbrand%2Fplaystation%2Fplaystation-5-games%2F10059648%3FselectedSellerId%3D0%26nrtv_cid%3Dvze1kqgjh3tei%26clickid%3DRiv07M0ozxyZTzGxQ21IOS-EUku2RYw9zSiZ2g0%26irgwc%3D1%26afsrc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_Riv07M0ozxyZTzGxQ21IOS-EUku2RYw9zSiZ2g0" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, and <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=24348&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fpmid%3DC01787%2CC01785" rel="sponsored">GameStop</a>.

            <p>
Earlier this month, Epic Games Store shyly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-will-lean-harder-on-fortnite-to-drive-third-party-sales-on-epic-games-store-with-100-licensed-hats-a-year">announced</a> that their free game giveaways are having "a measurable halo effect across the broader PC ecosystem", increasing the sales of those games on Steam during the offer period. New Blood Interactive’s Dave Oshry has made the same argument a bit less sympathetically: boosting the profile of games already on Steam is the <em>only</em> reason to release anything on the Epic Games Store, even given Epic’s more generous developer revenue share, because EGS sucks.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The subject came up during <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/interview/19699-new-blood-interactive-dave-oshry-2026-interview-dungeons-of-dusk-rpg-steam-epic-games-store-switch-2">a gargantuan interview with RPGsite</a>, which also touches on New Blood’s forthcoming Doom RPG-esque Dungeons of Dusk, Switch 2, parenthood, and Oshry’s favourite brand of coffee. “So, we don't have any games on EGS, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blood-west">Blood West</a> is on EGS,” Oshry commented at one point. “HyperStrange controls that. When we took over publishing for Blood West, they were like, ‘Hey, do you want the Epic Games Store stuff?’ I was like, ‘No, I don't give a shit. What does it sell? Like, five copies a month? They're like, ‘Not even.’
</p>
<p>
“But they did a free giveaway for Blood West over Christmas. I think it was - Blood West was free on Christmas or whatever and I thought ‘Oh, man, I guess that's going to kill some of our Steam sales that week or whatever, during the winter sale.’ It turned out Blood West Steam sales for those two days actually were, like, up 200% because it was just free advertising for Blood West. So, people saw that Blood West was free on EGS, and then they went and bought it on Steam instead, which is hilarious.
</p>
<p>
“So it's not a black hole,” he went on. “It actually advertises for other platforms. That's how bad EGS is. And it sucks because originally the promise of EGS was really good, but you have to build a better store. You can't beat Steam just with free giveaways and high developer percentages. You could give developers 100% of the royalties if you wanted, but if nobody's buying. What's 100% of zero? Like, who gives a shit?
</p>
<p>
“So, the ideas were there, but they failed to build a better store or a better user experience at all and it's been like 10 years, and they just haven't. So, it's dead. End of story.”
</p>
<p>
In the same interview, Oshry offered a similar, but slightly more forgiving analysis of GOG (I’ve added some hyperlinks, for context). “Back before Steam opened the floodgates and you could put any old game on there, things were great,” he said. “Steam would be for your new games and GOG would be for all your old games, right? Then Steam let anybody put anything on there, and then all of a sudden who needed GOG anymore?
</p><p>
“The things GOG has been doing with preservation, and updating games, and being able to host things like Fallout London,” he went on. “They have these <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gog-announce-a-new-new-one-click-system-aiming-to-take-things-to-another-level-entirely-for-fuss-free-modding">one-click mod installers</a> now, which is really good. For guys like me, I don't mind moving files around and shit, modding the old way, but we're getting to a point now where people are either too old or too young and don't know how modding works. The fact that you can be like, ‘Oh, man, I really want to play Heroes of Might and Magic 3, and you could just go to GOG and they've got, like, a one-click installer to play it on Windows 11 in ultrawide, and the fact that they’re taking the time to do that kind of stuff is great.
</p>
<p>
“The problem is it's still 1 to 5% of the sales on Steam, where it used to be closer to 5 or 10%. And <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gogs-new-owner-will-stick-to-its-revamped-classic-and-zero-drm-guns-but-does-think-lessons-lie-in-steams-overstuffed-embrace">GOG's got a new owner now</a>. One of the CD Projekt Red guys who left just bought GOG out from under CD Projekt Red. It's independent now. I mean, it was always independent, right? It's part of CDPR, but now it's his own company, and he's been outspoken about what he wants to do, just providing a better experience.
</p>
<p>
“Everybody roots for GOG, right?” Oshry concluded. “We want GOG to be a great thing, and GOG's great. It's just that I don't have a reason to use GOG or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gog-galaxy">GOG Galaxy</a> instead of Steam. The only thing I've got installed on GOG Galaxy right now is Fallout London and The Journeyman Project games, actually. I went back and played those a little bit, and those need to be fucking made to work on modern systems. Holy shit. That was a pain in the ass. But I got them running. I played them for five minutes. I got my nostalgia fix, and I uninstalled it.
</p>
<p>
“I mean, GOG is great. I love their preservation efforts and everything they're trying to do, but they need enough people to give a shit, or, how long are they even going to be around?”
</p>
<p>
All of the above chimes with my feelings as a dead-eyed user of all three platforms. The Epic Games Store has been around for eight years and still doesn't have a proper screenshot button - take it from me, the average review score for an EGS release would go up 2% if it did. GOG? Great at all that modding stuff, for sure, less good at resisting the siren call of generative AI. Mark can <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-shouldnt-have-happened-gog-reportedly-claim-sale-banner-made-with-al-tools-ended-up-on-store-by-mistake">tell you more</a>.</p><p>Still, all this is a wee bit “old man yells at cloud”. Oshry seldom lands in the middle of the scale with his opinions, and I really must object to his defeatist rhetoric that "the Internet sucks in 2026. Nothing's fun anymore. You used to be able to make a cool website, or nobody goes to websites anymore.” Shut up David. Stop insisting that it’s the children who are wrong and go finish making your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dusks-developers-are-making-a-fallout-inspired-crpg-with-first-person-combat">unofficial Fallout game</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Considering how popular the concept of pirates is, it’s a surprise that there aren’t really that many successful pirate video games. Aside from the likes of Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag and Sea of Thieves, it’s slim pickings, but there appears to be a new kid on the block, going by the name Windrose.</p>







<p>It’s still in Early Access, but that hasn’t stopped the title from blowing up in popularity, and fans are eagerly jumping into the brand-new demo. However, although it’s multiplayer, there’s a lot of confusion surrounding whether <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/windrose/" id="3630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Windrose</a> will feature PvP combat, so Insider Gaming has done some sleuthing and struck gold, as the answer has been revealed. </p>



<h2 id="h-does-windrose-have-pvp">Does Windrose Have PvP?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You’ll have to settle for these thugs instead. Image by Windrose Crew.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Despite the fact that Windrose has multiplayer features, there is no PvP enabled, as it is a strictly PvE adventure. </strong></p>



<p>Windrose has been on a long, arduous development journey, and plenty of changes and course corrections have been made over the years. Originally, the game was titled Crosswind, and it was set to be an open-world pirate MMO full of Pirate PvE—and PvP.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-gaming-show-most-wanted-everything-announced/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-gaming-show-most-wanted-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted</a></li>
</ul>



<p>However, since then, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/windrose-crew/" id="3635" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Windrose Crew</a> has drastically altered its plans. Instead, Windrose will now be a survival-focused adventure title, chock full of PvE encounters on both land and sea, with PvP laid to the wayside. </p>







<h2 id="h-will-windrose-have-pvp">Will Windrose Have PvP?</h2>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, it looks like that ship has sailed, as there seems to be no intention of bringing PvP combat to the high seas of Windrose.</strong></p>



<p>That might be disappointing to some fans out there, as the concept of naval combat against other players is admittedly a thrilling one. However, the developers behind Windrose clearly felt that their ambitions better aligned with a PvE experience, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/windrose-surpasses-1-million-steam-wishlists/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/windrose-surpasses-1-million-steam-wishlists/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game’s early success</a> makes it seem like that might have been the right call. </p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-co-op-multiplayer/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-co-op-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Does God Of War: Sons Of Sparta Have Multiplayer?</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Plus, the concept of PvP would have been much better suited to the MMO genre, with large-scale battles on the cards. Now that the game has instead opted for a more focused experience, it appears that it was a good call for PvP to walk the plank. </p>

            <p><a href="https://www.gog.com/en/">GOG</a> remains the one digital distribution platform that seemingly cares about proper video game preservation. This isn't free PR or a generous read of what it's been stating since it was born; facts and numerous endeavours to save old games from being lost to time are enough to be certain the folks at the top aren't messing around.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-and-cd-projekt-founder-micha-kicinski-acquires-100-ownership-of-gog">CD Projekt co-founder Michał Kiciński acquired the entirety of the platform</a>, effectively taking it away from the famous game maker's partial control. Since then, its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-joins-europes-largest-organisation-dedicated-to-game-preservation">mission statement</a> has only become louder: People want to <em>truly </em>own their games even when they're in digital format, and the works of the past, no matter their popularity, need to survive in their original forms too. GOG has even declared <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-faces-difficult-questions-about-generative-ai-use">it won't shy away from taking advantage of recent AI advancements</a> in conjunction with "human judgment" if they can be safely used to "advance" its crusade.</p>
<p>Now, following New Blood CEO Dave Oshry's praise for the platform <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/interview/19699-new-blood-interactive-dave-oshry-2026-interview-dungeons-of-dusk-rpg-steam-epic-games-store-switch-2">during an interview for RPG Site</a>, GOG's X/Twitter account has once again posted a loud call to action:</p>
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>

<p>"Game preservation only works if people care" is a true statement which no one should be able to argue against. No matter how much we collectively say we care about saving the old games from oblivion and true digital ownership, few things (if any) will change if we continue to grab remasters and remakes while ignoring original releases made readily available, or if we refuse to grab PC games which aren't on Steam.</p><p>Even Oshry admitted that, as much as he loves GOG and what it does, Valve's platform is a more pleasant one than GOG Galaxy, so there's room for improvement which can hopefully boost GOG's overall popularity: "I mean, GOG is great. I love their preservation efforts and everything they're trying to do, but they need enough people to give a shit, or, how long are they even going to be around?"</p>
<p>GOG's official account acknowledged both the praise and criticism, but (smartly) used this opportunity to ask people to "buy DRM-free, vote on the Dreamlist, join <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/patrons">GOG Patrons</a>" and continue to support "the games that shaped us." In recent years, the company has ramped up its efforts to give players more ways to directly engage with what goes on the platform and suggest new additions.</p>
<p>The Patrons initiative is particularly interesting, as it allows the most passionate video game preservation fanatics to directly support GOG's own restoration efforts, which target tune-ups and updates that make old releases (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dino-crisis-1-2-getting-enhanced-pc-re-releases-courtesy-of-gog">like the two original Dino Crisis</a>) work out of the box on modern systems with improved rendering options, controls, cloud saves, and whatnot. At the time of writing, it's 5 euros per month and also grants a number of perks like an exclusive Discord community, voting on preservation priorities, and exclusive BTS content.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last year’s entry in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/wwe-2k/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>WWE 2K series</strong></a> left some, <strong>including me</strong>, wanting. After several years of steady piecemeal improvement, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>WWE 2K25 went all-in on The Island</strong></a>, a new cosmetic-festooned online hub similar to NBA 2K's The City, with most other aspects of the game falling by the wayside. Was this just a one-year misstep, or the beginning of a new direction? <span>Last week, <strong>I traveled to WWE Headquarters</strong> in Stamford, Connecticut, to go hands-on with&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/wwe-2k26/" target="_blank"><strong>WWE 2K26</strong></a>&nbsp;and <strong>was surprised to find I could test pretty much the entire game</strong> (in years past, journalists were typically given a curated list of modes and matches to try).</span> This would seem to reflect the fact that developer Visual Concepts have really spread their effort out this year, offering updates for most aspects of the game rather than focusing on a single big ticket new item like The Island (although The Island does return this year).</p>



<p>So, has WWE 2K26 benefitted from this renewed focus on the fundamentals, or is the series destined to fall further down the card?&nbsp;While <strong>I need to play more before I can render any final verdict</strong>, you can roll on with my pre-show impressions.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFwwe2k268.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>While WWE 2K26 plays more or less the same as the series has for years now, <strong>some notable between-the-ropes tweaks and additions have been made</strong>. I've long been critical of WWE 2K's stamina and reversal system, arguing there simply aren't enough ways to change the course of a match and that reversals are overused and frustrating. If you're not feeling the often-finnicky timing on reversals, your opponent can seemingly beat you down with impunity. Alternatively, sometimes it feels like higher-level AI or skilled human opponents are able to reverse literally everything you throw at them.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFwwe2k2613.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>With WWE 2K26, <strong>Visual Concepts have taken at least a half-step to address this</strong>. Now if you go for too many reversals in a row (around three or four) you'll become "winded" and won't be able to reverse anything for a few seconds. This means those infuriating stretches where an opponent won't let you land <em>anything </em>will eventually come to an end, and, in theory, will force folks to play with a bit more strategy. Is it really worth it to reverse every kick and punch? Or do you save your stamina for the bigger moves?</p>



<p>Honestly, I wouldn't mind if the “winded” mechanic was even stricter. While there were a few less reversals during my recent playtime, they were still pretty heavily in play. Visual Concepts also hasn't done anything to fix the random-feeling timing of reversals. I think Visual Concepts understand that a more strategic approach to reversals is required, but ultimately, a more complete rework of the system is required. Perhaps something that takes the momentum of the <em>attacker</em> into account as well (and brings back blocks while you're at it).</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFwwe2K2614.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Other in-ring tweaks include <strong>new start-of-match actions -- &nbsp;you can now offer a handshake, rush in for a hockey-fight-style brawl, etc. -- and additional weapons, like thumb tacks and a shopping cart you can take an opponent for an involuntary ride in</strong>. These features don't really change core gameplay all that much, but are in keeping with Visual Concepts’ focus on simulating the look and feel of the real WWE TV product. They're fun little touches that should be appreciated by folks who primarily play these games to roleplay as a WWE Superstar.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFwwe2k2610.jpg"></a></figure>



<p><strong>Four new match types have been added</strong> -- I Quit, Dumpster, Three Stages of Hell, and the much-requested Inferno match -- <strong>all of which feel like worthwhile additions</strong>, to varying degrees. I Quit isn't a simple submission match – while you can make someone quit with a submission, you can also beat them down and then ask for a verbal “I Quit.” If your opponent slaps you in a submission or asks for an I Quit, a minigame pops up where you have to time button presses as your cursor passes through several green zones on a circular meter. These green zones shrink depending on how much damage you've absorbed to various body parts, so it is quite possible to get an I Quit by simply beating your opponent to a pulp. I quite liked this system and wouldn't mind if something similar were used for submissions across all match types.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFwwe2k269.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>The Inferno match is simple enough, as you beat on your opponent with big moves until the flame meter is maxed out, then try to light them ablaze by throwing them into the flames. Mechanically, the match works, and there are some fun secret ways to win (flaming tables or fireballs will do the job), but the presentation is a bit iffy. The flame effects are obviously just a flat texture, and you never actually get to see your opponent get lit up, just an animation of them being sprayed with a fire extinguisher (perhaps this is a ratings issue).</p>



<p>The Dumpster match is another of your basic "throw your opponent into something and close the door/lid" matches, albeit one that's good for some juvenile boasting. Meanwhile, <strong>Three Stages of Hell allows you to pick any three matches you want to play back-to-back, allowing you to make it whatever kind of experience you want</strong>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFwwe2k2615.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Visually, <strong>WWE 2K26 looks largely the same as last year’s title</strong>, despite the franchise finally dropping last-gen consoles. Most of the game's 400+ playable characters (that number includes alternate versions of characters and even completely fictional wrestlers from The Island) look mostly the same as last year, albeit with some tweaks for stars who have changed their looks and another level of polish on the lighting and some effects. Interestingly, in an interview with WWE 2K26's devs, one way they say they’ve taken advantage of their newfound freedom from last-gen restrictions is <strong>the return of body morphing in create-a-wrestler, which should result in more accurate (and out-there) custom creations</strong>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFwwe2k2611.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>As usual, <strong>2K Showcase is this year’s most heavily promoted mode</strong>, with CM Punk being the focus this go ‘round. The Showcase features the usual recreations of real-world matches, but also some intriguing "What if?" and fantasy matches imagining what might have happened if Punk hadn't taken a decade-long, er… "sabbatical" from WWE. It's a clever hook, but the Showcase matches suffer from the same problem they always have -- a very exacting list of objectives that can be frustrating to pull off just the way the game wants you to. Interestingly, this year, <strong>there is also the option to take on a gauntlet of regular matches to unlock all Showcase content, which feels like an admission that this mode will never be for everyone</strong>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WCCFwwe2K2612.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>That isn't necessarily the end of the world, as <strong>there are a lot of other modes on offer here</strong>. For instance, I'm happy to report that <strong>the MyRise career mode seems to be back on more solid ground this time</strong>. Last year's MyRise felt like it had been badly neglected, with only one story regardless of whether you played as a male or female Superstar and characterizations that felt completely divorced from actual WWE programming. This year, we get separate stories for both the men and women and a narrative that feels more grounded in real WWE programming, with players taking on the role of "The Archetype," a main-event Superstar returning on the Raw after WrestleMania to much fanfare. No tiresome "rags to riches" story here, you're right there in the mix with top wrestlers who feel like they're properly aligned and acting like themselves.</p>



<p>I wasn't able to delve into the game’s other modes as deeply, but they all seem to offer their own new bullet points. The Island now has a faction system and new options for teaming with others, MyGM has added intergender matches, multi-person matches, and 50-week seasons, the Universe sandbox mode now includes the WWE Draft, and more. <strong>Pretty much everywhere you look, something fresh has been added, which is actually a pretty impressive accomplishment considering Visual Concepts only gets around 9 months to develop each new entry in the series</strong> (these guys should be competing for the WWE Speed title).</p>

<h2 id="h-current-thoughts-on-wwe-2k26"><strong>Current Thoughts on WWE 2K26</strong></h2>



<p><strong>WWE 2K26 isn't a full-on reinvention</strong>. I'm not sure we're ever going to see that, but <strong>developer Visual Concepts has hit the gym, put in the work, and come back with small to mid-size gains pretty much across the board</strong>. I still have to play more to see how well it all holds together, and some nagging irritations still remain, but it's nice to see a veteran franchise player like WWE 2K still working on its fundamentals.</p>

You can check out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/wwe-2k26-interview-gamelay-changes-cutting-last-gen-the-island/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview with WWE 2K producers Lynell Jinks and Bryan Williams here</a>. WWE 2K26 hits PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and Switch 2 <strong>on March 13</strong>, unless you buy <a href="https://wccftech.com/wwe-2k26-announced-march-cm-punk-150-dollar-edition-battle-passes-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the game’s three special editions</a>, in which case, you’ll be able to play a week early on March 6.</p>

			<p><strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a></em></strong> made its debut on <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> and <strong>Xbox Series</strong> consoles in January, and the Switch 2 port in particular has been praised as a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/this-is-an-incredible-port-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-demo-leaves-community-stunned-with-near-ps5-visual-fidelity/">solid port</a></strong> that accounts for the system's technical limitations compared to the&nbsp;PlayStation 5&nbsp;and&nbsp;Xbox Series X,&nbsp;delivering the best possible experience.</p>



<p>With <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-arrives-on-nintendo-switch-2-this-june/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a></em></strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</em></strong>, however, achieving a high-quality port is definitely going to be more challenging, but the development team is set to deliver a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">30 FPS</strong> on the weaker platforms, such as the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Switch 2</strong> and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Xbox Series S</strong>, according to the trilogy's director <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Naoki Hamaguchi</strong>.</p>



<p>Speaking with <strong><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/we-ask-final-fantasy-vii-remake-director-naoki-hamaguchi-about-the-switch-2-versions-hair-problem-why-does-it-happen-and-can-it-be-avoided/">Automaton</a></strong>, <strong>Hamaguchi-san</strong> was asked about the performance target for the second and third entry in the series, confirming that every effort is being made on this front.</p>



<p><em>"We’re consistently aiming for 30fps wherever possible,"</em> <strong>Hamaguchi</strong> said. <em>"For FFVII Rebirth and the third installment of the trilogy, our engineers are working hard on tuning to ensure stable performance at that level. I hope players will look forward to it."</em></p>



<p>Considering how some <strong>visual compromises</strong> had to be made to make <strong>Performance Mode</strong> in <strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></strong> on <strong>PlayStation 5</strong> run at <strong>stable 60 FPS</strong>, it will be very interesting to see how the <strong>Switch 2</strong> and <strong>Xbox Series S</strong> will handle future games to ensure this <strong>30 FPS target</strong> is met, and what sort of compromises will be made to deliver the best possible experience for a massive game like <strong><em>Rebirth</em></strong> and the even bigger game <strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</em></strong> is set to be.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, there's still no indication of exactly h<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">ow big the third and final part of the trilogy will be</strong>, as it hasn't been officially announced yet.

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-rob-robot-trailer-2000669425"><em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie </em></a>arrives in theaters in April. We know <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-yoshi-birdo-baby-2000662854">Yoshi, Bowser Jr., and Rosalina</a> will be joining the sequel alongside the main returning characters, Mario, Luigi, Bowser, and Peach. But according to a new leak courtesy of a theater chain’s website, another new face is set to show up in the animated sequel.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-description-appears-to-spoil-a-major-unannounced-character">As spotted by <em>IGN</em></a>, United Kingdom-based fancy movie theater chain Everyman recently posted a new text description for the upcoming blockbuster that just straight up lists Wario. The totally new, not-yet-announced-to-be-in-this-movie villain who is seemingly going to be a part of <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> hasn’t shown up in any of Nintendo’s past marketing beats or trailers. <a href="https://www.everymancinema.com/film-listing/327878-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie/#coming-soon:~:text=After%20defeating%20Bowser%20and%20saving%20Brooklyn%2C%20Mario%20faces%20Wario%20and%20Bowser%20Jr.%27s%20evil%20alliance.%20Now%2C%20alongside%20his%20friends%20and%20Yoshi%2C%20he%20must%20stop%20their%20plans%20for%20world%20domination.">Here’s the description</a>:</p>

 <blockquote><p>“After defeating Bowser and saving Brooklyn, Mario faces <strong>Wario</strong> and Bowser Jr.’s evil alliance. Now, alongside his friends and Yoshi, he must stop their plans for world domination.”</p></blockquote> <p>Well, that sure sounds like Wario is going to be in this movie! Of course, calling this a spoiler is probably inaccurate as it’s likely to be revealed in Nintendo and Universal’s own pre-release marketing rollout via a new teaser or something before the movie’s April 1 debut. But at least for now, Wario’s inclusion in the <em>Mario</em> movie sequel has yet to be announced. We do know that Chris Pratt, who voices Mario, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/chris-pratt-supposedly-hints-at-a-couple-more-character-surprises-in-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie">has hinted that there are more unannounced characters left to be revealed</a>. So he’s likely referencing Wario, assuming this leaked description is accurate. And if it is, it sounds like Wario will play a big role in the film alongside Bowser Jr.</p> <p>Now, what I’m really excited about is that if Wario is in this movie, that means I can raise the chance of <a href="https://kotaku.com/waluigi-debuted-20-years-ago-today-and-i-respect-him-a-1844460557">Nintendo’s horrible affront to nature, Waluigi,</a> showing up in this flick from 1 percent to a solid 10 percent. Maybe more! How exciting.</p>

              <p>After <a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-goodbye-email-memo-xbox-microsoft-2000672084">the shock resignation of Phil Spencer and Sarah Bond from Xbox last week</a>, the gaming world is attempting to piece together exactly <a href="https://kotaku.com/thats-it-im-calling-it-xbox-is-dead-time-of-death-february-20-2000672114">what will happen next to Microsoft’s gaming brand</a>, especially under the auspices of new leader Asha Sharma. Why has someone with a background in AI and not gaming been put at the helm? And wait, she said <em>what</em> about birthrates and AI?</p> <p>Big tech’s obsession with birthrate figures is something that should certainly make you feel uncomfortable, given it’s usually about half a step removed from <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/why-are-elon-musk-and-marc-andreesen-obsessed-with-birth-rates/">matters far more sinister</a>. Which is why it’s so disappointing to hear Asha Sharma, in an interview on a podcast from five months ago, saying that the thing she thinks about the most—other than GPUs—is whether her son “will have classmates in the future.” (Thanks <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/samred.com/post/3mfdstcvges2c">Sam Machkovech</a>.) This is because, she says, “fertility rates are declining, the average birthrate in the ’90s when we were growing up was, like, 3, and now it’s 2.3, and in 2050 it’s estimated to be below replacement.” This is strange on its own, and also completely wrong, but her next words make it far weirder. “I think that AI can have such a big effect on it, and already is.”</p>

 <p>Sharma goes on to give examples of this, like how she’s heard about a hospital in London that’s using AI to improve the fertility success rate of IVF, the “amazing story” of how ChatGPT 5 is “helping in healthcare,” and how Stanford was a big customer of hers, using AI for “tumor reviews.”</p>  <p>Of course, the reason for the declining birthrate in the U.S. is multifactorial, but almost certainly primarily about income. In the affluent ’90s, people felt confident about being able to afford two or three children, but in the 2020s that’s a far more costly prospect. If people in big tech were genuinely concerned about the number of children being born, their attention would be wholly focused on <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2026/is-the-us-birth-rate-declining">making American lives more affordable, providing better benefits and support, and increasing wages</a>. And not, say, on replacing workers with ineffectual AI while driving industries that rely on paying low incomes.</p>

 <p>Sharma’s numbers are <em>way</em> off, as it happens. The fertility rate wavered between 1.9 and 2.0 in the 1990s, and hasn’t been close to her claimed 3 since the mid-60s. It dipped as low as 1.6 after steady decline following the financial crash of 2008, but in recent years has begun to recover: it was back up to 1.8 in 2025. So in fact a difference of 0.1 since Sharma’s heyday of baby births.</p>

 <p>But to put everyone’s minds at rest regarding those empty classrooms: As it turns out, we don’t just distribute however many children are around into the current number of classrooms. That would be a weird system. So even if birthrates were to suddenly halve, we’d just have…fewer schools. Am I really explaining this to the head of Xbox?</p>
