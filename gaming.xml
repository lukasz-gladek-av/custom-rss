            <p>Joanna Dark actor Alix Wilton Regan has implored fans to use their voices to save Perfect Dark, after the game was cancelled by Microsoft earlier this week.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Microsoft announced a wave of layoffs across the company, with games such as its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">Perfect Dark reboot, a new Zenimax MMORPG</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Rare's Everwild all cancelled as a result</a>. At this time, Microsoft also shuttered Perfect Dark's studio, The Initiative.</p>

<p>Soon after, Joanna Dark's actor shared an image of her Perfect Dark character on <a href="https://x.com/AlixWiltonRegan/status/1940539481586913465">social media</a>, calling her "Resilient. Determined. Creative. Caring. Strong". Adding that her time working with The Initiative had been "an honour", Regan stated: "Agent Dark doesn't give up and neither should any of you.... like Joanna, we will all rise again."</p>
<p>Regan has now called for fans to "speak up if you wanna see Perfect Dark survive". In a <a href="https://x.com/AlixWiltonRegan/status/1941021209891909790">recent social media post</a>, the Joanna actor wrote that "a lot of people have been reaching out and floating this idea on my timeline, my phone and in my DMs, so I'm just gonna say it:</p>
<p>"I HOPE WE LIVE IN A NICE WORLD."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, actor Elias Toufexis - known for playing Adam Jensen in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> series - says "thousands of dollars" he was expecting will now be lost due to the cancellation of Perfect Dark.</p>
<p>In his own <a href="https://x.com/EliasToufexis/with_replies">post on social media</a>, Toufexis revealed he had "a good amount of days of acting in Perfect Dark" that got "scrapped" when Microsoft put an end to the reboot earlier this week.</p>
<p>"These games getting cancelled is a constant threat," Toufexis wrote, "..now every game I do as director or actor I wake up hoping it isn't cancelled."</p>
<p>In subsequent posts, the actor, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfields-sam-coe-and-andreja-actors-recorded-lines-for-the-player-character">who has also had roles in the likes of Starfield</a>, assured his followers that he does get paid for the days he works. "But when you're working on a game they 'hold' you for x amount of days each month. (so I can schedule work around other games and shows)," Toufexis elaborated.</p>
<p>"You can't help but look at the holds and think about the $ that would have been made."</p>

<p>Word of this week's layoffs at Microsoft - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">also impacted the likes of King, Raven Software and more</a> - first began last month, when a report stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-reportedly-set-for-major-job-cuts-from-next-week">Xbox was set to restructure much of its central-European distribution</a>. At this time, Bloomberg described the then-upcoming redundancies as a "major restructuring", and the fourth case of layoffs to hit Xbox in the last 18 months.</p>
<p>In May, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-laying-off-3-of-workforce-in-biggest-round-of-cuts-since-2023-report">Xbox cut three percent of its total workforce</a>, which at the time was the biggest loss of staff since 2023. Previously in September 2024, Xbox laid off 650 employees, which it said was to "organise our business for long term success".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/joanna-dark-actor-asks-fans-to-call-for-perfect-dark-to-be-saved-as-adam-jensens-actor-details-financial-loss-due-to-cancellation]]></content:encoded>

<p>His appointment "could lead to an interesting future"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Shigeru Miyamoto E3 2015 dolls" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5cadad5db1bad/shigeru-miyamoto-e3-2015-dolls.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Shigeru Miyamoto has spoken about the appointment of Nintendo's newest outside director Kazuhiko Hachiya, director of the Japanese doll company <a href="https://global.petworks.store/">PetWORKS</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking at the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/qa2506e.pdf">85th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders Q&amp;A</a>, Miyamoto addressed a question on the increased number of outside directors "with diverse backgrounds", including Illumination CEO and <strong>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong> co-producer Chris Meledandri and Hachiya-san, who was revealed to be joining as a member of the board <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-appoints-doll-company-executive-as-a-new-outside-director">back in May</a>.</p>
<p>"Mr. Hachiya is a media artist who is active beyond the framework of games, and I have known<br>
him personally for a long time", says Miyamoto, revealing a connection between Hachiya and Nintendo through their relationship.</p>
<p>Miyamoto says he's been "discussing" the backgrounds of all the outside directors with Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa and that the two "have been exploring various possibilities".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Mr. Hachiya engages in unconventional activities, such as researching video games and building his own equipment. We believe that a connection between Mr. Hachiya and our company could lead to an interesting future, which is why we wanted him to join us as an outside director."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Miyamoto's not wrong about Hachiya's background, which we covered briefly back when the artist was appointed. Does Miyamoto's vague answer hint at some art collaboration or Nintendo-themed dolls? Or something beyond that? We probably won't find out for a good while, anyhow.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/convocation_notice2506e.pdf">Convocation Notice of the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders</a> — which is essentially an invite to the annual meeting and details the board members and the agenda — Hachiya is described as having "a wide range of achievements", which include art created by using digital tech and developing an email client.</p>
<div><p>He's also served in multiple key positions at Tokyo University of the Arts, where he is currently a professor in the Department of Intermedia Art and director of the Art Media Center. Nintendo believes that Hachiya will bring valuable experience and be able to supervise "based on his broad experience and insight in the field of art, and as a software developer and business executive".</p><p>

Essentially, we have <em>no</em> idea what this collaboration will bring about, but we're excited to see what Kazuhiko Hachiya can bring to the table.</p></div>
<p><em>Let us know what you think of Hachiya's appointment in the comments</em>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-qa-with-virtuos-i-think-we-will-see-it-surpass-the-predecessor/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-q-a-with-virtuos-%E2%80%98i-think-we-will-see-it-surpass-the-predecessor%E2%80%99.1235988/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been nearly a month since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch</a> of the massively anticipated Nintendo Switch 2 console. As part of our release coverage, we had the chance to interview two developers from game studio <a href="https://www.virtuosgames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Virtuos</a> to discover their initial thoughts and experiences with the latest console to enter the games market.</p>



<p>Virtuos may not be a household name to most of the public, but they have been in the industry for over twenty years, during which they have helped co-develop or port several noteworthy games, such as Heavy Rain, Horizon Zero Dawn, L.A. Noire, Dark Souls Remastered, Astral Chain, Cyberpunk 2077, Outriders, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, Hogwarts Legacy, and most recently The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered and the upcoming Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, to name a few.</p>



<p>Our Nintendo Switch 2 questions were answered by Alex Heise, Director of Business Development at Virtuos North America, and Eoin O’ Grady, Technical Director at Black Shamrock, a Virtuos subsidiary that contributed to Back 4 Blood, Starlink: Battle for Atlas, Grounded, Destroy All Humans!, Kerbal Space Program 2, The Outer Worlds: Spacer's Choice Edition, and Marvel's Midnight Suns.</p>




<figure></figure>




<p><strong>Firstly, Nintendo recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-debuts-with-3-5-million-units-sold-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the Switch 2 sold over 3.5 million units in the first four days, making it the fastest-selling console ever in that timeframe. Were you expecting this level of success? What's your outlook for the console's near future?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Eoin</strong>: Given the phenomenal success of the Switch, expectations for the sales performance of the Switch 2 were already quite high. Nintendo has a huge pool of loyal fans, but alongside that, the handheld gaming market is growing right now — and I'm not talking about smartphones. The original Switch, along with the Steam Deck and other high-quality handheld gaming rigs, has contributed to growth in this area. Gamers increasingly want AAA games on the go, and so I think we will see the Switch 2 surpass its predecessor. This is precisely because it is a Nintendo console, renowned for innovation and its unique gameplay experiences, and because it meets the growing demand for gaming on the go — offering indie gems, Nintendo exclusives, and now AAA blockbuster titles.</p>



<p><strong>Alex</strong>: As the fastest-selling console launch of all time, I don’t think anyone fully predicted this level of success. That said, my expectations were certainly high for a number of reasons. First and foremost, the Switch 2 is the most iterative console Nintendo has launched in quite some time, dating back to the transition from NES to SNES. No Nintendo console has ever had a “2” in its name, and in this case, they made a strategic decision by building on the proven success and strong brand of the original Switch with a similar yet more compelling product. The value of the Switch 2 is immediately clear to gamers, improving upon past console launches such as the Wii U.</p>



<p>Another key factor contributing to the successful launch was effective supply chain management to ensure sufficient units were available. Earlier launches of competing consoles were limited by supply, capping sales and keeping products out of stock for months. Meanwhile, Nintendo clearly prepared well in advance, sourcing new partners and adjusting manufacturing locations to meet the high demand for the Switch 2.</p>



<p><strong>Can you share your thoughts on the new console? What is the most interesting new feature, in your opinion, respectively on the hardware and software side?<br></strong></p>



<p><strong>Alex</strong>: As a day one owner myself, I've been absolutely thrilled with the Switch 2 and have been playing it daily! On the hardware side, the aspect I am most impressed with is something that’s difficult to gauge without hands-on experience — and that’s the build quality. The Switch 2 feels noticeably more premium than its predecessor. One of the most appreciated improvements is the Joy-Cons’ attachment mechanism, which feels much more secure and stable, enhancing the overall durability and user experience. Simply put, among all handheld consoles currently on the market, the Switch 2 offers the best feel in hand.</p>



<p>On the software side, the eShop improvements have been both a pleasant surprise and a delight. The store now loads very quickly and is snappy to navigate. The loading times or delays when cycling across pages are gone. Additionally, the weekly personalized recommendations based on your existing library are fantastic! With so many games released these days, discovery has become a growing challenge for consumers. A curated suggestion list is a great way to address this, especially since consumers are already familiar with similar recommendations on other media platforms such as Spotify and Netflix. Lastly, the ability for trailers and images to autoplay as you scroll through the shop is a notable improvement, effectively drawing attention to games you might have otherwise overlooked. All of these changes excite me both as a developer looking forward to bringing great games to the platform and as a consumer seeking a better shopping experience.</p>



<p><strong>Eoin</strong>: I was happy to see that the new hardware supports DLSS and VRR in handheld mode. Mobile hardware inevitably faces performance constraints, and these features will go a long way towards alleviating those limitations for players. Developers should use them strategically— they can massively enhance the gaming experience, as we have seen with their implementation on other platforms.</p>



<p>The virtual game card is another wonderful addition to the platform. Many of us grew up swapping cartridges and disks—a practice that's dying out as digital downloads become the norm. Virtual game cards make swapping games with friends easier than ever, bringing back that social and nostalgic experience. I am also intrigued by the novel and communal gaming experiences that can be built with the GameShare feature.</p>




<figure></figure>




<p><strong>In terms of raw console performance, do you agree that the Switch 2 is <a href="https://wccftech.com/wild-hearts-s-qa-switch-2-is-closer-to-the-series-s-than-ps4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closer to the Xbox Series S than it is to the PlayStation 4</a>, making it easier for developers to port their current-gen games to the hardware?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Eoin</strong>: GPU-wise, the Switch 2 performs slightly below the Series S; this difference is more noticeable in handheld mode. However, the Series S does not support technologies like DLSS, which the Switch 2 does. This makes the GPU capabilities of the two consoles comparable overall.</p>



<p>CPU-wise, there is a clearer distinction between the two consoles. The Switch 2 is closer to the PlayStation (PS) 4 in this respect, having a CPU just a bit more powerful than the PS4’s. Since most games tend to be more GPU-bound than CPU-bound when well optimized, the impact of this difference largely depends on the specific game and its target frame rate. Any game shipping at 60 FPS on the Series S should easily port to the Switch 2. Likewise, a 30 FPS Series S game that’s GPU-bound should also port well. Games with complex physics, animations, or other CPU-intensive elements might incur additional challenges in reaching 30 or 60 FPS or require extra optimization during porting.</p>



<p><strong>One of the most discussed hardware features ahead of launch is the support of NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, currently the gold standard when it comes to upscaling technology. However, not many Switch 2 launch games are taking advantage of it. Why do you think that's the case? Would you recommend that developers use it?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Eoin</strong>: I think there are two main factors influencing whether DLSS is used in launch titles. The first being, is it even necessary? For games like Mario Kart World or the upcoming Donkey Kong Bananza, which feature stylized cartoon-like aesthetics, DLSS may not be needed. Mario Kart, for instance, was in development for many years with the original Switch in mind. Games like these aren’t trying to push graphical fidelity; they have different goals for their art content and tend to hit 60 FPS without relying on DLSS.</p>



<p>For third-party games, it’s worth noting that Cyberpunk 2077 has <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shipped</a> with DLSS. Compared with the Xbox Series S and PS4 versions, DLSS evidently offers better upscaling technology, making a strong case for developers to implement it. More importantly, there are also other games that could benefit from DLSS, but don’t currently utilize it—that often comes down to how these titles are being ported. It is not as simple as taking the PC DirectX implementation of DLSS and running it on the Switch. Instead, DLSS has to be integrated through Nintendo’s NVN2 graphics API, and the extra work required for this might have been deferred by some developers for their initial ports.</p>



<p><strong>Similarly, the Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supports</a> hardware-accelerated ray tracing, but barely any games are using it. Does it even make sense, or should hardware resources be focused elsewhere?<br></strong></p>



<p><strong>Eoin</strong>: Hardware ray tracing is a widely discussed feature in this generation of consoles. The Xbox Series X and PS5 support it for lighting, but maintaining stable frame rates can be challenging. Epic’s Lumen offers support for software ray tracing on the GPU as a lighter option for a lighting solution, although with Unreal Engine 5.6, focus is shifting toward further optimization of hardware ray tracing capabilities.</p>



<p>On the Series S, hardware ray tracing for lighting has not been widely pursued as an option. That is noteworthy as the Switch 2 has less ray tracing power than the Series S, and DLSS may not significantly close that gap. Beyond lighting, however, hardware ray tracing continues to be widely used across all platforms for reflections and shadows. This is where I see the most potential for the Switch 2, as it has sufficient power to deliver high-quality shadows and reflections at reasonable resolutions and frame rates.</p>




<figure></figure>




<p><strong>In your Switch 2 brief, you mentioned that the console's expanded controller features are what really set it apart. Can you discuss them and how developers should leverage them in their games?<br></strong></p>



<p><strong>Eoin</strong>: Nintendo’s innovation with its controllers continues to amaze us all. There is no other platform where the controller doubles as a motion-tracking device, a gyroscope, two smaller controllers, and now, in its latest iteration, a mouse—or more accurately, two of them. A common mistake some developers make is approaching this unique set of hardware like an ordinary game controller. If a game is ported to function like it does on any other controller, we will miss out on the fun that comes from leveraging the Switch 2’s unique features.</p>



<p>Every first-person shooter should make use of the mouse feature; motion tracking should be integrated wherever it enhances gameplay, and support for the two mini controllers should be standard in every multiplayer game. Beyond that, developers should be acutely aware of how the stick layout and controller ergonomics affect sensitivity and precision. Thorough testing and iteration to find the best user experience is a must.</p>



<p><strong>Do you think GameChat will be a game-changer when it comes to social engagement in the Nintendo Switch 2 scene?</strong><br></p>



<p><strong>Alex</strong>: GameChat represents a significant step toward enhancing the social experience on the Switch 2. It provides a more controlled and secure environment locked to the Nintendo platform, which is especially valuable for younger players and their parents. Features like seeing what your friends are playing and being able to quickly join them are essential elements of the modern social gaming ecosystem, and Nintendo has made this intuitive and simple.<br>While it builds upon the trend established by third-party social platforms like Discord, GameChat integrates these social capabilities directly within the console experience. The addition of in-game video is fun and engaging, though it does require a camera setup, which might be a barrier for some gamers. Overall, while widespread adoption remains to be seen, it is undoubtedly a valuable feature that offers a seamless way for players to connect with friends.<br></p>



<p><strong>Eoin</strong>: GameChat has multiple layers of appeal. Firstly, I think it’s an absolute win for people who enjoy co-op games, and games in that genre will be enormously enhanced. The social element is very interesting and will undoubtedly be a hit with both players who love to stream as they play and those who enjoy watching. At the moment, this feature is limited to users on the platform and those on your friends list. To become an even bigger game changer, it could integrate with existing game streaming platforms such as Twitch or YouTube. That step is one that only Nintendo can take, and if paired with some great games, it could really transform social engagement within the gaming community.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

And sometime later, they got a notification that a structure they built had helped someone and received some likes. </p><p>I know this because it happened to me many times while playing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-how-long-to-beat-sequel-story-hltb-1851785232&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-how-long-to-beat-sequel-story-hltb-1851785232"><em>Death Stranding 2</em></a></span>, which is both a video game from Hideo Kojima and the world’s first totally good and not bad social network. </p><h2 id="h284"><a id=""></a>The Likes Economy Of <em>Death Stranding 2</em></h2><p><em>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</em> launched last month to mostly positive reviews. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-review-is-it-good-ps5-playstation-5-1851784852&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-review-is-it-good-ps5-playstation-5-1851784852">I personally enjoyed this very strange open-world post-apocalyptic cargo delivery simulator starring Norman Reedus</a></span>, even if I found the ending not very satisfying. But while <em>Death Stranding 2</em> is a game obsessed with delivering packages, connecting in-game NPCs to a larger network, and saving the world, it is also a strange multiplayer experience. </p><p>To be clear: You never meet other players directly while playing, but you can see what they build, interact with their creations, and even leave behind holographic signs, structures, and supplies. And all of this—including the mushrooms that grow from the ground when players all pee in the same spot—can be “liked” in-game as if they are pieces of content on your phone’s timeline. </p><p>This is a big part of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-vehicles-ziplines-pcc-dhv-magellan-1851785247&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-vehicles-ziplines-pcc-dhv-magellan-1851785247"><em>Death Stranding 2</em></a></span> that you can technically ignore. But good luck doing that. There is something deeply satisfying and rewarding about building a shelter or a funny sign and getting hundreds of likes for your effort. It creates this “Likes economy” where players work hard to “go viral.” However, to go viral in<em> Death Stranding 2 </em>means you have done something super helpful. </p><p>Unlike actual social media networks like Facebook or TikTok, the only way to go viral and get thousands of likes is by being a good, helpful person. If you place a ladder against a cliff and it leads to nothing, it’s likely that nobody will use it or like it. It will be buried under better, more helpful creations. And you can’t even dislike anything, either. You just have to ignore it. </p><h2 id="h285"><a id=""></a>Helpful Spam And No Racism</h2><p>This “likes economy” does lead to many of <em>Death Stranding 2</em>'s hubs and in-game shelters being surrounded by what amounts to spam. If you’ve played for even a few hours, you’ve likely experienced this when driving into a delivery centre and encountering the dozens of holographic signs that dot the pathway. Or you see that people have left guns, ammo, or healing items outside doorways, cluttering up the space in their efforts to win some likes. </p><figure id="" data-id="6ee6d466a5b07e273d1f8a92af8c8f93" data-recommend-id="image://6ee6d466a5b07e273d1f8a92af8c8f93" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kojima Productions / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6ee6d466a5b07e273d1f8a92af8c8f93" data-recommend-id="image://6ee6d466a5b07e273d1f8a92af8c8f93" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But while this spam is sometimes a bit annoying, it never feels mean spirited or shitty. It’s just a lot of people trying to be helpful all at once in one singular location.</p><p>Compare that to the shit you likely see every single day on social media in the real world, and it’s clear which is better. And as a bonus, <em>Death Stranding 2</em> doesn’t let you leave text notes or voice messages in the world. No racist garbage or awful slurs are sprinkled around. It’s just people working together to make the world of <em>Death Stranding 2</em> a better, easier place. It’s a social network that rewards kindness, empathy, care, and hope. And in 2025, we all need more of that. </p><p>I’m not foolish enough to believe <em>Death Stranding 2</em>'s social network-like features will replace Twitter or Facebook. Nor do I think it will change the world. But it does provide something I thought impossible: A social network that doesn’t make me angry and sad every time I use it. And that’s something, at least. </p><p> .</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-social-network-good-likes-1851785636]]></content:encoded>

IGN has contacted Microsoft for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Turn 10 Studios' original Forza Motorsport launched for the OG Xbox in 2005, and established the series as one of Microsoft's core gaming brands, as well as a serious rival to PlayStation's Gran Turismo.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">A developer who worked on Microsoft's now-cancelled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled">Perfect Dark reboot</a> has addressed the claim that last year's gameplay demo was "fake," and said the glimpse was a vertical slice of the project running "in-engine."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perfect Dark was one of several projects canned by Microsoft this week as part of the company's latest devastating cuts to Xbox staff and games. Developed by The Initiative, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-and-xbox-developer-the-initiative-closed-as-part-of-devastating-microsoft-layoffs">a studio Microsoft is now shutting down</a>, alongside Tomb Raider studio Crystal Dynamics, Perfect Dark had rarely been glimpsed since its initial <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-perfect-dark-announced-from-the-initiative">announcement back in 2020</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That all changed last year when a "gameplay reveal" video aired as part of the Xbox Games Showcase in June 2024. And it's this video that has since sparked questions over how much of what it shows corresponds to actual, working game systems. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, Kotaku writer Ethan Gach <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lsypye2edk2v" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a> on social media that he had been told last year's demo had been "basically fake." The question of the gameplay demo's legitimacy was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adammcdlt.bsky.social/post/3lt23bz2dwk2z" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discussed</a> in more detail by former Perfect Dark developer Adam McDonald, who now works as a senior game designer at Cuphead maker Studio MDHR.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It is actually in-engine," McDonald said. "I was one of three level designers that worked on it. It worked best if you played it the way the person playing in the video plays it, but it still worked even if you didn't hit the marks perfectly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There's some fake stuff in it," he continued, "and the real gameplay systems shown off worked juuust enough to look good in this video. We were rapidly making real design decisions so as to not knowingly lie to players about what the game will be. The parkour is all real, the hacking/deception is mostly real.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The combat is 'real' in that someone had to really do all that stuff in the video, but it's set up to be played exactly that way and didn't play well if you played it a different way."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Perfect Dark Reboot Gameplay Reveal Screenshots - Xbox Games Showcase 2024</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What McDonald is saying then, is that there's nuance here. Like many vertical slices meant to showcase a project that's still in development, it was made to work just enough, and to give a sense of how the final game would have appeared, had the project survived until launch. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">McDonald's suggestion here seems to be that the team behind it intended to show something that gave as accurate a sense of what Perfect Dark would be as was possible. That said, some elements clearly still sound like they were a work-in-progress, even if they were meant to be representative.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm seeing big controversy over 'THIS WHOLE THING WAS FAKE' and it's annoying me, so I wanted to say something," McDonald concluded. Then, in a reply to another user, McDonald said "it was a pretty typical vertical slice" and "I don't think we were particularly deceptive with it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He added: "It's probably more real than you think. We were figuring stuff out on the fly in time to include it in the demo, doing our best not to 'lie' to players. There's some fakery but quite a lot of it was legit."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After the cancellation of Perfect Dark, Rare's long-awaited Everwild, an MMO from Bethesda's The Older Scrolls Online team and cuts to other projects, it's believed that every game featured at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-2025-everything-announced">the Xbox Games Showcase presentation in June</a> this year will continue on.

With abundant events awaiting, Proxies can delve deeper into the coastal mysteries beneath the waves and embrace an extraordinary summer filled with friendship and adventure.</p><p>In Version 2.1, Proxies can explore two exciting new additions: Sailume Bay and Fantasy Resort. Nestled beneath the cliffs of Failume Heights, Sailume Bay will become the central stage for Chapter 2’s story. Here, Porcelumex will launch a comprehensive safety investigation to resolve conflicts stemming from the chaos caused by the Exaltists. The high-profile investigation team includes Alice Thymefield, descendant of the esteemed Thymefield family, who will later join the Spook Shack. Meanwhile, the summer story unfolds at Fantasy Resort, featuring sandy beaches, coconut trees swaying in the breeze, and a vibrant holiday atmosphere perfect for summer activities and mysterious stories.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_977737"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Two remarkable allies from the Spook Shack will join the roster. Ukinami Yuzuha is a shrewd S-Rank Physical Support Agent who deploys her tanuki companion Kama to throw candy bombs at enemies, empowering on-field attackers to accumulate Anomaly Buildup more easily. Her signature Sweet Scare ability adapts to the active agent’s attribute via Flavor Match, significantly boosting the Anomaly Buildup efficiency while simultaneously triggering Aftershock attacks. Alice Thymefield, the newest member of Spook Shack, is an S-Rank Physical Anomaly Agent. As a noble heiress, she utilizes her refined swordsmanship techniques to maneuver on the battlefield and accumulate Blade Etiquette. By consuming Blade Etiquette, Alice can unleash powerful strikes, amplifying Assault and Disorder damage. Meanwhile, Miss Esme, a graceful S-Rank Bangboo, soars alongside agents while generating beneficial effects that replenish Energy or HP. Additionally, the Void Hunter Miyabi (S-Rank Frost Anomaly) and Yanagi (S-Rank Electric Anomaly) will rerun on the Version 2.1 banners.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The once-pristine Fantasy Resort now stands as a fading paradise awaiting restoration, and Proxies will partner with the Spook Shack to revive the resort through a series of aquatic activities and attractions. Proxies can enjoy the thrills of surfing by navigating obstacles with power-ups, or board yachts and embark on exciting sea shooting challenges amidst scenic island tours. New fishing spots await our experienced anglers, featuring fresh new species and optimized interactions with reduced grinding for a more relaxed yet diverse gameplay. Besides the summer activities, stylish outfits that fit the summer vibes will be available for Yuzuha, Alice, and the protagonists. In addition, a new Bangboo Auto Battler event, “En-Nah” Chess Legend, will be introduced with a PVP mode, and the Simulated Battle Trial will be refreshed with a new scoring system that rewards combat technique mastery for challenging combat enthusiasts.</p></blockquote><p><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,860 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,500 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [23,623 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/zenless-zone-zero-c7c151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/zenless-zone-zero/id1606356401" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.Nap&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers and the version 2.1 special program below.

Destiny: Rising, the free-to-play mobile version of Bungie's long-running sci-fi shooter series, has been given a release date. It'll officially be whisking players away for some alternate-timeline shenanigans when it comes to Android and iOS on 28th August.
</p>
<p>
Announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-and-neteast-unveil-free-to-play-mobile-shooter-destiny-rising-with-closed-alpha-coming-soon">last October</a>, Destiny: Rising is a collaboration between Bungie and Chinese publisher NetEase, and is officially described as a "shared world" adventure set in an "alternate Destiny timeline, exploring a narrative in the post-Dark Age era". It's a result of a partnership the two companies <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-moves-to-reassure-destiny-fans-after-securing-usd100m-for-new-game">initially announced</a> - albeit in vague terms - back in 2018.
</p>
<p>
After a period of closed alpha testing that began last November, Destiny: Rising is almost ready for its full launch, which'll see players - in the role of a "fully customisable" Lightbearer named Wolf - embarking on a sci-fi adventure stretching from the sanctuary of Haven to the "icy, ancient metro of Jiangshi, and the arid expanse of the Red Sea Rift."

<p>
Destiny's familiar looter-shooter action is said to remain at the heart of the experience, and there's talk of "dynamic and challenging" single-player, co-op, and competitive multiplayer gameplay, plus various open-world objectives, missions, strikes, PvP battles, and six-player PvE activities. That's alongside customisable Primary and Power Weapons, the ability for characters to share compatible weapons across their arsenal, a new Mythic rarity gear tier, and more.
</p>
<p>
In a bid to encourage pre-registrations ahead of Destiny: Rising's 28th August release, NetEase is holding a pre-launch event that'll provide special in-game bonuses to anyone that registers their interest ahead of time. More rewards unlock as new registration milestones are crossed, and if that sounds like the sort of thing you want to support, you should direct your attention to <a href="https://destiny.onelink.me/pHa5/c6f53fla">Google Play</a> or the <a href="https://destiny.onelink.me/pHa5/kxdnllj3">App Store</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for Daddy Destiny (or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>, if you must), Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2s-getting-two-paid-expansions-this-year-and-one-of-them-is-star-wars-themed">recently announced its next major multi-year story arc</a>, the Fate Saga. It begins with a new paid expansion, titled The Edge of Fate, that arrives on 15th July alongside a free "core game update" for all players. Weirder is this year's second paid expansion, Renegades, which launches on 2nd December and promises to be "integral" to Destiny 2's new Fate Saga, despite its Star Wars theme.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>While the Switch 2 is dominating headlines around the world, it’s easy to forget the little guys. There’s plenty handhelds that are out there making people’s lives better without all the pomp and grandeur. Enter the Miyoo Flip, a retro handheld designed for emulation that takes some clear inspiration from one of Nintendo’s most iconic handhelds, the Game Boy Advance SP.</p>
<p>This clamshell device brings all the nostalgia to the yard. Picking it up had me reminiscing for days about my red Game Boy Advance SP with Groudon carefully embossed on the cover, and the days I spent playing Pokemon Ruby, Advance Wars and Fire Emblem. The Miyoo Flip feels like the original device, and given that the SP is arguably still one of the best handheld designs we’ve ever had, that’s a very good thing.</p>

<p>Measuring just over 8cm in either direction and 2.5cm thick when folded shut, it’s genuinely pocketable, though there’s also a very lovely hardshell case in the box that makes it a bit too chunky for your pocket. It easily fits in your bag though, and you don’t have to worry about it getting damaged at all. It’s so small compared to modern handheld PCs and consoles that you don’t need to think too hard about taking it everywhere with you, and our review unit has already been around the world a bunch of times with me without any hassle.</p>
<p>There’s a variety of different colours available, with our review unit arriving in a truly retro black and red livery. It looks like the contents of every kids’ bedroom in the 80s and early 90s, and the lighter plastics used make it feel pretty authentic to the period as well. It doesn’t feel premium, but when it’s priced around £70 you’re probably not expecting it too. What it does feel like is an authentic reimagining of a classic form factor.</p>

<p>It is equipped for more than just Game Boy games though, and the Rockchip RK3566 chipset and the central controls of a D-pad, four face buttons, four shoulder buttons and two inset analogue sticks at the bottom, make it ideal for emulation up to, and including, N64, Dreamcast, PSP and PlayStation.</p>

<p>They’re not the best analogue sticks in the world; not in terms of their actual functionality, but because they’re pretty deeply inset to allow the clamshell to close. They also sit at the foot of the device, which can become pretty tiring for your hands, depending on how you’re holding the Flip. It’s nice to have them though, and they do work well, but I’ve found myself mostly gravitating to the excellent-feeling D-pad, and the console generations that still focused their efforts on them.</p>
<p>Overall comfort is, however, very good. The light plastics make this an easy device to hold for long periods of time, and I do find that I prefer the narrow profile of systems like the Miyoo Flip, Trimui Brick or the classic Game Boy systems, when it’s a smaller device. If you liked the form factor of the Game Boy Advance SP, then.. this is pretty much the same.</p>
<p>The screen is a 3.5mm IPS LCD display with a 640×480 resolution, and it’s bright and colourful with plenty of clarity and decent viewing angles. It’s not ultra-high resolution, but the 4:3 scale means that this is a great device for playing classic titles, whether revisiting favourites like Super Mario World or Guardian Heroes, or checking out titles you haven’t found time to pull out of the cupboard in years. It does mean that PSP games suffer though, with large black bars above and below the wider aspect output. That’s a shame with a system that can readily play the games, but an easy concession given the form factor.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, this is the perfect device for revisiting your Game Boy Advance library. Given that it has to be one of my all-time favourite handhelds, that’s a huge benefit, and with the cannily crafted form factor, the Miyoo Flip is a pure shot of nostalgia. No, it’s not a perfect integer scaled resolution for the GBA, but it’s more than good enough to enjoy these games.</p>
<p>Miyoo included both the original and the revised operating software during our review period, and the updated OS made interacting with the Flip just that much easier. It’s simple, clear and straightforward, and while it is more stripped back than some offerings, it runs flawlessly, though I’m pretty certain I’ve heard that background music before. You do also have the option of running EmulationStation if that’s your preferred launcher, and you can opt for a range of its glitzier frontends if you prefer, though it may take a bit more tinkering to get everything working.</p>
<p>There’s a few handy quality of life inclusions here, not least the appearance of a Mini-HDMI out, a second USB-C socket for attaching a wired controller and two Micro SD card slots for adding even more storage. Thanks to that, this is a tiny device that’s capable of holding pretty much every game made up until 2000 and playing them, and that’s pretty special.</p>

<p>Some early builds of the Miyoo Flip were criticised for the build quality of the hinge, but in this V2 iteration it feels rock solid, unleashing a satisfying and solid click every time you open it, and moving through the three different viewing angles. Beyond that, the 3,000 mAh battery is suitable, if not stellar, and you’re going to get a good five to seven hours out of it depending on the games you’re emulating.</p>
<p>You are paying a slight premium for this form factor, with some serious competition from the standard Game Boy-evoking Trimui Brick that certainly feels more solid in your hand, but doesn’t have any analogue sticks, despite having similar processing power to the Miyoo Flip. The overall experience is much slicker with the Flip than budget retro handhelds like the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/17/boyhom-r36h-handheld-console-review-retro-gaming-on-a-budget/">Boyhom R36H</a>, but it should be when the Flip costs twice as much.</p>

Now, in 2025, we’ve had two new MCU films — <em>Captain America: Brave New World</em> and <em>Thunderbolts*</em> — that were either critically panned and commercially disappointing, or critically loved yet struggling to make MCU-sized returns. Marvel is in a bit of crisis mode.</p><p>Its movies are no longer the safest bet in Hollywood. The Disney+ shows have started to feel more like homework than appointment television, even for the biggest MCU fans. From where I’m sitting, after being a critic for over fourteen years and a lifelong comic book reader, the issues Marvel Studios is going through are mistakes that Marvel Comics has also made over the last few decades. There’s much .Marvel has done over the decades that are genius and have helped the comic book industry. But the company has also put its comic book arm in peril just as many times.</p><p>The MCU completely redefined not only superhero movies but the idea of movie franchises. All that success made Marvel Studios too comfortable with the audience, even after other studios had failed in their attempts to copy them. Why is it, then, that audiences have been disappointed? Why have the movies this year not been hitting the highs they used to? Why does each show seem like a shooting star that disappears from the cultural conversation almost the instant it airs?</p><p>Here, I’m going to diagnose some of the symptoms that have led the MCU to its current struggle era — and ways it can return to its glory days.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="73e0101575dab3fcc977a46f31b1c6cf" data-recommend-id="image://73e0101575dab3fcc977a46f31b1c6cf" data-format="webp" data-width="800" data-height="412" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Marvel's Phase Five" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Marvel's Phase Five" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="73e0101575dab3fcc977a46f31b1c6cf" data-recommend-id="image://73e0101575dab3fcc977a46f31b1c6cf" data-format="webp" data-width="800" data-height="412" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Marvel's Phase Five" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This is one you’ll hear the most. Many people felt <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> was a perfect conclusion to the saga that had been told, yet they remained interested in the MCU. Marvel Comics has a history of this pattern. When they hit big with the audience and have a strong group of creators producing stories that resonate, Marvel tended to try squeezing more out of the moment than they should. They flood the shelves with more titles and miniseries, and suddenly every character has their own comic.</p><p> When I bought the <em>Civil War</em> event, I decided to purchase every single tie-in title. By the end, it added up to 100 issues—and realistically, only the <em>Captain America</em> issues mattered to the main story. Even recently, with the <em>Blood Hunt</em> event, there were a ton of extra miniseries that felt completely unnecessary once you read the main comic. These moments made me want to read Marvel less because it felt like the company didn’t care as much and was just exploiting my love for the Marvel Universe.</p><p> After <em>Avengers: Endgame</em> briefly became the highest-grossing film of all time, not even a global pandemic could stop Marvel Studios from flooring the gas pedal. In 2021, they significantly ramped up output: four Disney+ shows and four theatrical films in a single year. Every quarter, there were two concurrent Marvel projects demanding attention. Villains and lesser-known Avengers got shows and films, while brand-new characters were introduced to replicate the <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> surprise. But aside from Spider-Man—who’s a cheat code, honestly—and Doctor Strange, most of those new additions didn’t stick. They ended up confusing and exhausting audiences. Feige and his Parliament seemed to ignore Marvel’s publishing history in their “research.” They repeated a mistake the company knows all too well: burnout. </p><p> Their slowdown in 2024, with fewer projects, feels like a step in the right direction. Still, they could’ve done a better job connecting more grounded films like <em>Captain America: Brave New World</em> and <em>Thunderbolts</em> to shows like <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em> and <em>Ironheart</em>. Only time will tell if a leaner Marvel output leads to the higher-quality releases fans deserve. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="adefae441fff10e9524aab9db7c8f75f" data-recommend-id="image://adefae441fff10e9524aab9db7c8f75f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1201" data-height="503" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hulk explaining something" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hulk explaining something" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="adefae441fff10e9524aab9db7c8f75f" data-recommend-id="image://adefae441fff10e9524aab9db7c8f75f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1201" data-height="503" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hulk explaining something" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Why did it take so long for Black Widow to get her movie? With a star like Scarlett Johansson, who’s been with the MCU since Iron Man 2, you’d think she’d earn her movie before the big Thanos throwdown. For some reason, it came out after the character was dead. Then they didn’t even put it in theaters. I know Hawkeye might not be a marquee name, but he was an Avenger, and his story got demoted to just a TV show. For some reason, Sam Wilson becoming Captain America—with the Winter Soldier as his partner—was also a show. <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em> should have definitely been a movie instead of a television series. Fans know these characters just as well as they did Black Widow and could’ve brought in an audience at an important time for starting a new story.</p><p>Now, here’s the thing: I like Shang-Chi—he’s the master of Kung Fu. The Eternals are deep-cut characters and would’ve been a good counter to that planned DC <em>New Gods</em> film, battling big Jack Kirby ideas against each other. Why couldn’t they crack an <em>Armor Wars</em> movie with Don Cheadle’s James Rhodes, especially with an Academy Award and Emmy nominations on his résumé? What’s the deal with Hulk, and how come he’s yet to have another movie—instead of Anthony Mackie’s Cap getting shoehorned into a Hulk story?</p><p>Marvel should use the names people know to draw them to theaters.  Charlie Cox’s Daredevil showing up in <em>No Way Home</em> and <em>She-Hulk: Attorney At Law</em> made the interconnected universe feel fun. <em>Ghost Rider</em> needs to get a second chance, perhaps with the Robbie Reyes version from the comics to attract some of <em>Fast and Furious</em> fans A muscle car with wheels on fire is an attractive visual. While they’ve also let that <em>Nova Corps</em> setup from a decade ago atrophy, they should still build new heroes while also building upon what the larger fanbase already knows. That can help generate excitement.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f9bdb7df4b73595a0ff4f9e1429ed7e5" data-recommend-id="image://f9bdb7df4b73595a0ff4f9e1429ed7e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="676" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aliens arriving" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aliens arriving" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f9bdb7df4b73595a0ff4f9e1429ed7e5" data-recommend-id="image://f9bdb7df4b73595a0ff4f9e1429ed7e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="676" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aliens arriving" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The multiverse angle hasn’t worked as well as Marvel had hoped. While it was an interesting setup for Spider-Man and Doctor Strange, building the entire second MCU saga around alternate versions of familiar characters—or ones from previous adaptations—hasn’t connected with audiences as expected. Seeing Tom Holland’s Spidey meet past Spider-Men and fight their villains, almost forming an MCU version of the Sinister Six, was thrilling. Doctor Strange traveling through realities worked, too. But Marvel’s push toward the 2015 <em>Secret Wars </em>comics<em>&nbsp;</em>concept, with multiple versions of the same characters clashing, feels clunky. A better move would’ve been adapting the original ’80s <em>Secret Wars</em>, with a godlike being like Doom forcing heroes and villains to fight on Battleworld—a much simpler, more engaging concept. WWE has done this every year with Survivor Series. It’s not hard to grasp.</p><p>When they announced a <em>Secret Invasion</em> show, I thought that story would’ve made a stronger backbone for a new three-phase saga right after <em>Endgame</em>. In the comics, massive universe-changing events are often followed by more grounded, Earth-based threats—or cosmic stories that only affect a few heroes. After <em>Civil War</em>, we got <em>World War Hulk</em>, which pitted Hulk against the Illuminati during a fractured time for superheroes. Then came <em>Original Sin</em>, a murder mystery that helped bridge to <em>Infinity</em>, <em>AXIS</em>, and finally <em>Secret Wars</em> 2015. Even if those stories weren’t all perfect, they gave readers breathing room and kept the stakes personal and digestible.</p><p>Marvel could have taken a similar approach with the Skrulls—seeding them in shows and movies for years before building to a full-scale takeover. That would’ve been <em>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</em> on a superhero scale—not the misfire of a show we got.</p><p>Other events like <em>Acts of Vengeance</em>, <em>The Kree/Skrull War</em>, <em>Shadowland</em>, or even newer stories like <em>Blood Hunt</em> could’ve worked like the original Avengers films did. Each phase would carry a thematic thread across films and series, with big Avengers team-ups as satisfying payoffs. It’s baffling that Marvel drifted from the very formula that made it so successful.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="de091b399fd12bd4a5b3cd0964827947" data-recommend-id="image://de091b399fd12bd4a5b3cd0964827947" data-format="jpg" data-width="900" data-height="525" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Villains coming together" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Villains coming together" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="de091b399fd12bd4a5b3cd0964827947" data-recommend-id="image://de091b399fd12bd4a5b3cd0964827947" data-format="jpg" data-width="900" data-height="525" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Villains coming together" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Why was Red Skull only used in one movie? He’s a Nazi—basically a bad guy cheat code perfect for recurring use. No Masters of Evil. No Fin Fang Foom, despite the popularity of Godzilla-style movies. They turned MODOK into a badly rendered joke in <em>Quantumania</em>. Where was Thor’s classic villainess, The Enchantress? She could’ve spanned movies and shows and made a better long-term threat than Valentina Allegra de Fontaine trying to be a darker, quippier Nick Fury.</p><p>Why not adapt <em>The Korvac Saga</em>? It could’ve followed a fractured Avengers team dealing with the fallout of the Blip and the loss of Tony, Cap, and Natasha. Watching the team disassemble after failing against Korvac would’ve explained their six-year absence better than just ignoring them.</p><p>One of the MCU’s biggest issues is how it softens or discards its villains. Zemo, for example, was right about super soldiers and the Avengers’ collateral damage. He’s not a villain anymore, just an anti-hero. Gone are the villains who want to rule the world or rob a bank. Instead, they make these characters so sympathetic that audiences often side with them more than the heroes. Marvel seems more invested in their villains than their leads.</p><p>I get making villains complex, but Marvel often goes too far, or just turns its heroes into the villains. Wanda’s destruction in <em>Multiverse of Madness</em> doesn’t feel earned if we’re still meant to root for her. Gorr in <em>Love and Thunder</em> was a terrible adaptation; it’s hard to argue with him given how useless the MCU’s gods are. Dar-Benn in <em>The Marvels</em> responds to Captain Marvel bombing her home world. The Leader in <em>Brave New World</em> is portrayed more like a suppressed genius than a threat. And <em>Thunderbolts*</em> is about helping a hero through depression.</p><p>When Marvel does give us a true villain, like The High Evolutionary in <em>Guardians Vol. 3, </em>it works. He’s evil, cruel, and compelling. That’s the direction they need. <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em>’s Kingpin brings that old menace back. Same with Loki at his best. Let’s see more villains like that—the kind that made Marvel worth watching in the first place.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="00a6dda932e73a567e3c5e9b4a644f3d" data-recommend-id="image://00a6dda932e73a567e3c5e9b4a644f3d" data-format="jpg" data-width="2554" data-height="1906" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kang and Doom fighting" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kang and Doom fighting" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="00a6dda932e73a567e3c5e9b4a644f3d" data-recommend-id="image://00a6dda932e73a567e3c5e9b4a644f3d" data-format="jpg" data-width="2554" data-height="1906" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kang and Doom fighting" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Kang is a classic Marvel supervillain, but Kang is confusing. Even diehard Marvel Comics fans struggle to explain him. Beyond everything with Jonathan Majors and Marvel’s decision not to recast, it says a lot that the character didn’t resonate. Who or what is Kang? How do you explain Nathaniel Richards and his ties to Reed Richards and Doctor Doom without using either character—or even acknowledging they exist? And then you have him lose to Ant-Man. ANT-MAN!</p><p>Compare that to how Thanos was built up: introduced as Loki’s superior, intimidating enough to boss around Ronan the Accuser, and then finally unleashed in <em>Infinity War</em>. It worked.</p><p>I’ve read tons of comics but never ran into Kang until <em>Avengers: Forever</em>, where Avengers from different eras united to stop him and other Kangs. It was good, but I had to research just to fully understand it. The more you deal with Kang, the more research you need. Time travel villains don’t have to be confusing, but Kang often is. He’s mostly an Avengers foe, and not a Marvel-wide threat like Thanos. There were other cosmic-level villains to choose from, yet Marvel picked one of the hardest to adapt.</p><p>Maybe they planned to hint at his connections—like being Rama-Tut in ancient Egypt or using Doom’s time platform to link him to <em>Fantastic Four</em>. But instead, we got a post-credit scene of the Council of Kangs—just multiple Jonathan Majors in bad makeup. His MCU debut was shaky too: <em>He Who Remains</em> beating other Kangs to control the timeline isn’t a strong hook. Try explaining <em>Loki</em> season one and how it ties into <em>Quantumania</em> without sounding unhinged. Thanos just needed magic rocks. Simple.</p><p>Maybe Kang should’ve been a one-off like Red Skull. Instead, they introduced him in two quirky projects and had him fight Scott Lang and his ants. Then he loses, shows up in <em>Loki</em> with a goofy haircut, and gets evaporated. He had a strong first appearance, but Marvel didn’t know what to do with him. Turning him into the core of the Multiverse Saga was likely the big mistake.</p><p>Secret Wars has always been about Doom—not Kang.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0bdadb872215a0c93f8bc3706f1f3f88" data-recommend-id="image://0bdadb872215a0c93f8bc3706f1f3f88" data-format="jpg" data-width="1983" data-height="1003" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Avengers joined together" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Avengers joined together" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0bdadb872215a0c93f8bc3706f1f3f88" data-recommend-id="image://0bdadb872215a0c93f8bc3706f1f3f88" data-format="jpg" data-width="1983" data-height="1003" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Avengers joined together" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>What I don’t care for is how the MCU has turned The Avengers into a brand instead of a consistent presence. Because of the films’ box office success, Marvel now treats the team like a summer comic book event—something you “build up to.” In comics, both Marvel and DC have always had tentpole summer crossovers—<em>House of M</em>, <em>Civil War</em>, and <em>Secret Invasion</em> from Marvel; <em>Identity Crisis</em>, <em>Infinite Crisis</em>, and <em>52</em> from DC. These events bring together a wide cast of heroes, spark tie-in stories, and launch new characters. But between those events, The Avengers, X-Men, Fantastic Four<em>&nbsp;</em>are always around.</p><p>In the MCU, though, there’s been no proper team in action until <em>Thunderbolts*</em> and the upcoming <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em>. And that long wait just feels unnecessary.</p><p>One of the charming things about The Avengers in the comics is that the roster was often oddball: a couple of scrubs and one star. Within six issues, you had “Cap’s Kooky Quartet”—Captain America, Hawkeye, Quicksilver, and Scarlet Witch. No Hulk, Thor, or Iron Man. That model worked, and it still would today. Wouldn’t it be interesting to see a team of Shang-Chi, Wong, Sam Wilson and the new Falcon, and She-Hulk trying to help people? And maybe they’re not doing great at it.</p><p>Now that the Netflix characters are canon, was <em>The Defenders</em> ever referenced again? Did they team back up? Was it on the news? The MCU also keeps teasing Young Avengers or Champions, but won’t commit. These characters show up in cameos or secret side roles, but never truly form a team. Why not just pull the trigger and let them grow across projects?</p><p>This approach makes fans feel strung along. Instead of building real momentum or emotional investment, Marvel just keeps hinting at what’s next—without giving us the actual teams that made the comics worth coming back to every month.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b2621b6628572e96a20347225a54eb13" data-recommend-id="image://b2621b6628572e96a20347225a54eb13" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="804" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man looking bewildered" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A man looking bewildered" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b2621b6628572e96a20347225a54eb13" data-recommend-id="image://b2621b6628572e96a20347225a54eb13" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="804" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man looking bewildered" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Go all the way back to Phase One, and you see how each post-credit scene pushed the larger narrative leading to The Avengers. The end of <em>Captain America: The First Avenger</em> is directly followed by a post-credits scene, which is actually a scene from the film. This continued into Phase Two, and it felt like even if the movie you saw wasn’t the best, that last scene could give you the hype you needed to make sure you were in theaters for the next film. It perfectly captured the early days of Marvel Comics, where you’d see little cameos of characters from other comics in panels, and then, as you read, you’d see a little editor’s note directing you to check out another title.</p><p>Yet now, most of the post-credit scenes feel like dangling cliffhangers that will never be realized in a new movie or show. We were teased Blade in The Eternals years ago. What happened to Dane Whitman, the Black Knight? That was Kit Harington — Jon freaking Snow — and he can’t be brought back after all these years? Many Phase Four and Phase Five scenes felt, at times, like they were trolling the audience and going against what we expected.</p><p>While it seems like they’re getting back on track with the post-credit scene in <em>Thunderbolts</em>, it just feels a bit too late, as we’ve been burned too often. Building on what I stated earlier, with the phases functioning as story arcs on their own while still advancing the saga, they need to return to making each post-credit scene feel like it’s pushing the larger story forward. Even if they want it to be funny or a bit of a troll, there still has to be some meat there for our appetites to hook onto—so we don’t walk away feeling like our time was wasted.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c7b5c4b5c7cc003b887e9f3ed8274f4d" data-recommend-id="image://c7b5c4b5c7cc003b887e9f3ed8274f4d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="798" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Marvel superheroes joined together" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Marvel superheroes joined together" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c7b5c4b5c7cc003b887e9f3ed8274f4d" data-recommend-id="image://c7b5c4b5c7cc003b887e9f3ed8274f4d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="798" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Marvel superheroes joined together" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This might just be a personal thing, but why does every Marvel movie need so much humor? It’s gotten to the point where the tension is constantly undercut by jokes, making it feel like the characters aren’t taking anything seriously. They make it seem like they know everything will work out. This also weakens the antagonists, reducing them to mere obstacles in the protagonist’s personal drama.</p><p>One of the biggest victims of this is <em>Thor: Love and Thunder</em>. It’s so silly that when Thor and his crew are on screen, it feels like Christian Bale is acting in a completely different film. Nothing ever feels dangerous; at best, it plays like a <em>Scooby-Doo</em> episode with superpowers. Even <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>, a movie I enjoyed, leaned too heavily into jokes. Compared to the first two <em>Deadpool</em> films, the humor here often overtakes the heart and personal stakes Wade once carried.</p><p>This overreliance on humor and the tendency to make every Marvel movie an action-comedy flattens the superhero genre. Not only has it become formulaic—it’s become a punchline. In the recent film <em>Friendship</em>, a character mentions going to see “the new Marvel” and everyone immediately gets the joke. That’s a bad sign. Marvel’s slump isn’t just about box office—it’s about perception. People are tuning out.</p><p>Marvel keeps promoting new movies or shows by claiming they’re tapping into other genres, but most of the time, they’re just more MCU fare with jokes at timed intervals. It feels like they’ve abandoned genre experimentation. Phase Two gave us real variety: <em>The Winter Soldier</em> worked as a political thriller, <em>Ant-Man</em> was a heist comedy, and <em>Iron Man 3</em>—a movie I don’t even like—at least felt like a Shane Black buddy action flick.</p><p>Marvel used to be the “cool” alternative to DC. Now it’s the “quirky” one. It’s time to dial back the humor—not to go dark, but to be sharp, confident, and cool again.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4def9d10ed6467e4da7c0e7642b6bf86" data-recommend-id="image://4def9d10ed6467e4da7c0e7642b6bf86" data-format="jpg" data-width="6385" data-height="6048" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A collection of Marvel comics" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A collection of Marvel comics" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4def9d10ed6467e4da7c0e7642b6bf86" data-recommend-id="image://4def9d10ed6467e4da7c0e7642b6bf86" data-format="jpg" data-width="6385" data-height="6048" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A collection of Marvel comics" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Early on, the MCU felt very focused on adapting the tone and vibe of Marvel comics. While not one-to-one adaptations, they blended the spirit of classic Marvel, Modern Marvel, and the Ultimate line. Iron Man’s origin, for example, was captured perfectly, appealing to general audiences while wowing diehard fans by bringing beloved characters to life. Involving comic creators in the production helped strike the right balance to make it enjoyable for everyone.</p><p>But once the MCU hit massive success, it started treating the comics more as a hindrance than a guide. For me, that shift began with <em>Captain America: Civil War</em>. The setup and themes were changed completely. While the film technically split the heroes, most audiences were just excited to see Black Panther and Spider-Man debut. I’m not even a big fan of Mark Millar’s comic or his post-9/11 worldview, but the premise—young heroes botching a mission, sparking a national debate on superhero accountability—was compelling. In the movie, it boiled down to Tony being mad that Cap chose Bucky over him, and Zemo manipulating everyone. It stripped away the political nuance in favor of hero-on-hero spectacle.</p><p>Fans would ask what to read before watching <em>Shang-Chi</em> or <em>The Marvels</em>, and I had nothing to recommend. Even explainer accounts are often just guessing based on Wikipedia and trailers. Straying too far from the comics could repeat the mistake <em>Game of Thrones</em> made: abandoning the source led to a disappointing ending. Unlike that series, Marvel doesn’t have to guess—the stories are already there. Bringing more creators back into the fold would help course-correct.</p><p>The MCU should lean more on its strongest stories to win fans back. Let the comics lead, rather than just using characters as loose inspiration. I’d love to see them attempt stories like <em>Annihilation</em>, <em>Avengers: Forever</em>, <em>Inferno</em>, or <em>Wolverine: Enemy of the State</em>. They could spark wildly different films and shows, while recapturing the shared tone that once connected the comics and MCU so well.</p></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/marvel-cinematic-universe-phase-5-marvel-comics-1851785555]]></content:encoded>

<p>With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-online-gamecube-controller-the-return-of-the-king">the new GC controller</a> giving <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/soulcalibur_ii">SoulCalibur II</a> that authentic feeling (while also adding wireless without a WaveBird and sneaking in some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/the-switch-2-gamecube-controller-has-gyro-and-a-better-d-pad">gyro</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-using-a-gamecube-controller-with-the-nso-app-yields-fun-surprises">other neat features</a>, too), we've been having a great time with the four available games. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/video-switch-2s-gamecube-emulation-apparently-has-underlying-issues-nintendo-desperately-needs-to-fix">Some emulation teething issues</a> aside, we haven't run into anything like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/10/nintendo-switch-onlines-n64-games-need-some-work">the problems of the N64 app at launch</a>, and we're dead excited for the upcoming lineup. Have you seen the secondhand price of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/fire_emblem_path_of_radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a> these days!?</p>
<p>However, with the Switch 1 libraries we've accumulated over eight years, plus the larger sizes of Switch 2 games (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a> is 59.4GB, for instance) and a paucity of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-physical-release-with-the-full-game-on-the-cart">'proper' physical game card releases</a>, storage space is at a premium - even if you've added more to the internal 256GB with a micro SD Express card.</p>
<p>Even with a pricey 1TB card, though, I couldn't get all my games on the system. Having to pick and choose what I take with me is a necessity now. Now, compared to a monster like Cyberpunk (or the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</a>, which will apparently weigh in at 73.2GB), the 6GB that the GameCube app currently asks for is small potatoes. The addition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_smash_football">Super Mario Strikers</a> this week bumped the overall download up from 5.1GB, so the situation isn't dire just yet.</p>
<p>The GameCube's cute little discs could hold nearly 1.5GB of data, so even accounting for any jiggery-pokery from Nintendo or repackaging of the ROMs, individual games aren't likely to be larger than that (most, like Strikers, will be much smaller).</p>
<figure><a title="GameCube Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fd8c962d75bb5/gamecube-games.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Some games came on two discs, of course, though I'd say the chances of seeing this one on NSO are slim — <em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>But on a handheld console where every gigabyte counts, the option to pick and choose the ISOs we want to take with us would be appreciated. As the library grows (it's currently at four, with six further games announced), so too will that app. And while the quality of the games so far is impressive, as with the other NSO retro apps, there are some games that you're just not going to play, for whatever reason. When the entire Game Boy offering takes up just 134MB, that's fine, but we could be saving valuable gigabytes with these GameCube games.</p>
<p>There's something to be said for having the entire library with you. There's always a chance you might discover a game you wouldn't have given the time of day otherwise, and having instant access to the lot <em>is</em> fantastic. But when my menu screen is filled with download bars flashing a little 'X' in the middle, something's got to give. It ain't gonna be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/f-zero_gx">F-Zero GX</a>, but the memory cost of having that with me at all times is going to increase every month.</p>
<p>And if we dare to dream that Wii games might one day get their own Nintendo Classics app, the sizes are only going to get bigger. Whether there's a genuine chance of Wii games ever coming to Switch 2 is a topic for another day, but the fact is that some of us would love to have a little more control over exactly what's on our systems.</p>
<p>What do you think? Would you like to be able to leave Wind Waker on the virtual shelf to make space for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/wave_race_blue_storm">Wave Race</a> (which surely must be coming, right?!)? Download an <em>extra</em> copy of F-Zero, perhaps - just in case? Let's get a handle on it in the poll below.</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI will likely remain the most expensive entry in the series even after its sequel is released, as a former Rockstar Games employee expects the development of the seventh entry to be cheaper.</p>



<p>Speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KIWITALKZ">KIWI TALKS</a> show, former Rockstar Games Technical Lead Obbe Vermeij, who worked on many iconic entries in the series like Vice City and San Andreas, discussed the future of the franchise past the sixth entry in the series launching next year, saying that there's likely not going to be a more expensive entry in the series than Grand Theft Auto VI because a lot of the development work is going to be taken over by AI, such as the work for maps and cutscenes. As such, no longer needing manual labor for these tasks, it is expected that Grand Theft Auto 7 will be cheaper to make than its predecessor, painting once again a grim picture for anyone working in the gaming industry. It will take a while, however, to see if Vermeij's prediction will be true, as we are unlikely to see Grand Theft Auto 7 for a very long time.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Talking about Grand Theft Auto 7 definitely seems a bit premature, considering Grand Theft Auto VI still has to come out. The highly anticipated new entry in the series was supposed to launch before the end of the year, but back in May, Rockstar Games confirmed the game would need more time and will launch in <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">May 2026</a>. Despite the delay, the excitement surrounding the game continues to be high, and some of its features promise to change not only open-world games but also entertainment as a whole, such as the rumored option for <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-may-allow-music-artists-to-upload-their-music-directly-in-the-game/">artists to upload their music directly into the game.</a></p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto VI launches on May 26, 2026 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

			<p>The Forza Motorsport series developer Turn 10 has become a Forza Horizon support studio, according to rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>As spotted on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/former-turn-10-studios-employee-claims-that-forza-motorsport-has-been-shuttered-and-the-studio-will-be-supporting-horizon.1235709/">ResetERA forums</a>, former Turn 10 employee Fred Russel revealed on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AlfaMale164S">Facebook</a> that the studio has shuttered the Forza Motorsport space and is now <a href="https://i.gyazo.com/0883ecbe1a63f7f109aa85ebde368458.png">a support studio for the Forza Horizon series</a> developed by Playground Games. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-developer-turn-10-hit-hard-layoffs/">over 70 employees were laid off this week</a>, this was somewhat expected.</p>



<p>Forza Motorsport developer Turn 10 is only one of the studios that has been impacted by the recent wave of layoffs. The Initiative, the studio put together to work on a new entry in the Perfect Dark series, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">shut down</a>, and the project was cancelled. Rare's<a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/"> Everwild</a> was similarly cancelled, as was a new MMORPG by ZeniMax Online, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-reportedly-loved-playing-zenimax-onlines-new-game-in-march-only-to-cancel-it-in-july/">reportedly loved by Phil Spencer back in March</a>, but apparently being widely appreciated by the head of Xbox is not enough to avoid cancellation. Other projects developed by other partners were also cancelled, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-creators-romero-games-next-unannounced-project-has-been-cancelled/">an unannounced FPS</a> that was in the works by Romero Games, the studio founded by the co-creator of the DOOM series, John Romero.</p>



<p>It's a massive shame that the Forza Motorsport series seems to be done for the time being, as the latest entry in the franchise was a return to form, according to Chris. You can learn more about it in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-motorsport-review/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>If the upcoming Resident Evil Requiem is not enough newness for all you zombie-loving fans, then I have some good news. Today, a new strategy game based on Capcom's Resi series has been announced.</p>
<p>It's known as Resident Evil Survival Unit, and is set for release across mobile devices. While Survival Unit is being co-developed by Aniplex Inc and Joycity Corporation, Capcom is working in "close collaboration" with the studios to "ensure authenticity and quality".</p>

<p>Details on what the game will look like and involve for now remain somewhat mysterious, though we can look forward to finding out more later this month, with a showcase planned for 10th July. It will take place at 11pm UK time.</p>
<p>The studios have said Resident Evil Survival Unit will "appeal to both longtime fans and new players". While we don't yet have a release date, it will be available globally across Japan, South Korea, North America, Europe, and Asia whenever it does arrive.</p>
<p>Along with this info, some artwork for Resident Evil Survival Unit was shared, showing a car driving down a road as a lightning storm rages. To one side, a sign for Umbrella - yes, that rather questionable corporation - declares that "our business is life itself…". The two people on the sign smile away. Oh, what poor sweet fools.</p>
<p>In terms of the Resi timeline, Umbrella itself went defunct in 2003, following the Raccoon Trials. Given this, we can perhaps surmise from the artwork that Resident Evil Survival Unit at least takes place before that time.</p>

<p>As for the rest of the series,  we got our first look at Resident Evil Requiem last month, when Capcom <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-officially-unveiled-coming-february">introduced us all to Grace Ashcroft and a destroyed Raccoon City</a>. The developer once considered having Leon Kennedy take on the protagonist role for Requiem, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leon-kennedy-actually-quite-a-bad-match-for-horror-says-resident-evil-9s-director">in the end decided he was "actually quite a bad match for horror"</a>.</p>
<p>Our Alex has been hands-on with Resident Evil Requiem already, admitting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-played-resident-evil-9-and-they-heard-me-scream-in-the-booth-next-door">even the relatively small chunk he played made him scream so loudly that those in the booth next door heard him</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/another-new-resident-evil-game-has-been-announced]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Dying Light developer Techland has confirmed there have been no staff reductions following the reported cancellation of two in-development games.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pb.pl/techland-z-potezna-strata-za-2024-r-1244492">Pulz Biznesu</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.gamewatcher.com/news/dying-light-developer-techland-cancels-two-upcoming-games-including-its-new-fantasy-rpg-ip">GameWatcher</a>), the developer published record losses of 135m zl (£27.4m) for 2024, as per the <a href="https://ekrs.ms.gov.pl/rdf/pd/search_df">Polish National Court Register</a>. While the two projects have not been named, it's presumed one is the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/techland-working-on-open-world-fantasy-action-rpg">fantasy RPG revealed in May 2022</a>.</p>
<p>In a statement to Eurogamer, a spokesperson for Techland said: "Game development is never a straight line, and sometimes fresh approaches are necessary to make great games. What's important here is that none of the reported changes have resulted in staff reductions. Developers were moved to other projects and are working on a number of games in our pipeline.</p>

<p>"Our primary focus right now is to release Dying Light: The Beast for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. After the launch of Dying Light: The Beast, we will share more about future titles in due time."</p>
<p>Little is known about the fantasy RPG, though the company recruited top talent from the likes of CD Projekt Red, Arkane, and Guerrilla Games.</p>
<p>"We're very happy with what we have accomplished with the Dying Light franchise so far," said Paweł Marchewka, Techland CEO, at the time of the game's announcement.</p>
<p>"At the same time, our ambition is to introduce a brand new IP that is vastly different from what we have been doing for the past several years. We want to create a fully next-gen experience. A new fantasy epic set in a sprawling open world, fueled by the skills and experience we have gained as a team over the years, infused with new ideas, passion, and creativity."</p>
<p>Although the record losses are significant, Techland's most recently released game was Dying Light 2 back in 2022. The first Dying Light, released in 2015, was a massive hit for the company, selling 20m copies as of 2022. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-2-has-surpassed-5m-copies-sold-since-launching-in-february">sequel sold 5m in around two months</a>.</p>
<p>The company's next release will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-the-beast-is-coming-out-on-25-august-revealed-at-summer-game-fest">Dying Light: The Beast</a>, coming 22nd August.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/techland-teases-multiple-unannounced-dying-light-projects-including-board-games-and-a-webcomic">Techland announced it would be releasing multiple projects in the Dying Light series</a>, including board games and a webcomic. Following these new cancellations, it seems the company is focusing on its most successful franchise.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-studio-techland-cancels-two-in-development-games-clarifies-no-staff-reductions]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Stop Killing Games campaign's petition to the European Commission has hit a major milestone, surpassing a million signatures. However, the YouTuber behind this effort to stop companies from rendering games unplayable by shutting down their servers is still asking for more folks to get their pens out and sign, due to concerns about fakery.</p>
<p>If you're out of the loop, Ross Scott originally launched <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-hopes-to-petition-regulators-to-stop-developers-from-shutting-down-games">back in 2024</a>, after Ubisoft pulled racing game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a> offline. Cue a lot of debates about terms of service which tell folks that when you buy a game, you're not buying permanent access to it, but rather <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-never-owned-the-game-insist-ubisoft-to-the-crew-players-that-are-suing-the-publisher">a license to play it</a> for as long as it exists.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The <a href="https://eci.ec.europa.eu/045/public/#/screen/home">European Citizens' Initiative</a> has crossed 1 million signatures. Except it hasn't," Scott announced in a video update uploaded to his channel Accursed Farms yesterday.</p>
<p>"This is going to kill morale, but there are two things going on here. The first we knew was coming. Every time somebody makes a mistake when they sign the Initiative, their signature gets invalidated. So that means we need more signatures to make up for everybody's mistakes."</p>
<p>"That could be a lot," he continued, "I've heard 10% minimum, 20% is better, 40% should be really safe." The second issue is that Scott says he's "received several reports of people claiming to [have spoofed] signatures on the initiative site."</p>

<p>"First off, I want to say that this is not a Change.org petition. This is a government process," Scott continues. "Spoofing signatures on it is a crime. Please do not do this."</p>
<p>It's unclear at this point whether any folks spoofing signatures on the EU petition might end up being prosecuted for doing so, but it won't invalidate the campaign as a whole. However, the fact Scott's even heard talk of such a thing has left him unsure of exactly how many real signatures he's got. He reckons there are "at least 600–700k" at current.</p>
<p>Hence him <a href="https://x.com/accursedfarms/status/1940798871678210158">asking for EU citizens</a> to keep on signing legitimately. As of writing, the EU petition is at 1,091,165 signatures, with a million having been the goal that would lead the European Commission to at least look into the issue.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that Stop Killing Games also has a <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074/">UK petition</a>, which currently has just over 150k signatures, and looks set to receive a date when it'll be debated in parliament soon. That said, the UK Government have already issued a response to that petition back in February, which reads: "There are no plans to amend UK consumer law on disabling video games. Those selling games must comply with existing requirements in consumer law and we will continue to monitor this issue."</p>
<p>"I would bet money on the EU initiative delivering something good if it passes, but the UK has been more about exhausting all options," Scott says in the video. He adds regarding that previous response from UK politicians: "A member of Parliament could sneeze on the petition, and that would not be a worse answer."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-eu-petition-hits-a-million-signatures-but-a-significant-number-could-be-fake]]></content:encoded>

While gamers take to the internet to celebrate, spokesperson and organizer Ross Scott says reaching 1 million signatures is good news but far from a victory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“OK, the breaking news: The European Citizens’ Initiative has crossed 1 million signatures – except it hasn’t,” Scott said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmkCQJrc9n4" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a video update</u></a> uploaded yesterday. “This is going to kill morale, but there are two things going on here.

At the time of this story’s publication, Stop Killing Games has reached 1.07 million endorsements ahead of its July 31 end date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, yeah, that sucks,” Scott continued. “We’ll just keep plodding away unless we can figure out what the safe numbers are.

Following its promising launch last year, however, the initiative struggled to maintain the support it needed to push its way through to the eyes that needed to see it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stop Killing Games’ chances at a successful campaign became so dire that Scott went as far as to publish a video titled “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfRLujXtUo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The end of Stop Killing Games</u></a>” just last week. In the hour-long explainer piece, Scott listed a lack of exposure as one primary cause behind the lack of support. It was the Hail Mary the initiative needed, though, as prominent YouTubers like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_5WIzkM0r8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Jacksepticeye</u></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sJpTCitKqw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>penquinz0/Cr1TiKaL</u></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlmulltSgWg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Ludwig</u></a>, and more were quick to voice their support with their own videos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All within the weeks since Scott shared his concerns, Stop Killing Games has gained hundreds of thousands of signatures, resulting in a solid chunk of the more than 1 million names attached to the movement today. Success remains uncertain even if Scott is able to reach that magic 1.4 million number, with even more uncertainty lying on the other side of that goal post. Still, as outlined by Scott on the Stop Killing Games website, he feels optimistic about the future of game preservation if the signature goal is met.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If we can pass the signature threshold," Scott says, "there is a very strong chance that the European Commission will pass new law that will both protect consumer rights to retain video games that customers have purchased and advance preservation efforts massively."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Should the word get out to enough interested individuals, players could see somewhat of a return to the days when buying a game came with the assurance that it would remain playable regardless of post-launch interference.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid the video game cancelations and studio closures that have come as a result of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff">Microsoft’s devastating round of layoffs this week</a> is concern about the fate of pretty much every Xbox game without a firm release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft games canceled as part of the cuts include <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rares-everwild-reportedly-canceled-as-microsoft-layoffs-sweep-across-xbox">Rare’s Everwild</a>, an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-online-devs-unannounced-mmo-was-doing-well-and-even-scaling-up-as-xbox-cancelation-blindsided-staff-sources-say">unannounced MMO from ZeniMax Online Studios</a>, the developer of The Elder Scrolls Online, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-and-xbox-developer-the-initiative-closed-as-part-of-devastating-microsoft-layoffs">the Perfect Dark Reboot</a>. The latter's developer, The Initiative, was shut down. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-says-warcraft-rumble-wont-get-any-new-content-as-microsoft-layoffs-hit-development-team">The team working on Blizzard’s mobile game Warcraft Rumble was laid off as new content ceased</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, external developers who were funded by Microsoft were also hit. Romero Games, the studio founded by Doom co-creator John Romero and Brenda Romero, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/update-romero-games-employee-says-whole-studio-subject-to-layoffs-after-microsoft-pulls-funding-for-new-shooter-from-doom-co-creator-john-romero">has suffered significant layoffs and the future of its new shooter is in doubt</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s a lot to take in, but it begs the question: which Xbox Game Studios games remain? And which, if any, were quietly canceled?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a memo sent to all Microsoft gaming staff and viewed by IGN this week, Matt Booty, head of Xbox Game Studios, said Microsoft still has "more than 40 projects in active development, continued momentum on titles shipping this fall, and a strong slate headed into 2026."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, a source told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/perfect-dark-everwild-game-canceled-microsoft-initiative-1236446212/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> that every game featured at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-2025-everything-announced">the Xbox Games Showcase presentation in June</a> is continuing on. So, what were those games, which we now assume are safe — at least for the time being?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision’s Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was at the show, and is certain to come out later this year (despite the layoffs hitting its various developers). inXile game Clockwork Revolution starred at the show, so that’s safe. Obsidian’s Grounded 2 and The Outer Worlds 2 were at the show and we should assume are both safe. It's a similar deal for Double Fine’s Keeper, The Coalition’s Gears of War: Reloaded, Ninja Gaiden 4, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle’s Order of the Giants DLC. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3 + 4, and the ROG Xbox Ally, both at the show, will continue too. Despite the cancelation of Everwild, Rare’s Sea of Thieves continues with new updates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the end of the showcase, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-teases-return-of-halo-in-2026-and-its-reportedly-a-halo-combat-evolved-remaster">Xbox boss Phil Spencer teased Forza, Fable, Gears of War: E-Day, and a Halo: Combat Evolved remake for 2026</a>. We assume since those games were mentioned, they’re safe,  although it’s worth noting that the Forza mentioned by Spencer no doubt relates to the next Forza Horizon game from Playground, which is also making Fable. Turn 10, which makes the more sim-focused Forza games, was hit hard by the layoffs.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, we know which games Microsoft still intends to release. But, given the events of this week, it’s now impossible to think about other Xbox games in the works without a degree of concern. Everwild and Perfect Dark were conspicuous by their absence at last month's show and both were canceled. What else failed to turn up?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Minecraft — remember Microsoft owns Minecraft! — remains huge and safe as houses, you feel. But what about Contraband from Just Cause developer Avalanche Studios? Where’s Undead Labs’ State of Decay 3? Ninja Theory’s Project Mara? Microsoft has a Hideo Kojima game, OD, on its books. Is that still happening? Toys for Bob, the Crash Bandicoot 4 developer and Call of Duty support studio that left the Xbox-owned Activision in February 2024, signed an agreement with Xbox directly to publish its next game. Is that still alive?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And what about Bethesda? ZOS’s MMO has fallen by the wayside, but surely Bethesda Game Studios' The Elder Scrolls VI and the next Fallout are fine. Starfield’s promised next expansion feels precarious, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-starfields-xbox-no-show-even-its-most-loyal-fans-are-starting-to-worry-bethesda-makes-it-so-hard-to-defend-this-game">given Bethesda's radio silence on the game</a>. And what about Blizzard? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reportedly-working-on-a-starcraft-shooter-with-ex-far-cry-chief-dan-hay-at-the-helm">As of last year it was reportedly hard at work on a StarCraft shooter</a>. Is that still the case?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s only when you run through what <em>wasn’t</em> at the Xbox Games Showcase last month that you realize what’s at stake here: Microsoft owns a huge number of development studios across the globe, from Bethesda to Blizzard and Activision to Halo. When Xbox suffers significant problems, a huge swathe of the video game industry and its developers do, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All eyes are on August's gamescom, where Microsoft is expected to show more of what is has coming down the line. Perhaps Phil Spencer will give fans a clear idea of what’s in the works from Xbox and what isn't as Microsoft's multiplatform push soldiers on. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-first-party-next-generation-xbox-consoles-announces-deal-with-amd-and-promises-full-backwards-compatibility-with-your-existing-xbox-library">It is still planning to release a next-gen Xbox console</a>, although we don't know when. Is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-plans-to-release-an-xbox-handheld-but-its-years-away">the first-party Xbox handheld Spencer teased</a> last year also still alive? Does Microsoft still plan to release its own gaming app store, despite the failure of <a href="https://in.ign.com/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile/231166/news/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-activision-shuts-down-its-battle-royale-mobile-game" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Call of Duty Warzone Mobile</a>, Warcraft Rumble, and this week's significant cuts to Candy Crush maker King? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the short term, at least, the games we saw in June are still on the way. But the long term future of Xbox remains vague indeed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

			<p>AMD FSR 4 running on PlayStation 5 Pro promises to be more interesting than anticipated, judging from what a well-known insider revealed recently.</p>



<p>Speaking on the NeoGAF forums, known AMD insider KeplerL2 commented on the recent announcement that the next version of the AMD upscaler is coming to PlayStation 5 Pro next year, saying that the system cannot run the model that is being used by the upscaler to run on RDNA4 GPUs. Sony and AMD started working on the mid-generation refresh before AMD decided to move FSR to an ML model, and when the company made the switch, the PlayStation 5 Pro design was done with no FP8 support. As such, it will be very interesting to see how running the <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr4-ps5-pro-2026-rdna5/">full-fat version of the upscale</a>r on the system will be achieved.</p>



<p>Those expecting to see games that support the AI-powered PSSR on PlayStation 5 Pro to automatically support AMD FSR 4 without developer intervention, however, may be disappointed. As far as KeplerL2 <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/ps5-pro-is-getting-a-big-upgrade-in-2026-%E2%80%94-i-asked-mark-cerny-what%E2%80%99s-coming-and-why-amd%E2%80%99s-future-pc-gpus-feel-more-playstation-than-ever.1685909/post-270585067">knows</a>, the current version of the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler doesn't allow system-level DLL swaps, so there's a very likely chance that developers will have to update already released games if they want to take advantage of AMD FSR 4 once it becomes available for the system in 2026.</p>



<p>Besides offering the aforementioned AI-powered PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler, whose implementation has been hit and miss, depending on the game, the PlayStation 5 Pro offers other improvements that make it the system of choice to enjoy PS5 games at their very best. You can learn more about the system by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The studio making underwater survival game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> have promised fans that "nothing has changed" despite a recent drastic change in leadership at the company. The game is still planned to be a single player survival adventure with optional co-op.</p>
<p>"Nothing has changed with how the game is structured," said a <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-community-letter">statement posted to Unknown World's website</a> yesterday. "It will remain a single-player first experience, with optional co-operative multiplayer. No subscriptions. No loot boxes. No battle pass. No microtransactions." Okay nameless statement, this still dosn't clear anything up.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We know that you have a lot of questions and concerns about the news from our publisher regarding the leadership changes at Unknown Worlds," it begins, and then spends eight paragraphs not answering those questions. "We’re also supporting Steve Papoutsis as he transitions into his role as CEO at Unknown Worlds. He’s already expressed his excitement to check out everything we’ve been working on."

</p><p>Earlier this week Krafton, the publishers who own Unknown Worlds, announced that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">three senior staff members were being replaced by an executive</a> from one of their other studios. Steve Papoutsis, who worked on sci-fi horror game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a>, is now the CEO of the studio. Those leaving include studio co-founders Charlie Cleveland and Max MacGuire. </p>
<p>In the press release which made that announcement, there were some lines about a renewed commitment to "achieving regular milestones". The subtext is that Krafton believed Unknown Worlds were not working fast enough. Their new guy, they suggest, will commit to regular checks from on-high.</p>

<p>"These reviews, based on clearly defined metrics and targets, will help ensure that games meet both creative and quality standards. This process is essential to delivering the right game at the right time. Unknown Worlds’ new leadership fully supports this process and is committed to meeting player expectations."</p>
<p>Fans of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> (hi) are squinting heavily at the megapublisher with untrusting eyes. Hence yesterday's damage control in the form of a "letter to our community", which is mostly a defence of incoming CEO Papoutsis and his benefactors at Krafton.</p>
<p>"We want to reassure you that KRAFTON feels strongly about supporting that vision at the studio, as we continue to navigate the game toward Early Access," the letter continues. "While we work closely with Steve and get him up to speed with all the amazing work the team has already done on Subnautica 2, we also understand that it means we’ll need to ask you to remain a little patient and support us as he comes on board."</p>
<p>They go on to promise that a new schedule and early access timeline will be coming soon, but still don't answer any obvious questions about this whole drama. Ousting the long-serving leaders of a studio and installing a former EA producer who presided over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-hardline">Battlefield Hardline</a> is a drastic assertion of control. So what happened? Why kick out those three specific people? Should more people expect to be laid off? Will the team face the <a href="https://www.vg247.com/the-callisto-protocol-proves-that-crunch-is-dumb">reportedly disastrous crunch conditions that affected The Callisto Protocol</a>? No answers are forthcoming.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Unknown Worlds saying "no loot boxes" is like a cereal company saying "we don't plan to add any mice to this batch of corn flakes". I, uh, never thought you were going to? | <span>Image credit: <cite>Microsoft</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The studio promises not to fill the game with lootboxes, and okay, thanks? Lootboxes are not the real worry, and the game is reportedly so far along in development it would likely be technically unfeasible to introduce such features anyway. The real worry is that the culture, morale, and day-to-day working experience at Unknown Worlds may alter for the worse. </p>
<p>A final wrinkle in the story: former studio head Charlie Cleveland says he is "Now making some films!" on LinkedIn. This comes after he recently moved to LA and set up a movie company, the website for which is awash with <a href="https://www.abyssal.co/nutmeg-mistletoe">generative AI movie posters</a> and <a href="https://www.abyssal.co/zeroes">wonky-faced placeholder images</a>. Which I imagine might distract someone from actual game development. But unless anyone involved speaks plainly about this messy situation, all we will have is speculation.</p>
