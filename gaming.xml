The second-generation Rotom Phone’s camera in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2022/11/18/23461245/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-rotom-phone-review-pokedex"><em>Scarlet </em>/ <em>Violet</em></a> was a significant improvement, but the device’s real standout feature was its ability to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2022/11/18/23461245/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-rotom-phone-review-pokedex">keep you from plummeting to your death</a> if you fell from a great height.</p><p>While neither of the early Rotom Phones were as visually interesting as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22898939/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em></a>’ Arc Phone, they both spoke to how the <em>Pokémon </em>universe’s consumer tech has become increasingly streamlined and robust. That trend continues in <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>with a new Rotom Phone that feels like it was designed for urban exploration.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/801113/pokemon-legends-za-rotom-phone-pokedex-review">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MzA4ODY=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24126232/fallout-pip-boy-review">Fallout Pip-Boy review: a wearable fit for the wasteland</a></h2><div><p>It’s hard to say what, precisely, makes a design timeless. Some classic gadgets are simply beautiful, while others remain functional years after they come out. The list of truly timeless products in tech is small, but there’s one name that looms large: RobCo Industries’ Pip-Boy. Sure, it’s relatively simple, and some of its features only work if you’re stuck underground. But when a design hasn’t changed for 200 years, you know it’s doing something right.</p><p>For those who have been living under an irradiated rock, a Pip-Boy is a wrist-worn computer that — despite originally being meant for the pre-war world and, later, life inside of a Vault-Tec vault — has become an indispensable tool for survival out in the wasteland. It’s large and rugged, though not particularly heavy or uncomfortable, and is outfitted with plenty of satisfyingly chunky dials and buttons. From an aesthetic perspective, it’s surprisingly versatile, pairing with everything from a Vault-Tec jumpsuit to raider armor. You never really have to worry about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/27/24113500/wearables-smartwatches-smart-glasses-smart-rings-etiquette">when and where it’s okay to wear one</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24126232/fallout-pip-boy-review">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MzQ0MjA=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24108802/3-body-problem-vr-headset-review">3 Body Problem VR headset review: magical tech in need of more apps</a></h2><div><p>Arthur C. Clarke famously said that “any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,” and that’s never been more true than with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/21/24102256/netflix-3-body-problem-review"><em>3 Body Problem</em></a> VR headset. It’s so far ahead of everything else on the market that it doesn’t seem possible. There’s really no doubt: this is the best way to experience virtual reality. Sadly, there’s far too little software to take advantage of all of that advanced tech; at launch, there’s only a single app available. And even though that one app is a game that could alter the fate of mankind forever, that doesn’t quite nudge the headset into “must buy” territory.</p><p>But let’s start with that hardware because it is indeed incredible. It’s a sleek metallic headset that’s so light you can barely feel it at all. It’s completely wireless, and unlike, say, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price">Apple Vision Pro</a>, it seems to work for just about everyone right out of the box. No fussing around with visual settings or specially-fitted seals. Just put it on and go. There are also no loading times, and the battery life appears to be infinite. How they managed to squeeze all of that inside such a tiny device is baffling. I’m eagerly awaiting the moment iFixit gets their hands on it.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24108802/3-body-problem-vr-headset-review">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NjU1ODI=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719653/purah-pad-review-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">Purah Pad review: a rugged tablet designed for the dangers of Hyrule</a></h2><div><p>It’s never easy to follow up a beloved device, especially when it’s one that managed to fuse ancient technology with a modern-day phablet. But the Purah Pad — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2017/3/7/14809872/sheikah-slate-review-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">a spiritual successor to the Sheikah Slate</a> — manages to add more utility to a device that already let you control physics. It still doesn’t have much in the way of entertainment options, but its new design and feature set are ideal for those traveling around Hyrule, particularly if you also have a wearable that gives you power over space and time.</p><p>In terms of hardware, the Purah Pad has a slightly more streamlined setup than its predecessor, with a seven-inch display flanked by physical buttons and other controls on the sides and a USB Type-C port at the bottom. It has a rather ornate design that fits right in among any other ancient tech you might have but also results in a gigantic bezel that can obscure the edges of the display. It’s form over function. I should also note that somehow, once again, this device has infinite battery life.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719653/purah-pad-review-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6ODE2NTA=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2022/11/18/23461245/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-rotom-phone-review-pokedex">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet Rotom Phone review: it’s a literal lifesaver</a></h2><div><p>As the <em>Pokémon</em> world <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23415407/pokemon-scarlet-violet-hands-on-preview-nintendo-switch">becomes a bigger, richer place</a> filled with an ever-growing number of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/6/23443302/we-finally-have-a-name-for-the-coin-pokemon">new monsters</a>, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21134790/pokemon-home-pokedex-transporter-move-3ds-games-switch-android-ios">pokédexes</a> trainers receive at the beginning of their journeys have similarly evolved with the release of each new <em>Pokémon </em>game.

While the jump from Generation VII’s Rotom Dex to the original Rotom Phone saw the device go through a drastic redesign to improve pocketability, the Generation IX Rotom Phone is more of an incremental hardware update meant to make the phone more useful for adventuring. Aside from a new second camera module and a thin built-in ring light around back, <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>’s Paldean Rotom Phone looks more or less exactly like last generation’s model and comes in a familiar fiery red-orange but can also be customized with a variety of cases.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2022/11/18/23461245/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-rotom-phone-review-pokedex">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTI0Nzk0" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22576224/tva-tempad-review-loki-season-1-review-marvel-timedoor">TVA TemPad review: who needs TikTok when you can control time and space?</a></h2></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MjY5MjI1" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2017/3/7/14809872/sheikah-slate-review-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">Zelda Sheikah Slate review: Link’s new phablet has magic, but no Netflix</a></h2><div><p>The Sheikah Slate is not your run-of-the-mill gadget.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>On October 15, the devs behind <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> announced that the game’s most popular mode, Conquest, would be tweaked in a big way that would potentially lead to shorter matches. This change was nearly universally hated by the online <em>Battlefield</em> community, and now, just 48 hours later, EA is reversing course as it continues to promise tweaks and fixes for the recently released online FPS.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-steam-record-login-queue-multiplayer-download-issue-2000634042"><em>Battlefield 6</em> launched last week to massive sales and high player numbers</a>, making it already one of the most successful entries in the long-running milsim series. But, as with any popular online video game these days, a lot of players online have spent nearly every day since launch offering feedback, complaining, or pointing out problems that need to be fixed. And EA is working on a lot of this, with fixes incoming for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-players-biggest-enemy-may-be-the-in-game-sun/1100-6535525/">overly bright maps</a>, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/battlefield-6-devs-are-trying-to-find-the-balance-between-zoomers-and-battledads-following-movement-nerfs-were-looking-at-adjustments-for-sure-to-find-a-good-in-between/">tweaks to movement</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-ghost-bullets-update-hotfix-network-bloom-2000635677">and more</a>. But among these many recent changes, one caught players on Reddit and social media off guard. For some reason, EA and Battlefield Studios lowered the ticket count for all levels when playing <em>BF6</em>‘s flagship mode, Conquest. And oh boy, were people mad about this change.</p>

 <p>For those not familiar with Conquest in <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190"><em>BF6</em></a>, the mode is all about capturing various points on large maps and holding them. The more you hold, the slower your ticket count ticks down. And any time a player dies and respawns, a ticket is also removed from that team. The side that hits 0 first loses. Before October 15, every map in <em>BF6</em> featured 1000 tickets for both sides. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o7bxf9/bfcomms_conquest_ticket_count_update_1510/">But then that was tweaked</a>, with different, lower starting ticket values depending on which map you were playing. EA claimed this was because battles were going on too long and timing out, so the idea was that lower ticket counts would lead to more matches ending because a team hit 0 and not because the timer ran out.</p>

 <p>This tweak angered many online as it seemed like something nobody was asking for. Likewise, many players, myself included, have played for many days now and have never seen a match end due to the timer running out. Other players were also mad because for them, <em>Battlefield’s</em> Conquest mode has always been about long matches that go back and forth for upwards of 20 minutes. As many pointed out online in thousands of messages and posts, if you want shorter matches, there are plenty of modes in <em>BF6</em> that offer that experience. Lowering the ticket count ultimately felt like a solution for a problem that didn’t exist, and EA seemingly agrees because it’s already reversed course on the controversial change.</p>

 <p>On October 17, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1979118925699747944">the official <em>Battlefield</em> social media account on Twitter posted</a> that the devs had “heard your feedback” and the studio was reverting the change.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We've heard your feedback about the recent reduction of Conquest starting tickets and will be reverting the ticket count across all maps to their original launch value of 1,000 and 45 minute timed rounds.</p> <p>Please note that on larger maps such as Mirak Valley and Firestorm this…</p> <p>— Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1979118925699747944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“We’ve heard your feedback about the recent reduction of Conquest starting tickets and will be reverting the ticket count across all maps to their original launch value of 1,000 and 45-minute timed rounds,” posted the official account. “Please note that on larger maps such as Mirak Valley and Firestorm, this change may lead to longer match durations. We’ll continue monitoring player feedback and gameplay data to ensure the pacing and overall flow of matches feel right.”</p>

 <p>It’s very odd to me that EA seems so concerned about long matches in Conquest, as that’s always been how the mode works, something other players pointed out in the comments below. I think the best way to solve this problem is to just add a “Fast Conquest” mode that has fewer tickets and is all about keeping matches short. Players who really prefer that version of Conquest can go enjoy it, and everyone else can grind away in 40-minute matches that go back and forth.</p> <p>In fact, I’d love to see EA do some official playlists that feature 2000-ticket matches, as sometimes I just want to spend an hour fighting in Operation Firestorm, you know? At least for now, <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s most iconic mode is back to normal, and just in time for <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190">some big XP changes that should make it easier to unlock new gear</a>.</p>

<p>Arrowhead Game Studios, the developers of the widely acclaimed Helldivers 2, are working on a brand new game and are looking for a new system designer to help with it. </p>



<p>According to a job listing on the company’s website, Arrowhead Studios is searching for a Senior System Designer for a new co-op Action game. </p>



<p><strong>“We’re looking for a talented Senior Systems Designer to join our growing design department and help shape the foundation of a brand-new, unannounced project,” </strong>the <a href="https://jobs.arrowheadgamestudios.com/jobs/6618789-senior-system-designer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">description reads</a>. <strong>“This is your chance to be part of an co-op action game from the start. You’ll be at the heart of building and tuning the core systems, progression loops, and combat feel like an Arrowhead Game.”</strong></p>



<p>Not much else is known about what this new action game will feature, but, based on what’s said later on, it will be for a completely new IP and built in Unreal Engine. </p>



<p>One thing that’s for sure, this new title isn’t going to be in partnership with Sony. In the spring, CEO Shams Jorjani said that Arrowhead’s next game will be “100% funded” by the studio.</p>



<p>A new IP coming from the studio shouldn’t be seen as a surprise by anyone. In September, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-developers-have-no-plans-for-a-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jorjani said that the goal</a> is to make Helldivers 2 a “forever game” and that there were no plans to make another sequel. Instead, they want to expand the current game even further as the months and years pass.</p>



<p>What do you hope to see Arrowhead Game Studios build with this new game after the success of Helldivers 2?

While Black Desert Online is an MMORPG--rather than a single-player action RPG like Crimson Desert--both games share similar fast-paced battles and high fantasy worlds. Black Desert is one of the most popular MMORPGs on the market, offering a massive world to explore, frantic action-based combat, and gorgeous graphical fidelity. The base game is just $10 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/582660/Black_Desert/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, but it's important to note Black Desert is designed around microtransactions and other in-app purchases (something that Crimson Desert will seemingly not be burdened with). Nevertheless, if you're sticking to the basic gameplay and character apparel, it should be a cheap way to stay busy until March.</p><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-preorder-guide/1100-6535007/">ROG Xbox Ally X In Stock At Best Buy On Launch Day, Ships Immediately</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-pokemon-legends-z-a-console-bundle-buying-guide/1100-6533331/">Pokemon Nintendo Switch 2 Console Bundle Restocked At Amazon On Launch Day</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-transformers-optimus-prime-soundwave-bumblebee-2-in-1-building-sets/1100-6509331/">Lego Transformers Bumblebee Gets First Solid Price Cut At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (4)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xenoblade-chronicles-series-nintendo-switch-best-deals/1100-6535432/">Two Xenoblade Chronicles Games Get Rare Discounts At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-spider-man-magic-the-gathering-trading-card-restock-amazon-preorder/1100-6529819/">Magic: The Gathering Spider-Man Booster Box Is Only $140 At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tolkien-lord-of-the-rings-illustrated-by-alan-lee-deluxe-book-box-set-amazon-walmart-deals/1100-6525568/">The $325 Lord Of The Rings Illustrated Box Set Is Still On Sale For Only $108</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-preorder/1100-6529762/">Pokemon Legends: Z-A Preorder Guide - Target Reveals Exclusive Launch Bonus</a></li>   </ul> </div>

			<p>There's no denying that Battlefield 6 has had a massive launch, one week into the game being on shelves. Even <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/battlefield-6-troubleshooting-guide-how-to-fix-common-pc-errors/">amidst issues for PC players</a> and progression frustration, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-clamping-down-battlefield-6-xp-farms-portal-increasing-xp-gained-in-matches/">EA and Battlefield Studios have acted quickly to address</a>, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-sold-over-7-million-units-3-days-biggest-franchise-launch/">officially sold over 7 million units in its first three days</a>, making it the biggest franchise launch ever, according to EA. On top of that, a new GSD data sales report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/battlefield-6-launch-sales-bigger">The Game Business</a> reveals it's already won a point against its ongoing and rejuvenized battle with Call of Duty.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/data-key-facts/games-sales-data/">Game Sales Data (GSD)</a> under Video Games Europe tracks software units sold for both retail and digital sales in regions across the EU, Africa, and Australia, and in its latest report for sales from October 5-12, it shows that Battlefield 6 was at the top of the charts for unit sales and revenue per GSD's tracking, with the latest entry in the long-running shooter achieving four times the launch sales of Battlefield V, and beating out the EU launch sales for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>As The Game Business points out, last year's Call of Duty was the first one to be available day one to Xbox Game Pass subscribers, which does skew the launch numbers from that of <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-launching-on-game-pass-seems-to-have-paid-off-for-xbox-but-not-call-of-duty/">a year when Call of Duty was not available on a subscription service</a>. </p>



<p>That said, with Xbox seemingly committed to having Call of Duty as <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">part of the list of premium releases Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers get</a>, especially since Xbox needs something to try and convince people Ultimate is worth $30 a month, Call of Duty available through Game Pass right away seems to be the new normal.</p>



<p>That's all to say that this is still a sign of just how successful of a launch Battlefield 6 is having, especially if it's already showing it can best the current standard of Call of Duty releases on the commercial charts. Of course, the launch of Black Ops 7 will be a greater test, since, realistically, there could be a chunk of Battlefield 6 players who've bought in just to get their fix until Black Ops 7 launches. Combined with the players who don't buy anything every year except for the new Call of Duty game, it's very possible that Battlefield 6 falls short of Call of Duty in terms of sales.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the GSD charts, EA (the publisher) held on to the number one and two spots in the units sold and revenue charts, with Battlefield 6 in first and EA Sports FC 26 in second. Behind it was PlayStation's Ghost of Yotei, followed by Little Nightmares III, for both charts. </p>



<p>It's only in the fifth position that the units sold and revenue earned charts differ, with Red Dead Redemption 2 making the units sold charts fifth place, and Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 making the revenue charts. However, specifically with Super Mario Galaxy, it's worth noting that digital sales numbers for Nintendo games are not available, since Nintendo only shares physical numbers.</p>



<p>Here's the full top 10 list for GSD's units sold and revenue charts, per The Game Business.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-rotom-phone-review-better-camera-higher-jumps.1328173/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Though the <em>Pokémon </em>games’ Rotom Phones haven’t really changed all that much design-wise over the past few years, each generation has introduced new functionalities that made upgrading a no-brainer. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962722/pokemon-sword-shield-review-nintendo-switch-launch-date"><em>Sword </em>/ <em>Shield</em>’s</a> Rotom Phone — the very first one — came with a bare-bones camera that made it easy to snap wide-angle (screen)shots out in the Galar region’s Wild Area. The second-generation Rotom Phone’s camera in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2022/11/18/23461245/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-rotom-phone-review-pokedex"><em>Scarlet </em>/ <em>Violet</em></a> was a significant improvement, but the device’s real standout feature was its ability to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2022/11/18/23461245/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-rotom-phone-review-pokedex">keep you from plummeting to your death</a> if you fell from a great height.</p><p>While neither of the early Rotom Phones were as visually interesting as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22898939/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em></a>’ Arc Phone, they both spoke to how the <em>Pokémon </em>universe’s consumer tech has become increasingly streamlined and robust. That trend continues in <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>with a new Rotom Phone that feels like it was designed for urban exploration.</p><p>Like its predecessors, the third-gen Rotom Phone’s conservative design is a reminder of how <em>Pokémon</em>’s gadgets have lost some of their personality in the time since Pokédexes went from being physical objects to downloadable applications. But what the new phone lacks in aesthetic flair, it makes up for with improved hardware and a couple of fresh tricks — including one that makes leaping across rooftops a snap — that make it a must-have for anyone <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637256/pokemon-legends-z-a-trailer-day-night-cycle">visiting present-day Lumiose City</a>.</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODAxNzU4"><p><span>$<!-- -->0</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Hands-free usability is more robust</li><li>More functional camera array with zoom</li><li>Roto-Glide is a game-changer</li><li>Excellent call quality and battery life</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Physical design is getting a little long in the tooth</li><li>No accessories</li><li>Might not work outside of the Kalos region</li><li>No snazzy Pokédex art</li><li>Still can’t send your helper Rotom into battle</li></ul></div></div></div><p>As nice as it was to see <em>Scarlet </em>/<em> Violet</em>’s Rotom Phone come with a second lens, one of the most frustrating things about the device was that there was no way to zoom in on things from a distance while you were wandering around Paldea. That second lens seemed like it didn’t really <em>do </em>anything. You had to get physically close to wild pokémon and <em>then </em>open up the camera app in order to take eye-catching photos of them, which made it very easy to wind up getting attacked. That would have been a nonstarter in <em>Z-A</em>’s Lumiose, where unpartnered monsters will go out of their way to fight humans without hesitation.</p><p>But in addition to adding a handy new zoom feature by way of a third (very functional) lens, the new Rotom Phone’s back-facing camera array can also be used while you are moving — something that opens up a new world of possibilities for trainers who fancy themselves shutterbugs. It’s easy to post up in Lumiose’s Wild Zones, hide in the tall grass, and snap photos of wild pokémon without them being aware of your presence. And being able to move while you’re using the back cameras also makes it relatively simple to get the hell out of dodge in instances when something does catch sight of you and decides to launch an attack. (You do still have to remain still while you’re using the new Rotom Phone’s improved front-facing camera, though.)</p><p>While the new Rotom Phone’s front-facing camera can be used for video calls, when you try to take a selfie, the electric / ghost pokémon living within the device will automatically activate the back-facing cameras and turn the handheld around. Previously you had to hold the second-generation phone in your hand or with a selfie stick in order to capture pics of yourself with your favorite partner pokémon. But the new phone’s resident Rotom can be directed to move the device around while taking pictures from various angles and distances, which gives you the ability to strike a pose hands-free.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->5</strong><span><figcaption>A pride of sleeping Pyroar.</figcaption> <cite>Image: Nintendo</cite></span></p></section><p>This is especially useful if you’ve downloaded the app to participate in Lumiose’s Z-A Royale and want to update your profile picture to something emotive. One major drawback, though, is that the new possessed phone requires you to stay still while you’re directing it to take pictures of you. Using the phone’s limited selection of built-in music, you can coax your pokémon to sleep or get it worked up before you snap a candid or dramatic photo. None of the third-gen Rotom Phone’s built-in filters are all that great, but it’s easy enough to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/676287/nintendo-switch-2-mobile-app-screenshots-backup-upload">transfer them to another device</a> if you want to do some artistic post-processing of your own.</p><p>Along with the Z-A Royale hub, an updated, Lumiose-specific Pokédex is the new Rotom Phone’s most useful application. It does all the basic ’dex stuff like track how many pokémon you’ve seen and caught, where specific species live within the city, and how they move. It also features a separate listing of pokémon with Mega Evolved forms, but what’s great about this version of the Pokédex is that it gives every pokémon that you can catch its own unique entry, which was not the case on the last Rotom Phone for some reason.</p><p>Unfortunately, the new Pokédex does not display the same kind of fancy artwork for monsters that <em>Scarlet </em>/<em> Violet</em>’s did. But the new interface is cleaner, more intuitive to use, and does away with the last generation’s excess skeuomorphism. The default map application also provides you with helpful information about which pokémon appear in Lumiose’s Wild Zones, where Z-A Royale battle zones pop up, and details about locations like shopping centers and Pokémon Centers.</p><p>By far, the new Roto-Glide functionality is what sets this generation of Rotom Phone apart from others. The last phone featured a safe-landing mode that activated whenever it detected that you had suddenly fallen a considerable distance. Roto-Glide builds on that idea by giving you a brief boost up when you jump from a ledge, which enables you to do a kind of bounce through the air. It’s ideal for leaping across rooftops or completing some of Lumiose’s many scaffolding obstacle courses.</p><p>Like the Arc Phone and both of the other Rotom Phones, the new model has fantastic battery life and call reception — at least within Lumiose City. I haven’t been able to test the phone out beyond the city’s limits, and it’s not clear whether this model would work outside of the Kalos region. I also wasn’t able to figure out how to activate the phone’s wide-screen tablet mode, but other people seem to enjoy it. The thing runs like a dream, though.</p><p>My biggest issue with the third-gen Rotom Phone is that it does not seem as if there are all that many (if any) cool accessories to help you make it feel more personal. The device appears to come in a variety of colors, like red, blue, yellow, white, and a stony gray. But it would have been great to see this model get some of the nifty phone cases that can be purchased across Paldea.</p><p>Roto-Glide aside, the new Rotom Phone is a somewhat incremental upgrade if you’re coming from the last generation, but you will need one if you really want to get the most out of your time in Lumiose City. The beefed-up camera alone makes this a much more useful tool to have as you embark on your next <em>Pokémon </em>journey, and if there are some stylish accessories <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pokemon/777169/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-nmega-raichu">in the pipeline</a>, the device will be damn near perfect.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTE="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Charles Pulliam-Moore</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/801113/pokemon-legends-za-rotom-phone-pokedex-review]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-rog-xbox-ally-x-pc-gaming-handheld-comparison-2000636643</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-switch-2-holding-its-own-against-a-top-pc-gaming-handheld-feels-like-a-small-miracle.1328167/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over the last couple of days I’ve seen some people using the Switch 2 <a href="https://x.com/Omnipotentgam0r/status/1978596002836734372">as a cudgel</a> with which to knock down <a href="https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-review-performance-issues-steam-deck-switch-2-2000635652">the new ROG Xbox Ally X</a>. And admittedly, comparisons of games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> running on both certainly don’t look nearly as stark as the price difference between the two handhelds. However, I don’t see that as a loss for the new premium PC gaming handheld so much as a win for Nintendo’s latest console.</p> <p>I’ve been going back and replaying a fair bit of CD Projekt Red’s 2020 open-world RPG on both machines and frequently find myself straining to feel a significant difference. I run through the streets of the <em>Phantom Liberty</em> expansion’s Dog Town on the Xbox Ally X using AMD’s recommended settings and the in-game graphics on high while in the performance power mode. I get 40-50fps, the lighting looks decent, and the textures are just detailed and clean enough to not draw my eye, letting me stay immersed in the world and action.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636661" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636661"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636661"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on the Ally X (left) and Switch 2 (right)</figcaption></figure> <p>Then I move over to Switch 2 thanks to the (occasionally finnicky) cloudsave syncing feature. While <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> will run around 40fps in performance mode on Nintendo’s hybrid handheld, I don’t find the extra smoothness that worth it. Instead, I prefer the extra layer of clarity and visual vibrancy from the quality graphics mode. The action is still smooth. The world feels much the same. Pretty soon I can barely remember what looked different with the game running on the Xbox Ally X, let alone worry about going back to the more powerful hardware.</p>

 <p>I’ve spent more than a few minutes scrutinizing a handful of screenshots of the game running on both devices and man, it takes some effort to start spotting the differences.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000636659" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636659"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636659">CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000636660" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636660"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636660">CD Projekt Red / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Can you tell which is which? Stare long enough and you’ll start to see some bits of the second image that look a little less distinct, especially the farther you go into the background. The shadows and lighting aren’t as smoothly mixed in the second one either. After a few moments of intently searching it for imperfection, you might, like me, come away thinking it just looks a bit more&nbsp;<em>brittle</em> overall. The second image is indeed from the Switch 2 running the game in handheld mode. Does it look $550 worse? Not even close.</p>

 <p>The Switch 2 version of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> also seems to hold up pretty well in certain comparisons. There’s less detail. The framerate is worse. But it’s not necessarily <em>that</em> much less detail, or<em> that</em> much worse of a framerate.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">More comparisons of ROG Ally X vs Switch 2,for Star Wars Outlaws and Hogwarts legacy. Switch 2 again for the most part obliterating the ROG in image fidelity.<br>Switch 2 is also rumored to be getting an upgrade for its DLSS tech soon,so it’ll get even better<a href="https://t.co/cL3iRC5hOb">https://t.co/cL3iRC5hOb</a> <a href="https://t.co/PXIfyeidOb">https://t.co/PXIfyeidOb</a> <a href="https://t.co/mnGEstkn5A">pic.twitter.com/mnGEstkn5A</a></p> <p>— 💫Sonicpulsar💫 (@sonicpulsar) <a href="https://twitter.com/sonicpulsar/status/1978717824341119479?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s weird to see Nintendo hardware holding its own rather than fighting for its life against more powerful alternatives. For now, at least, the Switch 2 feels more than just “good enough.”</p>

 <p>Now comparing the Switch 2 to the Xbox Ally X isn’t completely apples-to-apples. The Asus-made, Xbox-branded handheld has a slightly smaller screen, it runs Windows, and it plays tons more games that weren’t painstakingly optimized for it like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> was for the Switch 2. The fact that a five-year-old game doesn’t look lightyears better on the one doesn’t completely disqualify it.</p>

 <p>The new Ally X also affords a prospective user all sorts of options and perks that the Switch 2 doesn’t, not least of all a pair of ergonomic grips and thumbsticks that actually feel great to hold and use right out of the box. There are also plenty of moments when it does look distinctly superior, in addition to having access to a vast library of PC games that might never come to Nintendo’s platform.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636663" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636663"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636663"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on the Xbox Ally X.</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000636662" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636662"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636662"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on the Switch 2 (handheld performance mode)</figcaption></figure> <p>But the match-up does suggest a promising future for the Switch 2. We’ll have to see how the the finished port of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> runs on it when it arrives early next year, but what I tested back in August felt similarly impressive. <em>Borderlands 4</em> and <em>Elden Ring</em> might also shape up nicely. And given its success with<em> Star Wars Outlaws</em>, I’m expecting the recently leaked port of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> on Switch 2 to be impressive as well.</p> <p>Look, this is only the first year of the Switch 2’s life. We could be in a situation come 2027 where most new blockbusters still have to skip Nintendo’s platform, or rely on ports that are so compromised they can’t be confidently recommended to anyone but the most desperate Switch 2 owner with nowhere else to play.</p> <p>That’s certainly how it felt with games like<em> The Witcher 3</em> and <em>The Outer Worlds</em> on the original Switch. Those were fascinating experiments that reminded you how limited and dated the Switch hardware ultimately still was, at least for anyone working with it who wasn’t Nintendo. I hope we get a few good years on the Switch 2 before it arrives at a similar fate.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Escape from Tarkov’s Long-Awaited Console Version is Coming]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-console-version-coming/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov%E2%80%99s-long-awaited-console-version-is-coming.1328161/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recap video recorded from Tokyo Game Fest, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov spoke about the imminent future of Escape from Tarkov. The game is set to hit a 1.0 release on November 15, dropping on Steam and welcoming an entirely new audience into the scene.</p>



<p>Within that summing-up video, Nikita dropped a juicy tidbit and confirmed that the console version of Escape from Tarkov <strong>is being worked on</strong>, along with new games set in the Tarkov universe <strong>and </strong>DLC for EFT’s post-launch window.</p>



<h2 id="h-tarkov-is-finally-coming-to-console-but-when">Tarkov is Finally Coming to Console, But When?</h2>



<p>It’s impossible to say when Escape from Tarkov will arrive on console platforms, and when it does, we can’t predict what it’ll look like. Many have long believed that Escape from Tarkov will take a ‘lite’ form for console users, with Battlestate Games stripping back some of the complexity, which is better handled using a keyboard and mouse.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video, uploaded by Battlestate Games earlier today:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Battlestate Games at Tokyo Games Show 2025 | Aftermovie" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k3oWbSqk5WY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It’s only a snapshot reference, but at 02:10, Nikita says (while talking about what BSG is working on):</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Also, the console version, by the way.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That’s it—the truth of the matter from the horse’s mouth.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov has been going for almost ten years, and for the last <strong>eight </strong>of those, it has sat in a beta state, with Battlestate making many tweaks and issuing content drops every six months or so. It’s all coming to a head next month when Escape from Tarkov <strong>finally </strong>hits 1.0, becoming established as a ‘fully released’ game.</p>



<p>That immense update will usher in a new map, fresh factions, and even a linear story that will see players finally escape from Tarkov, securing one of <strong>four endings</strong>.</p>



<p>How do you feel about a possible release of Escape from Tarkov on consoles? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what you’re thinking.</p>

The <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CT68G1TP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Atari Gamestation Go</a></strong> is a 7-inch handheld with over 200 games and a few unique control methods, including a paddle, trak-ball, and even a numeric keypad. Retro enthusiasts interested in the Gamestation Go may want to secure one soon. Preorders for the $180 portable are sold out on Atari's website, but you can still snag one from Amazon ahead of its October 31 launch.</p><p>The Atari Gamestation Go releases the same day as the the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atari-2600-pac-man-edition-console-wireless-joystick-bandai-namco-game-preorders/1100-6533716/" data-ref-id="1100-6533716">Pac-Man Edition of the cartridge-based Atari 2600+</a>.

On the left side of the handheld, you'll find a D-pad, trak-ball, and integrated paddle. Below the four face buttons on the right side is a 12-button numeric keypad with 0-9 as well as the number sign and asterisk. It also has four shoulder buttons.</p><p>Atari 8-bit and 16-bit games made use of a variety of controllers, and the Gamestation Go looks to offer the most comprehensive experience yet in a handheld form factor. One interesting feature is called SmartGlow, which illuminates the controls for each game you boot up.</p><p>The built-in game library includes a wide range of arcade and console games from the Atari 2600, 5200, 7800, and Atari Arcade. Notable publisher partnerships include Bandai Namco (Pac-Man), Jaleco, and Piko Interactive. It also comes with the modernized "Recharged" versions of five classics, including Asteroids and Centipede. Another highlight is Balls of Steel, a pinball game with seven different tables. The full list of games can be found on Amazon's store page.</p><p>The Gamestation Go's built-in 7-inch display looks nice in promotional videos and images, but if you want the home console experience, you can connect the included HDMI cable to your TV or monitor to game on a big screen.</p><p>It's unclear exactly which controllers will work with the Gamestation Go, but the handheld has a pair of USB-C ports on the back for multiplayer. We know My Arcade is making an official controller and joystick, but we'd expect the Gamestation Go to support other controllers similar to the Game Station Pro home console.</p></div>                      </div><div data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4724" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6535527 - My Arcade Atari Gamestation Pro" data-collection="" title="6535527 - My Arcade Atari Gamestation Pro">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade-Atari-Game-Station-Pro-2600/dp/B0BT36XWTS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Arcade-Atari-Game-Station-Pro-2600\/dp\/B0BT36XWTS?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade-Atari-Game-Station-Pro-2600/dp/B0BT36XWTS?tag=gamespot-promos-20">My Arcade Atari Gamestation Pro</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade-Atari-Game-Station-Pro-2600/dp/B0BT36XWTS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Arcade-Atari-Game-Station-Pro-2600\/dp\/B0BT36XWTS?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade-Atari-Game-Station-Pro-2600/dp/B0BT36XWTS?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$80 (was $100)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Atari Gamestation Pro is My Arcade's dedicated home console.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dreamcore-indie-horror-liminal-backrooms-scary-2000636645</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/one-of-the-creepiest-games-of-the-year-is-pure-vibes-no-jump-scares.1328128/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you dig strolling through empty, abandoned places, immersing yourself in some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Backrooms">backrooms vibes</a>, and enjoying all that’s weird and liminal, then do I have a game to recommend for you. <i>Dreamcore</i> came out in January of this year and it’s a perfectly good time if you love spooky vibes but aren’t too jazzed about screaming monsters and jumpscares.</p>  <p>Developed by Montralulz, <i>Dreamcore</i> is a directionless, HUD-free wandersim that takes you through strange, abandoned levels that almost feel endless. The game intentionally tries to make you feel lost with its lack of clear-cut instructions on what to do. Strange symbols written on walls, seemingly innocuous signs, odd music, and audio cues are the only thing you’re given to figure out where to go and what to do.</p>

 <p>The levels are so massive, in fact, that I’m thinking I might need to keep some graph paper nearby to map out these spaces. I’ve only completed one level thus far, “Dreampools” which is a labyrinth of tiled walls, random pools, and the uncanny use of diffused lighting that often makes those <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-graphics-mods-pc-rtx-4090-1851133618">wild <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i> mods</a> or the <a href="https://kotaku.com/better-than-dead-trailer-controversial-bodycam-microprose-2000617981">odd bodycam-footage game</a> look disturbingly close to reality.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636652" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636652"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636652">© Screenshot: Montraluz / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>And though the game has no jumpscares, it’s still plenty capable of freaking you out–especially with some of the odd objects you’ll come across, like a massive smiley-face ball that, while certainly not intimidating, just feels…wrong. Is it watching me?</p>

 <p>With so few things to actually do in these spaces other than walk around, the real challenge here is not losing your mind and staying focused on slowly unraveling where you should go, following what looks interesting in the hope that you’ll find something unique. It reminds me a bit of <i>The Stanley Parable</i>, but with far simpler environments and the narrative elements ripped out. You often have the sense you’re being watched, that maybe someone’s been here before, and that there’s something you <i>should</i> do, but you can’t quite put your finger on it.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636647" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636647"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636647">© Screenshot: Montraluz / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>There are currently three worlds to explore: the aforementioned “Dreampools,” an endless expanse of empty suburban homes and white picket fences in “Eternal Suburbia,” and “Playrooms,” described as “a sequence of spaces inspired by children’s play areas, recreated with an artificial and silent aesthetic.” More levels are on the way.</p> <p>So if the spooky season has you in the mood for exploring some creepy spaces without things screaming in your face, and you like a bit of the avant garde, <i>Dreamcore</i> might just be up your alley.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[13 Things To Know Before Starting Pokémon Legends: Z-A]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-tips-guide-battle-shiny-wild-zone-2000636641</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/13-things-to-know-before-starting-pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a.1328125/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>makes some pretty notable changes to the series’ typical formula. Its battles take place in real-time, it makes the Mega Evolution mechanic a cooldown, and it has several different mission types to juggle while you’re catching and training monsters. That means even series veterans are starting from zero on some things, so before you head into Lumiose City, here are a few helpful tips to make the most of your stay at Hotel Z.</span></p> <h2><b>Read up on </b><b><i>Pokémon X</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Y</i></b><b>’s story</b></h2> <p><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is essentially a direct sequel to 2013’s </span><i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>. The entire game takes place in Lumiose City, a Paris-inspired metropolis you pass through in the original 3DS RPGs. There are returning characters and storylines that come up in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s stories and sidequests, so if you’ve never played through the original Kalos games or haven’t played them in a while, I recommend either reading a summary or watching a recap as a refresher. That way, you’ll know why it’s significant that AZ is running your hotel, or that Emma has a full-time detective job, among other bigger reveals later on.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636650" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636650"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636650">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Prepare yourself: This game is handholdy for a while</b></h2> <p><span>Sometimes I wish </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games would give me the option to interrupt NPCs with a Ron Swanson </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEhHEOIYgMY"><span>“I know more than you”</span></a><span> when they insist on tutorializing every little thing. Like, aw, you think I don’t know what a Potion is, or that I’m not on a first-name basis with every Nurse Joy from here to Kanto? And</span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s tutorial is particularly time-consuming, essentially taking up hours. You’ll be dragged around the city by your companions for several in-game days as you’re taught the ins and outs of everything </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>has to offer. Your Rotom phone will stop you from venturing too far from the intended path, and it will get very, very frustrating. But when it comes to an end, the rest of the city is open to you right off the bat.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Your moves do different things than you’re used to</b></h2> <p><span>Since </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>has a real-time battle system, some classic attacks have been tweaked to fit this new setup. For example, buff moves that once affected your Pokémon for a certain number of turns are now calculated in real-time, lasting however many seconds rather than turns. As you teach your party new moves, familiarize yourself with how they work in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, because they might be slightly different than what you’re used to.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Positioning and timing are everything</b></h2> <p><span>When you give your Pokémon commands, they will move to somewhere on the field that puts them in the right spot to execute the attack based on your opponent’s current position. However, if your opponent moves out of the way, the attack will miss. So rather than accuracy being determined by backend dice rolls, you see the attack land or not as you’re executing it. As such, a big part of learning how to best utilize every attack in your arsenal is understanding where you should be standing when you use it, and keeping an eye on your opponent’s maneuvers and cooldowns to make sure it’s timed well. Some enemies know moves like Protect that will shield them from your attacks, but they will be on a cooldown, so if you can bait your opponent into using it on a weaker move, you’ll have an opening for a counterattack.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636648" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636648"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636648">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Find attack orders that act as combos</b></h2> <p><span>This new position-based gameplay means that simply attacking at random and cycling through your cooldowns is not always the best play. As you cultivate your Pokémon’s movesets, finding attacks that can synergize together to create combos can help you get the leg up on your opponents. For example, right now, my Pikachu knows Quick Attack, Nuzzle, and Spark. One of my go-to strategies in battles is to have him use Quick Attack to get in close to an enemy, use that closeness to Nuzzle them into a paralyzed state, then use Spark to run out of the fight with a destructive, electric dash. This combo lets Pikachu be a bit of a hit-and-run character that can get in, do some damage, then retreat to safety. Knowing how your moves can work together is just as important as type coverage, and discovering those will take some experimentation.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Stop locking on as a pseudo dodge</b></h2> <p><span>To target enemies on the field, you’ll have to lock onto them with ZL. Doing this will make your active Pokémon square up against whoever you’re looking at, and they’ll stay relatively close to this foe so they’re ready to execute any commands you give them. If you find your partner is getting slapped around and should get out of the scrap, simply stop locking onto an enemy, and your Pokémon will run back to your side. Make sure you’re also out of the way of whatever attack is incoming, too, though.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>You can reach any clothing store once you have free rein&nbsp;</b></h2> <p><span>The fashion in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is pretty great. It’s a definite upgrade from </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, which forced all of us to wear school uniforms. New fits are expensive, but the game is pretty generous about letting you buy whatever clothes you want pretty quickly. Once you’re able to freely roam Lumiose City, you can reach every store without issue. Make a shopping day of running around the city and trying stuff on. Clothes are no longer gender-locked in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, either, so you can wear whatever you want.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000636651" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636651"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636651">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>You’ll unlock time skip later</b></h2> <p><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>loves to withhold basic functions for several gameplay hours, including a time skip feature that lets you skip to the night of its day/night cycle. You can only engage in trainer battles during the night, and some wild Pokémon only come out when the sun is gone, so there will be times when you wish you could just sit on a bench and wait for nightfall. I can tell you that you will be able to do that eventually, but for the first few hours, you’ll get an in-game warning that it’s not the time to be resting every time you try and sit down. Once you’re able to sit on a bench without someone yelling, you’ll be able to skip to evenings or hang out with your Pokémon friends on the bench and take photos.</span></p> <h2><b>If you haven’t heard already, Shiny Pokémon don’t despawn</b></h2> <p><span>Shiny Pokémon just became a lot easier to capture in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, and it’s because they <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-shiny-hunting-despawn-sound-effect-2000636142">no longer despawn</a>. These alternate-colored monsters have a low spawn rate, but in Lumiose City, they’ll stay on the map until you either defeat them or capture them, rather than disappearing as the map refreshes. You can lose a battle, leave a wild zone, or shut the game down entirely, and Shinies will be right where you left them. The hunters have </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-shiny-despawn-afk-exploit-wild-zone-2000636610"><span>already been exploiting this</span></a><span>, but even if you’re a casual Shiny collector, this will be helpful to your efforts.</span></p>

 <h2><b>More Wild Zones will open as the game progresses</b></h2> <p><span>Though you can go just about anywhere in Lumiose City early on, you won’t find some of your favorite Pokémon right off the bat. The Wild Zone areas where Pokémon reside will open up as you progress through the story, and later ones will feature monsters you couldn’t find in the early hours. It does mean that popular Pokémon aren’t available until much later, so if you can’t find a specific one, just know that more of these zones will appear as you keep going.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000636649" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636649"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636649">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Some story missions pause the day/night cycle</b></h2> <p><span>This isn’t a foolproof rule, but it’s something I noticed when I was running around Lumiose City and hadn’t received any notifications that the sun was getting low and the metropolis would turn into a battle zone. I had been neglecting a story mission that was set to take place during the day to do some side quests; then, when it dawned on me that time hadn’t passed, I realized the game world’s clock had seemingly been frozen until I went to deliver a package to a friend. Sure enough, the sun started setting shortly after I completed the quest. I tested this on a later story mission and noticed the sun was moving as it should, so this isn’t a universal truth. Just keep in mind that sometimes you might need to finish a story mission before the evening will come, or you can use it to your advantage to keep the sun shining while you run some daytime errands.</span></p>

These guys are keeping the city clean by picking up trash and spare Poké Balls that hooligans leave lying around the city. If you throw one of these capturing devices and miss, or a Pokémon breaks out of its hold, these guys will be holding onto them at the Center. Before you go stocking up on Poké Balls, check in with them to see if they have any of your litter on hand. </span></p>

<p>Are you a fan of horror stories set in a post-apocalyptic world where survival through the night is considered a luxury? If so, then Radiant Residents in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jump-and-splash-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> is a game you should check out immediately. Players are given 60 seconds to search a house for any important resources they can find, after which they are moved into a nuclear bunker. The main objective of the game is to survive for as long as possible in the bunker using the resources you recovered from the house. As easy as that sounds, there are some external factors that will almost definitely affect how long you survive. Players are required to manage hunger, thirst, and overall sanity, while also facing the constant threat of monsters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have plenty of Sanity Points to expend during your stay in the bunker, then buying the required resources and keeping everyone in the bunker will be a cakewalk. However, acquiring Sanity Points in the game is not a simple task. Moreover, some additional money never hurt anybody, and that’s where the magic of the Radiant Residents codes comes into the picture. Radiant Residents codes can be used to get extra Sanity Points, which in a post-apocalyptic world could be the difference between life and death.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-radiant-residents-codes">How To Redeem Radiant Residents Codes</h2>



<p>Unlike many Roblox games nowadays, which force players to perform specific tasks before they’re given access to the code redemption feature, Radiant Residents gives its players the freedom to redeem codes without hassle. It’s as simple as navigating through the menus and inputting one of the active codes into the correct text box. When done right, the entire process takes less than two minutes. If you’re new to the game, here’s a step-by-step guide that you can follow to redeem Radiant Residents codes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Launch Roblox and open up Radiant Residents</li>



<li>Click the purple ‘Open Shop’ button on the right side</li>

<li>Hit the ‘Enter’ key to redeem your rewards</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-radiant-residents-codes">How to get more Radiant Residents Codes</h2>



<p>New Radiant Residents codes are released by the developers during events and updates, so it’s likely not too long before more codes drop. These Radiant Residents codes are often released to players through either the game’s Discord server or the developers’ social media accounts. As useful as these codes can be, having to go and manually find the latest codes can be a bit of a hassle, so bookmarking this page might be a good idea. We update the article as soon as any new codes drop, so it can be your one-stop shop for all the latest Radiant Residents codes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you don’t have too much social anxiety and enjoy engaging with strangers while making new friends, all of this while looking your best, then Berry Avenue might be worth checking out. Berry Avenue is a role-playing game on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jump-and-splash-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> platform that places a significant emphasis on fashion. The game lets players get creative with their outfits, in that there are extensive clothing options. Although plenty of items are unlockable by simply playing the game and collecting resources, some free stuff to bolster players’ wardrobes certainly wouldn’t go amiss. Berry Avenue has a large open world map for players to explore, including detailed buildings and services like hospitals, schools, shops, and more. Berry Avenue even allows players to drive cars around the map, making it essentially a life simulator game, albeit on the Roblox platform.&nbsp;</p>

Dandy's World already launched its Halloween content last week, adding new Halloween toons, skins, and a limited-time Halloween floor. You can expect to see <a href="https://www.roblox.com/events/8910346076099969655" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">even more skins</a> arrive in today's update.</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Looking for </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dandys-world-codes"><strong>Dandy's World codes</strong></a><strong>?

For the unfamiliar, the game involves trying to keep your character fed, warm, and sheltered while you rescue missing children and avoid a dangerous deer-like entity at night. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, the game is also keen to get into the Halloween spirit. <a href="https://www.roblox.com/events/8114024574934057586" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Halloween: Week 1</a> begins in 99 Nights in the Forest on Saturday, October 18th.

In typical GaG fashion, the event will be extended and continue for a second week. Though it's not clear yet what this will involve, you can always expect new seeds, pets, weather events, and admin abuse before the event starts.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Steal a Brainrot Update</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/sab-roundup-1760709127161.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Steal a Brainrot is a particularly popular Roblox experience where you'll need to capture Brainrots from a conveyor belt and keep them locked away from other players. You can steal Brainrots and have your Brainrots stolen, so we advise you stick close to that lockdown button if you want to protect your Secret Brainrots. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Following on from last week's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/steal-a-brainrot/Witch_Fuse_Update">Witch Fuse event</a>, Steal a Brainrot is launching another update this weekend. Last week, there were new Halloween fusions and themed Brainrots, with La Spooky Grande available to those who collected all four Spooky Brainrots. The details for the <a href="https://www.roblox.com/events/8532495578259260020" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">next update</a> haven't been revealed yet, but we're hoping it continues the spooky theme.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Plants vs Brainrots Update</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/pvbroundupo-1760709173536.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This experience, which is a fusion of Grow a Garden, Steal a Brainrot, and Plants Vs Zombies, has quickly climbed the Roblox charts and is regularly releasing new content. In this game, you'll plant seeds that attack Brainrots, helping you capture them. As you earn money, you can unlock better plants and take down rarer Brainrots. Last weekend PVB launched the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/plants-vs-brainrots/How_to_Get_Cards">Cards Update</a>, and this weekend will also introduce new content. While no details have been revealed, it's claiming to be an "<a href="https://www.roblox.com/events/854537099309482613" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">epic update</a>", so watch this space. </p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Grab yourself some money and gear with our </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/plants-vs-brainrots-codes"><strong>Plants Vs Brainrots Codes</strong></a><strong>.</strong></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">Fisch Update</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/fischfright-1760709224673.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The fishing simulator with over 400,000+ variations to collect is also joining in with the seasonal fun and launching <a href="https://www.roblox.com/events/2968047596632539696" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FischFright</a>. Considering some of the things that lurk at the bottom of the ocean, there's plenty of opportunity for Fisch to include some truly terrifying specimens.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Sunday October 19th Roblox Updates:</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Sunday is a quieter day for Roblox updates. There's just one major update we can see taking place from one of the top experiences, and that's Fish It!</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Fish It! Update</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/fishit-1760709285774.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Who knew that the people playing Roblox were so into fishing? Fish It! is similar to Fisch, but offers a few more variations for you to collect (1,000,000+ to be a bit more exact). If you want a double dose of scary fishing experiences this weekend, then Fish It! rounds off the week with their <a href="https://www.roblox.com/events/8174015307124048435" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Halloween Event</a>. </p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>If you need some extra luck and potions, see our</strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fish-it-codes"><strong> Fish It!

For those not familiar, PDP released the same guitar for Xbox and PlayStation consoles previously – <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pdp-riffmaster-wireless-guitar-controller-review">IGN gave a great review</a> to the PlayStation version, in fact. Like those controllers, this one costs $149.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new controller can hold a connection up to 30 feet from a Switch or Switch 2, and gets up to 36 hours of play time on a charge. (It's rechargeable via USB-C.) Like the other iterations of this controller, it's collapsible and ships with a shoulder strap. The Riffmaster has an analog stick, strum bar, whammy bar, and 10 fretboard buttons – five at the top of the neck and five more near the body for all those sick shreds you'll be doing. On the pickguard – that's the part that holds the strum and whammy bars – there's also a Home button, plus and minus button, capture button, and d-pad.

Plus, it's a cheaper controller, <a href="https://crkd.gg/products/lp-black-tribal-multi-platform" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">starting at $114.99</a> for the multi-platform (read: Switch-compatible) Encore Edition. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The PDP Riffmaster Wireless Guitar Controller for the Switch and Switch 2 is available now at Turtle Beach's website or on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Riffmaster-Wireless-Controller-Nintendo-Gaming-Console/dp/B0FTZV2JHG" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a> for $149.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wes is a freelance writer (Freelance Wes, they call him) who has covered technology, gaming, and entertainment steadily since 2020 at Gizmodo, Tom's Hardware, Hardcore Gamer, and most recently, The Verge.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-yotei/">Ghost of Yotei</a> wastes no time drawing you in. Set amid the beauty of feudal Ezo, its tale of revenge soon gives way to something deeper--a journey of healing and reflection for its protagonist, Atsu.</p><p>Revenge and grief are still powerful motivators in the game, and these are grim themes that PlayStation gamers might be familiar with, thanks to titles like The Last of Us Part 2 and God of War Ragnarok. So what is it about the cycle of violence and anguish that makes it so appealing to developers, who have all put their own stamps on these ideas?</p><p>Speaking to GameSpot, Ghost of Yotei lead writer Ian Ryan and creative director Jason Connell explained how Atsu's quest might have started with revenge in mind, but over the course of the game, evolved into something greater.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIH3Efr6OOk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BIH3Efr6OOk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2>"It's about healing--revenge just sets it off"</h2><p>"I feel like there are a lot of different types of games--that even within Sony--that don't touch revenge at all, but there are some that are about revenge," Connell said. "I can't really speak to why they do it, but I will say some of the reasons why we chose it, and I think some of those will have overlap and I bet some of them won't have any at all. So, for example, it's hard to imagine that any other Sony game has been looking at a bunch of samurai films with revenge [themes] and decided that it was something that they were inspired by. But I could imagine that the second reason, we were going for a game that was going to be very open, a lot of freedom."</p><p>"I've seen people play 40 or 50 hours and haven't gotten to the second Yotei Six member. That is by design. Like we've made the game to be this way, but that really meant that we needed a very simple narrative hook that could get you, propel you into Atsu's journey, and some people are just going to go do it and find out it's a lot more than that. It's about healing--revenge just sets it off. And the people that don't, like, at least you understand that it's not like a hyper-complex thing to understand early on.</p><p>"And I do imagine that it can probably be appealing to storytellers, because storytelling is hard enough as it is, but you put it inside of a giant video game. Both progression, open-world exploration, and all these other competing elements can be really challenging. So the simplicity of it is really beautiful, and I think there's probably something that's very attractive to creators."</p><h2>"We wanted to kind of plant that fire in the player"</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4586726-img_6390.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586726" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4586726-img_6390.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4586726"></a><figcaption>Ezo is a land of unrivaled beauty in Ghost of Yotei.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4586726-img_6390.jpg"></figure><p>Ryan added that themes of revenge were useful in that they allowed players to hit the ground running, keeping them engaged from the very start of the game. "It's similar in that as we're approaching the story and we know it's going to be so wide, that we just want the player to be able to keep that, track that in their head, and, and not lose sight of that kind of overriding objective and emotional core to what Atsu is going through, even as she's following the golden bird to do any number of of side stories," Ryan said.</p><p>"We also wanted a smaller opening overall so that players could engage in the gameplay and get to the open world early. And part of that means also that we wanted to players to lock into and relate to that core overriding goal. It is just such a visceral, human desire that does have deep roots everywhere."</p><p>"Everyone can relate to it--just to varying degrees--and so we wanted to kind of plant that fire in the player and create that connection with Atsu, that they could carry it out into the open world even if they decided not to engage in the revenge quest for 30 hours, because ultimately going off and doing other things is a form of healing and not getting into that obsession."</p><p>Connell and Ryan had lots more to say about the game, and if you're interested in exploring just how the memorable roster of villains--the Yotei Six led by Lord Saito--helped shape the game, you can watch the video above for fascinating insight on Ghost of Yotei's development.</p><p>"Ghost of Yotei is shaped by Atsu, its new protagonist, as you're propelled on a gripping tale of revenge amidst the backdrop of Feudal Japan's contrasting beauty and violence," Richard Wakeling wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghost-of-yotei-review-lone-wolf/1900-6418414/" data-ref-id="1900-6418414">Ghost of Yotei review</a>.</p>

                <p>When <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft's</a> new expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-world-of-warcraft-midnight-whats-old-is-new-again/1100-6534043/">Midnight</a>, arrives this winter, it's going to allow everyone to get <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/housing-in-wow-will-be-available-to-everyone-wont-come-with-exorbitant-requirements/1100-6529278/" data-ref-id="1100-6529278">player housing</a>. Not every home is going to be created equal, but there's a way to get a leg up on your fellow players so you'll have a house full of furniture when the feature launches in early-access on December 2 for those who preorder Midnight.</p><p>Players can earn furniture by completing achievements, and it's all going to be awarded retroactively if you've already finished the ones you need. The full list of housing-related achievements was revealed on WoW's Public Test Realm, and now there's an add-on called <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/home-bound" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Home Bound</a> that makes it easier for everyone to see what they have to earn.</p><p>The add-on was created by a player called Bettiold, and it lays out over 100 different items--complete with 3D decor images--that can be earned by in-game achievements. Players can even filter out achievements they've already achieved to focus on the ones that they want.</p><p>To use the Home Bound add-on, download the file from CurseForge and follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Install Home Bound.</li><li>Once the game starts, type "/hb" or "/homebound" in chat.</li></ol><p>From there, players can browse achievements by category. Blizzard has previously revealed that there will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-will-include-a-level-up-system-and-neighborhood-wide-events/1100-6533095/" data-ref-id="1100-6533095">be neighborhood-wide events</a> called Endeavors, which will allow players to work together towards a common purpose and reap the rewards for cooperation.</p><p>The Midnight expansion is also doing away with combat add-ons, which has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-midnight-is-killing-part-of-the-game-before-its-ready/1100-6535418/" data-ref-id="1100-6535418">caused some concern among players</a> because the alpha build rendered nearly every piece of combat information invisible to add-ons without giving them a viable alternative.</p>

Some problems could block your progress in select missions permanently, but there's a new patch that has addressed many of these random occurrences, so you can keep clashing steel and hunting the Yotei Six without a hitch.</p><p>The team <a href="https://support.suckerpunch.com/hc/en-us/articles/42237189337499-Patch-1-010" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">dropped the patch notes for Update 1.010</a> on Sucker Punch Productions' official website. The patch stabilizes the game by fixing two rare crashes as well as swapping out placeholder assets during a major story beat. But those are somewhat small potatoes when compared to the myriad gameplay tweaks that make the game even more playable than it already is on PS5.</p>

<p>For instance, your progress could be blocked during "The Way of the Kusarigama" mission if you warped into it at a specific point. Or your progress could be halted if you ignored the "armor upgrade" scene and left the area during "The Tale of the Oni" mission. Heck, your progress could be barred if you created a campsite in mission-critical stealth grass during "The Kusarigama’s Shame," didn't have flash bombs during the "Fighting Fire with Fire" mission, or--and this is very specific--saved and exited the game after interrogating the enemy but before defeating Saito's goons during the "Higashi Lumberyard" mission. There are more, but you get it.</p><p>In short, many of these very random and very specific "permanent mission blocking" bugs have been ironed out. Now, nothing is stopping you from getting your revenge on that dastardly Lord Saito and his cronies.</p><p>Ghost of Yotei--which received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghost-of-yotei-review-lone-wolf/1900-6418414/" data-ref-id="1900-6418414">a 9/10 in GameSpot's "superb" review</a>--is available now for PlayStation 5.</p><h2>Ghost of Yotei Update 1.010 Patch Notes</h2><h4>Performance and Stability</h4><ul><li>Fixed a rare crash that could happen when ray tracing is enabled.</li><li>Fixed a rare crash that could occur during “Poison and Lies” if the player backtracked to the fire in the building then walked towards Oyuki with the Nine Tails NPC following Atsu.</li></ul><h4>Gameplay</h4><ul><li>Fixed a bug that prevented the Black Ghost mask from being granted to players who purchased the Digital Deluxe Edition of Ghost of Yotei once they completed “To Catch a Spider”.</li><li>Fixed a permanent mission blocking bug that could happen in “Fighting Fire with Fire” due to the player not being guaranteed to have flash bombs during the flash bomb trainer.</li><li>Fixed a permanent mission blocking bug that could happen in “The Way of the Kusarigama” if the player warped into the mission during a specific point.</li><li>Fixed a permanent mission blocking bug that could happen in “The Tale of the Oni” if the player managed to avoid seeing the “armor upgrade” scene and then left the area.</li><li>Fixed a permanent mission blocking bug that could happen in “A Brokered Trust” if the player managed to complete part of the branching objectives and then goes and completes a different mission allowing the second branch to become available.</li><li>Fixed a permanent mission blocking bug that could happen in “Higashi Lumberyard” if the player saved and exited the game after interrogating the enemy but before defeating Saito’s soldiers.</li><li>Fixed a permanent mission blocking bug that could happen in “Broken Horn Garrison” if the player died after killing all enemies and rescuing the prisoner but before the final conversation plays.</li><li>Fixed a permanent mission blocking bug that could happen in “The Kusarigama’s Shame” if the player created a campsite in mission critical stealth grass.</li><li>Fixed a permanent game blocking bug that could happen if the player climbed a tower in the Frontier, talked to an NPC, but then restarted from their last checkpoint.</li><li>Fixed a bug that could happen in “Encounters of the Wild” that would cause the fox to appear stuck if the player had reloaded their game after seeing the bear above the cave near the sanctuary.</li><li>Fixed a bug that would allow the player to change their loadout during the spar with Kiku in “A Wolf’s Pack”.</li><li>Fixed a bug where the player could become stuck in a permanent respawn loop if they jumped into a pit and died soon after completing an objective or mission.</li></ul><h4>Environment</h4><ul><li>Replaced a placeholder asset that had been along a major path in “The Kitsune’s Fate”.</li></ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Mexico’s government has moved another step closer to putting a tax on video games it deems to be violent. On Friday, Mexico’s Chamber of Deputies approved a financial package that includes an 8% tax on violent video games.</p>



<p>According <a href="https://www.finanzaspublicas.hacienda.gob.mx/work/models/Finanzas_Publicas/docs/paquete_economico/cgpe/cgpe_2026.pdf">to the proposal</a>, the tax would apply to games rated “C” and “D” under the Mexican System of Equivalences of Video Game Content Classification. When comparing to the ESRB, a “C” rating is for players 18+ while a “D” rating is for games rated for “Adults Only”.</p>



<p>Back when it was first proposed in early September, the claim was that <strong>“recent studies have found a relationship between the use of violent video games and higher levels of aggression among adolescents, as well as negative social and psychological effects such as isolation and anxiety.” </strong>This was said without providing any examples of those studies.</p>



<p>This new tax would apply to all games, both physical and digital. For free-to-play titles, the 8% tax would apply to in-game purchases and microtransactions.</p>



<p>The bill hasn’t become law in the country yet, as it will now head to the Mexican Senate for debate. Should it continue to move forward and become law, games from popular series like Grand Theft Auto, Mortal Kombat, and others will be subject to this new tax.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/pokemon-legends-z-a</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-switch-mostly-stable-much-less-shiny.1328044/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> on Switch is 'fine'. For a lot of people, that'll be enough. And certainly, even I'm surprised it's as stable as it is after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Legends: Arceus</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Scarlet &amp; Violet</a> had more than their fair share of performance woes — the latter of which is almost a completely different game with the free Switch 2 patch.</p>
<p>But, this should go without saying, If you have the newer console and you want Legends: Z-A, get it on there. You can read my general thoughts on the entire game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">in my review</a>, but performance-wise, 60fps, sharper image quality, and better stability means it's a stronger experience overall by a wide margin on the Switch 2.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:192371 @ 1760730933 -->
<p>I was honestly expecting this version to be a disaster, but I'm happy to say Legends: Z-A maintains a relatively consistent 30fps both handheld and docked. The drop is certainly noticeable coming off of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Switch 2 Edition</a>, but if you're playing this fresh, it likely won't bother you.</p>
<p>What <em>might</em> catch you out, however, are some pretty noticeably choppy 'cuts'. There's a lot more camera work in Legends: Z-A, from fast-panning shots to cutaways, and while docked, every single one of these staggered. Zooming into a trainer after defeating them, catching a Pokémon unaware in the Z-A Royale, there's a stutter every single time. I didn't notice it as much while handheld, but it was distracting.</p>
<p>Luckily, things are more consistent in battle, where things can get a little chaotic. Some moves like Brutal Swing and Gust can cause frames to dip slightly, particularly in handheld, but for the most part, things are good enough.</p>
<p>The visuals are one of my bigger issues with the Switch 2 version, and understandably, it's the same story here, despite the fact character models look good. Flat textures are even worse on Switch 1 — blades of grass looks blurry and jagged, bushes and trees are angular, and the cobbles just look fuzzy. Oh, and the shadows are abysmal, pixelated and blurry and sometimes not even there.</p>
<p>Pop-in was an issue on the new console too, but here, it's even worse. Sometimes characters and Mega Crystals will be visible from a fair distance, while other times, they won't appear until you're about 10 steps away from them. It's incredibly inconsistent and distracting. Some building textures will take around 6-7 seconds to load in, despite the fact you're staring right at them.</p>
<p>Longer load times and softer image quality are a couple more (expected) nicks in the older hardware version's armour, but overall, despite my complaints, Legends: Z-A on Switch is.... okay! It's a step up from the last two mainline games, but still far from Pokémon's best-looking titles.</p>
<p>And I think it's the Switch 1 version's fault. I absolutely get why Z-A is on the older console; The Pokémon Company isn't going to give up that huge player base with a mainline game yet. But its limitations hold Lumiose City back from its full potential. What could've been a vibrant, varied city instead comes with caveats, restrictions, and a fair few visual compromises.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/pokemon-legends-z-a]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-passs-grinch-game-angry-horny-weird-user-reviews-2000636631</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-pass%E2%80%99s-new-grinch-game-is-receiving-a-lot-of-angry-and-horny-reviews.1328041/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last night, as I browsed the Xbox Store on my Series X, <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-pass-october-2025-ninja-gaiden-grinch-price-2000633269">I spotted the newly released Grinch game, which is now available on Game Pass</a>. Curious how players were receiving the not-so-great-looking family-friendly Christmas platformer, I decided to check out the user reviews. What I stumbled into was a warzone filled with shots at Xbox’s recent price hikes and way too many people wanting to fuck the Grinch.</p> <p>Originally released in 2023, <em>The Grinch: Christmas Adventures</em> was a sloppy co-op platformer that had few fans and was promptly forgotten after it launched. But now it’s back and updated and is being sold as a new game with a new subtitle: <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-grinch-christmas-adventures-merry-mischievous-edition/9ppjp7x77nnb"><em>Merry &amp; Mischievous Edition</em></a>. I’m not sure how many people were clamoring for a new version of this bleh Grinch game, but it’s here just in time for Halloween. It is also one of the first games to be added to Game Pass after the <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-gets-massive-price-hike-yet-amid-big-changes-2000630604">massive price increase earlier this month</a>, which explains why so <em>many</em> user reviews for <em>TGCAM&amp;ME</em> (as the kids call it) are dunking on the subscription service.</p> <hr> <blockquote><p>“$30 A MONTH FOR THIS???? A GAME THAT LOOKS LIKE AN AWFUL 360 MOVIE TIE IN GAME?? 🤣🤣🤣🤣”</p>  <p>“BE ACTUALLY REAL XBOX. Awful clunky game about the grinch in the middle of october????? I AM THE SECOND REVIEW?????? 50% PRICE INCREASE. UBISOFT COLLECTION WITH 50% BOARD GAMES. I AM LEAVING THE SERVICE. THERE ARE FISH HOOKED UP TO WIRES RUNNING EVERYTHING AT THE XBOX H.Q. APPARENTLY IM SUBSCRIBED TO XBOX GAME PASS BABIES WITH DAY ONE DROPS OF THE GRINCH. UNACCEPTABLE . P.S if you dislike this review i’m automatically assuming ur a dev. “It’s for kids” argument DOES NOT WORK AS IT IS SLOP AND WHAT PARENT IS GONNA SPEND 30 DOLLARS A MONTH FOR THIS”</p> <p>“Bruh. You’re telling me for 30 dollars a month? I get this?…. Yeah, I’m glad my ultimate ends the 23rd. I got BF6 and multiplayer access all i need.”</p> <p>“Lolz. Ms wants $30 a month for this clunky ****?👀”</p> <p>“$30 4 this?? Cancel Gamepass.”</p> <p>“50% price hike for the Grinch is CRAZY. If xbox is raising the prices they better start putting out games that aren’t this”</p> </blockquote> <p>While these reviews make some sense–people are mad about the price increase and are lashing out at being given a bad shovelware game right in the wake of it–I can’t as easily explain why there are also so many horny reviews for this updated Grinch platformer. Seriously, what the heck is going on? Here’s just some of what I found. Be warned, a lot of this is NSFW. Oh, and the first two reviews below are the very first two reviews you’ll see on Xbox and the website as of this story’s publication. Merry Christmas, kids!</p> <hr> <blockquote> <p>“Grinch took my v card. He sat me down and bounced that grussy on it.”</p> <p>“My Parents Love the Grinch. My parents had a little too much egg nog and stayed up ALL night with Mr. Grinch. They said his heart grew 3 sizes! I woke up once and heard my mom yelling, ‘You’re a mean one, you’re a mean one!’ They must’ve had a good time, though, because I’ve never seen my parents smile so much!”</p> <p>“The Grinch. The Grinch assaulted me in a bad area…”</p> <p>“GOATED. Watched this green ahh hunk o’ junk bounce that mcboy grus ALL OVER max’s red rocket. Best 30 a month”</p> <p>“Grinch grew 3 sizes alright. 3 sizes in my Christmas stocking stuffer if you know what im sayin 10/10 would Grinch again”</p> <p>“Horny. He made me wet”</p> <p>“I stole lakes v card. The Grinch stole Lake v card”</p> <p>“This game gave me hard b0ner. The Grinch turned me on”</p> <p>“Something in my pants keeps moving. While I was playing as the Grinch, a snake kept growing in my pants. I decided to put it in my mouth and it tastes like BBC!”</p></blockquote> <p>Anyway, I’m not sure what else to add to all of this. I guess this is what I get for reading the user reviews on a Grinch Xbox game. My bad, everyone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A recent interview with Sucker Punch reveals that Ghost of Yotei DLC is possible, but only if necessary.</p>



<p>Released earlier this October, Ghost of Yotei serves as a spiritual sequel to 2020’s Ghost of Tsushima. Following mercenary Atsu, she travels around Edo to get revenge on those who killed her family. The game, a PlayStation 5 exclusive, is one of 2025’s best-reviewed titles alongside Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and Death Stranding 2: On The Beach. Now, with the game all wrapped up, Game Informer chatted with key members of the development team about what may be next for Atsu, if anything.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Credit to Sucker Punch</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/10/17/ghost-of-yoteis-creators-on-atsu-i-see-it-as-a-chapter-is-done" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Informer</a>, Ghost of Yotei co-director Jason Connell and lead writer Ian Miles talked about the game’s success and story. While the article itself is full of spoilers, it did come with some good news for fans. When asked about possible DLC, Connell remarked,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I think for us, we are at the spot in the project where we just get to put it out there and see what’s resonating with people and what people love and what people feel like they wish they maybe knew more about Atsu,” says Connell to Game Informer. “And I think for us, this is like the most important part of the project, in terms of making decisions like these, because same thing with Tsushima. You can listen, you can be like, ‘Oh, okay. People seem to want to know a little bit more about that relationship or what happened to the dad.’ </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Connell, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/10/17/ghost-of-yoteis-creators-on-atsu-i-see-it-as-a-chapter-is-done" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">in the quote</a>, refers to Ghost of Tsushima’s Iki Island DLC, which launched with the game’s Director’s Cut in 2021. The story in the expansion revolved around Jin’s father, someone who wasn’t explored much in the main game. He continues,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“How do you further that character?” states Connell. “And you get this rare opportunity to actually listen to millions of people about what resonated within a story versus maybe what didn’t or what are the holes. And I think that’s the mode that you want to be in. And that’s sort of the gift. Certainly we love Atsu, and we think it’s a great character. And just like with Jin, <strong>if there’s rooms to improve it or to bring some new elements to life or clarity for the narrative’s sake and it falls within what is best for Sucker Punch, then we’ll certainly take a hard look at that for sure</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Without going into spoilers for Yotei, there are sure to be some paths that potential DLC can take. While the developers do state that they view Atsu’s story as complete, it’s not out of the picture yet. Given the success the title has had this year, perhaps we may return to Edo in the near future.</p>
