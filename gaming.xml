Many reviews have less than an hour of playtime, meaning they either didn't spend much time in the game, they bounced off of the gameplay quickly, or some combination of both. Other reviews give positive feedback while calling other reviews disingenuous. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-is-a-defiant-punk-rock-take-on-co-op-shooters/1100-6531475/">FBC: Firebreak preview</a>, Mark Delaney called the FPS "a defiant, punk rock take on co-op shooters."</p><p>FBC: Firebreak is the first multiplayer game from the studio behind Control and Alan Wake. It features teams of three--each person has their own distinct kit--taking on hordes of enemies while trying to accomplish a variety of objectives. There are three jobs available at launch, each with a number of difficulty settings that expand the length of the job and number of enemies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4516001-ksof528n8b6f1.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4516001" data-ratio="0.56884057971014" data-width="828" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4516001-ksof528n8b6f1.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4516001"></a><figcaption>FBC: Firebreak post-launch roadmap</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15957481/4516001-ksof528n8b6f1.jpeg"></figure><p>Many reviews cite a lack of content as a reason for their disappointment. Remedy has detailed two future updates, including additional jobs and maps that will come to the game this Fall and Winter. Fans looking for more from FBC: Firebreak could check back in after those updates are released.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/savage-raven-edc-switch-2-carry-case-a-sleek-alternative-to-nintendos-official-offering<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="skull and co case review" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/917cb4575b1ca/skull-and-co-case-review.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We've already had a look at Nintendo's official Switch 2 carry case and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-carry-case-the-official-option-is-a-solid-one">scored it a super solid 8/10</a>, commenting that it had too few cart spaces (at just six), but was nevertheless a compact and good-looking case for the money.</p>
<p>Now it's the turn of Skull &amp; Co., or 'Savage Raven' as the company has now rebranded, with the Switch 2 EDC Carry Case. I'll be honest, it makes me feel a little bit like I should really be dressing up as <strong>The Crow</strong> when I'm out and about with my console rocking a name like that on its little protective jacket, but hey, this is actually a very strong alternative to Nintendo's rather less street-wise offering. It also has two more cart spaces than that case. Upgrade unlocked!</p>
<p>You'll likely already be familiar with Skull &amp; Co. as they've become quite a big player on the accessory scene over the past few years. Indeed, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hardware-skull-and-co-neogrip-for-switch-oled-review">we've previously reviewed the Switch OLED NeoGrip</a>, and I own a few other bits and pieces besides this case (which, for transparency, I bought with my own money in the run-up to the Switch 2 launch. Yes, I got a little excited. What of it?) So, as an owner of a few other items from the accessory-maker-formerly-known-as-Skull &amp; Co., I can tell you that this outfit makes some quality gear, and the story is no different here.</p>
<p>From the moment you pull this case from its packaging, you can feel the quality. This is a rugged offering in comparison to Nintendo's choice of smooth finish, and the black colour I've plumped for is understated (there are also 'multi-camo' and denim versions, if you prefer), which suits the impressively slim profile. Before I'd even gotten my Switch 2, this was actually the first time I realised just how slim the new console was going to be. It's ridiculous, and it helps the case tuck very easily into my rather small laptop bag, so it's good to go in terms of portability.</p>


<p>The case has two sturdy zips replete with nice little rubber logos, and a useful handle for when I want to carry it like I'm heading to a video gamer power meeting in the 1980s. The shell is composed of a tough 'Hardshell' material and the cover is water-resistant, too, something Nintendo's case does not have in its favour.</p>
<p>As I've already mentioned, it's wonderfully slim in profile, following the contours of the console closely, and making for a snug fit that <em>importantly</em> still has room enough for a console with its protective casing on. Nice work, folks! There is nothing more gutting than realising your shell has to come off every time. I've been in that war. I've felt that pain.</p>
<p>Inside, you're treated to a delightful velvet finish. Now, I'm not usually one for velvet at all, certainly not in its crushed variant, but here it's made for a surprisingly nice interior. It's soft, it feels luxurious, and your new console will undoubtedly love you forever, having been given such a comfortable and well-protected place to sleep.</p>
<p>More importantly, and perhaps of even more interest to you, dear reader, than how soft I find velvet in general, is the jazzy yellow strap which makes it nice and easy to lift the console out of its resting spot without resorting to pulling on the Joy-Con. You should note, too, that this case has got two extra spaces for game carts over the six found on the official Nintendo case alongside a nice little stretchy pocket, which could easily hold a further two carts if you don't mind pushing them in there.</p>
<p>Price-wise, in the UK you're looking at a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Savage-Raven-Carrying-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0F473TTRC/ref=sr_1_5?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.4Cy1mbnYb4oYSGCL_wZzleSM_ZIil1EJWfALj3BaraQbq4FBXJdMyhbFHmJiG2l-CqUdO4Y_X8_NMIVZHqnxPKobgmdvfPn6G9-RE-MRLCzaWr83JcJ_oBxfK27c7oPeujBNJKchn8LXcGD6xo8Ykn2kIA0sIbTksUONeDhLniAXilYs9qg2ZxrkM258GU-93wfUvQ88knTfilQ3o1foFQ.fTH3Y5XxXurb3LgzdC2NVUdWiABSFnGoC9u47YBtwHw&amp;dib_tag=nlife-21&amp;keywords=savage%2Braven%2Bswitch%2B2&amp;qid=1750088201&amp;sr=8-5&amp;th=1" rel="sponsored noopener">£22.99 price tag</a> (in the US it's <a href="https://www.savage-raven.com/collections/nintendo-switch-2/products/savage-raven-by-skull-co-edc-carrying-case-for-nintendo-switch-2?variant=50452960280868">$29.99</a> but varying from $19.99 to around the $23 mark at the time of writing), which means it's just £2 more expensive than Nintendo's offering over here. Easily worth the extra, in my humble opinion, considering you get those two extra cart spaces.</p>

<p>Now, you do get a free screen protector bundled in with the Nintendo case, but to even things up Savage Raven has included a very nice cloth emblazoned with the Savage Raven logo, which I vastly prefer to a free screen-protector as I use these types of cloths to clean my glasses when I'm playing, so bonus brownie points to whoever made that decision as I've never had cleaner specta...I mean Switch 2 screens.</p>
<p>There is a bigger version of this particular case available, too, just as Nintendo has provided a bigger version of their own, and that <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Savage-Raven-Maxcarry-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0F47VD3KG/ref=sr_1_8?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.4Cy1mbnYb4oYSGCL_wZzleSM_ZIil1EJWfALj3BaraQbq4FBXJdMyhbFHmJiG2l-CqUdO4Y_X8_NMIVZHqnxPKobgmdvfPn6G9-RE-MRLCzaWr83JcJ_oBxfK27c7oPeujBNJKchn8LXcGD6xo8Ykn2kIA0sIbTksUONeDhLniAXilYs9qg2ZxrkM258GU-93wfUvQ88knTfilQ3o1foFQ.fTH3Y5XxXurb3LgzdC2NVUdWiABSFnGoC9u47YBtwHw&amp;dib_tag=nlife-21&amp;keywords=savage%2Braven%2Bswitch%2B2&amp;qid=1750088046&amp;sr=8-8&amp;th=1" rel="sponsored noopener">'MaxCarry' variant includes a further four slots for game carts</a>, up to a total of 12, plus a pouch for cables and accessories, pushing the price up to a still-fairly-reasonable £27.99 (or whatever that translates to where you are).</p>
<p>Overall, I'm more than happy with what I've got for just a few quid extra over Nintendo's case here. I prefer the duller/smarter finish over the shininess of the Big N's effort, and it helps that we've got a useful strap, extra spaces for carts. This case is water-resistant and can fit a Switch 2 console with a protective case or grip on. I'm also a fan of the use of colour inside this case as, alongside the velvet finish, it gives it a real premium look and feel when you crack it open for game time.</p>

			<p>Xbox president Sarah Bond has just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOCtRanwXrA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a multi-year deal with AMD to power multiple gaming devices, including the successor of the Xbox Series X. Here's her complete statement from the brief video announcement:</p>
<p><em>At Xbox, our vision is for you to play the games you want, with the people you want, anywhere you want. That's why we're investing in our next-generation hardware lineup, across console, handheld, PC, cloud, and accessories. I am thrilled to share we've established a strategic multi-year partnership with AMD to co-engineer silicon across a portfolio of devices including our next generation Xbox consoles, in your living room, and in your hands.</em></p>
<p><em>Together with AMD, we're advancing the state of art in gaming silicon to deliver the next generation of graphics innovation to unlock a deeper level of visual quality and immersive gameplay and player experiences enhanced with the power of AI, all while maintaining compatibility with your existing library of Xbox games.</em></p>
<p><em>This is all about building you a gaming platform that's always with you, so you can play the games you want across devices anywhere you want, delivering you an Xbox experience not locked to a single store or tied to one device. That's why we're working closely with the Windows team, to ensure that Windows is the number one platform for gaming. The next generation of Xbox is coming to life, and this is just the beginning.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Xbox + AMD: Powering the Next Generation of Xbox" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VOCtRanwXrA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It seems like Microsoft wanted to confirm in an official capacity what insiders had <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-rumored-to-support-backward-compatibility-at-hardware-level/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already mentioned</a>, such as the fact that the next-generation Xbox will still be compatible with previous-generation games through backward compatibility. Interestingly, Sarah Bond did not reiterate <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her previous remark</a> about the next generation Xbox console delivering the 'largest technical leap ever' for consoles, though it's hard to say whether that means fans should lower their performance expectations.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, Microsoft has bypassed the mid-generation refresh (unlike Sony with its PlayStation 5 Pro) and seems ready to get a headstart on the next generation. According to the latest rumors, the Series X successor might <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-release-2027-premium-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch</a> in a couple of years.</p>

            <p>
Fishing, I think, is the truest of all video game power fantasies. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">Action</a> hero combat, romance wish fulfilment, god like abilities, all of that sort of thing pales in comparison to the act of fishing in a game. Just you, your rod, and a whole load of open water. I love to fish in video games, despite not being someone that has a strong desire to 100% genres like collectathons, I do love getting as many fish as I can, and I love a twist on the format. Enter Out Fishing, a mysterious sounding horror fishing game.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Where <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dredge">Dredge</a> sees you setting out into the open ocean on a boat to get the eldritch catch of the day, Out Fishing almost takes a calmer, more laid back approach. You have your own little camp near a lake, you can improve things like your rod strength and your reeling speed. Classic gamey kind of things, things you'd expect from a cosier game than this one, but then there's the fact that if you stay past sunset, you're greeted with… something, in the forest. Don't know what, but I hate the woods at night, so I'm already just a little bit anxious thinking about it.

<p>
I also really like one of the key features listed over on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3660260/Out_Fishing/">game's Steam page</a>: "A single, horrifying goal: reel in the one thing that was never meant to be found." That could literally mean anything. A dead body? A really weird fish? Repressed memories of a traumatic event? That last one sounds likely given that the devs cited Silent Hill as an influence (alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake">Alan Wake</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mundaun">Mundaun</a>).
</p>
<p>
What I am curious about is how connected the horror elements will actually feel to the fishing side of things. I'm hoping the two will tie into each other rather than feeling like separate games. I won't find out for a while though, as there's no release date. I'll stick to the slightly less scary Sega Bass Fishing in the meantime.

" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Cristina Alexander / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aca62b32579d5747c64415cfc5db3950" data-recommend-id="image://aca62b32579d5747c64415cfc5db3950" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yoshi sits on a bike outside of a restaraunt. " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are outfits littered around every race track in <em>Mario Kart World</em>, allowing you to build wardrobes for every character.. Each outfit is tied to certain foods packed into smiling lunch bags called Dash Food sitting outside of Yoshi’s restaurants. Sometimes, Dash Food can also be found on top of pickup trucks with ramps. Dash Food works similarly to Mushrooms, too: In addition to changing your appearance, you’ll get a speed boost.</p><p>However, not everyone who eats the same food item will unlock the same outfit. For example, if you’re racing as Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy or Yoshi and you pick up a burger, you’ll get the Touring outfit. If you’re playing as Bowser, Wario or Waluigi, the burger will trigger the Biker outfit. Eat cake while you’re playing as any of the eight aforementioned characters plus Toad and Koopa and you’ll be wearing the Pro Racer outfit, but do so with Donkey Kong and you’ll get the All-Terrain outfit.</p><h2 id="h943985"><a id="2"></a>Complete challenges</h2><figure id="" data-id="390eba98d1d5f1e1e16aa23ac410b225" data-recommend-id="image://390eba98d1d5f1e1e16aa23ac410b225" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yoshi sits on a bike in a snowy environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Yoshi sits on a bike in a snowy environment." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Cristina Alexander / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="390eba98d1d5f1e1e16aa23ac410b225" data-recommend-id="image://390eba98d1d5f1e1e16aa23ac410b225" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yoshi sits on a bike in a snowy environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While driving around the world map, you’ll come across the giant blue P-Switches that are found either on the side of the road or are lying somewhere off-road. Running over those switches can trigger challenges for you to complete within the time allotted, be it in 15 seconds or, at most, 30 seconds. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-rail-wall-charge-jump-ride-switch-2-1851784648&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-rail-wall-charge-jump-ride-switch-2-1851784648"><em>Mario Kart World</em>Is More Fun When You’re Grinding Rails And Riding Walls</a></span></p><p>Most challenges give you an opportunity to sharpen your <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-rail-wall-charge-jump-ride-switch-2-1851784648&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-rail-wall-charge-jump-ride-switch-2-1851784648">wall-riding skills</a></span> and enemy evasion techniques. Others will test your timing on using certain items, like the Feather, which allows you to jump up to five feet in the air to reach high places and avoid incoming projectiles. You can replay the challenges as many times as you want to beat your record if you so desire. </p><h2 id="h943986"><a id="3"></a>Rack up coins</h2><figure id="" data-id="c016355b09436a39efc73de957baa3a5" data-recommend-id="image://c016355b09436a39efc73de957baa3a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pricness Peach sits in a kart in a snowy environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pricness Peach sits in a kart in a snowy environment." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Cristina Alexander / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c016355b09436a39efc73de957baa3a5" data-recommend-id="image://c016355b09436a39efc73de957baa3a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pricness Peach sits in a kart in a snowy environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For the hustlers out there, you can find piles of coins hidden in every nook and cranny of the tracks. Keep your eyes peeled behind Yoshi’s restaurants, on top of billboards, in bushes, atop hilltops, and on boardwalks, just to name a few places. </p><p>Coin piles vary in size, from a stack of five coins to a money bag’s worth of 100 coins (or more). Don’t be surprised if you see a small stack of coins every once in a while. No matter what the size of the coin pile, they all add up to unlocking more new karts and other sweet rewards, like stickers.</p><h2 id="h943987"><a id="4"></a>Find Question Mark panels</h2><figure id="" data-id="d2a89377941b2fa7128b18eabdea2a29" data-recommend-id="image://d2a89377941b2fa7128b18eabdea2a29" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Princess Peach stands near a question-mark panel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Princess Peach stands near a question-mark panel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Cristina Alexander / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d2a89377941b2fa7128b18eabdea2a29" data-recommend-id="image://d2a89377941b2fa7128b18eabdea2a29" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Princess Peach stands near a question-mark panel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Each track has five Question Mark (“?”) panels hidden in various places. The panels don’t exactly do much when you run over them except give you new stickers to put on your karts. These are fun to collect. </p><p>And if you want an extra challenge: Activating 10 ? panels, is one of the ways to unlock Mirror Mode, which lets you race a track backwards.</p><h2 id="h943988"><a id="5"></a>Collect Peach medallions</h2><figure id="" data-id="7a33a53245b650ba87b7daf54fdd114f" data-recommend-id="image://7a33a53245b650ba87b7daf54fdd114f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Princess Peach rides a motorcycle near the shore." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Princess Peach rides a motorcycle near the shore." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Cristina Alexander / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7a33a53245b650ba87b7daf54fdd114f" data-recommend-id="image://7a33a53245b650ba87b7daf54fdd114f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Princess Peach rides a motorcycle near the shore." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you love collecting foreign coins in the real world, you’ll love collecting Peach Medallions. They’re basically giant coins that have a beautiful silhouette of Princess Peach’s profile engraved on them. They’re mostly found in high-rise places, like construction rails, musical blocks, thin columns, and aerial loops that you need to fly through. You can also find them in places you least expect, like a little islet beside the raging sea.</p><p>Peach Medallions are more like talismans than medallions because they lack a chain, but they’re medallions nonetheless. Unlike stocking up on rare coins IRL, collecting 10 of Peach’s coins will also unlock Mirror Mode.</p><h2 id="h943989"><a id="6"></a>Just take a relaxing drive!</h2><figure id="" data-id="8020eaf2c2c35b063096676f18c6ee5d" data-recommend-id="image://8020eaf2c2c35b063096676f18c6ee5d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Princess Peach goes for a drive in the desert." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Princess Peach goes for a drive in the desert." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Cristina Alexander / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8020eaf2c2c35b063096676f18c6ee5d" data-recommend-id="image://8020eaf2c2c35b063096676f18c6ee5d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Princess Peach goes for a drive in the desert." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Free Roam is perfect if you want to take a break from races and party battles with other players. Go for a relaxing road trip around the world and forget about the worries of the world. No races, no battles, no challenges–just you, your vehicle of choice, and the wide open road to help you take in the sights and sounds of every track you visit and the people you meet along the way–just like a real-life road trip would do.</p><p>You can also park somewhere to take a picture of yourself with Photo Mode. Like many other games, this feature lets you customize your character’s expressions and poses as they sit by the sunset, the mountains, the beach, or any breathtaking locale you take them. Those pictures will make great wallpapers for your PC or phone later on. Just make sure you remove the control guides before you snap any pics.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It was a sequence that proved so controversial at the time that the United Kingdom’s film board ordered it removed. 36 years later, after a remaster of the unedited version appeared on Disney+ in the UK, it’s been pulled once again.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197531" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Disney's New Lo-Fi Goofy Video Is Hiding A Kingdom Hearts Tease" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="152" data-playlist="197531,196406,196115" data-current="197531"><div><p>Disney's New Lo-Fi Goofy Video Is Hiding A Kingdom Hearts Tease</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197531/197531_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197531/197531_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197531/197531_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23063.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Before <em>Terminator 2, Titanic, </em>and <em>Avatar </em>(and the many <em>Avatar</em> sequels), Cameron brought us <em>The Abyss</em>, a very expensive underwater action-adventure film starring Ed Harris. The movie was a bit of a flop at the time, but has since gone on to become a classic among Cameron fans and sci-fi nerds. </p><p>At one point in the film, a rat is placed in a small tub of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_breathing&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_breathing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">breathing fluorocarbon liquid</a></span>. At first, the rat struggles and panics because it thinks it’s drowning. But eventually it calms and starts breathing the liquid, which contains oxygen. Five rats were used, and they all lived. However, many found the scene disturbing, and in the UK, this scene was banned and removed from all versions of <em>The Abyss </em>at the request of the RSPCA. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rspca.org.uk/-/fears-of-streaming-loophole-as-disney-plus-airs-prohibited-rat-abuse-scene&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rspca.org.uk/-/fears-of-streaming-loophole-as-disney-plus-airs-prohibited-rat-abuse-scene" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">But this scene was later included in the Disney+ version of the movie</a></span>, which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://filmstories.co.uk/news/the-abyss-rspca-expresses-concern-over-uncut-rat-scenes-appearance-on-disney/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://filmstories.co.uk/news/the-abyss-rspca-expresses-concern-over-uncut-rat-scenes-appearance-on-disney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was added to the service in April</a></span>.</p><p>Here’s the scene, but be warned that this is a real rat struggling to breathe and some might find it hard to watch. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-movies/disney-plus-removes-a-classic-james-cameron-sci-fi-movie-after-featuring-a-troubling-scene-that-was-cut-from-previous-releases/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-movies/disney-plus-removes-a-classic-james-cameron-sci-fi-movie-after-featuring-a-troubling-scene-that-was-cut-from-previous-releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On June 17, GamesRadar</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/disney-removes-hollywood-film-controversial-31873734&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/disney-removes-hollywood-film-controversial-31873734" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other outlets</a></span> reported that <em>The Abyss</em> had been removed from Disney+ after the RSPCA called out the media giant for including the scene and taking advantage of a “loophole” that allows streamers to ignore some local film and TV regulations. </p><p>“This isn’t about cancel culture—we’d welcome Disney Plus reinstating the film to their platform, just with this troubling scene removed—as is already the case in cinemas, on TV, and on DVD,” the RSPCA’s Head of Public Affairs said in a statement.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>This was instead about highlighting a loophole that currently exists, allowing animal abuse scenes deemed unacceptable elsewhere to be streamed freely and legally into our homes—and protecting the public from having to see this animal abuse content.</p></blockquote><p> For many years, the film was difficult to watch, as it wasn’t available on streaming platforms and physical copies were out of print. But last year, a 4K version of the movie was finally released. Like some of Cameron’s other 4K releases, it makes some visual changes that people aren’t happy with, but overall, it is a fine way to watch <em>The Abyss</em>. However, in the UK, you can no longer watch this version on Disney+ because of that single, short scene involving a rodent. Hopefully, Disney adds the movie back with that scene removed so folks in the UK can enjoy this underrated Cameron classic once more. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-sues-fortnite-cheat-maker/">Epic</a> has officially <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/squad-up-and-save-the-day-in-lego-fortnite-expeditions">announced</a> LEGO Fortnite Expeditions, a new PvE mode that is launching tomorrow, on&nbsp;<strong>June 18, 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Expeditions is a mission-based mode where you jump into various missions with three other players as a four-player co-op mode all with the aim of taking down a mysteriously masked villain, Mask Maker Daigo, who will destroy the world if you and your friends don't put a stop to his antics first.</p>
<p>You'll head out on these missions from your home base, the Supernova Academy, where you and the newly introduced heroes you'll play as, Shadow Caller, The Hunter, and Rift Ripper, are all training to become the next class of world-saving superheroes.</p>
<p>Epic also unveiled a gameplay trailer showing off each of the three hero classes in action, with Rift Ripper being extremely mobile and capable of reaching high areas with their Rift Jump and a Rift Dodge that works like a short-distance teleport.</p>
<p>Shadow Caller is very mobile in a different way, as they're able to hover above the ground while using magical projectiles to dispatch enemies. While The Hunter is a fast-moving ranged-focused class with a Bull's-eye Blade that can multiply the damage you do and make your attacks more accurate in battle.</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO Fortnite Expeditions - Super Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hMOPVQSHIic?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Beyond the core powers each class has, you'll also be able to increase your damage output with what Epic is calling the 'Tools in the Toolbox,' which gives you the choice between Dual Daggers, a War Hammer, or Plasma Pistols, to add an extra punch to combat.</p>
<p>LEGO Fortnite Expeditions will be available tomorrow and will be found in Discover in LEGO Fortnite, or it can be accessed from Odyssey and Brick Life using the Battle Bus Station.</p>

<p>According to HoYoverse's copyright claim, Lopez has "unfairly or unlawfully obtained a game update before its release date", but the suit appears more vexed by Lopez sharing footage of the character, than how he obtained the game build in question. </p>
<p>They argue that a leak such as this "dampens the excitement and anticipation that many players feel when they obtain the update legitimately upon its official release." It's worth noting that Castorice had already been revealed as an upcoming addition to the game - <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/news-honkai-star-rail-amphoreus-trailer-featuring-castorice-revealed-the-game-awards-2024">during last December's Game Awards, no less</a>. </p>
<p>Honkai: Star Rail is a live service gacha game, with around 70 characters at the time of writing. Jason Coles thought it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/honkai-star-rail-review">good fun</a> back in April 2023. I can see how the publisher of a game which thrives on the lure of randomly served or microtransacted anime fancy-dans might be extra prickly about having the goods screened ahead of schedule. On the other hand, I'm not particularly keen on billion-dollar publishers suing Discord streamers into the scorched earth over footage of a character we already know about.</p>
<p>As Carpenter comments in the newsletter, HoYoverse have proven <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-gaming-43885b83-8690-4687-9574-a8029abd586f.html?stream=top">pretty militant about going after leakers in the past</a>, though they're hardly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/epic-sue-over-fortnite-superhero-leak">alone in this</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/playing-personal-game-backups-could-get-your-switch-2-banned-by-nintendo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Earlier this week, the makers of the popular Mig Flash cartridge, which allows users to play Switch games loaded via an SD card without modifying the console itself, <a href="https://x.com/SwitchTools/status/1933967207840514159">issued a firmware update</a> enabling the cards to run original Switch games on the Switch 2. Since then, though, multiple Mig Flash users are reporting that they've seen their Switch 2 consoles banned from Nintendo's online servers, even in cases where the devices were only used to run backups of legitimate games the users purchased themselves.</p>
<p>"My Switch 2 test has been banned after using the Mig [Flash] with perfectly legal dumps of my own cartridges, so it would seem that Nintendo can detect something," popular hacking news account Switch Tools <a href="https://x.com/SwitchTools">posted on social media Monday</a> (along with <a href="https://x.com/SwitchTools/status/1934723908676338036">a follow-up showing a stack of legitimate Switch games</a> they said they had backed up using the device). "I strongly recommend that you do not use the Mig [Flash], it was already very risky to use but it is even more so on Switch 2."</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">My Switch 2 test has been banned, after using the mig switch with perfectly legal dumps of my own cartridges, so it would seem that Nintendo can detect something<br>
Similar reports on reddit are starting to come in.<a href="https://t.co/nbPMlRWSaP">https://t.co/nbPMlRWSaP</a><a href="https://t.co/3eq6dkbFMi">https://t.co/3eq6dkbFMi</a><br>
I strongly… <a href="https://t.co/btzjQYJzE4">pic.twitter.com/btzjQYJzE4</a></p>
<p>— SwitchTools (@SwitchTools) <a href="https://twitter.com/SwitchTools/status/1934637497985769875?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The insistence that the ban came while using "perfectly legal dumps of my own cartridges" is important here. Nintendo has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/06/inside-nintendos-perfect-method-for-detecting-online-switch-piracy/">long used certificates with robust cryptographic signatures</a> to identify when individual copies of Switch games are being shared for the purposes of piracy. If Nintendo notices the same cryptographic signature on security certificates being used by hundreds of different consoles and accounts, for instance, the company can be relatively sure that all those users are engaging in piracy.</p>
<p>But the Mig Flash can also be used for backup and play of an individual's legal Switch game purchases on a personal console, which shouldn't lead to any such signature conflicts. On <a href="https://migflash.com/#/:~:text=08/01/2024,held%20responsible%20for.">the Mig Flash website</a>, the developers of the device say they "only support and guarantee your gaming with your own games backups. This applies to online, too. If you want to play online with the full Mig Flash warranty, you need to use your own dumped backups... Failure to respect this rule might end up in bans from Nintendo online service, which we won't be held responsible for."</p>

                <p>After everyone spent the last couple weeks believing the headlining artist for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> Festival Season 9 would be Deadmau5, the reality ended up being something completely different: Bruno Mars will be the <em>actual</em> <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/bruno-mars-is-home-in-fortnite-festival-season-9" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">new Festival Icon</a> when Season 9 launches on Wednesday.</p><p>Bruno Mars is an interesting choice because he's already in Fortnite. The Silk Sonic set, which included skins for both Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak, was released way back in 2022. None of the eight previous Festival season headliners had been added to the game as skins prior to their respective seasons.</p><p>The new Fortnite Festival Season will come with a new Music Pass, which will be available for 1400 V-Bucks or via Fortnite Crew. The highlight is the Die With a Smile Bruno skin, which is based on the singer's look in the video for his and Lady Gaga's track Die With a Smile. That skin unlocks instantly when you purchase the pass, and you can gain XP across any Fortnite experience to progress the pass from there. Also included with the paid pass is a guitar, a drum kit, and jam tracks for Bruno-San's Theme Song, Silk Sonic's Leave the Door Open, ABC by tThe Jackson 5, and Mun Ra by Sabotage. There are free rewards as well for those who don't buy the pass, including instruments, auras, and four jam tracks.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4515832-fortnitebrunomarsshopstuff.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515832" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4515832-fortnitebrunomarsshopstuff.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515832"></a><figcaption>This new Bruno Mars skin will be available in the Fortnite item shop throughout Festival Season 9.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4515832-fortnitebrunomarsshopstuff.jpg"></figure><p>Naturally, Bruno Mars will also have a set of cosmetics in the shop throughout the season, starting with the Bruno-San skin, which has two distinctive styles. Alongside the skin will be a back bling, a contrail, a keytar, a bass, and both an emote and jam track for his song Bonde do Brunão--all of these will be included in one big bundle. Outside the bundle, the shop will also have jam tracks for Die With a Smile by Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga, and APT by Rose and Bruno Mars.</p><p>For longtime Fortnite players, this update will also come with a feature that's been heavily requested for years and years: If you set your lobby music to random, it will actually play a different song when the one you're listening to finishes. Since lobby music was first introduced to Fortnite in Chapter 1 Season 6--that was seven years ago!--the random feature would simply pick one song and play it on a loop until you left the lobby.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Owning these new business fronts allows access to unique Money-Laundering missions. Earnings from these laundering operations are stored inside the player's duffle bag found in the car wash bedroom. To celebrate the launch of Money Fronts, Rockstar says that missions launched from the Hands On Car Wash will pay out 2X GTA$ and RP this week.</p><p dir="ltr">Getting into the laundering business also benefits other operations in GTA Online. Owning the car wash boosts all Counterfeit Cash Factory sales from a player's MC business, while owning the dispensary provides a bump to all Weed Farm sales. Additionally, Operating Higgins Helitours as a front results in a lift for all Air Freight Cargo.</p><p dir="ltr">While money laundering is great for building a cash empire, there are some risks that come with cleaning all that dirty money. Money-Laundering missions raise suspicion from the authorities in the form of Heat on the various business fronts. Businesses with Heat will be flagged with caution signals on the map, and it requires players to cool things back down by completing legal activity. This means activities such as cleaning customer cars at the car wash and delivering legal weed for the dispensary.</p><p dir="ltr">Mr. Faber, the head of the money-laundering network, also gives unique missions for additional extra cash and RP rewards. These Mr. Faber Work missions include various tasks, such as recovering stolen assets, escorting valuable cargo, and dealing with rival outfits. These raise the Heat level on a player's money-laundering businesses, and more of the legal activities will need to be completed to reduce this.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4515896-overflodsuzume.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515896" data-ratio="0.56235997012696" data-width="1339" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4515896-overflodsuzume.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4515896"></a><figcaption>The new Överflöd Suzume supercar.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4515896-overflodsuzume.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the Money Fronts expansion includes six new vehicles for purchase, including the Överflöd Suzume supercar.

<p>Should have stapled some photo credit on there</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Switch 2 Sad DK" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/30f78c9fe1a1d/switch-2-sad-dk.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Jim Norman / Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>A couple of weeks ago, we <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-one-gamestop-apparently-stapled-receipts-to-brand-new-switch-2-boxes-and-guess-what-happened">reported</a> on a handful of unlucky Switch 2 customers who rocked up to their local GameStop on launch day only to find their console screens punctured by a poorly-placed staple. Keen to escape the hot water that such a fiasco (rightfully) landed the company in, GameStop attempted to make light of the situation with a new advertisement announcing console restocks in its stores, but the joke has only ended up pinning more trouble on the company. <em>Tut, tut</em>.</p>
<p>We'll start with the self-deprecating promo itself. GameStop proudly announced its Switch 2 restocks with the new tagline, "Staples not included". The accompanying picture in the company's <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1934729633393725468">announcement tweet</a> shows a Switch 2 unit suspended in mid-air, with a red stapler brandishing a "Do Not Use On Box" message in the foreground.</p>
<p>While perhaps a bit insensitive to those unlucky enough to land a punctured unit, it's just about self-critical enough that we cracked a little smile when we first saw it. "Fair play, GameStop," we thought to ourselves, "you might just bounce back from this"...</p>
<p><em>Whoops</em>, spoke too soon! As it turns out, GameStop forgot to staple some photo credit to its funny little promo. That cool image of the floating Switch 2? It ain't GameStop's to use.</p>
<p>As pointed out on Twitter by Bloomberg's <a href="https://x.com/chriswelch/status/1934750202478711084">Chris Welch</a>, the snap was originally taken by photographer Janelle Jones <em>for</em> Bloomberg. It even takes centre stage on the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-06-16/nintendo-switch-review-hardware-performance-game-selection-battery-life">outlet's console review</a>, for crying out loud! All GameStop did was crudely edit a picture of a stapler over the OG's dock without credit or mention. You can see it for yourself in Welch's tweet below — <em>spoiler</em>: it's not a good look for ol' GS.</p>

<p>As it stands, the GameStop promo is still live on the store's social media accounts, but we imagine it will only be a matter of time before that quietly disappears from our feeds. <em>Sigh</em>, only GameStop could manage to land itself in more hot water while attempting to make light of a previous slip-up.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-outlines-season-17-due-to-begin-on-june-24/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Blizzard has announced that Season 17 is set to begin next Tuesday in Overwatch 2. The developers also shared what players can expect to find in the upcoming season of the free-to-play team-based hero shooter game.</p>
<p>The team previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-team-says-stadium-mode-is-very-popular-outlines-future-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that Stadium continues to be very popular among Overwatch 2 players, so it is no surprise that much of this season is dedicated to the mode. Three heroes (Zenyatta, Sigma, and Junkrat) will be available in Stadium, and two new maps are being added: Esperança and Samoa. Moreover, thanks to expanded build tools and the debut of Stadium Forge, match strategy will run deeper. Stadium Forge is a create/save/share system that will allow players to test and refine team compositions. It will even include early and late game example loadouts for every hero.</p>
<p>Season 17 will also see the first-ever Stadium rank reset, giving everyone a fresh start to prove their skill. Drives will reward consistent performance, Custom Games will let users create their own rules, and fresh All-Star rewards will incentivize players to partake in the mode.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>At long last, map voting is being added to Overwatch 2 in Quick Play and Competitive. After the role queue locks, players will see three randomized map options to choose from. Every vote adds a 1-in-10 chance to that map's odds, and the winner is selected using a roulette-style roll. Team chat, battle tags, and individual votes are hidden to minimize pressure. Leaver penalties kick in as soon as voting begins, by the way.</p>
<p><iframe title="Season 17: Powered Up! Official Trailer | Overwatch 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7p5K_d1qgfQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Blizzard is also introducing three new maps. In Core mode, Aatlis is a vibrant new Flashpoint map showcasing the beauty and culture of Morocco. With lush gardens and luxury resort spaces, this map is built for tighter fights, cleaner rotations, and fast-paced momentum. As mentioned before, in Stadium mode, the streets of Esperança return in a round-based format with new elevation layers, allowing teams to switch tactics between rounds. It's kind of a Push map designed specifically for Stadium's unique format. Finally, the volcanic control point from Samoa joins the Stadium pool, bringing lava and loadouts together. Expect open arenas, intense vertical action, and ample space for high-mobility competitions.</p>
<p>Blizzard is launching two Mythics on day one for the first time in Overwatch 2. These are D.Va's Mythic Horang Hero Skin and Reaper's Mythic Steel Death Weapon Skin, both of which evolve through four tiers.</p>
<p>In about a month, the game will get a limited-time 6v6 mode called Hacks &amp; Hijinks in which match modifiers change every round. Players might float in low gravity, chase down health packs that charge your Ultimate, or react to brand-new mechanics that shake things up. Hacks &amp; Hijinx is only going to be available on Control maps between July 15 and 28.</p>

            <p>
I find Fortnite's desperation to be the everything game both fascinating and overwhelming. There's always something new for you to do around the corner, some new game mode that's attempting to tap into current trends of whatever it is that kids are into at any given moment. Currently, on the younger audience side of things with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lego-fortnite">Lego Fortnite</a>, Epic Games are launching Expeditions, a new wave-based mode that looks like a bit of a blend between a hero <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a>.
</p>
<p>
I'll be honest, the framing of the whole thing is very much not for me, because I am not a child. A place called the Supernova Academy acts as your base before you head out on PvE missions all in the hopes of stopping "the evil Mask Maker Daigo from destroying the world". It's as generic a setup as can be, which I feel is a shame because kids do deserve quality storytelling, something which Fortnite itself isn't awful at (I don't love the FOMO nature of its events, but it's certainly Doing Something at the very least).

Missions see you facing down hordes of enemies as is typical of the wave-based format, there's a map to explore with Lego people to rescue and resources, money, and gear to gather up. You also have different hero classes to choose from, like one that can fly around to get a lay of the land, another can use rifts and summon crystals to deal damage to a bunch of enemies, you get how this all works.
</p>
<p>
The whole thing very much feels like it was made for kids who think the big boy shooters their siblings or teenagers are playing online look really cool, but obviously are far from old enough to play. This is a Fortnite mode though, as cynical as I might feel about this thing, I'm sure it'll do well enough.

Lego Fortnite Expeditions is launching tomorrow, June 18th.

It can be a little tricky to nail this move at first. <strong>The secret to Rail Riding is to either drive over them when they’re already underneath you (such as with train tracks) or to land on them from above after using a ramp or a charge jump.</strong> Your aiming needs to be great here because while your kart will only magnetize to them if it’s very close.</p><p>Landing on a rail from a ramp or high jump is pretty easy. If you find yourself just missing the mark, try performing a spinning trick by pressing R + left or right. This is a great way to nudge yourself slightly to the side when you’re in the air. If you’re having trouble with Charge Jumps, remember that you need to be driving straight. Charge Jumps are done by holding down R until you notice blue sparks coming out from the back tires. Letting go of R will launch you straight into the air or up and to the side if you move left or right at the same time.</p><p>Grinding on rails is a pretty on-rails technique (heh), with your kart simply following along without any input. That doesn’t mean you’re forced to sit there and watch. You’ll steadily build up a turbo charge just like drifting, but you can only use the boost by jumping off. It’s also possible to trick jump in place, although this seems more beneficial for dodging enemy <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-bullet-boo-flower-shell-bob-omb-kamek-1851783874&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-bullet-boo-flower-shell-bob-omb-kamek-1851783874">power-ups</a></span> than gaining any speed.</p><h2 id="h507931"><a id="2"></a>How to Wall Ride</h2><figure id="" data-id="928caf138c916397df80a4fc2a6a8591" data-recommend-id="image://928caf138c916397df80a4fc2a6a8591" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A purple Yoshi collects coins while wall riding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A purple Yoshi collects coins while wall riding." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="928caf138c916397df80a4fc2a6a8591" data-recommend-id="image://928caf138c916397df80a4fc2a6a8591" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A purple Yoshi collects coins while wall riding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Next up is another mechanic that can feel a little finicky, but be activated in similar ways: Wall Riding. <strong>This works by launching yourself at a wall after using a ramp or Charge Jump.</strong> Your kart will seemingly magnetize to the surface and leave you driving sideways for a few seconds.</p><p>This technique works in more places than you’d think. As long as the surface is a bit bigger than your kart and relatively flat, you can wall ride along the likes of buildings, natural terrain, and even big trucks on the road. Wall riding builds up your mini-turbo incredibly fast, so it’s great to use these for some quick boosts when appropriate. Keep in mind that not every wall will be a benefit in every race. The same can also be applied to rails, as I’ve grinded quite a few and been taken off course.</p><p>Trying to ride on every rail and wall you see in Free Roam mode is a must. Besides being a ton of fun and helping you master these techniques, it can be necessary for collecting some Peach Medallions or completing specific P-Block challenges.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Tron: Catalyst Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/tron-catalyst-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tron-catalyst-review.1220796/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tron-catalyst-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's easy to get drawn in by the unmistakable chrome and neon look of the Tron movies. It definitely made Tron: Catalyst, a top-down action game set in a different virtual world than those we've seen in the films, catch my eye. But in this case, those aesthetics only carried me so far. It doesn't make any critical system errors, but almost every part of it seems like it could have used a little more compute time.
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Catalyst focuses on a determined and likeable courier program, Exo, who gets mixed up in a sweeping conspiracy relating to a potential hard reset of the server she and her fellow digital consciousnesses reside on. This Arq Grid was created by Kevin Flynn, AKA Jeff Bridges from the films, and is currently the stage for an interesting political struggle between the authoritarian organization Core and their free-thinking opponents, Automata. Getting to explore this world held my attention, but a lot about it felt two-dimensional.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Tron: Catalyst Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the life it has is injected by occasional dialogue scenes with fairly respectable but somewhat inconsistent voice acting, and I’m not sure the cartoon character art hit quite the right tone. It almost reminds me of the animated kids’ shows Disney often does these days to follow up many of their popular, live-action blockbusters. And that doesn't quite fit the gloomy, noir vibes of apocalyptic intrigue. I did like the character designs conceptually, though. Every major player is certainly distinct and imaginative.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Catalyst really is the picture of a game that is merely pretty good and rarely ever great.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The plot is also just alright. At the risk of repeating myself, Catalyst really is the picture of a game that is merely pretty good and rarely ever great, in just about every arena. I was interested in the various factions and sub-factions, but they never got fleshed out enough to matter. I was intrigued by the central mystery and the looming threat of the server ending, but I rarely felt a strong urgency to unravel those threads. The writing at least does what it needs to do to move things, but frequently relies on what feel like deliberate leaps of logic to avoid breaking up the flow of a level.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The best example of this is the Glitch, a condition affecting Exo that allows her to reset the server to an earlier state. This is essentially a way to start the current chapter over from the beginning, but retaining any knowledge you've gained, abilities you've earned, and shortcuts you've unlocked remaining open. It’s a very clever idea, but I feel like this mechanic had a lot more potential than what it ends up being used for.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Glitch mechanic had a lot more potential than what it ends up being used for.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the time, I simply pressed the reset button when the quest objective told me to, or when I'd goofed up big time by getting too much heat from the Core enforcers. There weren't enough instances in which I felt like I could use it in a clever or dynamic way to open up optional paths or gain an advantage I wouldn't have had simply by following the main quest rigidly. It’s a time loop story without a lot of opportunities to exploit the fact that you know what’s going to happen. Time travel is always tricky to work with, and Tron: Catalyst mostly plays it safe in that regard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is also, and I'm sorry again for sounding like a broken record, but… it's fine. The controls are very responsive and the animations are kinetic and snappy. It looks cool as hell to dance back and forth through a pack of cyber cops, bouncing the light disc off walls and slashing away with stylish violence. But it started to feel fairly repetitive and never really got my blood pumping or my neurons firing in the way a better action game might because its attempts to keep me on my toes never succeeded at breaking me out of the same basic hack and slash routine.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Len's Top 10 Games Based on 80s Movie Franchises</h3><p>The films of the 80s have inspired many a great game over the years. Here are some of the best.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a respectable difficulty curve, introducing new mechanics along the way like the ability to steal an enemy's code to copy their fighting style, or bosses that can only be damaged by parrying one of their attacks first. But too many fights can still be concluded swiftly and with token effort by spamming dodge and melee attacks. Eventually Catalyst introduces a stealth system, but I didn't use it except when I was forced to because it's pretty dull, and fighting through a level the loud way seemed so risk-free that it didn't even offer a meaningful advantage.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There's a respectable difficulty curve, introducing new mechanics along the way.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The key problem with combat is that it usually doesn't feel necessary to think very tactically to progress on the default difficulty. This is the entire skill tree right here, and it's possible to fill it out completely long before the end of the journey if you're meticulous about looking for secrets like I am, so there aren’t a lot of either/or choices to make. Even stolen enemy abilities that can power up your attacks like this blade module didn't end up feeling all that impactful for me, to the point that I wasn't bothering with them in the majority of fights. To be clear, it's not bad. It's fun enough. But that's all it ever is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, a Tron game without light cycles would be very odd indeed, so Catalyst gives you one pretty early on that makes it quick and enjoyable to navigate some of its larger areas. Many outdoor zones still ended up being a bit cramped for how fast this thing is, though. And the few instances of light cycle combat or chases highlighted how clunky it can feel in certain circumstances. There's even a light jet you get to pilot later, but this felt even more like a minigame and less like a well-thought-out mechanic.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe the aspect I was most underwhelmed by, though, was the music. At this point, I associate the Tron universe with the likes of Daft Punk and Trent Reznor. And that's a high bar, I'll admit. I doubt any of those guys are available to create bespoke music for a project of this modest scale. But Tron: Catalyst's subdued, understated, overly safe blend of orchestral and electronic never gave me the chills I was looking for, even when I put my nice headphones on and turned the volume way up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The score often fades into the background because it's too repetitive, and it doesn't vary enough in intensity between stretches of low-key exploration and the biggest plot reveals or action sequences. Sure, it does the job. But if there's one aspect where I would expect a Tron tie-in to go above and beyond, it would be the music. So it was harder to accept “merely acceptable” on that front.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it might sound like damning with faint praise, I honestly think one of the aspects of Tron: Catalyst that works best is its restrained scope and length. It didn't even take me 12 hours to finish, playing pretty meticulously, and that's just about exactly how much attention I had to give its digital world. It would have been really easy to overstay its welcome, especially with the meager trickle of new mechanics it doles out, so it was definitely a smart decision to not pad this out. Playtime isn't directly correlated with quality, and I respect how much this adventure respected my time.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/im-reviewing-death-stranding-2-heres-what-i-thought-of-the-original<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hello. I’m Simon, and I’ll be reviewing Death Stranding 2: On the Beach for IGN. As you probably know, the response to the original Death Stranding was varied to say the least, so I thought it would be helpful to provide a bit of context regarding my own feelings about the 2019 sci-fi epic before hearing my thoughts on the sequel. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I didn’t review Death Stranding for IGN – that was the job of the excellent Tristan Ogilvie, and you can read his <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/01/death-stranding-review"><u>thoughts here</u></a>. His score of 6.8 isn’t anywhere close to the most negative assessment Death Stranding received at launch, but it’s also far from the glowing praise some others bestowed upon it. As I said, verdicts were varied, and I’m about to add yet another to that mix. Opinions are inherently subjective, especially when it comes to art, so naturally my thoughts on Death Stranding differ from Tristan's, albeit not by too much. This is not a re-review, so you won’t get a different score here, but let me explain what I did and didn’t like about the original.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with the story, arguably the most complex and divisive aspect of Death Stranding. It’s the element I enjoyed the most, as I fully embraced its ever-increasing glossary of fresh sci-fi terminology and ended up quite connected to its core cast of characters. I think it's definitely the sort of experience that rewards you the more you put into its world, and while it can prove a little impenetrable during its slower, earlier hours, I really did end up fully invested by its final act. Sam’s connection to Lou, as well as the dynamic between Cliff Unger and Die-Hardman, especially resonated with me. Die-Hardman’s final scene, brilliantly brought to life by Tommie Earl Jenkins, is one of the most affecting performances in a video game that I can remember. That’s not to say that the rest of the cast aren’t also fantastic; I could lay on praise for all of them, ranging from Margaret Qualley’s dual roles to Lea Seydoux’s complicated Fragile. I’m looking forward to seeing new faces join them this time around, in particular Elle Fanning’s enigmatic Tomorrow, and I’m willing to go on the record as saying I don’t trust her at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, there’s a huge scale here in its world-ending events and giant oil monsters, but this is the sort of sci-fi and post-apocalypse fiction I really connect with – grand, global stories rooted in deeply personal tales, a la Denis Villeneuve’s Arrival or Cormac McCarthy’s The Road. Death Stranding delicately balances moments of wonder, whether they be colossal looming threats or simply walking over the crest of a hill to a dose of Low Roar, with one-on-one conversations that anchor that grandeur in relatable humanity. It’s those very human themes of birth, death, hope, and grief that we can all relate to, and I enjoyed greatly how these shone through, no matter how much alien language was thrown my way over the 40 or so hours its tale takes to tell.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is the sort of sci-fi and post-apocalypse fiction I really connect with – grand, global stories rooted in deeply personal tales.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of gameplay, it looks like we’ll be getting more of that MGS-flavour tactical espionage action from Death Stranding 2, if recent hands-on previews are anything to go by. This excites me greatly, because no matter how much I enjoyed the original’s story, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t find the act of actually playing Death Stranding a slog at times. In fact, it’s what made me bounce off of it when it first released back in 2019. On my first go around, I got just a handful of hours in before deciding all that walking just wasn’t working for me. Its routine of setting out for a hike, crossing rivers and mountains, before eventually reaching nothing more exciting than a delivery location became tiresome for me very quickly, especially during its laborious (and seemingly never-ending) third chapter. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But I’m very glad I gave it another shot a couple of years ago, this time playing the Director’s Cut to completion, as I found myself having a much more enjoyable time with it. That new version’s addition of deeper combat and new delivery tools, such as the companion bot and catapult, introduced some much-needed variety into the mix. Plus, the fact that many half-built highways, helpful ladders, and convenient bridges already existed in the world thanks to the online Chiral network definitely made the journey a lot smoother than it was at launch. The further I got into the game and the more my collection of tools grew, the more fun I found myself having. I bombed along on a motorcycle and enjoyed setting up zipline systems to dart around with ease. I’m hopeful that many of these more convenient delivery options are available from the get-go in Death Stranding 2.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Travelling across Death Stranding’s world was ultimately rewarding, then, but I still can’t say I ever fully clicked with its combat. Yes, I did have a good laugh chucking blood and piss grenades at a big oily lion, but I largely found its BT encounters a bit of trudge. It meant that I avoided conflict as much as I could – a perfectly valid way to play Death Stranding, but one that did result in me letting out a groan every time it started to rain. I also found myself largely dodging human enemies, too, with their yellow hazmat suits often signifying tedious stealth situations. I’m encouraged, then, that Death Stranding 2 looks to be quite a bit more action-heavy in the way it's expanding your arsenal and enabling you to deal with threats in more dynamic ways. While I’m not asking for Sam to become a super soldier able to take waves of enemies head-on, I am looking forward to wielding a bit more firepower this time around instead of opting to skirt around the edges of combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, the TLDR version is that I really enjoyed the world of Death Stranding and its characters, but didn’t find the moment-to-moment gameplay consistently rewarding. I liked it, just didn’t love it. I am very excited to jump back in with Death Stranding 2, though – from what we’ve seen so far, it does look like the story is packed full of intrigue again, and that we’ll be treated to the sort of spectacle that rarely gets created outside of Kojima’s studio walls. I’m just hoping it has the gameplay to match its cinematic ambitions this time around, and doesn’t make the gaps between its gloriously sculpted cutscenes as much of a chore. I guess we’ll all find out when my review of Death Stranding 2 drops on June 23rd.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

                <p>Greek teenager Angelos Mako was a young man on a mission. Almost 10 years since Facebook removed Dungeon Rampage, Mako wanted to bring back the game that was a safe space for him during a rough time in his life. After years of trying to recreate the code, Mako now owns the code and the license, and it'll soon be available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3053950/Dungeon_Rampage/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>.</p><p>"My parents were going through a very nasty divorce.

<p>Playing the game every day for five years straight, it became part of his young life, then suddenly the game was removed. That set off his quest to get it back, even at the age of 10.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4515870-scwbbt.png" data-ref-id="1300-4515870" data-ratio="0.5671875" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4515870-scwbbt.png" data-ref-id="1300-4515870"></a><figcaption>Dungeon Rampage is back!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4515870-scwbbt.png"></figure><p>"I couldn't fathom it. I couldn't understand why it happened," he continued. "But even from that moment, I said that I'm going to find a way to get this back again. I had no clue how, but I had a dream."</p><p>He eventually did some apprenticeships for a Roblox team, working in Unity. While he was doing that, four years later, he ran across a Discord server that was trying to remake Dungeon Rampage and joined in. He quickly learned they wanted to remake the game instead of restoring the original, but Mako took over that project last year, trying to do more of the latter.</p><p>"I was fed up. I wanted this to come to life," Mako said. "Okay, I'm starting from scratch. I'm taking initiative. And I went directly to try and get the copyright of Dungeon Rampage." Using a saved credits screen from the game, he made a LinkedIn account and messaged everyone he could find. "People replied, actually. That's the weird part."</p><p>One of the first people to reach out was Jason Yeung, the game's original creative director. Yeung agreed that the attempt to remake Dungeon Rampage was a cool project, but he needed to speak with Mike Goslin, former head of Rebel Entertainment, the original Dungeon Rampage developer. Mako soon spoke to Goslin on the phone, who then introduced him to the CEO of the parent company, and he got his license agreement.</p><p>Only one problem: Nobody seemed to have the original code.</p><p>Mako tracked down the last engineer on the project, who said he might have the files of the last build on a laptop--something he gave his young daughter to play with. Luckily, the laptop and the files were still intact. It turned out to be a tougher challenge than they expected because Dungeon Rampage wasn't a simple Flash game; it was Flash and C++ and a PHP backend. When one part was working fine, others seemed to fall apart, but after several trials and errors, the game finally booted up, with Mako being the first one to play it in eight years.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gamebreaking/dungeon-rampage" rel="nofollow ">Kickstarter campaign</a> was set up and easily crushed its initial $25,000 goal--it's at $66,000 now, and on its final day. The team event got access to the original game's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dungeonrampage/">Facebook</a> page as well.</p><p>"It's a very fun game and it's been a very fun game forever," Mako added. "Those first days of playing again were the first days of discovering fire as a caveman. That's my best analogy of this."</p>

<p>Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedys-control-spin-off-fbc-firebreak-has-only-come-together-at-the-last-minute-and-somehow-feels-better-for-it">hands-on with FBC: Firebreak</a> earlier in the year and called it a "frantic, electrifying run-based shooter, with difficulties feeling like gambles".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sifu-developers-next-game-will-give-football-a-fresh-perspective">Rematch, meanwhile, comes from Sifu developer Sloclap</a> and gives a fresh perspective on the beautiful game.</p>
<p>The following games will all be leaving Game Pass on 30th June:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arcade Paradise (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Journey to the Savage Planet (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>My Friend Peppa Pig (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Robin Hood: Sherwood Builders (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>SteamWorld Dig (Cloud and Console)</li>
<li>SteamWorld Dig 2 (Console and PC)</li>
</ul>
<p>To keep playing these games after they leave Game Pass, you'll need to purchase them - luckily Game Pass subscribers get a 20 percent discount.</p>
