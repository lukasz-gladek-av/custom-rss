            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A report from <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/deals/ea-private-deal-buyout-video-game-maker-808aefec">The Wall Street Journal</a> reveals that EA is closing in on a deal to become a private company, with private equity investors including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and the firm Silver Lake putting up a massive $50 billion to buy out the company. According to The WSJ, if this buyout were to go through, it would go down as the "<em>largest leveraged buyout ever.</em>"</p>



<p>Details on the deal are currently unclear, and of course, we don't necessarily know if it'll go through or not. Large-stakes deals involving Saudi Arabia and its growing interests in the videogame industry have <a href="https://wccftech.com/embracer-group-stock-crashes-following-cancellation-of-transformative-2-billion-deal/">gone under at the last minute for what remain unknown reasons</a>.</p>



<p>It's also not the first time that we've seen the idea of EA changing in ownership getting tossed around, as there were <a href="https://wccftech.com/disney-gaming-giant-buy-ea-iger-noncommital/">reports of Disney potentially looking at acquiring EA in 2023</a>, though nothing ever came of the idea in part due to chief executive officer Bob Iger not wanting to invest so much in that direction. </p>



<p>Still, if this deal that the WSJ has reported goes through and EA becomes a private company, it could potentially mean a massive shift for one of the videogame industry's largest publishers and developers. Since the WSJ's report broke, EA's <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/26/electronic-arts-buyout.html">stock has reportedly jumped up 15%</a>.</p>

<section><p>Some gaming experiences are more fun after everyone else is done with it.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>On September 4, I was one of the many eager Hollow Knight fans who hastily opened up every gaming storefront to experience the moment when the ludicrously long wait for Hollow Knight: Silksong finally ended. Like everyone else, I experienced the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-releases-immediately-crashes-steam-and-nintendo-eshop/1100-6534478/"> crashing of these storefronts</a>, but eventually, to my delight, I managed to install Silksong on my Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">I've barely touched the game since.</p><p dir="ltr">More than three weeks after its noteworthy launch, my progress in the game is significantly behind that of my friends and peers. Some have already rolled credits, and lengthy, spoiler-tagged conversations about Silksong on Discord read like classified CIA documents. Meanwhile, I've only just defeated the Bell Beast, an important but fairly early boss that you encounter in the story’s first hour.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a common occurrence for me to download the newest, hottest video game, only to briefly tinker around with it before moving on to something else. Over the years, it's been challenging to pinpoint why this is. And while there's surely a number of different factors that contribute to this, I eventually realized what was behind this block with Silksong: I'm afraid to play it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4575789-010_bellbeast%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575789" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4575789-010_bellbeast%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575789"></a><figcaption>Hornet takes on the Bell Beast.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4575789-010_bellbeast%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I'm not scared of the game itself or its content--while there are some gnarly and unsettling sights in the world of Hollow Knight, it's not a particularly scary game. Rather, I'm afraid of getting lost. I'm afraid of the uncertainties ahead as I progress through the labyrinths of Pharloom and the indecision that comes with each split path. I'm afraid of not knowing where the next bench will be as I stray farther away from a safe haven--as the probability of dying suddenly and losing my rosaries increases.</p><p dir="ltr">This is a phenomenon I often experience with metroidvanias--one in which fear and apprehension overcome logic as I reach areas that I perceive to be dead ends, leading me to abandon that playthrough for an extended period. Yet, this all seems to contradict the fact that the metroidvania is one of my favorite genres of video games. From Ori and the Blind Forest to Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, I revel in the opportunity to explore a sprawling yet intricately designed map. There are very few moments in gaming that can rival the gratification of unlocking a power-up that opens up new doors, or finding a shortcut that makes exploration much easier. I actually quite enjoy backtracking, especially as you gain more abilities and skills, and appreciate any game where I can revisit older areas with a fresh perspective and spiffy new movement techniques.</p><p dir="ltr">But for my weird and special brain, all of this has to be done at a certain, slower pace, lest I overwhelm myself with the aforementioned anxieties. And for better or worse, both Hollow Knight games are the biggest culprits of evoking that uneasiness because of the vastness of their worlds, and the multi-step processes (and currency) necessary to create functional maps that assist in your exploration.</p><p dir="ltr">Even so, I still desire to explore every corner of Pharloom, expand my map by documenting every nook and cranny, and squeeze out as many activities as I can. My cautious approach to gaming has led me to a more patient approach to this game--one where I feel content to let others enjoy it and document their findings and thoughts before I plunge back into the depths.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4575790-nintendoswitch2_hollow_knight_silksong_screenshot-4%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575790" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4575790-nintendoswitch2_hollow_knight_silksong_screenshot-4%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575790"></a><figcaption>Hornet explores a lush, green environment.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4575790-nintendoswitch2_hollow_knight_silksong_screenshot-4%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There's an entire <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/" rel="nofollow ">online community of "patient gamers,"</a> or people who wait at least a full year to play popular titles. While I don’t count myself as a member of this community, I do like a few of its tenets. The promises of bug fixes, balance changes, and DLC releases are good reasons to wait on any game--Silksong has already seen meaningful changes to make for a better experience, with new content also on the way. But it's the prospect of having more documentation, tips, and walkthroughs available that motivates me to play Silksong at a slower pace.</p><p dir="ltr">After sitting on the original Hollow Knight for a long time, I aggressively got back into the game once it became clear that a Silksong release date was imminent. I had abandoned it about a year ago when I was stuck on the Soul Master boss fight, but through numerous attempts--and the help of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NlFhbr_gvk">YouTube guides</a>--I finally defeated it and was able to move on. And I've felt a lot more confident and empowered during my more recent Hollow Knight exploits thanks to having interactive maps, endless YouTube tutorial videos, and countless forums at my disposal.</p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps it's not the "correct" way to play Hollow Knight, but I believe it's a valid approach to it--or any game, for that matter. Yes, I am more dependent on external help and watching the experiences of other players, but I am still fully engaging with the game itself and using that knowledge to gain the confidence to figure out my own approaches to what Hollow Knight throws at me.</p><p dir="ltr">Developer Team Cherry, as with any studio and its games, crafted Hollow Knight and Silksong in a deliberate manner to invoke certain feelings and behavior as you play. I understand arguments that taking my time and constantly checking maps and videos to ensure I'm on the right track detract from the curated experience, but I still feel that surprise and awe. The way I see it, I'm playing the game on an easy mode that I've made myself.</p><p dir="ltr">For instance, in the little time I've played Silksong, I walked into a room only to see that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/hollow-knight-silksong-boss-guide/2900-6988/#7">infamous mini-boss Skarrgard</a> was at the other end--and having spoiled myself by reading discourse on that encounter, I noped the heck out of that room.</p><p dir="ltr">I liken it to how I research horror movies before watching them in theaters to make sure I'm prepared for any intense or gory scenes. Yes, it might spoil a pivotal moment for Weapons, but it also ensures that I'm ready for the shock--and I still find myself appropriately uneasy during the moment. I can still appreciate it in the context of the rest of the story. My experience with a piece of art, no matter how it was crafted, is unique to me, and although I might engage with a metroidvania differently than intended, I still get the satisfaction I need from it through my own approach.</p><p dir="ltr">I admire anyone devoted enough to a new release that they skip work and dive into the rabbit hole, eager to be one of the first players ever to discover its secrets and have a complete, unspoiled experience. For games like Silksong, that isn't me, and I think that's okay.</p><p dir="ltr">In recent times, we feel so much pressure to finish games as quickly as possible, whether it's due to internal pressure or the looming, impending release of the Next Big Game in a packed and relentless release schedule. Amid that tidal wave of new games, it’s important to remember that it’s solely your own choice on when and how to engage with them. There may be some joy in getting through the door first and comparing notes with everyone else as they all delve into the unknown, but that collective hype doesn’t have to dictate your playing (or spending) habits.</p><p dir="ltr">One day, sooner or later, I'll get back into that Silksong rabbit hole myself, albeit with some guard rails. No matter how you choose to play a game like Hollow Knight: Silksong, just remember that they’re always there, and you deserve to play and finish them exactly the way you want to.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/amount-of-video-games-released-on-steam-has-gone-up-93-from-2020-to-2024/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-26/the-video-game-industry-has-a-problem-there-are-too-many-games?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1ODkwNzA3MSwiZXhwIjoxNzU5NTExODcxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMzdHSzZHUFFRVkswMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.lidXNm4rmbqYYLqJZbYiy4XcuF9d7QqKMdctRoZmr7g">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, which centers around one of the modern video game industry's issues: there are simply too many games. Schreier pointed out a staggering statistic to consider about how the industry has changed in the last few years, showing that according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/">SteamDB</a>, the amount of games released on Steam in 2020 totalled around 9,656. In 2024, that number went up 93%, to 18,626.</p>



<p>In today's attention economy, where video game developers aren't just competing with other developers to get players buying and playing their games but with streaming services, social media apps, and so on, it's hard enough for studios to sell copies in the first place. Add to that the fact that there are more games launching all the time, every day, with both big triple-A titles and small indie titles vying for attention, and the problem is further exacerbated.</p>



<p>To be clear, this isn't necessarily a problem for casual video game enjoyer-Joe Blow. It's arguably a better time than ever before to be someone who enjoys playing video games, simply because there is such a flux of good games to play, at a variety of price points, available on multiple devices and even on ones that don't need to be primed for playing games, thanks to better-than-ever cloud streaming services.</p>



<p>But it is a growing challenge for game developers who, particularly when you consider that games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-biggest-competitor-threat-video-games-industry/">Fortnite and other live-service forever-style games</a> are the biggest competition to anyone trying to just release a new, fully-formed game.</p>



<p>You won't see game studios cite the fact that there are 'too many games' as a reason for why their laying off staff or shutting down, but this is a new reality that the industry is having to grapple with now more than before.</p>



<p>It's not necessarily something that can be solved, nor should it really be considered a problem, so to speak. But it can't be denied that the growth of the video game industry in recent years means there's a new normal that game developers simply did not have to contend with at the same level a short five years ago.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a> was, at one point, going to be a free-to-play game that would have been “completely” different than what we got in 2024. And this pivot is part of the reason why <em>Helldivers 2</em> has some nasty performance problems.</p> <p>When <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-update-terminid-2000620349"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a> launched on PS5 and PC early last year, it quickly became a massive hit for PlayStation and developers Arrowhead. And since then, the sci-fi co-op shooter has remained popular as more updates have expanded the game, adding new weapons, enemies, locations, and more. But in recent months, players have complained about performance issues and technical problems.&nbsp; <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-new-content-bug-fixes-1851419351">Arrowhead’s CEO, Shams Jorjani,</a> isn’t shying away from these criticisms and is directly addressing them in the official <em>Helldivers 2</em> Discord server. And it’s here that he also revealed that at one point in time, <em>Helldivers 2</em> was a much smaller game that was planned to be free-to-play and not a paid experience.</p> <p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arrowhead-ceo-blames-helldivers-2-performance-issues-on-tech-debt-accumulated-thanks-to-goalposts-being-moved-a-few-times-during-development-the-foundations-of-this-big-tower-were-made-for-a-little-bungalow/">On September 25</a>, while talking to fans about <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-sequel-dei-politics-woke-arrowhead-1851731175">Helldivers 2</a> a</em>nd its ongoing performance issues on console and PC on Discord, Jorjani explained that the shooter had a lot of built-up “tech debt” from various pivots that happened during development.</p> <p>“[<em>Helldivers 2</em>] started as a AA game,” <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1420832196813389824">said the CEO</a>. “[It] then grew in scope, then pivoted to a launch title for PS5, then pivoted to F2P, then back to premium ( I might have the order messed up) – so the goal posts were moved a few times – so the foundations of this big tower were made for a little bungalow on the beach.”</p>

 <p>As far as I know, this is the first time it’s been officially confirmed by anyone at Arrowhead publicly that <em>Helldivers 2</em> was at one point planned to be free-to-play. It’s interesting to think about now, and according to Jorjani, that version of the game would have had a “completely different content pipeline” and would have likely been a very different game compared to what we actually got.</p>

 <p>“I wasn’t with Arrowhead back then so I don’t know – but the model was always to give away as much nice stuff for free and monetize other things,” said Jorjani. “It would have been a completely different angle. It [would have] required a completely different content pipeline.”</p>

 <p>Making all of these changes and pivots during development led to a lot of tech debt, which the CEO says is a big reason the game’s performance is “so-so.” But they are planning to improve things in the future, with the CEO telling fans in the Discord that improving the game is like cleaning out a garage.</p> <p>“Tech debt is like a garage filled with stuff you just chucked in,” said the CEO. “We really need to put up shelves in the back to get organized.” This isn’t the first time he’s talked about the game’s tech debt causing issues. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-ceo-just-comes-out-and-says-it-the-technical-debt-is-crippling-and-we-didnt-hit-the-mark-with-into-the-unjust-update-so-arrowhead-is-trying-to-get-our-s-in-order/">Earlier this month,</a> he reiterated that<em> Helldivers 2</em> wasn’t in a great place and that the team needed to get their “shit in order” and fix it.</p>

Then we ask whether we need a <em>Deus Ex </em>remaster when it basically just makes a game from 2000 look like a game from 2004.

We also talk about what’s known about <a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/the-ice-shooters-motive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the shooter at a Dallas ICE facility</a> this week, and how it feels like meme culture has taken on the role that video games once played in being blamed for violence.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-rebirth-switch-2-xbox-port-part-3-2000629254</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/live-action-beauty-and-the-beast-was-an-inspiration-for-ff7-remake-trilogy-says-director.1310022/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Square Enix arguably broke the internet about 10 years ago when it finally revealed it was working on a long-anticipated remake of <i>Final Fantasy 7</i>. Now, in 2025, two parts of this trilogy project have arrived on PlayStation and PC, with ports expected on Switch 2 and Xbox in the near future.</p> <p>Speaking with a number of outlets, <i>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</i>’s director Naoki Hamaguchi shed some light on <i>FF7 Remake</i>’s upcoming arrival on Switch 2 and Xbox, what it took to get the game running on less powerful hardware, how <i>Rebirth</i> is shaping up on Switch 2, and which <i>Final Fantasy</i> he’d be eager to see remade next.</p> <h2>The key to the Switch 2’s <i>FF7R</i> port was nailing the lighting</h2> <p><a href="https://screenrant.com/ff7-remake-director-interview-rebirth-switch-2-confirmed/">Speaking to <i>ScreenRant</i></a>, Hamaguchi zeroed in on “character expressions” and “lighting” as being essential to delivering a quality experience on Nintendo’s hybrid console:</p>

 <blockquote><p>Our aim was to align more towards the lightning we see in the PS5 version, and then we also kind of balance this by aligning more towards the sort of switch to post-effect and fog. And in this way the user is not really able to make out a huge difference</p></blockquote> <p><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-xbox">In an interview with <i>Inverse</i></a>, Hamaguchi said that a Switch 2 port seemed likely early on once “Nintendo first shared with [Square Enix] the new hardware […] the thought came to me that <i>Final Fantasy 7 </i>can likely run on these specs.”</p>

 <p>According to Hamaguchi, the Xbox version was already in the works before the team got their first look at the Switch 2 hardware. And, contrary to what you may think, the underpowered Series S wasn’t much of an issue. Though the team has run into some memory problems on Series S, Hamaguchi still describes Microsoft’s budget console as “quite high in terms of specs.”</p>

 <p><i>FF7 Remake</i> isn’t the only part of the remake project headed to Switch 2. The more graphically ambitious <i>Rebirth</i> is also expected to arrive at some point in the future. Hamaguchi described <i>Rebirth</i> as being in a “working state” on Switch 2. “Our desire was to be able to ultimately offer and serve all of the platforms available,” Hamaguchi told <i>ScreenRant</i>. He declined to say, however, whether or not the third installment will arrive as a multiplatform title on day one.</p>

 <h2>Development on part three of <i>FF7</i> remake’s trilogy is ‘going extremely well’</h2> <p>The <i>FF7 </i>remake project is still ongoing, with a yet-unnamed third entry on the horizon. Hamaguchi describes development as “going extremely well.” “A lot of the content is already playable,” <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-selling-well-no-need-to-worry-about-the-trilogys-finale-director-naoki-hamaguchi-says/">he told <i>Automaton</i></a>, “and the game’s direction and form are firmly set in place. Right now the team is united around refining everything.”</p>

 <p><i>FF7</i>’s remakes have certainly impressed a number of fans, but concerns over the sales of the last entry and the general direction of the various plot changes do remain. For his part, Hamaguchi has described <i>Rebirth</i> as “doing very well on both PS5 and PC” in terms of sales. He also shared with <i>ScreenRant</i> how the recent live-action <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> remake inspired his decisions in reinterpreting <i>FF7</i> for the remake trilogy:</p> <blockquote><p>When development [on <i>FF7 Remake</i>] was happening, the <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> movie remake was released. That movie, the original, was one I watched as a child. And then they now had the live-action that’s a remake…I saw the overall story and the world itself was not altered, but it was completely deconstructed in a way to really entertain today’s viewers, which was deeply satisfying.</p></blockquote> <p>Although <i>FF7</i>’s remake chapters have occupied his time, Hamaguchi has spent some time daydreaming about other possible remakes in the classic JRPG series. <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/final-fantasy-7-director-on-xbox">Speaking to <i>Windows Central</i></a>, the director described <i>FF6</i> as his favorite, saying “That would be very cool to take on as a remake. I’ve put my heart and soul into the <i>Final Fantasy 7 Remake</i> series for over a decade now. Working on something completely new would be quite fun as well.”</p>

			<p>Heart Machine, the studio behind Hyper Light Breaker, Hyper Light Drifter, and Solar Ash, is getting ready to release its next game, Possessor(s), which it has announced will arrive on PC and PS5 on November 11, 2025.</p>



<p>Possessor(s) is a 2D search-action title where you play as Luca, but you also play as Rhem, the demon possessing Luca, as you both work together to escape the clutches of a company called Agradyne, who was using demons like Rhem to power the energy they sold to Sanzu City, the game's setting.</p>



<p>A gameplay overview trailer that debuted today alongside the release date news shows off the art and design chops Heart Machine is known for, while also delving into what Possessor(s) is about, and a bit more on how the high school-aged Luca and the demon Rhem ended up having to work together.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The launch of Possessor(s) will mark the second major release for Heart Machine in 2025 as it started the year with the early access launch of Hyper Light Breaker. Since then, the game has <a href="https://wccftech.com/hyper-light-breakers-first-major-update-buried-below-arrives-next-week-game-key-giveaway/">received multiple updates</a>, the most recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1534840/view/497207097933433675?l=english">having arrived earlier this week</a>, as Heart Machine continues to fix and tweak the game in collaboration with its community.</p>



<p>Unlike Hyper Light Breaker, Possessor(s) is not releasing in early access, with the complete game set to launch in a little more than a month at the time of this writing.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/forget-pricey-tablets-from-apple-and-samsung-this-galaxy-tab-a9-plus-is-going-for-nothing-before-october-prime-day.1309989/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve been perusing for a fancy new tablet, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4336/">do take note that the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ just got its price chopped down over at Amazon.</a> Usually this Samsung tablet starts at&nbsp; $220, but right now you can score the 11-inch Android for just $159. The 28% discount amounts to a savings of $61. That’s for the 64 GB model by the way. Double your storage, and you can still save as the 128 GB model dropped from $270 to just $209. That one is a 23% discount which works also out to you saving $61. Both versions are available in either black or silver.</p>
<p>This 2024 Galaxy tablet has a nice and large 11-inch LCD screen which can display in resolutions of up to 1200p with a refresh rate of 90 Hz. According to the product page, the Galaxy Tab A9+ can deliver a “cinema-like audio experience,” which is, uh, an obvious embellishment. No one is expecting something you can hold in your hands to match that of an AMC theater. What this is really saying is the tablet has Dolby Atmos support. You can expect terrific sound that’s loud and clear as far as tablets go coming from the on-board speakers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4336/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The build of the Galaxy tablet is slim and light, yet durable —exactly what you’d hope for on a device you’d likely to take with you out and about. Bring it from home to your office, down to a coffee house, then over to a friend’s no problem.</p>
<p>Storage we covered. You have a choice between either 64 GB or 128 GB. The price jump from one to the next is an even $50. If you expect to be downloading a bunch of movies or TV shows or storing tons of photos, you may decide it’s best to splurge. Otherwise if streaming and documents saved to the cloud will be the main way you use it, just stick with the cheaper 64 GB.</p>



<h2>Full Flexibility</h2>
<p>Android OS is able to run multiple apps at the same time, allowing you to view them side-by-side. This is excellent when multitasking, letting you work more efficiently. You can even view multiple tabs in you web browser next to each other. Transferring files is easy as Quick Share allows you to send stuff to another nearby device with just a couple button presses.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4336/">If you have little ones at home, they can enjoy your Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ as well</a>. The Samsung Kids app is filled with all sorts of playful and colorful content to keep them entertained.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/brazil-president-signs-law-to-ban-loot-boxes/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/brazil%E2%80%99s-president-signs-ban-on-loot-boxes-aimed-at-u-18s-into-law-will-go-into-effect-in-march-2026.1309974/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As a part of <a href="https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2023-2026/2025/lei/L15211.htm">a law focused on protecting Brazil's youth online</a>, a ban on loot boxes for those under 18 in Brazil has been signed into law by President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and will go into effect in March 2026, per a report from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-campaign-against-predatory-in-game-practices-takes-a-step-forward-in-brazil-as-president-lula-bans-loot-boxes-targeted-at-under-18s">Eurogamer</a>.</p>



<p>Specifically, when the law goes into effect in March, as it currently stands, games that have loot boxes will have to be rated as 18+, and any rated below that will be prohibited from including them.</p>



<p>It's the latest update in governing bodies across the world, looking more closely at loot boxes in videogames. In <a href="https://wccftech.com/dutch-government-intends-to-ban-lootboxes-in-games-alltogether/">2023, the Dutch government put forth a motion to ban loot boxes</a> in games altogether, and back in 2018, Belgium also banned loot boxes, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-cease-sales-fifa-points-belgium/">prompting the sale of FIFA points to cease in the region</a>.</p>



<p>There's also been <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-loot-box-class-action-lawsuit-canada-costly/">cases of lawsuits brought to game companies</a> over loot boxes, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/lootboxes-battlefront-ii-gambling-banned/">whether they constitute gambling</a>. Though there have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/fifa-ultimate-team-packs-arent-gambling-rules-austrian-court/">rulings pointing towards them not being gambling</a>, they remain a controversial element of modern gaming's live service era.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see how strictly this current ban in Brazil is enforced, and how game companies respond to the new law once it officially goes into effect in March of next year. Even before then, we could likely see companies lobbying in an attempt to change the law, so that we don't have a case of, as a hypothetical, EA Sports FC being rated as 18+ in Brazil, and as a game suitable for children everywhere else.</p>



<p>Though if the ban does prove effective, it could be that one of the videogame industry's largest sticking points is slowly changed through further legislation like what Brazil is implementing in other parts of the world.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/vandal-hearts-2-gradius-sword-suikoden-ps1-demo-disc-save-file-2000629247</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-26-year-old-mystery-behind-a-cult-classic-srpg%E2%80%99s-gradius-sword-has-finally-been-solved.1309971/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Vandal Hearts II</em> is an obscure strategy RPG sequel produced by Konami at the end of the PS1’s life. Few played it but many who did will cherish it forever. Now its oldest and weirdest mystery has finally be solved. A reference to Konami’s classic shoot ’em up series <em>Gradius</em> mentioned a special sword in the game’s files that no one could ever get to spawn without hacks. Fans thought up all sorts of wild theories about the “intended” way to unlock the secret, including maybe needing very specific save files from other Konami games like<em> Suikoden</em>. It turns out that they actually needed a super-rare demo disc.</p> <p>The Gradius Sword in <em>Vandal Hearts II</em> isn’t just a fun little Easter egg. The weapon contains a powerful spell called “Ripple Laser” that summons an actual 3D model of <em>Gradius</em>‘ ship, the Vic Viper, to fly across the battlefield and blow up enemies. It’s pretty powerful and has a surprisingly ornate animation for something that no one was ever able to discover in the game naturally. The result has been decades of random threads across <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/199180-vandal-hearts-ii/80436904?page=2">message boards like GameFAQs</a> and elsewhere as fans tried to figure out what you could actually do in the game to trigger the Gradius Sword to appear.</p> <p>Three years ago, the tiny <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjQ4JRg9fo">YouTube account Dragon Quarter</a> reposted footage of the Ripple Laser skill in action that was originally uploaded in 2010. Then last night, Dragon Quarter returned with a major update. “After getting a tip from a follower (who I realize now got their tip from a recent post on&nbsp;<a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/199180-vandal-hearts-ii/80436904?page=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">GameFAQs</a>) of Twitch streamer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/karkalla" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Karkalla</a>, who is currently playing through <em>Vandal Hearts II</em> for the first time, I have confirmed the Gradius Sword was originally unlocked by downloading a special save data file from Dengeki PlayStation D22 (SLPM-80471), a demo disc included with <em>Dengeki PlayStation Magazine</em> Issue 116 (dated 1999-09-24),” they <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-decades-old-mystery-about-a-hidden-unlockable-gradius-sword-in-vandal-hearts-ii-for-playstation-has-finally-been-figured-out.1309491/">posted</a> on ResetEra on Friday.</p>

  <p>According to GameFAQs user Kern, the discovery came after finding a reference to the demo disc on an older Japanese site. “Someone on a discord who had some old discs found the file on the D22 disc (which you can get from ebay),” they wrote. “I wasn’t able to verify it personally myself but he posted images of the file, and he was able to open the save file on an English copy and the Gradius sword was available for purchase.” Dragon Quarter has since confirmed it as well.</p>

 <p>This is the kind of deep gaming lore I thrive on. For years, random players <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/199180-vandal-hearts-ii/53785268">on forums have claimed</a> to have found the weapon early on in <em>Vandal Hearts II</em> just by chance. Is it possible there’s some one in a million chance for it to just spawn randomly without the demo disc data? Who knows. It seems clear that Konami at least intended for it to be an exclusive bonus for owners of the demo disc, similar to the deluxe edition pre-orders of today that let players begin a game with unique upgrades and gear.</p> <p>The most absurd theory by far was that you needed to have a final Gregminster save point from the original<em> Suikoden</em> on a memory card to get the Gradius Sword to appear in the shop. When that was debunked a couple of years ago, many players had resigned themselves to the weapon only being available via some hacked save file from “Jean” that was uploaded to GameFAQs over a decade ago. Now players can get it the “official” way by downloading a <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/199180-vandal-hearts-ii/saves">copy of the demo disc save</a> and using a PS3 memory card converter to get the data onto a PS1 memory card.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="cec31544ef737"><a title="Devon Pritchard Lead" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cec31544ef737/devon-pritchard-lead.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-of-america-president-doug-bowser-announces-retirement">Nintendo shared the news</a> that none of us could have predicted so soon: Bowser is stepping down from the position of top dog at the end of this year. The Koopas will have to find a new king, the Mushroom Kingdom will have to find a new menace, the kart racing scene will ha- what? Not <em>that</em> Bowser? Oh... we're going to miss these jokes.</p>
<p>Okay, for real now: Nintendo announced that <em>Doug</em> Bowser is retiring from his role as Nintendo of America President on 31st December 2025. After six years in the position, Bowser is to be succeeded by Devon Pritchard, a long-time NOA executive and the subsidiary's first female president.</p>
<p>While we'll be sad to see Mr. B go at the end of the year, it's an exciting time to get to know the new face stepping into his boots — not literally, we assume. You might have seen Devon Pritchard's name crop up in various conferences and events in recent years, but we actually know surprisingly little about her.</p>
<p>So, join us as we run through everything we know about the new face of NOA, and say farewell to 'not <em>that</em> Bowser' in the process — come on, who knows when we're going to be able to make those jokes again?</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/related-articles:188448 @ 1758912706 -->
<h2>Who Is Devon Pritchard?</h2>
<h3>Far From A Nintendo Newbie</h3>
<p>Despite appearing at a fair few Nintendo events in recent years — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEFfc70f6rE">the San Francisco Nintendo Store grand opening</a>, Switch 2 reveal etc. — the name Devon Pritchard may not have entered your sphere. But it should have, because she's far from an NOA newbie.</p>

<p>Pritchard joined Nintendo of America in 2006, heading up the subsidiary's legal department as its presidency changed from Tatsumi Kimishima to Reggie Fils-Aimé — remember that guy?</p>
<p>She would go on to take leadership roles in the company's Marketing, Business Affairs, and Publisher Relations sectors, before landing her current title of NOA’s Executive Vice President of Revenue, Marketing and Consumer Experience in 2021.</p>
<p>Why is this important to note? Well, because it follows a similar pattern to what we have seen with NOA's presidential promotions in the past. Let's not forget, both Bowser and Reggie's NOA careers started in the sales and marketing departments (of which they were both vice presidents), and Kimishima came to the role off the back of his work in Pokémon finances. If you want a new NOA president, you look to the internal marketing and finance departments first.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/related-articles:134329 @ 1758913250 -->
<h3>Law, What Is It Good For?</h3>
<p>With all that background, it'll come as no surprise that Devon Pritchard knows her legal onions. She became a Doctor of Law at the Gonzaga University School of Law in 2001, and before that, got a Bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences from Kansas State University.</p>
<p>While at Kansas State, she played on the university volleyball team... sooo, revival of the canned <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/06/next_levels_super_mario_spikers_was_canned_because_nintendo_had_issues_with_its_level_of_violence">Super Mario Spikers</a>, then? We doubt it.</p>
<h3>A Grip On Gaming?</h3>
<p>It seems somewhat counterintuitive, but being the most die-hard capital-G <em>Gamer</em> isn't necessarily a prerequisite to being the Nintendo of America President.</p>
<p>Of course, we all remember Reggie being very much hands-on in this department, regularly sharing what he was playing and for how long — what can we say? He had to get back to playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/animal_crossing_new_leaf">Animal Crossing: New Leaf</a> on his Nintendo 3DS — but do you ever recall Bowser sharing his playtime?</p>
<figure data-uuid="307f8fc5e9f93"><a title="Reggie Look" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/307f8fc5e9f93/reggie-look.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>We don't know for sure what Pritchard's <em>vidyagame</em> chops are like just yet, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9fW2TGXxco">Kit &amp; Krysta's latest video</a> shed <em>some</em> light on her gaming habits. The former-NOA employees worked closely with the soon-to-be President during their tenure at the company, and while they agreed that she's far from a hardcore gamer, they were quick to point out that she knows her Nintendo.</p>
<p>"She definitely loves Nintendo," Krysta stated. "Like all of us, she has these childhood memories of connecting with Nintendo in some way, shape or form. She's probably not playing games every day for many hours, she's not a '<em>core gamer</em>', as we like to call it, but she definitely understands the industry, and she understands how Nintendo fits into [it]."</p>
<p>Kit was quick to also point out that Pritchard has young children, and very much views Nintendo's image through them. "I had some very insightful conversations with her about the industry, about games, and about Nintendo's games. So, I think she's really on it."</p>

<h3>Pik Me A Winner<br></h3>
<p>Let's briefly address the Bulborb in the room: yes, there is a picture of Devon Pritchard holding a Bulborb plushie, and yes, it was formerly her display picture on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/devon-pritchard-a970a21aa/">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<p>Does that mean we're going to get <strong>Pikmin 5</strong> under her leadership? Maybe. But a NOA president being a fan of a series doesn't really have any sway over what the company releases, and, according to Krysta Yang, "she's not really a Pikmin fan".</p>
<p>But hey, we can dream...</p>
<h3>Bye To Bowser</h3>
<figure data-uuid="4933d2c1eaa82"><a title="Doug Bowser Direct" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4933d2c1eaa82/doug-bowser-direct.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, Pritchard sounds like a promising follow-up, but we couldn't celebrate the incoming talent without also sending a goodbye to Mr. Bowser himself — he's been the NOA president for the past six years, after all.</p>
<p>When we look back on the Bowser era, it's impossible <em>not</em> to compare him to Reggie. Let's admit it, Bowser wasn't the larger-than-life quote machine that his predecessor was, but honestly, who is?</p>
<p>Bowser's tenure can generally be looked back on as steadily guiding H.M.S. Nintendo of America through calm waters; for that, he did a good job. Nintendo didn't need another recognisable Reggie-like to drum up the hype at otherwise quiet Directs because, since Bowser's introduction in 2019, the output has been anything but quiet.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-sets-all-time-launch-record-for-video-game-hardware-in-the-us">launched to record-breaking sales numbers</a>, Nintendo continues to earn more money than ever before, and Bowser has, from an outside perspective at least, maintained cool, calm, and collected at the head of it all.</p>
<p>It mightn't have been the back-to-back tough-call role of previous NOA presidents, but remaining steady during some of the strangest times for the wider industry is nothing to scoff at — even if you do think he should have pulled rank on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a> à la Reggie and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/wii_sports">Wii Sports</a> to make the damn thing a pack in...</p>
<p>As for what the incoming president had to say about her predecessor, Pritchard shared the following message on her <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7377109391864610816/">LinkedIn</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Congratulations on an incredible career, Doug! You’ve been a fantastic leader and it’s an honor to build on the foundation you’ve established here at Nintendo. On behalf of the entire Nintendo of America team, thank you for everything. Wishing you a well-deserved and happy retirement!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Setting A President For The Future</h3>
<p>So, where does this leave us for the future? Honestly, we'd be surprised if it were anything other than more of the same.</p>
<p>The days of Nintendo requiring a Reggie figure at the helm are long behind us. Nintendo is <em>not</em> big on its personalities, and if the Bowser era has taught us anything, it's that the NOA president will mainly stay out of the public eye while the going's good.</p>
<p>From an outside perspective, we can only assume that Pritchard will follow the same approach: generally staying in the background before occasionally popping up at a North American event or showcase. That's just the way Nintendo <em>is</em> these days.</p>
<p>But who knows, perhaps she's being measured up for a Jim Henson puppet replica as we speak.</p>
<figure data-uuid="74d119a1b787e"><a title="Nintendo Direct Puppets" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/74d119a1b787e/nintendo-direct-puppets.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Evil Hat Productions has announced it will be launching a crowdfunding campaign for Designers &amp; Dragons: Origins. This is not a reprint of the original documentary-style books, but rather a new collection of volumes that delve into the early years of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> and its numerous supplements.</p>

<h2>The <em>Designers &amp; Dragons: Origins</em> Backerkit Campaign Announcement</h2>

<p>According to its official <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/call_to_action/0477a26f-723e-4d2f-8f11-74cdc007daf1/landing" rel="nofollow">landing page</a>, <em>Designers &amp; Dragons: Origins</em> is a 4-volume set that covers the history of each and every product released by TSR for original <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, <em>AD&amp;D</em>, and <em>Basic D&amp;D</em>. This will include all Unearthed Arcana, the legendary orange-covered B3, and the rare 1986 <em>Up The Garden Path</em> prewritten adventure.</p>

She delves deeply into the artwork, design, and origins, as well as other iconic books released during the world's most popular fantasy TTRPG's formative years. Everything from the start of the TTRPG genre, to the discovery of the Forgotten Realms, to the fall of Mystara will be covered in these books.</p>

<p>Designers &amp; Dragons: Origins is a more comprehensive look at one of <em>D&amp;D's</em> eras by Appelcline. This is in comparison to past <em>Designers &amp; Dragons</em> books, which focused more on the broader history of the TTRPG industry. The origin of TSR and the influence of wargaming in the 1970s. The rise of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fighting-fantasy-solo-adventure-rpg-series-returns-to-us-through-steve-jackson-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steve Jackson</a> and West End Games in the 80s. The growth of independent publishers in the 2000s. The list goes on.</p>

<p>Evil Hat Productions is the publisher of many beloved TTRPGs throughout the years. Their work includes the electropunk dark fantasy heist game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/blades-in-dark-review-next-level-roleplaying" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Blades in the Dark</em></a>, the <em>Dresden Files</em> RPG, <em>Thirsty Sword Lesbians</em>, <em>Apocalypse Keys</em>, and <em>Monster of the Week</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the landing page, the Backerkit campaign for <em>Designers &amp; Dragons: Origins</em> will go live near the end of October.</p>

The <em>Tetris</em>: My Play Watch is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FM9TYLT7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">now available for preorder through Amazon</a> for $79.99, and is expected to ship sometime in October 2025 with an alternate interchangeable band.</p><p>Developed in collaboration with The Tetris Company, the <em>Tetris</em>: My Play Watch looks like an Apple Watch with its square design and rounded corners, functional crown dial, and 1.91-inch color touchscreen. But without connectivity to a smartphone, it’s really only a smartwatch in that it offers more than basic time and calendar functionality. You can think of it more as a wearable console that plays <em>Tetris</em> (including marathon and puzzle modes) that also happens to display the time using a series of customizable <em>Tetris</em>-themed watch faces.</p><p>The crown dial on other My Play Watch models can be used to play games like <em>Space Invaders</em> and <em>Breakout</em>, but it’s only used to navigate the watch’s UI on this version. <em>Tetris</em> can be played through by swiping to move pieces while taps rotate them – similar to how the smartphone versions of the game are played. That could prove challenging on a small screen for those chasing high scores.</p><p><strong><em>Correction, September 26th: </em></strong><em>An earlier version of this article said the </em>Tetris<em>: My Play Watch was available for preorder through the company’s online store. Preorders are being offered through Amazon.</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/785725/tetris-my-play-watch-smartwatch]]></content:encoded>
