            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom is releasing a new&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>update tomorrow (or today, depending on where you are!), and the studio has released the patch notes ahead of the update's launch, showing what kind of endgame content you can expect.</p>

<p>Back in late July, Capcom revealed that it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-endgame-august" rel="nofollow">bumping up</a> some of the monster-hunting RPG's endgame content to mid-August, seemingly in response to criticisms from players regarding the game's lack of same. According to the patch notes, that's exactly what you can expect, too.</p>

<p>The patch will run anywhere from 2GB to 6GB depending on which version of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>you have, and it'll land tomorrow at 2:30am UTC (that's around 7:30pm Pacific or about 10:30 Eastern tonight).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-update-1.021-patch-notes-monsters.jpg?itok=hJqIknFK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-update-1.021-patch-notes-monsters.jpg?itok=OpvtVARi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>is getting a new update tomorrow with some more endgame content for you.</figcaption></figure><p>First up, you're getting tempered versions of nine of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' creatures when you reach HR 100. They'll take the form of nine-star quests, and you'll also find "regular and tempered versions of Rey Dau and Nu Udra" appearing in the Wounded Hollow if you reach that rank.</p>

<p>Monsters at HR 100 or higher have had their appearance rate adjusted, and standard monsters have had their appearance rate raised slightly. Not only that, but you'll find a new Glowing Stone appraisal item that will grant you "a talisman with random skill attributes" when appraised.</p>

<p>A number of other changes are coming as part of this update too, and if you want to see what those are, you can check out the <a href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-us/Ver.1.021.00.00.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full patch notes right here</a>. It's worth doing so, as there are a number of improvements that could make your experience just a little bit better.</p>




<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series. Released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date" rel="nofollow">in February</a>, the game was initially a phenomenal success for Capcom, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" rel="nofollow">selling 10 million copies</a> within the space of around a month and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-record" rel="nofollow">breaking records for its developer</a> into the bargain.</p>

<p>Since then, however, sales have <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/monster-hunter/capcom-admits-monster-hunter-wilds-sales-are-soft-as-pc-issues-persist-but-really-theyve-plummeted-barely-beating-2021s-monster-hunter-rise-and-losing-to-8-other-old-games-including-devil-may-cry-5/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">slowed</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recent reviews</a> on Steam have dipped to Mostly Negative, with players decrying a lack of performance updates and simplified gameplay (although reviews seem fairly heavily weighted towards the former).</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Please, for the love of all that can be side-swiped to oncoming traffic, make a new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/burnout-paradise">Burnout</a> game. This has been one of the five thoughts that fill my head on a daily basis for years at this point, and thanks to a website that's letting people draw pixel art all over Google Maps, I've been given yet another outlet via which to let it out.</p>
<p>That site is <a href="https://wplace.live/">wplace</a>, and it'll look familiar if you've been partial to the now defunct Reddit thread <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/place/">r/place</a> at any point. Basically, anyone can hop into its map and colour in pixels to doodle over the top of any place on Earth, creating vast canvases of cool art and scrawled messages to whomever might be watching.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So, naturally, I've joined in. First, I had to find a place to write. Enter Paradise City, a <a href="https://www.p-city.com/">swanky resort</a> just next to the airport in Incheon, South Korea. I had to fit my work in next to someone who seems ken to go and see My Chemical Romance in 2026, which is fitting, because we're united by our lust for things that were good in the 2000s. There are also some pretty creepy looking gingerbread people nearby, but I'm sure my unhinged wonky writing will put them off from messing with my demand: 'NEw Burnout PlS!'.</p>

</figure>
<p>I wasn't done there, though. A resort felt a bit too hopeful for the situation this series has ended up in. So, I found the stretch of Oregon river named Shitten Creek, and have neatly written another 'New BurnouT! PlS' up it, for all to see. There's no other art in this remote bit of the beaver state as of writing, so if you head southwest of Eugene you get a lovely clear look at my struggle to spell out each word while sticking to the wplace's 64-pixels-at-a-time limit.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You do get more than that paltry sum, but you've got to wait for a cooldown timer to replenish your stock before you can start drawing again. Will my efforts directly result in current rights holders Electronic Arts seeing and going 'oh bollocks, we'd better finally greenlight a sequel to Paradise or sell up to someone who will'. Look anything's better than just a single cryptic tease from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/burnout-paradise-remastered-review">Paradise Remastered</a> co-devs Stellar Entertainment <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/need-for-speed-unbound-dev-offers-a-very-strange-teaser-and-fans-think-its-for-a-burnout-game/">last year</a> that the unnamed arcade racer they've got in the works might, possibly, be Burnouty.</p><p>Anyway, I'm far from the only one who's scrawled something game-related across wplace's Earth. There are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age</a> fans <a href="https://x.com/Scar3crowss/status/1954560684559065413">in Scotland</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>ers everywhere (including near Team Cherry's HQ in Adelaide), and I'm glad to report someone's written "It just works" in Bethesda's hometown of Rockville, Maryland.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Naturally, I also looked at my local area and was glad to find someone had penned the logo of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-43588365">defunct local shop chain Grainger Games</a>, with a number of nearby messages saying they still miss it.</p>
<p>I might come back and write a bunch of other dormant racing series that I'd love to see revived and brought straight to PC in some other places. Los Angeles might be gridlocked with graffiti, but I'll stay up til the small hours finding room for Midnight Club.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Later this month, <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251"><em>Helldivers</em> 2</a>—previously a PS5- and PC-only PlayStation-published sci-fi shooter—arrives on Xbox with crossplay support. And a new trailer teases the possibility that some Orbital Drop Shock Troopers from <em>Halo 3: ODST</em> might appear as backup.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-ps5-exclusive-1851785573">Back in July</a>, Arrowhead and PlayStation Studios announced that their super-successful live-service shooter <em>Helldivers 2</em> would arrive on Xbox on August 26. The co-op shooter leaping to the PS5’s main rival is yet more evidence that the console wars are over. Plus, it means a bunch of Xbox-only players get a chance to enjoy one of the best co-op games released in years. Now, just about two weeks before <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-port-ps5-sony-playstation-decision-ceo-discord-2000616377"><em>Helldivers 2</em> crashes onto Xbox Series X/S consoles,</a> Xbox and Sony have teamed up (which is a little weird to say) to tease some <em>Halo</em> content coming to <em>Helldivers 2.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>On August 12, a new trailer for <em>Helldivers 2</em> on Xbox dropped and it shows off a bunch gameplay, featuring the kinds of loud explosions and mayhem you’d expect. But at the very end of all that is a quiet, jazzy tease that seems to heavily imply<em> Halo 3: ODST</em> soldiers are inbound. I’ve set up the trailer below to start right at the teaser:</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Helldivers 2 - Bring the Boom | Out August 26" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qc8n_dxYcvE?start=70&amp;feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Ohhh, how I’ve missed the rain-soaked streets of <em>Halo 3: ODST a</em>nd its chill jazz music soundtrack. What a game. And a perfect fit for <em>Helldivers 2</em>. Both Helldivers and ODST soldiers land onto battlefields via drop pods to fight intergalactic threats. <em>Helldivers 2</em> has been very careful with its IP crossovers, but <em>ODST</em> makes sense and visually won’t feel too out of place. The real question is how fans will get their hands on some ODST armor, and also, will it feature some smooth jazz music? We’ll likely find out more before <em>Helldivers 2</em> launches on Xbox Series X/S on August 26.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Finish the fight?</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> looks set for an unlikely Halo crossover after a new trailer teased the arrival of the ODST.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arrowhead's hugely successful PC and PlayStation 5 third-person shooter launches on Xbox Series X and S on August 26 as the first Sony-published game on Microsoft’s console. The trailer, below, ends with what looks like the arrival of an ODST on a rain-drenched battlefield, alongside the iconic music from the game. It's all very ODST!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Bungie-developed Halo 3: ODST came out exclusively on Xbox 360 in 2009. You play as an Orbital Drop Shock Trooper, or ODST, during and after the events of Halo 2. So, this is <em>not</em> the chance to play as what would be an over-powered Master Chief in Helldivers 2, rather a pretty powerful standard soldier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The next obvious question is whether this ODST crossover will come alongside other Halo items, such as its iconic assault rifle and perhaps even the Warthog. Helldivers 2 seems particularly suited to a Halo crossover of this kind, so it will be interesting to see just how far it goes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arrowhead <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-published-helldivers-2-gets-shock-release-date-on-xbox-series-x-and-s">announced Helldivers 2’s Xbox release date last month</a> (bizarrely, it comes out the same day as Microsoft releases Gears of War: Reloaded on PlayStation 5). In a post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/03/helldivers-2-xbox-release-date-pre-order/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Xbox Wire</u></a>, Helldivers 2 Game Director Mikael Eriksson commented on what this launch means to the studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We know gamers have been asking for this for some time and we are so excited to bring more Helldivers into our game," he said. "We have so much more in store for the future months and years – and the more players we have the more stories we can tell! The fight for Super Earth has only just begun.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Crossplay across all platforms is confirmed, which means PC, PlayStation, and Xbox players will be able to play together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 2 launched on PC and PS5 in February 2024 and was a rare live service smash hit for Sony. It is the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time, shifting an incredible 12 million copies in 12 weeks. While player numbers on Steam, which Valve makes public, remain healthy a year-and-a-half on from the record-breaking launch, the Xbox release will no-doubt boost the player pool even further.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The timing of Halo in Helldivers 2 coincides with Halo also being featured in Fortnite, during a bug-infested season that some Arrowhead developers have said is basically <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arrowhead-says-fortnites-new-alien-bug-season-is-very-we-have-helldivers-at-home">a Helldivers-themed Fortnite</a>. "Hmmm... it's giving 'we have Helldivers at home,'" community manager Katherine Baskin wrote on the game's Discord, before adding: "I'm not worried."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Halo, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-teases-more-halo-news-this-october">Microsoft has teased more on what's to come in October</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

<p>aaaaaaaaa I don't know</p>

<figure><a title="Mario - 40th" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/10482f92e0b0f/mario-40th.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Fans have recently been pondering over a mysterious X/Twitter account that seemingly directly references Super Mario's upcoming 40th anniversary.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/mario-40th-anniversary-placeholder-twitter-account/">The Gamer</a>, X account <a href="https://x.com/supermario40th">@supermario40th</a> has been causing a bit of a kerfuffle, with some suspecting that it might be legit, thus indicating that Nintendo will indeed celebrate the plumber's anniversary with a number of key announcements. At the moment, it's completely blank bar the handle, the 'aaaaaaaaa' name, and a single follow for <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo">Nintendo's Japanese account</a>.</p>
<p>So why is this even worth mentioning? Well, Nintendo's done it before, that's why. Its <a href="https://x.com/supermario35th">@supermario35th</a> account, which is still live at the time of writing, went through a very similar journey back in 2020 (it even had the same 'aaaaaaaaaaa' name, albeit with a couple more 'a's), and we covered it <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/07/fans_have_discovered_a_private_mario_35th_anniversary_twitter_account">right here on Nintendo Life</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the potential issue we have is that the 40th anniversary account was seemingly created back in 2020. So what's going on? Well, either Nintendo itself created the account early to ensure nobody else nabbed it, or someone <em>did</em> nab it and is simply keeping it safe in the event Nintendo knocks on their door.</p>
<figure><a title="40th Account" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/12cbfc94872eb/40th-account.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://x.com/supermario40th">X</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo held a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_UcjEq2Dgk">35th anniversary Direct presentation</a> for Super Mario on 3rd September 2020. It seems unlikely that the company will stick to the <em>exact</em> same schedule for the 40th, but it might well be worth keeping an eye out for a potential announcement in the coming weeks.</p>

              <p>Brendan “PlayerUnknown” Greene changed the entire course of gaming in 2017 with the release of&nbsp;<em>PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds</em>, now known nonsensically as <em>PUBG Battlegrounds</em>. (<em>Plunkbat&nbsp;</em>forever.) Without it–for good or ill–we may not have <em>Fortnite</em>, one of the most successful games ever.&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em> isn’t doing too badly itself, with more than half a million people playing at least once every day. Now, Greene is hoping to revitalize the survival genre with <a href="https://kotaku.com/pubg-2-prologue-brendan-greene-playerunknown-metaverse-1851765648"><em>Prologue</em></a>, developed over the last four years and today revealing a surprise free open beta.</p> <p>Reminiscent of games from the survival sim heyday, <em>Prologue&nbsp;</em>drops its players in a woodland cabin and challenges them to find their way to a weather station, randomly placed on the sprawling 8-by-8km map. Along the way, you’ll be bombarded by weather extremes and hungry wildlife, while needing to keep yourself fed, watered and warm. Which, while certainly a familiar premise if you played <em>The Long Dark</em> or&nbsp;<em>The Forest</em>, is aiming for a different emphasis.&nbsp;<em>Prologue</em> appears to be aiming for the extremes of isolation, a sense of agoraphobic loneliness in its procedurally generated maps.</p> <p>Plus, of course, this comes with the pedigree. Greene may have moved on from&nbsp;<em>PUGB</em>, hence the title now only containing his nickname’s initials, but PlayerUnknown Productions comes with a lot of expectation. And then a lot of confusing rhetoric about “metaverses” and the like. But if you want to find out exactly what the game’s about, well, you can right now! For free!</p> <p>Available on both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/prologue-go-wayback-72ee27">Epic</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Prologue: Go Wayback!&nbsp;</em>playtest lets you download and play the game ahead of its Early Access launch intended for later this year. To get it on Steam, head to the store page (the “go wayback” title, which hopefully isn’t permanent, at least makes it possible to search for) and then click on the “Request Access” button beneath the demo link. You’ll instantly get in, and will find the game available to install at the top of your Steam library. I’m downloading it as I type.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6 players will be able to access two new game modes and a new map during the upcoming open beta weekend. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6’s open beta was the biggest beta test yet for the franchise, bringing in over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">500,000 concurrent players</a> on Steam alone. However, it did come with some minor issues that developers are figuring out, including “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-devs-are-looking-into-unexpectedly-fast-time-to-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unexpectedly fast</a>” time to death. Developers will try to iron out any problems they can before the next BF6 Open Beta weekend arrives, featuring a new map and modes.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-open-beta-weekend-2-will-add-empire-state-with-rush-and-squad-deathmatch-modes">Battlefield 6 Open Beta Weekend 2 Will Add Empire State with Rush and Squad Deathmatch Modes</h2>

The developer first thanked players for testing out the title and providing feedback. In the upcoming weekend, players get to do it all over again, but on a brand new map, Empire State and two new game modes, Rush and Squad Deathmatch. </p>

<p>The upcoming Battlefield 6 beta weekend will also have maps and modes from the previous weekend, including Siege of Cairo, Liberation Peak and Iberian Offensive. Modes of the prior weekend included Conquest, Closed Weapon Conquest, Breakthrough, Domination and King of the Hill. BF6 Open Beta Weekend 2 will also include Closed Weapon Conquest and Breakthrough. </p>



<p>In other news, the viral VTuber ‘RileyCS’ has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-rileycs-cheating-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been banned on Twitch</a> following allegations of cheating. Additionally, BF6’s anti-cheat engine is asking players to&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-anti-cheat-faces-issues-with-valorant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">uninstall Valorant</a>.

                <p>The Pokemon Company and McDonald's have teamed up before, but not without <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mcdonalds-pokemon-happy-meal-promotion-begins-is-immediately-ruined-by-adults/1100-6487354/" data-ref-id="1100-6487354">attracting undo attention from would-be scalpers</a>. Earlier this month, McDonald's Japan was forced to end its latest Pokemon Happy Meal promotion a few days early because the supply of cards quickly ran out amid chaotic crowds clamoring for the cards that came with them.</p><p>According to <a href="https://nintendosoup.com/pokemon-tcg-mcdonalds-japan-campaign-draws-disgust-and-flak-for-food-waste-and-chaos/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Soup</a>, scalpers drove most of the demand for Pokemon cards and many of them abandoned their Happy Meals uneaten at the restaurants or on the streets outside. In some cases, the crowds inside the McDonald's restaurants were so unruly that the police had to be called.</p><p>The most-prized item from this giveaway was a McDonald's-exclusive Pikachu card featuring Pokemon's iconic creature ready to scarf a Happy Meal of his own. Aside from the scalpers who came away with the cards, the only real winners of this PR debacle were the pigeons who devoured the discarded meals.</p><p>McDonald's Japan did set a limit of five Happy Meals per customer, but that limit was either ignored or circumvented by scalpers. Overzealous collectors and scalpers aren't unique to Japan. American Rick and Morty fans may recall <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rick-and-morty-co-creator-responds-as-mcdonalds-ap/1100-6453883/" data-ref-id="1100-6453883">the Szechuan Sauce mania</a> that occurred in 2017 when McDonald's briefly brought it back.</p><p>However, Pokemon fans appear to be in a league of their own. Reports have emerged that the Japanese mob has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-cards-are-reportedly-being-used-to-launder-money-by-the-japanese-mob/1100-6528520/" data-ref-id="1100-6528520">using some Pokemon </a><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-cards-are-reportedly-being-used-to-launder-money-by-the-japanese-mob/1100-6528520/" data-ref-id="1100-6528520">cards to launder money</a>. Last May, a UK man was arrested in possession of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/man-arrested-after-being-found-with-a-stolen-pokemon-card-haul-worth-over-300000/1100-6531563/" data-ref-id="1100-6531563">over $300k worth of stolen Pokemon cards</a>.</p><p>The resurgence of Pokemon fandom shows no signs of abating, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokepark-kanto-will-let-you-experience-real-world-of-pokemon-in-2026/1100-6533333/" data-ref-id="1100-6533333">there's even a PokePark Kanto attraction </a>slated to open next year in Japan. The next game in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legend-z-a-trailer-shows-off-release-date-window-and-a-new-battle-system/1100-6529753/" data-ref-id="1100-6529753">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>, will be released on Switch and Switch 2 on October 16.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>, the three-player first-person shooter from <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/control">Control</a> developer Remedy Entertainment, launched back in June to middling results. Though available on Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus on day one, Remedy saw players quickly drop off from the game for various reasons. Now, in <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5">Remedy's latest financial results</a>, the company has acknowledged the game's "unsuccessful" launch and plans to turn things around.&nbsp;</p><p>"Commercially, we were unsatisfied with the launch-phase consumer sales of FBC: Firebreak," the financial results read. "Thus far, FBC: Firebreak's commercial performance has largely been driven by the Xbox and PlayStation subscription service agreements."</p><p url="https://youtu.be/CP3ameICxSk" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CP3ameICxSk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The results go on to explain that FBC: Firebreak was designed to evolve over time and that, despite a rocky launch, Remedy believes it has built a solid foundation. "Players who spent over an hour with the game reviewed the game mostly positive – showing us that the core experience of the game is entertaining. We have already rolled out patches and communicated on how the game will continue to develop."&nbsp;</p><p>Remedy says looking ahead, a larger "Major Update" late September will be the next key step for FBC: Firebreak, supported by "targeted marketing activities, which we expect will drive interest in the title."&nbsp;</p><p>"We are committed to continuing to work on FBC: Firebreak, engaging with the community, and expanding the game," Remedy's comments on FBC: Firebreak end.&nbsp;</p><p url="https://youtu.be/yqgJWW1iF0o" width="640" height="360" responsive="1" show_suggested="1" privacy_mode="0" autoplay="0" show_player="1" start_at=""><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yqgJWW1iF0o" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Elsewhere in the financial results, Remedy says <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2023/10/31/remedy-provides-update-on-control-2-says-max-payne-remakes-are-in-production">Control 2's</a> development is on track to hit its next milestones, with the focus now on "the gameplay, environments, and missions." <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2024/04/29/remedy-shares-development-updates-for-control-2-max-payne-1-2-remake-and-codename-condor">Remedy's Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 remake project</a> remains in full production, the studio says, and "collaboration with Rockstar Games remains close and productive, ensuring alignment as the project advances toward its next major phase."&nbsp;</p><p>For more, read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/control/a-heady-power-trip"><em>Game Informer's </em>Control review</a>, and then read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/alan-wake-2/back-to-reality"><em>Game Informer's </em>Alan Wake 2 review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Control&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>studio Remedy has released its financial statement for the first half of the 2025 fiscal year, and the company has admitted it's not happy with the launch sales of its latest game&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a>, Remedy CEO Tero Virtala says that despite a 43% increase in revenue over last year's first half, as well as "an initial accrual from subscription service agreements with Sony and Microsoft",&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>"underperformed" on Steam, which Virtala describes as "the primary consumer sales channel on PC" for the game.</p>

<p>According to Virtala,&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>'s underperformance is due to its "initial onboarding experience and mission structure", which, when taken together, "resulted in high early player drop-offs and an influx of negative reviews". These led to what Virtala calls a "rocky launch" for the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fbc-firebreak-launch-sales-remedy-financials-shooting.jpg?itok=165J9pCp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fbc-firebreak-launch-sales-remedy-financials-shooting.jpg?itok=aqHnfjNJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>FBC: Firebreak</em>'s initial sales haven't impressed developer and publisher Remedy.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite these initial wobbles, however, Virtala says he believes that&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>is "a solid game to build on", and that the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-whats-next" rel="nofollow">major update coming in September</a>&nbsp;will serve as "the next key step" for the multiplayer shooter. Given that the game is currently <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2272540/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sitting at just 16 players</a> on Steam, with a 22-player 24-hour peak, let's hope Remedy can turn things around.</p>

<p>With regards to the studio's other upcoming games, Virtala says progress is brisk.&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>, which Remedy says will move in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-sales-control-2-action-rpg" rel="nofollow">a more action RPG-wards direction</a>, is "on track towards meeting its next milestones", Virtala says, with development currently focused on various core gameplay systems and world design elements.</p>

<p>As for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/max-payne-remakes-control-spinoff-remedy" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes</a>, they're still "in full production", and Remedy's collaboration with&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>IP holder Rockstar "remains close and productive", which is always nice to hear. Let's hope we get more info about those soon.</p>

<p>Remedy also says that sales for the original&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>crossed the five million mark during this year's second quarter, following the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-control-franchise-rights" rel="nofollow">transferral of the franchise rights</a> from original owner 505 Games last year.</p>

              <p>Remedy, the creators of&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake</em> and&nbsp;<em>Control</em>, have had a good six months. The company’s revenue has risen by 63 percent, which is just the sort of good news you want to be able to tell your parents, and at the same time the company completed buying all the rights to&nbsp;<em>Control</em> from publishers 505 Games, as part of its plans to become fully independent of external publishers. Lovely to be them. However, despite all this good news, it seems Remedy’s latest game, three-player co-op shooter <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, is still struggling. But Remedy isn’t giving up on it.</p> <p>Back in July, while acknowledging the launch hadn’t gone as well as hoped, Remedy’s Thomas Punha <a href="https://kotaku.com/remedy-control-fbc-firebreak-lowplayer-count-update-1-3-1851785449">tried to downplay the significance of the very low player counts on Steam</a>. “Steam is a very important part of the business of&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>,” he told&nbsp;<em>GameSpot.</em>&nbsp;“The Steam [active player count] is a very easy statistic to dig up, but it isn’t everything.”</p> <p>However, it seems like it’s still an awful lot. In the <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5">company’s latest financial report</a>, Remedy CEO Tero Virtala concedes that PC was where <em>Firebreak</em> had been intended to best succeed, but it has instead fared vastly better on console thanks to subscription deals. “On Steam, which was planned as the primary consumer sales channel on PC, the launch underperformed,” says Virtala. “The game’s initial onboarding experience and mission structure resulted in high early player drop-offs and an influx of negative reviews. As players spent more time in the game and we released updates improving the game, sentiment in reviews turned more positive.”</p>

 <p>Well, that’s kinda true. The game remains on “Mixed” reviews on Steam, although it’s trending slightly more positively. Currently 68 percent of the 1,685 reviews are positive, although even this stat belies just how few people are playing. It’s all very well to say players are having a better time, but how many? To this day, the game has an all-time peak simultaneous player-count of 1,992, and that was two months ago. In the last 24 hours, the game peaked at 24 people. It’s a colossal flop.</p> <p>The higher (although not stated) numbers on console are likely because the game was included day-one on both Game Pass and PS Plus, meaning anyone with a sub can take a risk-free look, even, if they–like most humans–will struggle to coordinate three people to play at the same time. Still, you make money by putting your games on these services, as Virtala points out:</p> <blockquote><p>“Commercially, we were unsatisfied with the launch-phase consumer sales of <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>. Thus far,&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>’s commercial performance has largely been driven by the Xbox and PlayStation subscription service agreements. A considerable portion of the revenues from these agreements will still be recognized throughout the contract period.”</p></blockquote> <p>Despite all this, Remedy is valiantly sticking with <em>Firebreak</em>, even though I think anyone would give them a pass at this point. There’s still a “Major Update” coming in September, which the company plans to support with a marketing campaign in an effort to turn its fortunes around. Virtala adds, “We are committed to continuing to work on <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, engaging with the community, and expanding the game.”</p> <p>In better news, the report states that&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em> is meeting its milestones, and the <em>Max Payne 1 &amp; 2&nbsp;</em>remake “continues its progress and remains in full production.” Meanwhile, the original&nbsp;<em>Control</em> has now sold over 5 million copies, which is stunning. And the company is well on its way to becoming self-sustaining as a self-publishing studio freed from publisher pressure and fees.</p>

<p>You can’t deny FBC: Firebreak is ambitious, even if it is a game no one was necessarily clamoring for. The latter part of this is now evident, as Remedy has given deeper insight into FBC: Firebreak’s underwhelming launch and plans for the IP.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-fbc-firebreak-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FBC: Firebreak</a> was Remedy’s first new release since the Game of the Year-contending <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/alan-wake-2-has-sold-over-2-million-copies-and-is-finally-profitable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alan Wake 2</a>. Firebreak is set in Control’s (another Remedy IP) world and is a team-based FPS. This is quite a bold shift from the company’s other games. We’ve seen from gameplay and matches that the game has potential, but its launch has failed to land.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Firebreak hasn’t caught yet. Credit to Remedy</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s quite damning to hear that the FBC: Firebreak “launch underperformed.” This is the official word from Remedy’s Jan-Jun 2025 financial <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a>.</p>



<p>“On Steam, which was planned as the primary consumer sales channel on PC, the launch underperformed. The game’s initial onboarding experience and mission structure resulted in high early player drop-offs and an influx of negative reviews.”</p>



<p>The company was happy that “The launch succeeded technically, reaching over 1 million players in its first 10 days,” but goes on to say: “Commercially, we were unsatisfied with the launch-phase consumer sales of&nbsp;FBC: Firebreak.”</p>



<p>The majority of the shooter’s revenue has come from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fbc-firebreak-xbox-game-pass-playstation-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass and PlayStation Plus</a>-subscribing users. Firebreak was free on both services at launch.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, despite the adversity, Remedy believes FBC: Firebreak is a “solid game” the team can build on: “Looking ahead, a larger ‘Major Update’ late September will be the next key step for&nbsp;FBC: Firebreak. This will be supported by targeted marketing activities, which we expect to drive interest in the title. We are committed to continuing to work on&nbsp;FBC: Firebreak, engaging with the community, and expanding the game.”</p>



<p>Do you think Firebreak can bounce back? With so many live-service games out there, it’s tough to stand out. Let me know if you think it can by heading to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

The next game from PUBG creator Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene, the open beta will run until the launch of the game's early access period on PC.</p><p>"After running playtests with our Discord community over the last six months--and receiving some fantastic feedback--we decided to take the time to add more ways to explore our generated worlds based on our community's suggestions," PlayerUnknown Productions said in a press release.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 - Official Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Interestingly, Battlefield 2042 had the opposite problem, with players often complaining that the maps felt too big and often lifeless. In the BF6 beta, however, players are saying that the small map sizes mean they are pushed to engage far too often.</p><p>The criticism is far from universal, of course. Some players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1ml9u97/psa_small_maps_are_not_a_new_thing_this_is_bf3s/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">stand behind</a> the smaller maps, pointing out that some fan-favorite Battlefield maps like Sienne Crossing and Grand Bazaar were also small. Other players counter that the issue with the new maps may not be their actual size, but how combat and movement flow through them.</p><p>The largest of the beta maps, Liberation Peak, suffers from a different design issue that has been annoying players--terrain that heavily favors snipers. The abundance of snipers has been parodied in memes showing an absurd number of sniper glints coming from Liberation Peak's rocky terrain--though real screenshots posted in the replies show these edits aren't really that far from the truth.</p><p>Of course the point of a beta is that elements that don't work can be changed before the game's launch, which is scheduled for October 10 on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. BF6 devs have publicly addressed some feedback, while EA also has a full <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/battlefield-6-all-major-changes-confirmed-for-launch/2900-6845/" data-ref-id="2900-6845">list of changes</a> that will be implemented pre-launch. The developer has said it will be going over player feedback from the beta to identify what else needs to be modified before launch.</p><p>Players will have a chance to check out more Battlefield 6 maps and different modes when the open beta returns for a second weekend on August 14. For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">Battlefield 6 open beta breakdown.</a></p>

<p>Remedy has been distracted by other games in recent years. But Control 2 is one of the company’s biggest upcoming projects, and not only have we learned new details about the game’s progress, but the company has announced a huge milestone for the franchise.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/control-ultimate-editions-new-update-introduces-hideo-kojima-mission-for-all-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Control</a> felt interesting until the game’s final moments: The puzzles, the paranormal activity in the environment, and your powers. It felt like something was <em>always </em>happening. It could see-saw from horror to hot action in a heartbeat. The demand for a second game has been strong for a while, and it appears the sequel is getting closer.</p>



<h2 id="h-control-2-development-is-on-track-says-remedy-entertainment">Control 2 Development is “On Track,” Says Remedy Entertainment</h2>



<figure><figcaption>More Jessie is a good thing. Credit to Remedy</figcaption></figure>



<p>The 2025 Remedy Half-year financial report told us several things: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rockstar-games-working-closely-with-remedy-entertainment-on-max-payne-1-2-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar and Remedy are working together on the Max Payne 1 &amp; 2 Remake</a>, the Control franchise has surpassed 5 million lifetime copies sold and counting, and Control 2 is coming along nicely.</p>



<p>Here’s the official <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">word</a> on Control 2’s development: “Control 2&nbsp;development is on track towards meeting its next milestones. The focus is now on the gameplay, environments, and missions. Work continues on developing the game into a strong commercial offering.”</p>



<p>The next milestones could be an official reveal trailer or even a gameplay reveal right out of the gate. I think it’s safe to assume from this that we’re still quite some way off from Control 2 hitting shelves and digital storefronts, though.</p>



<p>One thing’s for sure: Remedy has a lot on its plate with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fbc-firebreaks-new-patch-introduces-faster-progression-and-economy-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FBC Firebreak</a>, the Max Payne Remake, and Control 2.</p>



<p>What did you love most about the first Control? For me, it was all of it, to be honest. I want to hear what you think, and you can get a conversation underway courtesy of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">2025 has already been a productive year for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/phasmophobia"><u>Phasmophobia</u></a> maker Kinetic Games, not least because though it's only August, we've already seen a major overhaul of the in-game journal, the release of the (terrifying) reworked Bleasedale Farmhouse, and now a revamp for the fan-favorite Grafton Farmhouse map has just gone live.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we dive into the final half of the year — and get ever closer to spooky season — we sat down for a chat with art director Corey J. Dixon to talk about what's new, when Phasmophobia will finally feel finished, the possibility of Phasmophobia 2, and what it's like working with Blumhouse Films on a movie adaptation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Tell us about the reworked maps. Why rework them at all?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>[Creator] Dan [Knight] wanted Phas[mophobia] to be the best thing it could be. And with the amount of asset packs that he had to use to create the game, there was a feeling of it not being his own thing. The design and the game and everything else inside of it was his baby — and it was successful because of that — but anyone could recreate Tanglewood. They just needed to buy the asset. So Dan was like: 'I want to make this the best puzzle horror game I can. Let's rework the maps.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I joined Kinetic Games about nine months after Phas came out, so it's just over four years now. Back then, there were only three of us. It was me, Dan, Ben [Lavender], and I was doing all the art myself. My first job was slowly replacing all the art assets, [and] we're still going four years later. But there's a lot more people now.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Why was Grafton next on the list to get a revamp?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>We do what we feel is best for players. Asylum was the most repetitive map. It was absolutely <em>huge</em> before. I'd had chats with Dan where he's like, 'Oh yeah, it took me so long, like I was just copy-pasting rooms because I'd made it so big,' and it just wasn't that enjoyable to make. That was the first target — we felt that that was the most repetitive, and could have the biggest uplift. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So we did that one first, and then the farmhouses. There are two farmhouse maps, but they were almost identical. We had so many players who couldn't even tell the difference between Bleasdale and Grafton because they were the same asset pack. So we had the conversation, and I suggested that we should really spread them apart. Let's make one of them this kind of ornate, mansion-y, bigger map, and then take the other one in the opposite direction. Let's ruin it, destroy loads of it — give it that abandoned ghosthunting experience that a lot of people do in real life. I think it's worked — they feel completely different now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Do you have plans to rework anything else?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>Earlier this year, we announced we would be doing Tanglewood, and that's a fan-favorite map. Everyone absolutely <em>loves</em> Tanglewood. So we'll have to make sure we maintain a balance of, you know, giving it a fresh coat of paint, but not changing <em>too</em> much, because we know how much players absolutely adore it. But I'm pretty sure we'll find that balance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How do you manage demand from players who want smaller maps with those who want much bigger ones?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>It's a combination of things, the first mainly being the community. We've got statistics on what maps people play. We know that people play small maps, and we hear people talk about small maps all the time. That's a massive factor. We want to update and add things that players <em>want</em> to play. We understand there is a community of players that do like the larger maps, but the bigger the map, the longer it takes to make or redo. So, for us, if we're going to do, for example, three maps in a year, and if we [chose] a large map, that might mean we only get to do one or maybe two a year. So players are missing out because we're doing something that takes much longer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's kind of weighing up what the benefit is for the community versus how long it takes. We would like to rework all of the base game maps eventually — it's just how long that takes, and in what order.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Have you ever considered expanding beyond four-player co-op?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>A lot of the community have asked for that, especially on the big maps! Yeah, more players means you'll find the ghost and identify it quicker. But it's not really something we're looking into. The whole game is locked in around four players. And it's a 10-year project. Now, for Dan, he's [already] worked on the game that long, and the code base is kind of locked in, there's a lot of linking, intertwining systems, and it all kind of works together. So even if we wanted to do that, it would be an absolutely huge project.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Phasmophobia Nell's Diner Map Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: You've also recently revealed that the next new map coming to Phasmo is Nell's Diner. Tell us about it.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>We planned for a new, small map this year and, again, looked at the community. People suggest things all the time. We have a <em>massive</em> list that has all of the things the community has suggested, so we reference that and see what we think, what we think would work or not. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We need to make sure that small maps make sense, because the way that the game plays, you're restricted in what kind of maps you can do. A lot of people have suggested a theater or an amusement park, and while those would be absolutely amazing art tasks — they'd be so fun to make, gameplay-wise — they'd be really difficult. Massive open spaces mean you don't have ghost rooms, and you need to have things on the floor or things for the ghost to interact with. So a diner just kind of made sense. You can split it up into these nice little chunks — you've got the dining area, the counter, the kitchen, the staff areas at the back, and then some toilets. It's a perfect little, small map. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's also a familiar thing. People love the house maps because they play Phas in a familiar environment, which is just a house that doesn't look creepy or abandoned. They stop playing [for the night] and walk around their house at night and go, 'Oh my God. This is so similar. This is my house, and I'm scared of looking around at night.' And a diner is very familiar for a lot of people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The theming is super unique. We've never done a retro American style or really embraced the culture of it all. Shout out to the art team!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Is that because you have a bigger team now? One of the criticisms we see is about the pace of development, which has felt sluggish at times.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>Oh, yeah. Definitely. If you compare our updates this year to last year — I think last year was just the console update, and then we did [new map] Point Hope. This year, we've already done the Bleasdale update. Grafton. The Chronicle update — which was a huge shake-up of the gameplay — came out a couple of months ago, and we're still on track with our roadmap. We did Easter, we've got the Halloween holiday, and then Nell's Diner as well.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: You recently said the diner was a chance to use a little environmental storytelling, too?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>We're trying to push that as much as possible. Phas doesn't have a story, per se, but even back when I did the asylum map, I tried to add a bit of storytelling there about, like, maybe there's an origin story there for one of the ghosts, or maybe it's just a crazed lunatic. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're trying to let players think about what happened here without being too hand-holding. We've dropped these little bits and pieces around, and people absolutely love it. We did some stuff in Bleasdale that even referenced Grafton. [Our community] absolutely loves it. So we're just trying to push that Phas is not just a ghost-hunting game with these environments that look pretty but don't mean anything. It's a living, breathing world. We've got a lore update coming at some point that's just going to push the storytelling in the game as far as we can.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Does this mean we're closer to a 1.0 release?  Phasmophobia's been in early access since its 2020 debut.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>We definitely have plans for 1.0, probably in line with our Horror 2.0 update [<a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-2025-roadmap" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>slated for 2026</u></a>] is where we feel the game is feature-complete. It doesn't mean we'll stop working on it — we still want map reworks and new maps and stuff in the future, so there'll be more stuff for the game. But I think once the Horror 2.0 has been redone, which is the next thing we work on after the [2025's] Player Update, the game will feel finished. Once that's in, I think it will be in a good spot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's really difficult to know [when it may be finished]. Our community is constantly putting out, 'Oh, it should have this!' so we can look at that and just keep doing it! We'd love to work on it until we're really happy with it. We haven't set a date or an update that's like: we're done. I think we'll just know: there'll be that company-wide feeling that this project is done now, we've made it the best it can be, which is what Dan wanted Day One. I think we'll know when we hit that milestone — I don't think we can plan for that. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Phasmophobia Grafton Farmhouse Map Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How do you keep the horror sequences fresh (and scary) for veteran players while keeping the gameplay loop simple enough for new ghosthunters?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>We just try and maintain a balance. Like with the Chronicle update, we wanted to make it make sense. Before, something would be dropped on the floor, and you take a photo and go to the person you're selling them to, and say: 'I promised the ghost threw this! It wasn't me!' So that was the main goal of the update: let's make the evidence system make sense, right? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">People come up with crazy ideas, and some of them are great. Going back to the first anniversary, and we did a mini update where we redid the journal, because that was a big pain point for players. And people were posting designs on Reddit. It meant that when we came to do it, we had <em>tons</em> of reference, and we knew what players wanted feature-wise, and we just had to make it kind of look pretty, and we haven't touched it since. The community's great, it's almost like you don't need anyone [on the development team] with a brain now. We could just be developers that don't have any thought, and we just follow the Reddit thread and just churn out stuff, because there's <em>so</em> many good ideas on there!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When we got to the gameplay design of the Chronicle Update, it was just about maintaining that interest for new players, but having it complicated enough so that experienced players would enjoy it as well. With the unique and duplicate system, you can go in and take whatever photos, videos, and sounds you want, and not worry about the unique and duplicates, and you'll still get a pretty good payout.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But veteran players with thousands of hours [in the game] — they know every nook and cranny. They can kind of curate their own really difficult game mode in custom difficulty, and they can go for a perfect investigation, and they can make each game the hardest they want it to be, and then end up with these <em>huge</em> payouts. The custom update is kind of 'play your way.' We noticed so many people were making their own little challenges, and we were like, let's just put it in the game. Let's just spend the time and put it in. We did a few updates to get the rewards right, but now it's super solid. It's rewarding when it needs to be, and it's less rewarding when it doesn't. I'm really happy with how that turned out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Given how much Phasmophobia has changed since its launch half a decade ago, have you ever considered starting from scratch with a sequel?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>I wouldn't write it off. It would be a fun challenge to see if we could do another one. There are a lot of things that I know we would change as a company if we went into Phas fresh. There's definitely things we would all probably say, 'Oh, let's not do that!' Or 'that would be awesome. We should do that instead.' So, yeah, you never know. It's definitely not off the cards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What about a Nintendo Switch 2 version?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>We want what's best for the game, and if the opportunity arises, we'd love to. But there's no news or anything I can share. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Before we go — the Blumhouse movie adaptation. How can Phasmophobia's genre-defining gameplay translate to a movie?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Corey J. Dixon: </strong>We've got a really good partnership with Blumhouse. It's brilliant. It <em>will</em> be a Phasmophobia film, it won't just be a ghost hunting film — we're going to make sure it's a film that fans want to watch, and we're going to work with them really closely. They're really willing to work with us, and, obviously, we want to work with them. So yeah, we've got a really good partnership, and I think fans are going to love it when it comes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Phasmophobia's Grafton Farmhouse reworked map is now live across all platforms, including PC via Steam, PS5, PS VR2, and Xbox Series X and S.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

As a new set of high-difficulty quests, 9★ monsters will start appearing when you are HR 100 or higher.</strong><p data-cy="paragraph">Starting with Ver. 1.021, Tempered Monsters (9★) of nine monster species will begin appearing in locales.<br>Following that, our third title update in late September will see additional 9★ monsters appear in event quests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For veteran players who have experienced end-game content in previous Monster Hunter titles, we understand that the difficulty of Tempered Monsters at launch may have felt lacking. Therefore, starting with Title Update 2, we've introduced a system for more detailed monster parameter customization, as well as other adjustments to ensure a challenging and rewarding experience.</p><strong>2. We're adding the Glowing Stone appraisal item as a quest reward for quests with 9★ monsters.</strong><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon quest completion, the Glowing Stone appraisal item — a quest reward for quests with 9★ monsters — will transform into an Appraised Talisman with randomly assigned skills.<br>Unlike other talismans which can be crafted and upgraded at the Smithy, Appraised Talismans cannot be upgraded. However, they can be randomly granted not only armor skills but weapon skills and decoration slots (both weapon skill and armor skill decoration slots), allowing for more customization and experimentation with builds. We hope this leads to more engaging gameplay and encourages hunters to try different weapons and armor based on the talismans they obtain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, we recognized that end-game content early after the game's release was slightly skewed around Arkveld. This, combined with the fact that Arkveld is relatively resistant to elements, resulted in limited opportunities to try out diverse builds. In response, we have adjusted the difficulty, average hunting time, and rewards for each of the 9★ monsters being added in an effort to ensure that all monsters offer balanced rewards fitting with the effort spent hunting them. We encourage you to select your hunts based on your own individual skill, equipment, or needs, and enjoy each challenge.</p><strong>9★ Monster Adjustments</strong><p data-cy="paragraph">In light of the addition of 9★ monsters, we've lengthened the duration of meal effects so that they're less likely to expire if the hunts go on a little long. We also raised the upgrade limit for armor of rarity 5 or above, so that players can squeeze in a little more defense before they go up against these challenging new monsters.<br>Additionally, from HR 100 and higher, Rey Dau and Nu Udra will now appear in the Wounded Hollow, and each region's apex predator will be more likely to appear even with that region is not experiencing an inclemency.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Title Update 3
</strong>As mentioned previously, Title Update 3 will see the gradual introduction of 9★ monsters in Event Quests as well.<br>We are also adjusting the strength of support hunters in line with the addition of 9★ monsters. We apologize that the timing of these adjustments are in stages and come after the implementation of the monsters themselves, but we hope you understand that this is a result of expediting the monster implementation.<br>In order to diversify the lineup of quests, we are working to make it possible for Lagiacrus to appear in the Wounded Hollow, as well as other additions such as more hunts targeting packs of monsters. We are also implementing adjustments to improve gameplay convenience, such as preventing monsters from spontaneously destroying pop-up camps and resetting the cooldown for mantles upon beginning a quest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, we can also assure you that any new monsters added in Title Update 3 will also feature 9★ difficulty quests.<br>We hope you look forward to the new contents for Title Update 3, and that in the meantime you can enjoy the new additions from Ver. 1.021 to strengthen your equipment and collect Appraised Talismans in preparation for the challenging hunts ahead.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Weapon Balance Changes</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">As previously announced, we had been planning balance adjustments for 5 weapon types. However, in the end we have expanded the scope and will be implementing adjustments (upward adjustments) for 11 total weapon types.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Affected Weapon Types:
</strong>Great Sword, Long Sword, Sword &amp; Shield, Dual Blades, Hunting Horn, Lance, Switch Axe, Charge Blade, Insect Glaive, Light Bowgun, Heavy Bowgun</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Bug Fixes Only: </strong>Gunlance, Bow</p><strong>Overall Direction</strong><p data-cy="paragraph">In previous updates, we aimed for greater diversity in hunting styles and equipment builds, including equipment with elemental properties. We performed balance adjustments, including some downward adjustments, to ensure no single strategy was overly effective against monsters introduced later on. However, this resulted in some hunting styles becoming less viable and certain weapon types experiencing lower-than-intended viability.<br>We apologize for the results and that we did not communicate our balancing intentions clearly enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This update will mitigate the excessive downward adjustments made in Title Update 2, and will focus on enhancing each weapon type's individuality while strengthening their ability to face high-difficulty monsters planned in the future. We will be implementing upward adjustments for 11 weapon types.</p><strong>Revisiting Downward Adjustments</strong><p data-cy="paragraph">For sword &amp; shield, charge blade, light bowgun, and heavy bowgun, we will be revisiting the downward adjustments made in Title Update 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sword &amp; Shield
</strong>In Wilds, we've been particularly focused on making the weapon easy to handle even for beginners, making adjustments to its moveset so that a certain level of damage can be dealt with any action.<br>Among these, the damage output of some actions was found to be too high in relation to their ease of use when compared to other weapon types. Therefore, we made some downward adjustments in Title Update 2.<br>Among those adjustments, we found that the downward adjustment to Guard Slash reduced the usage frequency of Counter Slash, so we're applying a slight power increase to Guard Slash to compensate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Charge Blade
</strong>In Title Update 2, we aimed to balance Amped Element Discharge so that it could offer another reliable source of damage beyond multi-hit attacks in Axe Mode. However, the adjustment resulted in less power than intended, and also failed to expand player options.<br>To address this, we revisited these adjustments and made it so that increased damage via enhanced phials is reflected while in Power Axe Mode, making it easier to maintain high damage output while keeping Power Axe Mode active.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Light Bowgun &amp; Heavy Bowgun
</strong>In the Ver. 1.011 update, we introduced downwards adjustments to elemental and pierce ammo to prevent them from being overpowered against future high-difficulty monsters, like the recently-introduced Arch-tempered Uth Duna, and to ensure that a variety of weapon types were viable. However, we're reviewing this change and will be slightly increasing the power of elemental ammo for light bowguns.<br>We will also relax the downward adjustment to the amount of rapid fire and ignition gauge recovery when using pierce ammo. Finally, we'll increase the amount of gauge recovery for various ammo types and improve the handling and power of special ammo in order to expand viable ammo selections for more situations.</p><strong>Other Weapons</strong><p data-cy="paragraph">We will perform some upward adjustments for weapons like the great sword and insect glaive as well, which previously have not been the subject of balance changes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For dual blades, we focused on improving usability, such as making Demon Boost Mode easier to maintain and making Focus Strikes easier to use. In particular, based on player feedback, we added a Focus Strike action (which can be chained into others) that provides another option for continuing attacks without changing your position.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We have implemented upwards adjustments for each weapon type, focusing on expanding playstyle options. We encourage hunters to try each of the weapons out again after the update is live.<br>Details on the adjustments made for each weapon type will be included in Guild Reports on our official social media accounts, so please check the reports for more information that we weren't able to share here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also plan to adjust some series skills that were previously difficult to use, with the overall goal of increasing equipment build options.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Efforts to Improve Game Stability</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">We'd also like to touch on our efforts to improve game stability, particularly for the Steam version, in response to numerous player comments.</p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong><p data-cy="paragraph">We are currently aware of an issue across all platforms where the game may crash when a player gesture, such as the Water Gun gesture, hits another player at the same time that a specific type of communication error has occurred.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We plan to fix this issue in the Ver. 1.021 update.<br>We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience and ask that you please wait a little longer for the fix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We are strengthening our checking system to prevent game crashes caused by issues on the application side. In the event that a bug is found, we will investigate and fix it promptly.</p><strong>CPU Usage Optimization (Steam Version)</strong><p data-cy="paragraph">In Title Update 2, we fixed bugs related to shader compilation and reduced the impact of anti-cheat measures on processing load by about 90%. In addition, as an option to reduce CPU load while improving frame rate, we implemented support for the latest super-resolution technologies, DLSS4 and FSR4.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition, in Title Update 2 we improved our texture loading process, reducing instances where low-quality textures are displayed when monsters suddenly enter the player's field of view.<br>Title Update 3 will see similar improvements for NPCs and Seikret mounts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Future Plans
</strong>In general, increasing the native frame rate will also increase CPU usage. If the frame rate limit is set to unlimited or a high value in the options, CPU performance will be maximized(*) in the attempt to increase the frame rate, which may result in a very high CPU usage. Please adjust your graphics options to limit the frame rate in accordance with your hardware's specifications.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">*In cases where GPU performance is bottlenecked, CPU performance may not be fully utilized.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We are aware that some players may be concerned about the potential strain on their PCs, particularly those using CPUs known to have stability issues (as reported by various manufacturers), due to prolonged high CPU usage during extended play sessions.<br>On the other hand, as making changes to CPU processing could affect the game's overall performance, we plan to proceed with caution.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In regards to CPU load reduction, we plan to address this issue in the fourth title update scheduled for this winter. Once the initial implementation is complete, we will proceed with a second stage of further mitigation measures.<br>We will also address GPU load reduction in a similar manner.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We will continue to work on improving the game's stability so that more players can enjoy the game on PC with peace of mind. Thank you for your understanding.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Looking Ahead!</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">We would like to express our sincere gratitude to all of you who have provided us with valuable feedback and requests.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We will continue to share the development team's progress on these through our Guild Reports. For detailed information on adjustments, including those we were unable to cover in this update, please refer to our <a href="https://x.com/MHStatusUpdates/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official social media accounts</a> and <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Note: Information will be published on our social media accounts first, and later posted on our official website as well. For the absolute latest, please check social media.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We will continue to make various fixes and adjustments through future updates, as well as implement additional exciting new content.<br>We also plan to address improvements that were not included in the Ver. 1.021 update in future title updates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Please also look forward to more details we'll be announcing soon about Title Update 3, scheduled for release at the end of September.<br>For our fourth title update this winter, on top of new monsters, we are also considering additional weapon-related end-game features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We'll continue to work hard to make Monster Hunter Wilds as enjoyable as possible for hunters throughout the world. Thank you for your continued support.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

                <p>In its financial results for the first half of 2025, Remedy Entertainment says that it is "unsatisfied" by the post-launch sales of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fbc-firebreak-review-controlled-chaos/1900-6418376/">FBC: Firebreak</a>. While the company says that its co-op PvE game reached 1 million players after launch in June--with high numbers from PS5 and Xbox Series X|S specifically--PC sales underperformed and weren't enough to cover the low sales on console. It's worth noting that FBC: Firebreak was available day-one through PS Plus and Xbox Game Pass, with those playerbases likely being responsible for the game reaching 1 million players in 10 days.</p><p>Remedy's first self-published game, FBC: Firebreak did receive a payment from Microsoft and Sony for allowing its game to be distributed via the respective subscription services of those two companies, with Remedy aiming for Steam to be "the primary consumer sales channel" on PC. FBC: Firebreak was met with negative feedback and poor post-launch sales, Remedy says, but it's still committed to turning the game around, and it says that it has a solid foundation to build on, going forward.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> FBC: Firebreak GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p>"FBC: Firebreak was designed as a game that evolves over time," <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Remedy said</a>. "Despite the rocky launch, we believe we have a solid game to build on. Players who spent over an hour with the game reviewed the game mostly positive--showing us that the core experience of the game is entertaining. We have already rolled out patches and communicated on how the game will continue to develop. Looking ahead, a larger 'Major Update' late September will be the next key step for FBC: Firebreak."</p><p>Remedy says that it will launch targeted marketing activities to further drive interest in the title, as well as work with the game's community to help expand it over time.

			<p>The Magnus APU will reportedly power the Xbox next-generation console and a line of Xbox PCs, employing a strategy that will greatly benefit AMD.</p>



<p>Speaking on the NeoGAF forums, <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-ps6-early-specs-leak-amd-rdna-5-lower-price-than-ps5-pro.1686842/post-270705701">known AMD leaker Kepler L2</a> outright said that the Magnus APU leaked <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-next-xbox-amd-zen-6-magnus-apu-11-cores-384-bit-memory-bus/">last month</a> is not only going to power the next-generation Microsoft console but also <em>"Xbox PCs"</em> with the APU getting licensed out to OEM partners. Bar a few likely differences, these systems should be essentially the same, as another known insider, HeisenbergFX4, <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/mlid-ps6-early-specs-leak-amd-rdna-5-lower-price-than-ps5-pro.1686842/post-270705260">believes</a> there won't be any special development required for the Xbox next-generation console, since no developer would put in additional work for what is setting out to be a small, niche market.</p>



<p>Ultimately, having a desktop chiplet powering the next-generation Xbox system as well as regular Xbox-branded PCs will be a big win for AMD, as highlighted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">Moore's Law is Dead</a> in a new video going over the leaked APUs for the next-generation consoles. Not only will production numbers be high, but AMD will likely be able to get better prices from TSMC while also benefiting from the optimization work done for the Xbox next-generation system. Considering how game optimization issues are rampant in the PC space nowadays, this could also become a great marketing point for the company and the Xbox partner OEMs.</p>

<p>The Xbox next-generation Magnus APU is set to mark a massive change in the console space. Its chiplet design, featuring separate CPU and GPU dies, is very different from the most recent console APUs, and will potentially power <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-magnus-apu-flexibility-compete-pre-built-pcs/">a more iterative approach to console design</a>, allowing Microsoft to offer more frequent upgrades and possibly do away with the traditional console cycle. With console-exclusive games quickly becoming a thing of the past, it's not surprising to see how all console manufacturers seem to be going in different directions, an approach set to make the next generation of consoles one of the most interesting to date.</p>
