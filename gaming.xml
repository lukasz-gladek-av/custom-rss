			<p>Way back when it was announced, Playtonic’s Yooka-Laylee attracted a huge amount of excitement and anticipation, promising to bring back the lost art of the collectathon 3D platformer. With ex-Rare devs leading the way, and their former employer subject to the whims of Microsoft’s inner workings, fans were hoping that the lizard and bat combination would resurrect the golden age of Banjo-Kazooie et al. The end result was one of the biggest disappointments in gaming memory. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review/">Yooka-Laylee</a> wasn’t a complete disaster but felt unfinished and strangely empty, especially in the later levels. The 2D spin-off <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/08/yooka-laylee-and-the-impossible-lair-review/">Impossible Lair</a> was far more complete and therefore better received but it was clear that Playtonic felt that there was unfinished business with the first game. Enter Yooka-Replaylee.</p>
<p><iframe title="Yooka-Replaylee | Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/spXZHz4ZXUY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Yooka-Replaylee is the updated and fully fleshed out version of the original pitch that fans were excited for back in the day. The visuals have had a major overhaul, the levels filled with new challenges, and the game mechanics given a new lease of life. It’s no exaggeration to say that this is the definitive Yooka-Laylee experience and I hope that it reaches the wider audience that it deserves.</p>


<p>The visual upgrade is the first thing to hit you upon starting up the game. I played on Switch 2, predominantly handheld, and the new palette really pops on the screen. It also looked fantastic when docked with smooth performance and a much improved camera. The different levels really stand out with the increased graphical detail, leading to environments that are far more interesting to explore. Exploration is also required as there are double the number of pagies to collect and many new minigames and trials to complete.</p>


<p>Just in case you are new to the series, let’s go through some background. Yooka and Laylee are best friends that live on a pirate ship. One is a lizard and one is a bat, with the latter living on Yooka’s back in much the same way that Kazooie lived in Banjo’s backpack. They have the same kind of friendly banter and back-and-forths, and share many of the same platforming skills of their spiritual predecessors. Whilst relaxing on their ship one day, they meet a magical book that offers power to its owner. Before they can get too comfortable, though, the evil Capital B steals the book and scatters its pages throughout the lands. It is therefore up to the dynamic duo to explore the various levels and rescue the Pagies.</p>
<p>The original game had a system of unlocks that meant you had to buy skills as you progressed and return to levels to find Pagies that were unavailable first time around. One of the most transformative changes in the new version is that all of the skills are at your disposal from the very start. This makes it possible to completely clear a level before moving on if you want to go for 100% and removes the need to backtrack. This doesn’t mean that completion is easy, though, as there are still some fiendishly hidden collectables and challenging minigames to beat in order to collect everything.</p>

<p>You begin your quest to collect the Pagies in the overworld hub. This area contains the entrances for the five levels, each with 50 Pagies to collect, as well as 50 Pagies of its own. Accessing each level requires you to have a set amount of Pagies, but this amount has not been altered from the original, so it is actually possible to reach the final confrontation with Capital B after rinsing just the first two levels and the overworld to meet its 120 Pagies goal. This is a peculiar choice as it makes much of the new content feel far more optional than it should. There isn’t even an achievement for collecting every Pagie, which seems like a bizarre choice. I only briefly touched the last two levels in my playthrough, but know I will be returning to mop up the rest of the collectables at some point.</p>
<p>It’s not just Pagies, as there are also 150 Quills, currency that you can use to buy upgrades from Trowser the Snake, 5 Ghosts with different approaches to collect them, hidden pig characters to find, an Arcade coin for Rex’s retro arcade machine, a Mollycule for Dr Puzz, coins to spend with Vendi the Vending Machine, 8 Pagie fragments, and even more. The collectathon is the game here, with narrative being restricted to entertaining cutscenes as you unlock each Pagie door – another clear influence from Banjo-Kazooie.</p>

<p>Each level is well designed to hide all of these many collectables and you’ll need to scour every nook and cranny to find them all, as well as fully exploit Yooka and Laylee’s abilities to traverse complex platforming sections with impressive verticality. Enemies are frequent with different varieties for each biome and there are fun boss battles that reward victory with 3 Pagies. Less fun are the returning mine cart sections that remain just as frustrating as ever. Fortunately the huge excess of Pagies in this version means that you can ignore challenges or minigames that you don’t want to play. Perhaps the most radical redesign here is the Retro Rex Arcade minigame which now plays out with far more substance than originally.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Yooka-Replaylee isn’t just the definitive version of the game; it’s one of the most enjoyable 3D platformers this side of Nintendo first party titles or Astro Bot. The levels are now packed with things to do, the range of different challenges keeps things interesting, and the upgrades and equippable tonics enable you to customise the difficult to suit your playstyle. All in all, this is now an essential purchase for fans of 3D platformers.	</p></div>

First-person undersea scare-o-puzzler Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss launches April 16, 2026, as announced during last night's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/galaxies-autumn-25-showcase-how-to-watch">Galaxies showcase of less than blockbustery videogame darlings</a>. It kind of looks like a marginally more combative Soma with less <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-a-nod-to-nietzsche-in-soma-got-me-thinking-twice-about-that-suffocating-buzzword-immersion">philosophical subtext</a>, which sounds like a solid Friday night to me. It's also an opportunity for some hipfire scattergun commentary about the Lovecraftian premise of sights beyond comprehension, and how this gels with videogames, an artform that has "video" in the title. 
</p>

<p>
As described on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2760560/Cthulhu_The_Cosmic_Abyss/">Steam</a>, Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss sees you and a sinister chatbot accomplice exploring Cthulhu's prison, the ancient submerged city of R'lyeh, while resisting "the creeping madness caused by Cthulhu's influence". You've found your way there while investigating a lost mining station, deep beneath the Pacific.</p>
<p>There's a secret at the heart of R'lyeh "that could shatter your understanding of reality". All this talk of madness and shattering notwithstanding, the release date trailer deals in familiar Lovecraftian imagery. There are tentacles, fish monsters, mutated humans, and streets of snotty, graven stone that spiral upwards and downwards in frightful ways.

<p>
I was going to do my usual routine of putting my hands on my hips and saying "well that doesn't look very incomprehensibly cosmically horrible to <em>me</em>, it looks like a bunch of feisty trout people, upside-down windows and flagrant Orientalism". But this kind of thing is perfectly in keeping with Lovecraft's own descriptions of Cthulhu, which are nowhere near as fancy as I'd love them to be. "The Thing cannot be described," he writes in <a href="https://www.hplovecraft.com/writings/texts/fiction/cc.aspx">The Call of Cthulhu</a>. "There is no language for such abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy, such eldritch contradictions of all matter, force, and cosmic order. A mountain walked or stumbled." Then he proceeds to talk about Cthulhu being green and greasy with big "flabby" claws and a squid for a head. 
</p><p>
I generally think that the better recent "Lovecraftian" cosmic horror seizes upon Lovecraft's artier abstractions and twists them further. For example, I find R'lyeh itself a lot more intriguing than the depiction of absolute unit squidman Cthulhu. Lovecraft's narrator in the story makes a loose connection to futurism, the Italian 19th century art movement that dealt in worlds smashed and hastened by combustion engines and electricity, producing city paintings <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Street_Enters_the_House">like this one</a>. "Without knowing what futurism is like, Johansen achieved something very close to it when he spoke of the city," Lovecraft's awestruck voyager expounds, "for instead of describing any definite structure or building, he dwells only on broad impressions of vast angles and stone surfaces--surfaces too great to belong to any thing right or proper for this earth, and impious with horrible images and hieroglyphs." 
</p>
<p>
I'd love to play a Lovecraftian game that runs with that analogy and puts Euclidean geometry under more artful stress, rather than just bending what could otherwise be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a> 3 maps in silly ways. I'm not sure you can pursue such ideas in Unreal Engine, much as The Cosmic Abyss may decorate its cavern roofs with inverted masonry - Unreal Engine games come with a certain built-in visual register and audience expectations. Still, perhaps that shattering secret at the heart of the game will surprise me. It looks like they have a black hole down there. Always keen on a black hole somewhere it shouldn't be.
</p>
<p>
Speaking of black holes, I will tell you about my one moment in a videogame that compares to Lovecraft's account of cracking the seal on R'lyeh and - in the seconds before Johnny Octochops emerges - encountering a "tenebrousness" that has an unambiguous "positive quality", bursting forth "like smoke from its aeon-long imprisonment, visibly darkening the sun as it slunk away into the shrunken and gibbous sky on flapping membraneous wings". It was while playing <a href="https://zenorogue.itch.io/relative-hell">Relative Hell</a>, which I've written about here and there. It's a shmup that, to pack everything down, models <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-de_Sitter_space">ideas about spacetime</a> I do indeed struggle to describe, inasmuch as my own subject-verb-object grammar is a product of 'classical physics'.
</p>
<p>
In every game of Relative Hell I've played, I've slid off the surface of legible reality and found myself at large in a frictionless yet enveloping dark sphere with coloured gameplay props smeared around its profile. I cannot work out what it means to move in that sphere and it scares the shit out of me. The developer's notes don't help. Here is one: "in the pause mode, when you advance/revert the time, you can see a dark circle -- this represents your "future", that is, the area reached by the light you emit currently (you can theoretically affect this future), or "past", the area you would have seen by now." If the shadows parted and Cthulhu appeared, it would be a relief, frankly.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Everyone’s gaming journey varies, and we all reach different places at different times. You might only now be playing a hack-and-slash game for the first time with Ninja Gaiden 4, and it’s not a bad way to start. There will come a point where you feel the need to move on, and this is why we’ve picked out some of the best hack-and-slash games in a similar vein to Ninja Gaiden; you should play now or at some point.</p>



<p>Some of them are oldies, but they’re all goldies in one way or another. We love the hack ‘n’ slash genre as it’s fast-paced, usually brutal, and demands a higher skill level to master these games. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-preload-guide-file-size-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> is a continuation of everything the genre has established to this point.</p>



<p>Whether you’ve completed the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-trophy-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4 trophy list</a> (seriously impressive!) or you’re ready for a new challenge, there’s something on this list for everyone.</p>



<h2 id="h-games-like-ninja-gaiden-4-you-should-play">Games Like Ninja Gaiden 4 You Should Play</h2>



<h3 id="h-devil-may-cry">Devil May Cry</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Dance with the devil. Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>With some of these entries, it’s hard to isolate a single game, and the Devil May Cry series is the perfect example. Apart from the much-maligned Devil May Cry 2, which didn’t resemble a DMC game and was a travesty, let’s face it, every other release is incredible in its own right. </p>



<p><strong>This even includes the controversial 2013 reboot</strong>—where Ninja Theory took a break from Ninja Gaiden to give Dante a midlife crisis makeover. The action is slick, the combo and score system gives you incentive to keep replaying levels, and the franchise is a thematic treat.</p>



<h3 id="h-god-of-war">God of War</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Let’s take a trip through time. Credit to Santa Monica</figcaption></figure>



<p>Again, we won’t be picky here, but let’s take the modern-day God of War reboots out of the equation. Ignore them and go back in history to revisit Kratos’ humble and horrible beginnings. Learn how the God of War got his title, why he looks the way he does, and why the recent incarnation of Kratos seems tired and devoid of anger and conflict wherever possible.</p>



<p>God of War is the best hack and slash series (in this writer’s opinion), and <strong>God of War 3 is the pinnacle of the action</strong>. Like DMC, every entry is special in its own right, but God of War 3 is the culmination of an epic trilogy. It features some of the series’ most iconic set-piece battles ever, and the action and gameplay look and play beautifully.</p>



<h3 id="h-bayonetta">Bayonetta</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Sultry yet skillful. Credit to PlatinumGames</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.platinumgames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlatinumGames</a> really knows its shizzle, doesn’t it? The company appears multiple times on this list in both development and publisher roles. Here, it’s as a developer, and you can choose any of the three mainline Bayonetta games for your hack-and-slash fix. <strong>Bayonetta is a wicked witch, and oozes charisma and personality</strong>. With guns for shoes and a penchant for using her whole outfit as part of her arsenal, Bayonetta has combos and chaos coursing through her veins.</p>



<p>Intricate combat systems are supported by the usual slew of magic and special abilities, and it all weaves together to make Bayonetta a joy to behold. It’s a series you should definitely consider, and you should play each game after playing Ninja Gaiden 4.</p>



<h3 id="h-nier-automata">Nier: Automata</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Nier, far. Credit to Square Enix</figcaption></figure>



<p>Developer? PlatinumGames. Unbelievable fast-paced action and engaging story? Check. <strong>PlatinumGames generally doesn’t miss</strong>: From Vanquish to Astral Chain, they know what players want. They know how to make immersive action games, and there’s a reason why Nier: Automata was in the running for Game of the Year in 2017.</p>



<p>Playful parkour and pleasant platforming sections intertwine frenetic action-heavy sequences. Blink, and you’ll miss a building being destroyed and 2B (the main character) being swarmed by hostile robots and threats. One of Automata’s pulls is the story, which requires multiple playthroughs to fully experience and realize the game’s ambitious vision.</p>



<h3 id="h-metal-gear-rising-revengeance">Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Not a proper MGS game, but it’s still pretty good. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p>Copy and paste everything about PlatinumGames again. Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance was a different kind of game. Having Raiden—the cyborg ninja—as the protagonist meant Konami pivoted toward a more hack-and-slash approach. <strong>It’s an MGS spin-off</strong>, for sure, but it doesn’t make it any less fun.</p>



<p>Outside of the typical action cadence Platinum delivers, there’s a terrific story here with the usual Kojima-inspired narrative licks and splashes of Metal Gear Solid nuance. This is a short but sizzling sweet ride.</p>



<h3 id="h-dante-s-inferno">Dante’s Inferno</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Let’s get the major and obvious negative out of the way: <strong>Dante’s Inferno is a blatant reskin of God of War</strong>, and doesn’t deliver the same compelling experience. On the other hand, if you enjoy hack-and-slash games and love God of War, there’s a lot to relish about Dante’s Inferno.</p>



<p>You guide Dante through the Nine Circles of Hell before confronting Lucifer himself. You have to fight your way through a LOT of enemies and bosses to get there. Each of the Seven Sins is explored, with environments and enemies designed to match up with the current area’s theme. The game is actually badass, and had this come out before the first God of War game, the annals of history might look quite different.</p>



<h3 id="h-ninja-gaiden">Ninja Gaiden</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Why not. Credit to Team Ninja</figcaption></figure>



<p>We come full circle with Ninja Gaiden. Logically, if you enjoy Ninja Gaiden 4, why not go back and play any other NG release? News Flash: There are quite a few of them. 2025 has seen the release of two other launches alone: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-complete-list-of-ninja-gaiden-2-black-achievements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a> (A complete remaster of the second game) and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-ninja-gaiden-ragebound-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-and-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a>.</p>



<p>You’ve got NES and SNES releases from the 80s and 90s, and <strong>2004 onwards is seen as the real start of Ninja Gaiden</strong>. You can’t go wrong with most of them, to be honest, and you know what you’re going to get!</p>



<p>We’ve tried to pick the absolute must-play hack-and-slash games and franchises. However, you’re more than welcome to disagree. So let us know through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1416770944961220720/1416780218936463463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a> which hack ‘n’ slash titles or series you think NG4 fans have to play next.</p>

                <p>The convergence of AI and game creation is a topic that won't be going away any time soon, especially when large companies like EA reportedly wants its devs to consider artificial intelligence to be "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wants-devs-to-view-ai-as-thought-partners-report/1100-6535589/" data-ref-id="1100-6535589">thought partners</a>" when crafting titles. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer was recently asked about Xbox's AI usage, and he indicated that it's primarily being utilized for operational purposes for now.</p><p>"Our applications of AI today are mostly actually on the security and protection of our networks," said Spencer during his appearance at the Paley International Council Summit (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-on-ai-use-much-more-operational-than-it-is-in-the-creative-space" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>). "It's now at a scale where you can't really moderate the safety of those with just people alone. The volume is too high. So we have AI that we use to make sure that the conversation and topics that are happening, and for protected child accounts and other things and who gets to talk to those accounts to those people, is locked down by parents or guardians who are setting those controls. That's our primary use of AI inside of our organization today, which maybe isn't the most glamorous use of AI, but it's something that I fundamentally believe in."</p><p>As a company, Microsoft is going all in on AI and voice controls with a recently unveiled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-wants-ai-and-voice-control-to-be-an-even-bigger-part-of-windows/1100-6535491/" data-ref-id="1100-6535491">campaign to fully integrate that technology into Windows 11 machines</a>. In the video game industry, prominent developers Hideo Kojima and Glen Schofield believe that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">AI tools should be embraced</a> in game creation. A recent survey also found that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/more-japanese-game-developers-are-embracing-ai-than-ever-before/1100-6535072/" data-ref-id="1100-6535072">over 50% of Japanese game publishers utilize AI</a> in some way.</p><p>Spencer did address whether Microsoft encourages developers to use AI in the creative process, and he noted that he prefers to let the devs make that decision.</p><p>"I have found that creative teams will use tools that make their job easier when it makes their job easier," said Spencer. "Any top-down mandate that 'thou must use a certain tool' ... is not really a path to success. I look at the teams, and we make tools available, and I kind of let it organically percolate."</p><p>A recent report indicated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/" data-ref-id="1100-6535643">Microsoft's extremely ambitious profit goals</a> may be harming the company, and possibly played a large role in its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-layoffs-begin-with-200-cuts-in-europe-report/1100-6532905/">massive layoffs</a>, as well as the price hikes for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/">Xbox consoles</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/">Game Pass subscriptions</a>. It was also disclosed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-ceo-makes-480-times-as-much-as-the-median-company-worker-a-growing-gap/1100-6535651/" data-ref-id="1100-6535651">Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made $96.5 million</a> in the company's 2025 fiscal year. That's approximately 480 times as much as the median company worker at Microsoft.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagate-4tb-portable-hard-drive-hits-0-02-per-gb-the-cheapest-way-to-expand-xbox-or-playstation-storage-yet-2000638557</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seagate-4tb-portable-hard-drive-hits-0-02-per-gb-the-cheapest-way-to-expand-xbox-or-playstation-storage-yet.1333840/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you or someone you know is constantly teetering on the edge of maxing out their file storage be it on their computer or on a gaming console, in constant need to deleting the old to make room for the new, you or they may find peace by just using an external hard drive. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4989/">Right now, you can save 20% on this Seagate portable external HDD.</a> Amazon normally has it listed at $125, so the discount takes it down by a solid $25. You’re left only have to pay an even $100 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4989/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Xbox and PlayStation Compatible</h2>
<p>This Seagate external hard drive is compatible not just with PCs but also with your Xbox or PlayStation console. The Xbox Series X has an internal SSD with a capacity of only 1TB, while the Xbox Series S has even less with just 512GB. The PlayStation 5 base console is working with 1TB. And keep in mind that these numbers are the total capacity. Some of that space is already used up by necessary system software loaded onto it to make the consoles work, so you’re really only working with a fraction of that for game storage.</p>
<p>The Seagate portable drive can add on a whole 4TB more for storing all your games. That’s great news considering many AAA games as of late have ballooned in file size, with games like <em>Call of Duty Black Ops 7&nbsp;</em>is listed on storefronts as being over 200GB. That will take up almost half your Xbox Series S.</p>



<p>Now there is a catch. While you can download and store your games onto the Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5, you can’t actually play them from it. Current gen games require super fast load time with specific hardware that enables certain functionality like Xbox’s Quick Resume feature. So when it comes time to want to play you game, you have to transfer the file from the drive to the console.</p>
<p>While that’s not the most convenient thing in the world, moving files from drive to drive is still exponentially faster than needing to redownload a game from the internet. Moving from a drive is better than that. Think of it like a digital version of taking your game off the shelf and popping the disc in when you’re ready to play. The drive can be your library, and this HDD is far cheaper than an SSD would be that can support playing the games directly from. So this presents a great budget option to maximize your game storage space while minimizing what you’ll have to spend.</p>

		<p>I have to say, the Switch 2 might be my favourite console. I liked the original Switch well enough, but the bump in power is really helping to make it feel like, well, an actual console, rather than a handheld masquerading as one. The whole handheld that turns into a home console is an alluring one, which is probably why rumours that Sony are eying up the same format for the next generation are so interesting. The number one thing that holds these things back, though, is battery life. I can just about live with the Switch 2, but both the Steam Deck and the ROG Ally are woeful on the battery front when I’m trying to play the games I want to play.</p>
<p>It has been a busy week wherever I’ve been playing, and I’ve spent a good deal of time with Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch. It’s a great pairing of Fire Emblem-esque strategy and roguelike progression, and I definitely recommend you check it out! Besides that, I’ve spent ages building parks in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/21/jurassic-world-evolution-3-review/">Jurassic World Evolution 3</a> and then gone round and round a lot in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/22/nascar-25-review-heart-pounding-racing-action/">NASCAR 25</a>, both of which have kept me very happy indeed.</p>

<p>The first to drop into WWP this week was <strong>Laura</strong>, and she responded to my shouted call for WWP by shouting right back at me, yelling “I’VE STARTED PLAYING JURASSIC WORLD EVOLUTION 3 AND GOODNESS ME THOSE DINOSAURS HAVE HAD A LEVEL UP IN GRAPHICS IN THIS LATEST ONE. ALSO, BABY DINOSAURS! SQUEEE! PS EVERYTHING SHOULD BE WRITTEN IN CAPS ON A FRIDAY!” That feels very loud for a Friday.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> was next in, showing great restraint to calmly inform us that he’s been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/23/fading-serenades-review/">Fading Serenades</a>, Once Upon A Jester, and Slots &amp; Daggers for review – see those two later today.</p>

<p><strong>Nic B</strong> has been kicking around in Lumoise and Iwatodai, jumping between <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/14/pokemon-legends-z-a-review/">Pokémon Z-A</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/21/persona-3-reload-switch-2-review/">Persona 3 Reload</a>. He’s got plans for the future though, saying, “I’m looking forward to starting Ghost of Yotei when my wife and I are free at the same time, as she wants to watch me play this one!”</p>

<p>Having just finished up Yooka-Replaylee, <strong>Steve</strong> told us, “It is the game it was always meant to be and a must play for 3D platformer fans.” He continued, “I’ve also been continuing to explore indie demos on Steam, with a focus on horror for this spooky season. I’ve got Powerwash Simulator 2 installed for my new comfort game, ready for the dark and cold nights.”</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong> has been playing Super Fantasy Kingdom, which he says is “yet another deeply compelling Hooded Horse game. I don’t know how they keep doing it.” He’s also been playing Pokemon Legends Z-A, but decries, “I’m enjoying it, but really wish it was better.”</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> has been playing Hellblade 2: Senua’s Saga, but hasn’t really been enjoying it. He says, “Sadly, it isn’t very good. It looks fantastic, but the gameplay is tedious filler and most of the stuff that made the original so compelling has been lost. Despite its short length, I’m not sure I’m going to make it to the end credits on this one, I’ll probably go play Hades 2 again instead!” He’s not forced his child to play either of these things though, with his son having really got into Marvel Rivals. Ade said, “His go to characters currently being Spidey, Venom, and Namor. Makes a nice change from all things Minecraft for Dad!”</p>

<p>Next up, <strong>Jim</strong> has briefly shelved Ghost of Yotei this week in order to play some Battlefield 6. He told us, “Much like every Call of Duty entry, I find myself sworn to beat the Battlefield campaigns before I touch the multiplayer which hasn’t been entirely disastrous this time around. The BF6 campaign has some flashy locations and cool set pieces but the story didn’t really land with me.”</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Tef</strong> has played a bit of Battlefield 6 multiplayer this week, made a start on Escape Simulator 2 with his better half, and did his best in an extraction shooter.</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played?</p>

            <p>Yesterday was Fallout Day, the date in the series' universe when the bombs dropped and permanently turned a lot of people into those skeletons you grind into dust while tramping about in your power armour. Bethesda awakened Todd Howard from cryo-sleep, and announced some stuff in a broadcast. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a> are being sold to people again. Also, in admittedly more exciting news, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>'s Burning Springs update got a proper release date.</p>
<p>The upcoming second series of Prime Video's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-season-2-radiates-new-vegas-with-a-trailer-heavy-on-stupid-sexy-house-and-a-december-debut-date">Fallout TV Show</a> was also there, with that and the 76 update set to make December <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/enlisting-walton-goggins-for-a-fallout-76-expansion-in-total-tonal-tandem-with-season-2-came-organically-devs-say-despite-previous-hint-at-very-limited-crossover">very Walton Gogginsy</a>.</p>

<p>First, we might as well get the <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/N00XVTawnzBBH7HNwv0hN/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-announced">Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition</a> over with. It's mainly a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>-esque title engrandening around the RPG hitting Nintendo Switch 2 via a re-release that's also dropping for PC on November 10th. It's basically the all-DLC game of the year edition, but with 150 bits of extra creation club stuff and a new menu dedicated to its more modern form, creations.</p><p>How you feel about both likely depends on whether you're cool with the idea of leaning into mods which have been given the official Bethesda thumbs up to add an extra twist to your thousandth trip through the Commonwealth. Odds are that's much more appealing to console players whose mod access is limited, with the bigger question for us PC folks being whether the anniversary edition's arrival will come with an update to the original game which leaves existing mods in need of a nudge to get working again.</p>
<p>On the even more cynical side, the PC version of Fallout: New Vegas' ultimate edition is <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/6CJ0fC8EQZTdOXQD90VAnz/fallout-new-vegas-15th-anniversary-bundle-announced">being re-released</a> with a bundle of merch to commemorate its 15th Anniversary. This arrives next year, and will set you back an eye-watering <a href="https://international.gear.bethesda.net/products/fallout-new-vegas-15th-anniversary-bundle">£139.99</a> / <a href="https://gear.bethesda.net/products/fallout-new-vegas-15th-anniversary-bundle">$154.99</a>. That's for the New Vegas ultimate edition that you can currently get for £4 / $5 / €5 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sub/13435/">Steam</a> as of writing, thanks to a deal that ends shortly. Or £16 / equivalent if it's reset to regular price and you don't fancy waiting for the next sale.</p>
<p>Why the price hike? Well, there's a PVC statue of Victor, some of Doc Mitchell’s two-headed bear pictures, and a few pins/patches of the clothing variety lobbed into a bigger box. Now, as someone who once bought a cheap fan-made t-shirt with the graffiti logo of Ulysses from the Lonesome Road DLC on it, I may be chucking stones in a glass house here, but er, no, my wallet will be staying closed.</p>
<p>I will, however, likely give Fallout 76's TV Show Ghoul-centric <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-76s-next-expansion-goes-all-in-on-fallout-tv-show-season-2-bringing-walton-goggins-and-new-vegas-feel-to-ohio">Burning Springs update</a> a go when it arrives on the <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4s3LXe6vs14YRUdiQpBhSf/fallout-76-burning-springs-preview">freshly revealed</a> full release date of December 2nd. I'm sceptical it'll be able to avoid feeling like a rather naked cash-in on the Fallout TV Show that struggles to justify its existence much beyond that, but I'll give it a chance to prove me wrong before declaring either way.</p>
<p>As alluded to earlier Todd Howard also popped up during the Fallout Day stream. We know you want things, and are working on things, he told the assembled throngs. Cheers Todd, replied the assembled throngs.</p>

            <p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A has sold 5.8m copies so far in its first week, according to the official Pokémon company website.</p>
<p>Roughly half of these were on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a>, and the number includes both physical and digital copies of the game. This makes it one of the highest-selling Pokémon titles in terms of first-week sales.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://x.com/pierre485_/status/1981599907262714267">noted by video games sales specialist Pierre485 on X</a>, Z-A still lags behind Pokémon Scarlet/Violet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a>, and Pokémon Sword/Shield in terms of first-week sales. However, it has already surpassed the likes of Pokémon X/Y and Pokémon: Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee.

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-2-bundle-announced">Pokémon Legends: Z-A was included in a special Switch 2 hardware bundle</a>, which was announced back in July of this year. The Switch 2 version <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-announced">touted "improved graphics and frame-rate"</a>, and Switch copies of the game can be upgraded to the Switch 2 version via an upgrade pack.</p><p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A not only brings Mega Evolutions back to the series, it features an arena-style 3D battle system where Pokémon can move around during fights in a bold evolution of traditional turn-based battles. It's also possible to be knocked out during fights, adding a previously unexplored degree of danger.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">Eurogamer's three star review</a>, Chris Tapsell wrote, "Lumiose City could do with work, but Pokémon Legends: Z-A is a much more tightly focused - and delightfully goofy - return to better form. At least by modern Pokémon's standards."</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Speaking as a veteran insomniac who routinely has to operate across time zones, let me share a few of my top tips for staying awake when you really want to sleep. Firstly, fill your eyes with as much light as possible - moonlight, fridgelight, phonelight, flamingoilbarrelight - and your lungs with as much bracing outdoors air as they can take. Secondly, enlist a similarly restless friend for some mutual tickling. Thirdly, remember your failures. All of them. Fourthly, consume a carefully calibrated mixture of fresh fruit and coffee, then look up dad jokes on Reddit.</p>
<p>It doesn't feel like any of these proven strategies will work in Sleep Awake, the new first-person "psychedelic" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game from former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spec-ops-the-line">Spec Ops: The Line</a> director and designer Cory Davis and his team at Eyes Out. Nobody wants to tickle you here, going by the trailer. Nobody has any dad jokes to share. They just want to beat you to a bloody sludge with pipes.</p><!--more-->
<p>Sleep Awake takes place in a city called the Crush, the last known city on Earth. Humanity faces extinction thanks to a mysterious force that disappears people when they fall asleep. Such civilisation as remains consists largely of addled cultists, would-be messiahs and assorted lairy randos, all battling desperately to keep their eyes open.</p>
<p>The game's levels are strewn with various means of prolonging wakefulness, from that old classic the bed of nails, to dubious brain-modifying technology that resembles the Pilot's throne in Alien. You will creep around, corner to corner, solving puzzles and straying into parallel dimensions that may or may not be hallucinations. There's music from Robin Finck of Nine Inch Nails. They're pretty loud, aren't they? Good choice of rock pedigree for this setup. Imagine if they'd hired Simon &amp; Garfunkel. There'd be no humans left after 30 minutes.</p><p>Sleep Awake now has a release date - December 2nd - announced during last night's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/galaxies-autumn-25-showcase-how-to-watch">Galaxies Showcase</a> of indie malarkey. Perfect. A decent remove from the Xmas hols, but still close enough to cast a shadow over Santa's strained, unblinking face. You can find a demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2446540/SLEEP_AWAKE/">Steam</a>. Or you can read Oisin's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sleep-awake-a-visually-inviting-horror-game-from-the-dev-behind-spec-ops-the-line-has-a-demo-out-now">slightly mixed impressions</a> of that demo.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Developer emptyvessel has released an extended gameplay video of its upcoming 4v4v4v4 cyberpunk first person shooter DEFECT. In the game, you choose to play as a member of one of a number of factions including The System’s Police Force, Rogue Police, or a member of different gangs as each group attempts to complete its own objectives while sabotaging and defeating the others.</p>
<p><iframe title="DEFECT | Extended Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O0d9sqm5LX0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In this extended gameplay trailer for DEFECT, we open with the load in screen for The System’s police force where players vote on the objective to pursue and prepare their loadouts for the starting phase, though you can pick up and find other weapons in the matches too. The police’s mission here is to infiltrate Nodrog’s territory, whose voice can be heard taunting the force. During the footage you see switches to surveillance camera views, and this is how Nodrog is following the police’s moves. These cameras can be hacked to provide additional tactical advantages.</p>
<p>Players will have a variety of tools at their disposal like drones and scanners to scout out areas, and a tool called a Body Snatch. With Body Snatch, players can subdue enemies and then transfer a downed teammate’s consciousness into that body. In the video, we see this play out with a gang member being taken down and then joining the police due to their mind being taken over. There are also health stations dotted around maps, but they only have three charges and are usually in dangerous areas. Health does not regenerate so finding and defending these points is also a crucial element of matches in DEFECT. The final objective in this video is to reboot the building’s operating system, but emptyvessel has stated final objectives differ and can change depending on what is happening in matches.</p>

<p>This video just looks at DEFECT’s multiplayer PvP mode, though emptyvessel has confirmed it is also working on single player and co-op content for the game. A release date is yet to be confirmed for the game, with PC currently confirmed as the only platform with Steam Deck compatibility in the works.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/24/lost-eidolons-veil-of-the-witch-review/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>There’s something about handheld gaming that just seems to fit with tactical games. Nintendo in particular, have regularly married the two, with series like Fire Emblem forming part of the bedrock of their handheld gaming lineup for many years. So, while Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch is out for all the major platforms, it’s a natural for the Nintendo Switch, fusing Fire Emblem-esque strategy and storytelling with Roguelike progression.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d9ScyPnAxU0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That said, Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch doesn’t make the best first impression on Nintendo Switch (by way of Switch 2’s compatibility layer), and a big part of that is in-game visuals. I initially started playing the game in handheld mode, and while the character artwork is detailed and characterful, the in-game visuals seemed very basic indeed. It looks better when you play docked, but it’s still pretty rough around the edges. It’s a testament to the quality of the gameplay that you’ll find yourself drawn into the tactical action, despite this, and the longer I spent with the game, the less I noticed.</p>


<p>There’s definitely a strong flavour of Fire Emblem in every gulp of Lost Eidolons: Veil of the Witch. You move your team of characters around a grid, facing off against a slew of different enemies, and if you want to be successful, you have to consider positioning, weaponry types, weaknesses and individual strengths.</p>


<p>While Fire Emblem has a straightforward weapon triangle of strengths and weaknesses to consider, Veil of the Witch takes this a step further with weapons and armour types with paired affinities. That means that heavy armour is weak to axes, leather armour is weak to swords, and cloth armour is weak to spears and bows. Besides that, some larger creatures will have different weaknesses depending on their positioning, and you’ll pour a lot of thought into where you’re going to send your team.</p>
<p>As you’d expect, there’s melee, ranged and magical attacks and support spells, as well as unique moves for each character. For all of these traditional trappings, the roguelike progression, and multiple runs into this fantasy world really do bring a newfound sense of freshness to the tactical action. Part of that comes down to decisions.</p>
<p>Every time your characters level up, you’re given two possible upgrades to equip them with, so you have to decide between better defence and improved attack, or enhanced movement and increased critical hit chance. Each run, there’s a chance to build them differently, and having that extra sword to spin makes Veil of the Witch consistently compelling.</p>

<p>Alongside levelling up, there’s further choices to be made following each battle. Here you can choose your route through the world, with an indication of the type of reward you’ll gain for heading in that direction,</p>
<p>Despite the repeated trips through the game world, there’s a story to be told, with Sable, the titular Eidolon, using your crew to further her own shadowy motives, bringing you back from the dead over and over again. While Veil of the Witch is often a little worthy, and there’s a lot of thou, thee and verily in the dialogue, you start to find the characters quietly endearing, learning more about them as you progress, often via one-to-one conversations back at your base.</p>
<p>Once again, that brings the Fire Emblem comparisons come even closer, but the feel and tone of Veil of the Witch is fundamentally very different from Intelligent Systems’ iconic franchise, and it absolutely stands as its own thing. It draws you in far more effectively than you might be expecting, and if you’re looking for a tactical RPG that is a little more respectful of your time, Veil of the Witch fits the bill perfectly.</p>

<p>Runs probably do run longer than you’d expect for the Roguelite genre. You’ll find battlefields that you thought you were finishing up suddenly beset by reinforcements, or small skirmishes where enemy fighters are repeatedly resurrected. These extend your time in certain battles, slowing your progress, especially when you’re facing an almost inevitable death. Equally, there’s as much challenge and depth to each encounter as you’ll find in the best of the genre, and there’s plenty of variation to the way that battles play out, with different conditions changing things up. Overall, I’d rather have the thoughtful, engaging strategy, rather than it becoming a frantic jog through multiple encounters.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a>'s battle against the bot farmers continues with a series of backend updates from EA. Amongst other things, the developers have reversed some "unintended" changes to XP progression and balance, and removed bots from "verified" modes available through the Portal editor.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Last week, the developers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-is-getting-updates-to-speed-up-xp-progression-and-unlocks-as-ea-tackle-plague-of-bot-farmers">announced</a> that they were taking action against players who'd created matches simply to murder computer-controlled soldiers en masse for easy XP. The argument being that Battlefield 6's servers are filling up with XP factories, making it harder for players to find the weird and wonderful mode variations that Portal is supposed to be for. 
</p>
<p>
As ever, the counterargument is that there might be fewer bot-processing joints and more flights of Battle-whimsy in Portal if the game's progression system were less annoying. I didn't find it particularly annoying during my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-review">pre-release time with multiplayer</a>, but then again, I'm not very competitive-minded and was in no hurry to unlock any of those fancy scopes. Too busy lying on my back, enjoying the deep blue sky over Gibraltar (while bleeding out).
</p>
<p>
I neglected to note in the previous story that Battlefield Studios have a more straightforward monetary interest, of course, in stopping people short-circuiting the XP system. Battlefield 6 is a live service game with a forthcoming battle pass and options to pay for XP and tier skips. It's harder to sell those special editions and Double XP boosters if people can accelerate the grind on custom servers.
</p><p>
Here's an update on their attempts to remedy the situation from Battlefield's social accounts. "We have organized a series of changes to emphasize our commitment to highlighting the player community and making this a space where you can celebrate creativity, find unique experiences, play with friends, and build communities.
</p>
<p>
"As part of this effort, we've rolled out several backend updates to support healthier matchmaking and better overall experiences in Portal. This includes resolving unintended systems that affected XP progression and balance across experiences, and for now, removing bots from Verified Experiences to help improve the overall quality of matches."
</p>
<p>
Verified experiences are a more curated and grounded selection of Portal modes that mostly let you twiddle with the settings of Breakthrough, Conquest, and Rush. Unlike other custom modes, these modes award full XP, so you can see why EA would be keen to do away with botfarming in verified experiences.
</p>
<p>
EA have now introduced a change whereby you'll need to disable "bot backfill" if you want full XP gain in a verified mode. Any verified experiences that have bot backfill will need to be unpublished and republished with the change. 
</p>
<p>
"Servers, including persistent ones, may occasionally need to be restarted," the developers add. "These brief interruptions may continue until ongoing improvements are fully implemented."
</p>
<p>
The first season of Battlefield 6's live seasonal seasonings <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-first-post-launch-season-of-updates-will-add-two-new-modes-then-get-very-cold">begins on 28th October</a>. It introduces a new map, some extra guns, a new mode, and a paid battle pass for those who partake.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sometimes, you have to immediately talk about a game trailer you’ve seen. This is one of those times. During the Galaxies Steam Fest showcase, Team17 dropped a brand new announcement and reveal trailer for Rockbeasts, a band management sim, that looks to take the spirit of Bojack Horseman and Adult Swim and apply it to the world of MTV-era music management. It looks utterly brilliant, so, first things first, go have a look at it.</p>
<p><iframe title="ROCKBEASTS | Gameplay Trailer 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DV4ULIZ6qyw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The immediate thing we obviously have to talk about is the cast of creatures. Fish bassists, deer guitarists, ostrich front-animals, and rabbit drummers adorn the artwork for the game, and their look gives you an impression of the irreverent take the team are going for. There’s lots of rock-centric attitude, plenty of drama, and some rhythm-action in there too, which has put it right to the top of my radar.</p>
<p>Coming from Polish two-man team Lichtund, the game aims to chart the highs and lows of being in a band, working your way through dive bars and tiny venues through to headlining your own stadium tour. That’s a very dry and basic task though, and you have to cope with ego-stroking, spoiled brats and a lot of sticky venues.</p>
<p>Key Features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Manage Resources Managing Time (turn-based game)</li>
<li>Do Quests and Side Quests</li>
<li>Level up and get sweet gear</li>
<li>Customize your band and instruments</li>
<li>Plan and play Concerts (what songs you’ll play, what gear you’ll use (from smoke machines to disco balls, we’ve got it all), and even how the band will look on stage)</li>
<li>Unlock New Songs (a full soundtrack recorded in a studio and performed by the voice actors)</li>
<li>Experience branching narratives across 17 episodes where your choices make a difference</li>
<li>No two playthroughs are the same!</li>
</ul>
<p>This awesome-looking dark comedy has been written by acclaimed video game writer Jakub Szamałek (Senior writer on The Witcher 3, Principal Writer of Cyberpunk 2077, and the upcoming The Blood of Dawnwalker). It’s also fully voiced and features some very recognisable voices, including the iconic Iggy Pop.</p>
<p>It’s available to wishlist on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1445880/ROCKBEASTS/?hsCtaAttrib=210178644193">Steam</a>, PlayStation and Xbox right now, with Nintendo Switch listings coming soon!</p>

<p>Now, the company is back at it again. In a new announcement, <a href="https://stability.ai/news/stability-ai-and-ea-partner-to-reimagine-game-development?utm_source=x&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=SAI+x+EA+">Stability AI</a> (of which acclaimed movie creator James Cameron is part of its board of directors) has confirmed that it has entered into a new partnership with EA to "co-develop transformative generative AI models, tools, and workflows that empower EA’s artists, designers, and developers to reimagine how games are made".</p><div><figure data-videoid="r2Zh6lJRTak" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2Zh6lJRTak?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r2Zh6lJRTak?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r2Zh6lJRTak?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed62bd51inolgk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>As part of the announcement, Stability AI said the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"EA and Stability AI are both trailblazers in their respective fields. For more than 40 years, EA has led through technological shifts across interactive entertainment, redefining what is possible for its global community of players.</p>
<p>"With the launch of Stable Diffusion, the most widely used image model in history, Stability AI transformed how visual media is created and put generative AI in the hands of millions of creators. This partnership combines EA’s leadership in interactive entertainment with Stability AI’s unparalleled technical expertise in generative AI.</p>
<p>"Together, we’re opening new creative frontiers that will shape how EA designs, builds, and brings experiences to players around the world."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, over on EA's website, the company states that with "humans at the center of storytelling, we’re evolving how we work so that AI becomes a trusted ally". It stresses that AI will primarily accelerate workflows, enable faster iterations, and expand creative possibilities – whatever that means.</p>
<p>In an effort to potentially lessen the backlash that this news will inevitably generate (chortle!), EA said that AI "can draft, generate, and analyze, but it can’t imagine, empathize, or dream", and that it is up to the human mind to drive true creativity.</p>
<p>Even so, we can't imagine this announcement will go down too well with many folks. The company is well known for its sports games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-fc-26">EA SPORTS FC 26</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/ea-sports-madden-nfl-26">Madden NFL 26</a>, but has also helped produce intriguing adventure titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tales_of_kenzera_zau">Tales of Kenzera: ZAU</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Is Doing Better in Japan Thanks to Growing Importance of PC, Phil Spencer Says]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-doing-better-japan/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-is-doing-better-in-japan-thanks-to-growing-importance-of-pc-phil-spencer-says.1333765/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Although the perception of Xbox is at an all-time low, the brand is doing better in Japan, a region that is notoriously one of the worst for Microsoft's video gaming division</p>



<p>Speaking with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/55776">Japanese publication Famitsu</a> during the recent Beyond the Strand event celebrating Kojima Productions' 10th anniversary, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer commented on Xbox's performance in Japan.</p>



<p>In the past year, the total playtime across the entire ecosystem has increased by around 20%. Although no exact figure has been confirmed, Spencer specified that the playtime growth is balanced between console, PC, and cloud. However, much of this total playtime increase is due to the increasing importance of the PC market in Japan.</p>



<p>To further boost Xbox's market share in Japan, Microsoft is planning to provide more content for Japanese players. Spencer confirmed that the publisher is currently talking with different partners while it is continuing to maintain a close relationship with Japanese developers like CAPCOM, Square Enix, SEGA, Bandai Namco Entertainment and Konami.</p>



<p>Speaking about the company's future in terms of hardware, Phil Spencer reiterated once again to Famitsu that <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-xbox-console-will-be-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience-says-ceo/">a new Xbox console is coming</a>, though he offered no additional details. However, the recent release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-this-is-an-xbox/">ROG Xbox Ally</a> provides an indication of the company's strategy, which aims to connect multiple devices under the Xbox platform.</p>



<p>Xbox's renewed focus on the Japanese market is no surprise. The company is attempting to cater more to the region's audience by setting the next entry in one of its hallmark franchises, <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-is-coming-to-pc-xbox-consoles-in-2026/">Forza Horizon 6</a>, in Japan and publishing games developed by Japanese studios, such as the highly anticipated <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-4-bathed-in-blood/">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, which ended the series' long hiatus. Hopefully, the attention on the Japanese market will bring back other Japanese franchises that have been left dormant for a while.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>'s true ending didn't feel totally slam dunk satisfying to me in its 1.0 release form, and developers Supergiant Games seem to have agreed with those sorts of assessments. Hence, in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a>'s first proper post-launch patch they've just put out as a Steam preview, some "true ending enhancements" being rolled out like a boon from a sassy god.</p>
<p>Shameless plug alert, if you want to read my full thoughts on that 1.0 version, you can read <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-10-review">this here review</a>. The short version is that it's good.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Anyway, enough of that, let's dive into <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/505090299391902119?l=english">the notes</a> for this post-launch first patch preview. "The Patch 1 Preview represents a work-in-progress whose contents may evolve, and some text translations are still in progress," Supergiant wrote. "We do not have a release date for the full patch."</p>
<p>In terms of their true ending tweaks, the studio say they've added some extra events with key characters you'll run into both before and after completing Melinoë's task. Bits of the ending scenes before the credits roll have also been "revised", while one change I can't say I'm necessarily a fan of is that the number of times you'll need to clear the underworld run before getting the final ending has gone up. On one hand, it'll ensure you get more chances to see these new scenes, but on the other, I fear it might feel a bit like padding in a game that's already treading a thin line in that regard towards the end.</p><p>Alongside those ending tweaks, Supergiant have added in a cauldron incantation which lets you go back in time and replay previous story beats, which is handy since it means I won't have to start from scratch to take in the revamped finale. "A number of character-related Prophecies, including the one connected to the story epilogue, should unfold faster than before," reads another of the patch's headline changes, while the decor you can buy for the crossroads now costs less spirit kudos points. Phew, no more lofty rug prices.</p>
<p>In terms of the usual bug fixes and balance adjustments, only one of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nocturnal">Nocturnal</a> Arms has had an aspect tweaked, that being the Witch's Staff's ability to burn folks when imbued with Hestia's smoulder ring cast boon. The boon and blessing specific tweaks are more numerous and a few bosses have had their hitboxes and effects adjusted.</p>
<p>There's more in the full notes, and if you want to give this preview a go, Supergiant have included instructions on how to opt into its Steam beta after backing up your saves.</p>

		<p>For Fallout Day, Bethesda Game Studios brought some updates on the Fallout franchise and mark some of the milestones that the series has passed. In particular, to celebrate its 10th anniversary, the company announced: Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition will arrive on 10th November (and 2026 for Switch 2!), and there’s a physical 15th anniversary bundle for Fallout New Vegas on the way as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tWVT9eYOPas?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Similar to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/19/skyrim-anniversary-edition-ps5-free-upgrade-xbox-series-x-s-pc-ps4/">Skyrim: Anniversary Edition from 2021</a>,&nbsp;<strong><em>Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</em></strong> bundles the game and all its official add-ons together with over 150 mods of Creation Club content, looking to create a curated ultimate collaboration between the original developers and the community.</p>
<p>Creations are coming to Fallout 4 broadly through the new in-game Creations menu, which will make it easier to discover and download more mods as well.</p>
<p>The Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition is coming to Xbox Series X|S, PS5, Xbox One, PS4, and PC this year, with a Switch 2 release set for 2026. There will also be an Anniversary Upgrade for existing platforms, and Game Pass and PS Plus subscribers will also have upgrade options.</p>

<p>Another anniversary is being celebrated for Fallout: New Vegas, which is turning 15 this year. There’s no new port of the game (sadly), but Bethesda has created a new physical Fallout: New Vegas 15th Anniversary Bundle, which is probably already out of stock on the Bethesda Gear Store.</p>
<p>The bundle includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fallout: New Vegas: Ultimate Edition PC Code</strong></li>
<li><strong>Victor Statue (8″ PVC):</strong> The friendly Securitron stands tall and is ready to roll</li>
<li><strong>Doc Mitchell’s Evaluation Cards (8×8 cardstock set):</strong> Straight from your first moments in Goodsprings, a true piece of New Vegas history</li>
<li><strong>Vault Boy Enamel Pin (1.5″):</strong> Vault Boy stacks the odds with poker chips in hand</li>
<li><strong>Mojave Express Patch (3.5″ × 1.9″):</strong> Woven, iron-on, and full of wasteland charm</li>
<li><strong>NCR Recon Patch (3.25″ × 3.5″):</strong> Woven, iron-on insignia of the New California Republic’s finest</li>
<li><strong>Collector’s Big Box:</strong> A throwback-style display box created exclusively for the anniversary</li>
</ul>
<p>And then there’s Fallout 76, with more details on the Burning Springs update which will arrive on 2nd December, and introduce a new region in Ohio where you’ll battle the Rust King and desert Deathclaws.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fallout 76: Burning Springs Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JJ_SER3SwSQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In good news for this game, native PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions are on the way for next year.</p>
<p>And finally, Fallout Shelter is getting new updates in the form of Seasons:</p>
<p>“Inspired by Vault-Tec’s experiments, Seasons introduces limited-time Vaults to the game that are completely separate from your original Vault. Each Season will have a unique theme, bringing new challenges and rewards as players hit different milestones.”</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pacific-drive">Pacific Drive</a> has finally come to Xbox and it's also been added to Game Pass, available to those who sub to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium, or PC Game Pass. In addition, Xbox players can also check out the Whispers in the Woods expansion which also launched today.</p>
<p>The base game, which itself is a lovely and mysterious roadtrip well-worth playing, is available for those with Game Pass, though the Whispers in the Woods expansion must be bought separately for £12.49 / €14.99 / $14.99. You'll also be able to buy that for PS5 and PC, which each recieved the base game back in February, 2024.</p>
<p>The expansion got a release date trailer last night <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-in-the-jam-packed-autumn-edition-of-the-galaxies-showcase">during the Galaxies Showcase</a>, which you can watch yourself below.

In our annual round-up, the game was described as such by editor Chris Tapsell: "One of this year's most unique games, but also one that seems to tap right into the zeitgeist: weird physics, gallows humour, masochistism, and a requirement to press on regardless."</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-increases-price-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-despite-record-subscription-profits-last-year">Game Pass recently received a price hike</a>, as well as a change to the tiers of subscriptions themselves, all while Xbox recorded record subscription revenue.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-za-sells-5-8-million-units-debut-week/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-sells-5-8-million-units-in-debut-week.1333738/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This morning, The Pokémon Company has announced that the latest installment in the monster-catching series, Pokémon Legends: Z-A, has sold 5.8 million units in its debut week, with Nintendo confirming that around half of those sales were on the Nintendo Switch 2. </p>



<p>While still a very good sales performance, it lags a bit behind compared to the first Pokémon Legends, Arceus, which launched in early 2022 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-arceus-sales-reach-6-5-million-holds-1-position-in-uk-boxed-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold 6.5 million units in its first week on the market</a>.</p>



<p>We <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pokemon-legends-z-a-urban-renewal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently posted Wccftech's review of the game</a>, penned by Nathan Birch, who rated the game 8.5 out of 10. Here's a summary of his time with this new Pokémon Legends:</p>



<p><em>The Pokémon Legends: Z-A campaign is a bit lighter than some other entries in the series, as you'll be able to complete the story in around 20 hours if you're really galloping toward the finish line. Of course, you could easily spend two to three times that (or more) if you really want to Catch 'em All and tie up everything the game has to offer. As is usually the case with this franchise, you get out of this Poké Ball what you put into it.</em></p>



<p><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the most cohesive, thoughtfully-constructed Pokémon RPG of the HD era. Some may miss the more expansive world of something like Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, but this game's top-notch new combat mechanics, solid gameplay loop, and refreshing level of polish makes it fairly easy to overlook its compact map. Pokémon Legends: Z-A feels like a great new foundation to build on and I'm excited to see how the series evolves next.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/defect-immersive-squad-based-cyberpunk-shooter-impressive-gameplay/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/defect-an-immersive-squad-based-cyberpunk-shooter-gets-first-impressive-gameplay.1333735/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>During the Galaxies Gaming Showcase, independent studio emptyvessel has unveiled the first gameplay footage of its debut title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/immersive-shooter-defect-announced-by-emptyvessel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DEFECT</a>. </p>



<p>The team, <a href="https://wccftech.com/aaa-gaming-veterans-found-two-new-studios-called-giant-skull-and-emptyvessel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founded by two former id Software developers</a>, provided an impressive demonstration of this immersive squad-based cyberpunk-themed first-person shooter game. According to emptyvessel, DEFECT is set in a futuristic, divided city where players battle it out in a world ruled by an enigmatic AI known as 'THE SYSTEM', while ruthless gangs and rogue law enforcement vie for supremacy. Players will choose from a selection of dangerous factions, including THE SYSTEM's own policing force, rogue police elements, and gangs vying for power. They will compete to achieve objectives such as smuggling guns, assassinating or kidnapping targets (including players), or arresting suspects. </p>



<p>Every mission in DEFECT is said to be different, whether you’re acting as the law, the lawless, or somewhere in between. Your choices determine how you play the game with friends in single-player, PvP, or co-op multiplayer modes. Squads of four players compete to complete multiple open-ended objectives and acquire valuable items and enhancements that can turn the tide of battle. The inevitable chaos means that no firefight ever ends the same way twice.</p>



<p>The game doesn't feature automatically regenerating health, unlike most recent shooters, so players must find health stations to heal themselves if they’re going to stay in the fight. These health stations generally have three charges. As seen in the trailer, DEFECT features extensive environmental destructibility, including multiple layers of destruction on each wall and item, and features such as dynamic dust that fills the room the more you destroy. This can be used strategically to reduce visibility in a space if you have equipment such as tactical goggles or to escape a dangerous situation quickly. Environmental interaction also includes players being able to flip tables and similar stuff to create cover and/or block paths.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>emptyvessel founder and game director Emanuel Palalic said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>Our entire emptyvessel team is incredibly excited to show off this first look at gameplay in DEFECT as we’ve poured a ton of passion and time into crafting the game’s tone, atmosphere, and underlying systems. DEFECT is a HUD-less immersive shooter where any wall can be destroyed, gadgets and tools completely redefine how you approach combat, and every weapon or ammo type affects the world, interactables, and enemies in unique ways. The world is filled with emergent moments and dynamic branching narratives that react to player actions in real time.</em></p>



<p>Earlier this year, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/empty-vessel-closes-its-series-a-funding-for-defect-with-11-million-total-raised-single-player-support-and-console-launch-added-to-development-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">covered the news</a> that emptyvessel had raised $11 million in Series A funding <a href="https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-invests-in-defect-indie-developer-empty-vessel-to-help-get-defect-over-the-finish-line/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from NCSOFT</a>, 1AM Gaming, and Black Phoenix Games, to finish the game and add single player mode and console launches. However, it seems like DEFECT is currently only available for wishlisting on PC stores, like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2470010/DEFECT/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/defect-dde0e6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/defect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GOG</a>. Those store pages actually provide interesting information, including the game's system requirements (which we added below) and the confirmation that it will come with a level editor and LAN multiplayer co-op/PvP support. DEFECT does not have a release window yet.</p>

			<p>During yesterday's Galaxies Gaming Showcase, French developer Tactical Adventures announced the early access release window for Solasta II. The sequel to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/solasta-crown-of-the-magister-tactics-dragons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2021's turn-based tactical role-playing game</a> will be available on PC in early 2026 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2975950/Solasta_II/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Steam</a>, though details such as pricing and the estimated early access period haven't been shared yet. The studio had <a href="https://wccftech.com/solasta-ii-announced-powered-by-unreal-engine-5-early-access-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally planned to launch this year</a>, but there has been a small delay.</p>



<p>Unlike the first game, which was powered by Unity, Solasta II features much better visuals thanks to the switch to Unreal Engine 5. You can still get a taste of that in the two-hour demo available on Steam. The downside to the engine change is that it likely won't be as moddable; the previous installment featured a level editor that brought forth a wealth of user-generated content, such as whole new adventures for players to enjoy.</p>



<p>In this sequel, which is still based on the Dungeons &amp; Dragons SRD 5.1 ruleset, players will embark on a quest driven by family legacy to the faraway continent of Neokos, where the ancient and enigmatic Shadwyn (voiced by Amelia Tyler, the narrator of Baldur's Gate 3) is corrupting the land. </p>

<p>According to Tactical Adventures, Solasta II stays true to its promise of delivering gameplay based on the world's most popular tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG): Dungeons and Dragons. But that's not all that Solasta II will have to offer. This new instalment will also allow players to roam freely across the lands of Neokos, exploring and uncovering the map as they wish. </p>



<p>The studio has promised to show off the new in-game overworld map for traveling between areas and answer fans' questions in a special Community Stream that will air on Tuesday, October 28, at 10 AM Pacific Time (1 PM Eastern Time, 6 PM CET) via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TacticalAdventures/streams" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/tacticaladventures" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitch</a>.</p>

<p>"A brand new, original story-led adventure"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Bluey, the popular Australian animation for children, is <a href="https://www.bluey.tv/blog/blueys-quest-for-the-gold-pen-video-game-arrives-december/">getting a new video game</a> on the Switch and Switch 2 in 2026.</p>
<p>It's officially titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/blueys-quest-for-the-gold-pen">Bluey's Quest for the Gold Pen</a> and is an "original story-led adventure game" by the show's creator Joe Brumm. Halfbrick – the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psvita/fruit_ninja">Fruit Ninja</a> studio based in Bluey's hometown of Brisbane – will be bringing this title to Nintendo platforms and other systems in partnership with PM Studios.</p>
<p>This new game, "inspired by the hand-drawn worlds of the Dragon and Escape episodes" invites players to unlock Bluey's drawings, which are brought to real life by the Heeler family. It blends "heartfelt storytelling with discovery-driven gameplay".</p>
<p>All up, there'll be nine adventure-filled levels to work through - from snowy mountains, golden beaches, to lush green forests and even the Aussie outback. Along the way, players can uncover treasures, solve puzzles, and embark on magical mini quests as they "glide, fly, and skate" through the world.</p>
<p>The initial launch for Apple devices is taking place this December, with the console and PC release to follow next year.</p>
