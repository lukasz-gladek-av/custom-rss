		<p>Having been announced under the codename Project Defiant, Sony has now revealed more about the FlexStrike wireless fight stick. The stick is still in development, but will be viewable at Evo 2025 in Las Vegas, building up to a release in 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="FlexStrike Wireless Fight Stick - Features Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TTGmg6uYXKc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The FlexStrike is compatible with both PS5 and PC, using either a wired connection or their ultra-low latency PlayStation Link USB dongle. The fight stick has mechanical switch buttons with toolless swappable restrictor gates – there are square, circle, and octagon restrictor gates that can be kept within storage compartments for the gates and the USB adapter. Additionally, the stick will come with a handy sling carry case, so you can take it wherever you need to get some fighting done. Digitally.</p>
<p>There’s some good quality of life features around all of this. That PlayStation Link dongle is an updated version of the one that shipped with the Pule Elite and Pule Explore headset and earbuds, now with USB-C – it’s not entirely clear if the original dongle will get a firmware update, but we’d expect it to. One dongle allows for simultaneous fight stick and audio use, and on PS5, one dongle will let two fight sticks connect for couch multiplayer.</p>
<p>The control inputs can be customised with a built-in lever mode switch for directional input tweaks, and a lock button to prevent accidental inputs and layout changes in a match.</p>

<p>While the FlexStrike has got many of the same game inputs as found on the DualSense controller, and has a touchpad, there will be software support to let it run at the same time as a DualSense controller, if you’d rather use the gamepad for menu navigation.</p>

			<p>One of PlayStation's announcements during its Summer Game Fest-timed State of Play was the introduction of a new wireless fight stick from the company, announced at the time under the name "<em><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-announces-project-defiant-a-wireless-fight-stick-for-ps5-and-pc/">Project Defiant</a></em>." Today, in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/28/new-details-on-playstations-first-wireless-fight-stick-flexstrike/">PlayStation Blog</a> post, the official name for the fight stick, FlexStrike, was revealed, along with a new trailer showcasing its features and the news that it'll be out sometime next year. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>Compatible with PS5 or PC via a wired connection or wirelessly with PlayStation Link, our innovative ultra-low latency wireless technology, FlexStrike wireless fight stick features mechanical switch buttons and toolless swappable restrictor gates,"</em> writes Edwin Foo, vice president of product development at Sony. "<em>These include square, circle, and octagon restrictor gates that fit into the fight stick’s built-in storage compartments alongside the included PS Link USB adapter."</em></p>



<p>You'll be able to use it wirelessly with a USB-A dongle in the front or back of your PS5 or PC, or use it with a wired USB-C connection. You can have a DualSense controller connected to your PS5 simultaneously with the FlexStrike, to help navigate menus better, and as the trailer shows off, its wireless connection is Sony's new PlayStation Link, which is how all its most recent wireless peripherals connect to PS5 and PS5 Pro consoles. </p>



<p>It'll be at EVO 2025, but if you're at the event, you won't be able to try it. PlayStation says it'll be there "<em>on display only</em>," so you can get a look at it and the carrying case it comes with when visiting the Arc System Works booth. More details on when players will actually be able to get their hands on it will probably arrive closer to its actual release date, sometime in 2026. </p>



<p>PlayStation has had a firm hand in the fighting game community for years, but this is the first time it is making its own fight stick for players to use. Whenever players do get their hands on it, especially the pros that might consider bringing it to EVO, it'll be interesting to see if it can usurp the fight sticks and gamepads they already prefer.</p>

Itch.io quietly updated its list of banned content over the weekend with the following section on adult games:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The following is a non-exhaustive list of prohibited themes present in card processing networks. We are unable to support the sale of any works containing these topics:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Non-consensual content (real or implied)</li><li>Underage or “barely legal” themes</li><li>Incest or pseudo-incest content</li><li>Bestiality or animal-related</li><li>Rape, coercion, or force-related</li><li>Sex trafficking implications</li><li>Revenge porn / voyeur / hidden cam</li><li>Fetish involving bodily waste or extreme harm (e.g., “scat,” “vomit”)</li></ul></blockquote><p>Developers can appeal individual bans, but with thousands of listings removed and someone needing to actually play each individual title to adjudicate claims, that process seems all but unworkable in the short term. “It’s almost impossible to come up with an exhaustive list of unacceptable products to sell, so often we have to take content reviews one at a time,” Itchi.io writes on the site. “If an issue arises with your account that isn’t already covered by our policy, then we will contact you and share what options you may have.”<br></p><p>While Steam has also banned hundreds of games revolving around rape or incest in response to pressure from Visa, Mastercard, and other payment processors. Itch.io has gone much further in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/itch-io-nsfw-porn-games-delisted-collective-shout-1851786841&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/itch-io-nsfw-porn-games-delisted-collective-shout-1851786841">nuking “NSFW” content</a></span> from the store.

Itch.io made the decision to remove all NSFW content,” it wrote <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.collectiveshout.org/steam_campaign_history?fbclid=IwY2xjawL0QDxleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFFZ3B4WlJTSDJscFhOalplAR6uwODqdp3uydYui8kfSDKbn0M9XVd7IahVz0CP_LKIt9CuXBnsmjIuE-qSRw_aem_xj1j_AxgE0x_j0VgHW7dKw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.collectiveshout.org/steam_campaign_history?fbclid=IwY2xjawL0QDxleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFFZ3B4WlJTSDJscFhOalplAR6uwODqdp3uydYui8kfSDKbn0M9XVd7IahVz0CP_LKIt9CuXBnsmjIuE-qSRw_aem_xj1j_AxgE0x_j0VgHW7dKw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in an update on July 28</a></span>. “Our objections were to content that involved sexualized violence and torture of women.”</p><p>One of the game’s pulled from Itch.io is a relationship sim called <em>Love’s Heart</em>. “A game that takes you inside a lesbian academy, where over the course of 10 main story chapters, you’ll help your kemonomimi roommate, Katsune, search for the Love’s Heart, a magical gem said to grant any wish,” reads the description. According to its creator, it includes the option for incestual relationships between characters but doesn’t not demand it. It remains available on Steam but was one of those games purged from Itch.io last week. </p><p>“This completely destroys me—so many games published with love on this platform, and now they won’t reach anyone new,” wrote<em> Love’s Heart</em> creator Capky Games <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://itch.io/blog/993219/all-nsfw-games-removed-from-search-listings&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://itch.io/blog/993219/all-nsfw-games-removed-from-search-listings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a blog post</a></span> last week. “I don’t have an audience elsewhere; I depend on itch.io to grow.

But the real magic is in the card’s presentation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The artwork gives off a stunning look of pure chaos featuring storm clouds, jagged cliffs, and Hydreigon descending like a triple-headed demon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">We've been covering Mafia: The Old Country in an exclusive way all month long through our IGN First "cover story." We hope you've enjoyed the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-9-minutes-of-exclusive-gameplay-ign-first">gameplay</a> and our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-exclusive-hands-on-preview-ign-first">hands-on preview</a>. Today we have the pleasure of talking to Hangar 13 studio president Nick Baynes and game director Alex Cox about returning the Mafia series to its not-open-world roots, which games The Old Country takes design inspiration from, the plentiful amount of fruit found throughout the upcoming prequel, and more. The following is a transcript of the video interview above that has been lightly edited for clarity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: Nick, I wanted to start here because I got to talk to you in person last week when I did get to play the game and something that jumped out at me just from our idle conversation was more than once, you mentioned your desire to see players complete this story. And so I'm curious, did your telemetry show you that wasn't the case with Mafia III?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hangar 13 Studio President Nick Baynes</strong>: Not so much. It's more, I suppose, anecdotal, the fact that the nature of the type of game that we are making, and if you look at the other Mafia games that were maybe a bit more focused and based much more around a story that had a very clear linear path through it. I think naturally a lot of people completed those and we have a lot of feedback from people who, you see all the reaction videos online of people completing those games when they play it. And I think that's a really powerful thing. And I think both as a player of games myself and as listening to the fans, people like finishing these stories and the way that we tell the stories, they're designed to be completed. I think we are really, really proud of the story we're telling and the whole narrative arc and the development of the characters through the story. So yeah, I guess where we're coming from, it's not necessarily a specifically data-driven thing. It's just we're telling stories and I think every storyteller wants someone to find out how their story ends.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: You've both talked about this decision that you've just alluded to again here of pulling back from going more of an open world route as Mafia III did to a more linear, narrative-focused story as with the first two games. Alex, I'd love to hear from you, what drove that decision?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mafia: The Old Country Game Director Alex Cox</strong>: Well, actually it was the response to Mafia Definitive Edition in a lot of ways. We got the response to that game. One of the responses was, "Hey, it is great to get to the end of the game because it's a little shorter than Mafia III was and see the ending." So that kind of triggered ... We got a response from the remake that that was the kind of Mafia game that a lot of players wanted to play, and it sort of led us down that road is when we were thinking about what was next for the franchise, what was the next kind of game we wanted to build? Obviously we were going through a big engine revision as well for this game too so we wanted to keep it quite focused on what we think Mafia does best, which is telling great stories. So yeah, that's how all of that kind of came together. It was really the response to ... Yeah, it was the response to remake.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: And I suppose from a design standpoint, it certainly changes your mindset a ton. And Nick, from more of a studio level perspective, it maybe shortens the timeline a bit too as opposed to doing more of a full open world thing. So I guess what I'm trying to say is there are probably a lot of benefits that come out of this that are not the original thing you're going for. You're making a creative decision, but it seems like there are a lot of happy side effects from it too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, the biggest side effect of it's not so much about how long it takes to make it. It's more about the fact that the things that you are doing, you're more focused on and you can devote more time to really pushing the quality and making sure that it's a real polished gem, that everything in the game has had the right amount of attention spent on it to make sure that everything the player encounters feels really, really high quality and that we get to deliver what we want to do. And I think sometimes just generally as developers, you want to focus on everything, but you have to make choices and prioritize, and naturally the more focused you're getting, the more you can actually polish everything. So that's very much a key thing about that whole kind of ... I use the expression polished gem as absolutely something we've referred to throughout development in terms of our focus and how we wanted to focus on this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex</strong>: I mean, that was the formula for Mafia I and Mafia II as well, and that was the design principle that we wanted to return to. Both of those games were ... I'm talking about the remake of Mafia II, but probably applies to the original game as well back in 2002. But when we are talking about a highly choreographed, high quality action adventure game with a linear story, with this beautiful wild backdrop or however you want to refer to it, that's the formula that we wanted to revisit. And I think as Nick mentioned there, the amount of time and attention that we're putting into the cinematic presentation, the action adventure gameplay is much higher than games that really focus on a broader sort of breadth of [gameplay].</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: The gaming community responded incredibly positively to the news that you guys were kind of going back to that more narrative linear focus from the first two games, and there was a really positive reception, certainly gamers are happy when they hear that the game is going to cost a little less than they might've initially expected. It's a $50 price point for you guys, and I know the price is ultimately set by your publisher at 2K, but I suppose the one maybe ... concern's probably too strong a word, but just maybe slight defensive worry that I think is natural from a lot of gamers is that, "Oh, well this must mean The Old Country is really short." Now, I know you guys probably don't want to sit here and give a number for how many hours this game is because then people just attach good or bad things to that. But I guess would you like to address any of those sort of defensive concerns about "getting your money's worth?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So I think the first thing is, I mean, again, obviously we're not going to give an exact number and partly that it's obviously different for every single player. But generally speaking, if you think of Mafia I, Mafia II, that's roughly the same scope and scale as this game, and I think hopefully, I don't think anyone's going to be disappointed if they're going into it with that expectation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like you say, really as developers, we don't really think about the price point. We just focus on making the best game possible. But this game, I feel like it drips AAA quality. When you play the game, I don't think anyone's going to play this game and feel that, "Oh, this is a lower budget game." It looks incredible, it plays really well. There's all the depth you'd expect in terms of dialogue and the world that has been created around the players and the experience they go through. So I think really no one needs to be concerned about the quality of the game or anything like that, or it being super short. I mean, I saw someone online when we announced the price saying something like, "Oh, I bet it's like three hours." It's not three hours, but going into it expecting a Mafia I, Mafia II style experience, I think everyone's going to be super happy.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: I really get the sense, and again, you guys have kind of already almost said it here directly, that Mafia I really is kind of the touchstone or the North Star for this project because of that reception that you mentioned to the definitive edition. Can you speak to that of how the reception to the remake of the first game energized the team and drove the creativity for this one?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex</strong>: Yeah, it's funny actually because when we came to do the remake, what we did is we actually channeled the design philosophy, the creative approach of Mafia II to the remake, to the original Mafia. So if you know what I mean, we structured it in the same way we presented the chapters in a very similar kind of way to Mafia II. So it was kind of like, what would the original Mafia have looked like if it was remade through the creative lens of Mafia II? And so this project has been in a similar kind of way, taking inspiration from both of those titles. It's structured, as you mentioned, you mentioned chapters, for example. It's got a very similar structure to those games. That's how we divide up our story. Our story is, again, in a similar way to those two titles, spread over several years of time.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"It's set in the same universe, it's something that's going to be immediately familiar to players that want more Mafia, but it's moving forward in all aspects."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There's significant kind of changes through Enzo's journey. And in terms of what we wanted players to feel like is that while we've created a new Mafia game for a new generation of Mafia games, that it is very familiar on the pad, it's very familiar in terms of look and feel of the title. It's got narrative connections, it's set in the same universe, it's something that's going to be immediately familiar to players that want more Mafia, but it's moving forward in all aspects. It's visually cutting edge for games in 2025. We've moved gameplay forward in various ways from what we did in the past. And so yeah, it's like a restart for the franchise in many ways, but there's a lot of familiarity under the hood.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nick</strong>: I think also, just to add to that, and I don't always know how many people ... If people know too much about this, but there's real connective tissue here at Hangar 13 all the way back to the original Mafia. So we've got people here working on The Old Country that worked on Mafia I back in the early 2000s. We've got people who worked on Mafia II and all three all the way through including the definitive edition. So when we're talking about looking back to the first one, some of the team here actually worked on that first one. So we're not necessarily even looking at it to reference. I think each game is influenced by the last, what worked, what didn't work, how can we improve it?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other thing as well is we always starting any game, but obviously in particular a Mafia game, we look at what makes a Mafia game? What is it the players want? What do we think makes a Mafia game? And looking at all that collectively, and building on our experience. But like I was saying, it's really cool, it's not just people that joined recently, like myself, I joined seven, eight years ago. So I can look at the old game, say, "This is where it comes from." Whereas some people here actually look back and they worked on it, they've lived it since the late 90s really, when they first started working on it. So that's the other thing as well. There's this big through line, not just in terms of some of the narrative connections and some of the game features, but also with the team themselves, which is really awesome, I think.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: Now, Alex, you were talking about, I want to hear from both of you on this. I'm going to do the Sophie's Choice thing because I'm just curious. You're not allowed to say Mafia: The Old Country but what's each of your favorite game in the series so far?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex</strong>: Well, mine is [Mafia] II, but that's because that was the first game I worked on, so it's kind of imprinted itself on me. That was my first game. I worked in QA, I was originally a tester. My first game in development was on Mafia II...It was really hard back then with the limitations we had with obviously the graphical limitations and all that kind of stuff. But the first Mafia, when it first came out and I first saw it, it absolutely blew my mind. And then 20 years later, 18 years later, to get the chance of working on it myself with the definitive edition and seeing it reimagined, I just think that to me, it's got a really timeless classic story. I love the way it's structured. Yeah, I think that's my favorite.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nick</strong>: For me, it's [Mafia] 1, I think for two reasons. First reason is when it came out, it was just absolutely, I think, groundbreaking in terms of there's one or two games around that time which were pushing, bringing cinematic storytelling into games.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: So Alex, you hinted at this. You mentioned the engine a little while ago, and I wanted to kind of circle back on that because I've been playing Mafia since the beginning as well, and it's always been a beautiful game. And from what I've seen and had the privilege of playing now of Mafia: The Old Country, it's still very, very much is. You guys have moved from a proprietary engine to Unreal Engine 5, and I'm curious about the impetus behind that choice.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex</strong>: Well, Unreal, I think as many, many players will be familiar with now, brings an awful lot to new games, gives us cutting-edge visuals in particular. And for the kind of game we were looking to make this time around, we really, really wanted to put a massive emphasis on portraying the beauty of Sicily, the fantastic landscapes, plus the MetaHuman tech and all of the stuff that's really allowed us to do really, really top quality cinematic presentation. The performances of the actors are really, really fantastic. Amazing quality facial, and that's key to this Mafia game as it was for all previous Mafia games in their time of release and achieving that kind of let's say visual cutting edge in particular, environment art and cinematics, was really front of mind when we decided to make the transition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nick</strong>: And also going back to something we were saying earlier, it's about focus and focus on quality and focus on the content. When you're doing your own engine, that's a lot of time you have to spend and effort in making sure it's cutting edge and it still looks contemporary and you've got a lot of heavy lifting to do on that. And obviously as technology gets more and more ... As things get more and more advanced, that takes more and more time. And I think as a studio, we just really wanted to focus on the gameplay, the visuals, the storytelling, the cinematics, and to be able to put as much focus on that as opposed to actually creating the engine that it sits on, it really helps us and I think ultimately allows us to develop and deliver a better quality game.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"I think [the move to Unreal Engine 5] ultimately allows us to develop and deliver a better quality game."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: Was there a particular landscape or scene that you guys prototyped in Unreal Engine 5 to make sure that it was going to represent the visual quality that you wanted of the series? Because what visually I remember most or what stuck with me after playing your game for three hours is the landscapes. I mean, the characters look great, don't get me wrong there, no complaints for any of that. But it's that Sicilian landscape. That's really what kind of stuck with me. So I'm just curious, was there a little test area that you made to make sure that everybody at the studio was happy with where it was going to go technologically?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex</strong>: Yeah, it's funny actually because the first thing that we did right at the beginning of the project, and it was almost like the whole team moved to Unreal and we decided to come together around one exercise that we could all align behind. And that was creating the market square environment from Mafia II. Mafia II starts in Sicily, and actually our game is set in the same ... You see this town called San Celeste right at the beginning of Mafia II. We chose that for a whole wide variety of reasons. A, we already know what it looks like. B, we can see what it looks like when we've massively upgraded it like 15 years later. And also we know that at the pre-existing location from the franchise, we're going to channel the creative vision, we're going to channel the narrative universe. We're going to get all of the stuff in there by grounding ourself in that first place. So that's where we started, right in the center of San Celeste.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: Digging into the gameplay a little bit here, I've got a handful more questions for you guys. Stealth, we were talking before we recorded, I love stealth. And when I was playing Mafia: The Old Country, I took full advantage of the stealth opportunities that were presented to me. It seems like it is a fully supported combat play style choice, maybe not necessarily in every scenario. Sometimes you're going to have a one-on-one knife fight with somebody that's terrible and you're not going to stealth your way out of it. But what were the goals with implementing stealth into Mafia: The Old Country?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex</strong>: Mafia's got these ... We call it a roller coaster experience. Sometimes you play a choreographed shootout, sometimes it's a car chase, sometimes it's a stealth section, sometimes you get to choose, and stealth has been kind of a big part of the play your way kind of style of Mafia since Mafia II. It was in Mafia II a little bit. Mafia III became pretty much play your way all the way through. For Mafia: The Old Country, it was always going to be part of the formula.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The thing that's I think most pertinent to this game is because we wanted to make combat generally more feel more dangerous, we wanted to bring in a more grounded kind of feeling to any kind of encounter with enemies, we wanted to make sure that stealth really captured that vibe of surviving in a dangerous environment. So there's a heightened value to sneaking around and taking out a guard. And also that vibe of, well, Enzo is trying to survive in 1900 Sicily. It's kind of a resource port environment, you're having to loot and scrabble around for resources in combat, for example. Again, favoring a more deliberate gameplay style if you're going to stealth around and kind of take out a few enemies.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: I was really surprised just in a fun way, that Enzo's knife seems to be very important in the sort of combat loop of the game. You guys basically have a kind of whole knife RPG system down to the point where in my head I couldn't help thinking about it of you almost have to reload your knife like a gun when the blade dulls. You got to take a minute to sharpen it. So can you guys talk about the design choices of the knife and how that's really seems to be kind of doubled down on?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, I think the first thing is that Enzo, I think we already described elsewhere that Enzo comes from the mines. He's certainly had a very impoverished childhood. He's used to scrabbling around and making use of anything that comes to hand and being resourceful. So when we added the knife, we didn't just want it to be, oh, it's a melee item you can use and it's maybe a different takedown. It actually needed to feel like a real almost extension of Enzo, it's something that's really ... He's much more familiar with knives and sharp objects than he is with guns, for example. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So then it was like, well, okay, well if you've got a knife, what else would you do with it? And you'd pick locks and you'd throw it, and you also would do takedowns. And then the question is, well, it can't be to overpowered. Well, they're going to get blunted, so you need to sharpen them. And I think really that whole thing was not just having a weapon for the sake of it. Say, oh, we've added a knife as a melee item. It was much more this is key to who Enzo is and how he goes through the world and how he's grown up. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex</strong>: Yeah, I mean it came from the history of Sicilian criminals as well. That idea of a Sicilian criminal armed with a knife is sort of like part of the history of the Sicilian Mafia knife fighting, that is a kind of martial art in Sicily. And so there's a lot of grounding in the historical context of the story and the vision of ... Yeah, I mean particularly when it escalates into knife duals, Enzo versus bad guy on a kind of a sun-drenched hillside, like fighting to the death is a core angle that really sells the unique aspect of this game. What's the vision of title? It's grounded in that 1900 Sicily setting while still broadly speaking, playing like a Mafia title as players would expect.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: On a sort of similar note about authenticity, there is a good bit of Italian spoken this game, even when playing in English. I imagine the dialogue in this at least as much, possibly more than any other game, is probably gone over with a very, very fine tooth comb? Because I imagine you've not only got to make sure that any Italian language that's used is done in kind of an authentic way, but also, and you guys have done this before, so it's not like your first rodeo here. But I imagine you've got to make sure the voice cast isn't doing some sort of stereotype caricature of a typical mafia crime family too. So can you kind of speak to that sort of authenticity piece of it?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex</strong>: When we look at the previous Mafia Games, Mafia I, II, and III, the performances, the kind of authenticity, the particular locale, Chicago, New York, New Orleans comes across from the performances, the actors and all of that stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, we knew in this case we were going to be making a game that was primarily English language first, English language is the native language, but had to be accented. So that was always going to be a challenge to avoid the problem you mentioned there where it doesn't sound strange, somebody putting on an odd accent, derivative or any kind of weirdness there. And so we were quite careful in the casting process. Several of the main cast are native Italian, so that helps, including Ricardo, who plays Enzo. He's a native Italian. And again, and everybody else could do a very plausible accent. Everybody spent some time with a voice coach as well to make sure that they were as close as possible doing an authentic Sicilian accented English. And then we've been consulting with a partner team, a developer in Sicily as well, who's been giving us a lot of advice about cultural matters, including performance and such.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: Just about done here. But I'm curious why a prequel this time versus either continuing forward in time after three, or maybe even going back to somewhere between two and three. So can you guys, I'm just curious the decision to put the timeline where it was in this one?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nick</strong>: There's a lot of reasons. I mean, one of them was we wanted to start up a whole new story arc for the Mafia series. And so what better ways than to go back to the very start of Mafia? What's really nice about this game, I think is for new players who are jumping on for the first time, they don't need to have played any other Mafia games. But for players who have played the other games, there are links and certain Easter eggs and character hints and that kind of stuff in there, which links it all together. And it just felt like a good place to start. The origin of organized crime, the origin of the franchise itself, whilst also setting things up for the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And also, I think one of the things we always look at with Mafia is we're letting players play the mob movie. And we've done the big American crime cities and it felt like a really unique, very, very appropriate place to go to. We thought it'd be a beautiful environment to make a game in, which as you said, it has been. And it's just a unique story, I guess. So I think that was just some of the things. It gives gameplay opportunities that if we'd gone to another city, it might have not given us the opportunities to what we've done in this game, and obviously in the future, who knows where we'll go next. But this felt like a really appropriate place to kind of kick things off in this next story arc.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: Love it. All right. I saved my most important question for last here. Now I only played three chapters, about three hours, but I think in that time I saw more just gorgeously rendered and beautifully lit fruit in your game than maybe I've seen in any entire single game ever. So are you guys confident in saying that you have the most fruit and best looking fruit in the history of video games? This is a key question here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nick</strong>: [laughs] Yes. I'm happy to go on the record and state that is correct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alex</strong>: [laughs] 100%.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/mafia-the-old-country-devs-discuss-returning-the-series-to-its-roots-ign-first]]></content:encoded>

There is also a new Legendary gem, the Manaflux gem, that is inspired by Hearthstone's mana mechanic. It builds mana stacks over time, after which using a skill will play a Hearthstone card like Ragnaros or Acidic Swamp Ooze to decimate enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">While players who want to collect all the cards will need to purchase card packs, Blizzard is giving away some freebies in the form of a promo code (CARDCOLLECT) that can be used to acquire a random card and various other items like gems and crests. Players who login to Diablo Immortal with a character level 10 or higher during the event will also unlock an exclusive Hearthstone card back.</p><p dir="ltr">The event will additionally add new Warcraft-inspired pets like the Core Rager and Lil' Ragnaros, as well as character skins based on Azeroth's most famous power couple, Malfurion Stormrage and Tyrande Whisperwind. It's not the first time Diablo Immortal has crossed over with the Warcraft universe, with a previous crossover event adding the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-immortal-is-getting-a-lich-king-boss-battle-for-wows-20th-anniversary/1100-6527585/" data-ref-id="1100-6527585">Lich King as a boss battle</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In the leadup to the event's launch, fans over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1m5v4d1/diablo_x_hearthstone_colab_is_ai_generated/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_body&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fans-claim-blizzards-new-diablo-immortal-x-hearthstone-art-was-made-with-generative-ai/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/fans-claim-blizzards-new-diablo-immortal-x-hearthstone-art-was-made-with-generative-ai/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>) noticed the piece of artwork teasing the Diablo Immortal and Hearthstone crossover looked off. That quickly led to accusations that Blizzard, or perhaps Diablo Immortal's co-developer NetEase, had used generative AI to create the artwork.</p><p dir="ltr">The artwork features a Night Elf (presumably Tyrande) sitting across a tavern table and playing cards, and there are some noticeable oddities. Tyrande's necklace appears to be somewhat melted, the Hearthstone cards look wrong, pieces of toast are just sitting on a table in an odd manner, and the human card player's ear is malformed.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard has not addressed the situation, but it's not the first time it's been accused of using AI art in Hearthstone.

            <p>It doesn't sound like Bob Odenkirk wants to play nicely with Nintendo's moustachioed Jack of all trades Mario.</p>
<p>Speaking with Eurogamer's sister site IGN at San Diego Comic-Con, Odenkirk said that he would, err, "kill" Mario, which sounds quite extreme.</p>

<p>For background on how we got to this unexpected and rather dramatic comment from the actor, Odenkirk had been chatting about his upcoming action thriller Nobody 2, where he plays assassin Hutch Mansell. The conversation turned to how Hutch would end the days of characters who had also gone on holidays during their own sequels, as this is the <em>very loose </em>premise of Nobody 2.</p>
<p>Anyway, after chatting about popping off the likes of Bernie Lomax from Weekend at Bernie's 2 by decapitation and finishing off the Brady Bunch by chucking them down the stairs, Nintendo's mascot came into focus thanks to his escapades in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a>.</p>
<p>"I'll kill 'im," Odenkirk said looking at some images of Mario enjoying life on the beach. "I'll tear that moustache off his face, jam it down his throat, take those goggles, rip them to pieces, and stab him with those.</p>
<p>"It's gonna be bloody. Bloody!"</p>
<p>This thirst for Mario's blood comes "because of the smile," Odenkirk claimed. "I don't like that smile, it's too innocent." You can check out IGN's full conversation with Odenkirk below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>After reading The Lord of the Rings, the last thing on my mind was wanting to be a Hobbit. No, I categorically wanted to be Legolas, growing my hair and joining the University Archery Society, spending a year enjoying the fine art of putting arrows in a massive circle. If I couldn’t be Legolas, though, then it would have been Strider, and then probably Gimli or Gandalf in that order. Frodo and Sam might be the ostensible heroes, but as the everyman they’re not… well… very cool, are they? And frankly, my own feet are hairy enough already.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tales of the Shire | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XabBAJdc964?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>However, as an adult person, with adult constraints, tasks and responsibilities, the Hobbits’ way of life is far more alluring than the detached, changeable, emotionally reserved elves. Here we have a race that has made elevenses a religion, whose pantries are always full, and who can nap, eat and smoke at any time of day without anyone raising an eyebrow.</p>


<p>Their beautifully decorated underground homes are also warm, cosy and ever so appealing – even more so with the state of the current real-world housing market. This is the perfect time then to discover Tales of the Shire, a cosy life sim that lets you become the Hobbit of your dreams, and there’s not an adventure in sight.</p>
<p>You’ve got to give a suitably Hobbity name to your Hobbit, and thankfully, there’s a range of pre-made ones to mix and match from if you don’t quite feel as creative as Tolkien. Enter Odo Lightfoot, or maybe Myrtle Mugwort. It’s interesting to find a game where the character creator has as many options for foot hair as it does for hair on your head, but overall, this is a limited character creator compared to most. Still, you can make a fair approximation of Sam, Frodo, Merry or Pippin, and that’s probably the important thing.</p>


<p>Your first task is to become a local of Bywater. This Hobbit town is made mention of in the series as a crucial location in the fight back against Saruman, but there’s no sign of vindictive wizards here, just an array of green pastures, blooming flowers and one rundown Hobbit Hole for you to bring back to life.</p>
<p>Food is the key to a Hobbit’s heart, and that’s as true as ever here. Progress is fundamentally tied to making meals, sharing them with townsfolk, and levelling up your relationship with each of them through bribery-based friendship. The better your ingredients, the better your meals, and you go through a short series of tasks to prepare each one. These are pretty simple, but they do make you feel slightly more like a cook than someone clicking through menus.</p>
<p>Things are complicated by each dish’s sweet spot. You have to prepare and cook dishes to a particular level, with a scale between smooth and chunky, between tender and crisp, and if you manage to do that, alternating in how much you chop or cook each component, you’ll make your dish much tastier, greatly increasing its impact on the diner.</p>

<p>I particularly like some of the little touches the team have included, like the birds that serve as your route finders, fluttering from signpost to arch to wall as you go about your business. It’s such a smart and natural way to direct your play that I wonder why I haven’t seen it before – the closest might be the wind blowing in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/14/ghost-of-tsushima-review/">Ghost of Tsushima</a>.</p>
<p>One of the other key things you’ll spend your time doing, is tidying, designing and expanding your Hobbit Hole. It’s a bit of a wreck when you arrive, and the first thing you’ll want to do is clear up. Thankfully, this is very well done, and the controls are clear and easy to use, making moving, rotating and setting items pleasingly easy.</p>
<p>It’s also very detailed, so you can place mugs and bottles on shelves or the floor, filling places with clutter if you want, or going for a new-age Hobbit Feng Shui where everything points in the right direction. I do wish there were a gyro option on Switch, for a perfect level of precision, but it works suitably well without.</p>

<p>The Switch version A Hobbit’s Tale looks distinctly pared back, and frankly, it’s a little ugly. The character models look less detailed, and there’s clear pop-in of level furniture, with flowers and other details magically appearing as you walk towards them. What it does mean is that everything runs relatively smoothly, and the overall presentation remains charming, but it’s definitely not a looker on the older handheld, and it’s limited to compatibility modes on the Switch 2 – hopefully a patch or upgrade is forthcoming.</p>
<p>A further disappointment is that there’s no recorded speech, and only minimal grunts and exclamations made by characters during conversation. It gives every encounter a strange silence, a disconnect, and it really robs speech of any emotional depth at all. Even if it was shorter portions of speech that give a flavour of the full written dialogue – like we’ve seen in series like Fire Emblem – that would have breathed so much more life into the characters here.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the beautiful soundtrack helps to draw your attention away from any other audio/visual deficiencies. It manages to capture the nature of the films, with finely drawn, gentle orchestration emphasising the arable fantasy, letting you truly embody the Hobbit way of life. It’s about as perfectly tuned to its task as possible, and while you’re cooking, cleaning, renovating and removing, it provides an excellent aural backdrop.</p>

<p>Now, Tales of the Shire is going to appeal to a very particular sort of person. Some might decry the limited Lord of the Rings connections – at least those who expect to be walloping orcs with swords – but there’s a heap of Animal Crossing here, alongside some Stardew Valley and Story of Seasons, wrapped up in a thoroughly convincing Lord of the Rings landscape. For fans of cosy gaming, those for whom a busy little fantasy life is what they want at the end of a day, rather than a grand adventure, Tales of the Shire is a gentle and lovingly crafted entry in the genre.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/witchfire-webgrave-update/</link>

			<p>The Astronauts, the studio behind early access first-person fantasy shooter Witchfire, have released the latest major update for the game, Webgrave, which adds an entire new region to explore called Velmorne, new weapons and gear for players hunt the Witch with, changes to player onboarding, quality of life improvements, and more. </p>



<p>A new trailer showcasing the update has also been debuted, going through several of the changes included in the update, mainly around how player progression and build crafting work in the update. Which is great for returning players, but for new players, and even some returning ones, the arrival of a new in-depth tutorial set on a new map before you're dropped into Hermitory is perhaps the biggest highlight of the update. </p>



<p>What's definitely a welcome feature for returning players is the introduction of a new difficulty level, Gnosis VI, to raise the stakes even higher if you've already found yourself running through Witchfire's challenges without issue.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Witchfire was first launched into early access on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-early-access-release-overview-trailer/">Epic Games Store in 2023</a>, and then on Steam in <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-comes-to-steam-early-access-later-this-year/">September 2024</a>. The studio has continually updated and tweaked the game in response to feedback from players, and in a press release for today's update, The Astronauts co-founder and creative director, Adrian Chmielarz, thanked players for taking that journey with the studio.</p>



<p>"<em>Thank you to our early adopters! To all of you who have participated in our Early Access so far: Thank you very much for your help in getting us to this point</em>,<em>" </em>Chmielarz said. "<em>Your feedback in our official Discord and beyond has been vital!"</em></p>



<p>Witchfire will have been in early access for two years this coming September. Now that the game is getting a proper tutorial as part of this expansion, and an overhaul to its weapons and ability systems, it'll be interesting to see if we finally get word of a 1.0 release coming sometime next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hobbits from J.R.R. Tolkien's <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> universe, Middle-earth, have what could be the coziest lifestyle ever created, and <em>Tales of the Shire</em> attempts to bring that relaxation to the masses with one of the most relaxing, play-at-your-own-pace games to release in a while.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the calm and surprisingly deep atmosphere, fun yet simple gameplay loops, and in-depth customization are held back from shining like the star it should be in a few unfortunate areas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hobbits are creatures who spend their days with life’s simplest comforts, and they’re incredibly fond of food. Players start the game as a new Hobbit in an area called Bywater, an already-established part of the Shire.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-by-the-river.jpg?itok=i95Tr6NB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-by-the-river.jpg?itok=76neaal- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nature is beautiful and bountiful in&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire</em>.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>After they arrive in Bywater, preparations begin to try to establish the area as its own Village. To do this, an appraiser will need to verify its status. This results in a variety of different quests and, ultimately, waiting around.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During this, players are able to grow closer to the other Hobbits through cooking and hosting meals. To prepare for these meals, players have to forage, fish, and farm for ingredients.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>Tales of the Shire</em> Cooking Is a Cut Above</h2>

<p>Cooking is easily the focal point of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="40e0d549-a81e-46b9-9977-4f4a7267b6d2" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/tales-of-shire-preview-delicious-delight" rel="nofollow"><em>Tales of the Shire</em></a>, and its depth attests to that. Everything from picking combinations of flavors and seasonings in ingredients to using a variety of kitchen tools to achieve the perfect texture is satisfying, especially when you finally achieve exactly what you’re trying to make seasoned to perfection.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cooking-in-tales-of-the-shire_0.jpg?itok=rX8TQ0Fu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cooking-in-tales-of-the-shire_0.jpg?itok=bujPXldJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Cooking in&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>includes balancing different flavors and textures to create the best meal you can.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, the meal sharing isn’t as straightforward as it should be. What should happen is that players write letters to Hobbits to invite them to a meal. The next day, the Hobbit will write back what they’re craving that day for a meal, and players make the meal and start the event whenever they want during the day.</p>

<p>As a reward for a meal well done, Hobbits will share recipes with the player.</p>

<p>However, there was a problem that caused the game to crash after most of the meals I tried to host that weren’t part of the main story. To get around it, I had to ignore the meals that I planned, which ended up with some Hobbits who are surprisingly good at holding grudges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The developers are working on ironing out problems before <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d2f5f5b9-19dc-4f88-ba82-0aecd6ac2014" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/tales-of-shire-preview" rel="nofollow"><em>Tales of the Shire</em></a> launches, so this could be solved by the time the game is released. However, it was something that had a pretty big impact on reviewing the game since I couldn’t get too close to the other Hobbits or unlock as many recipes.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-mealtime.jpg?itok=AlYjN6od 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-mealtime.jpg?itok=EHbQgHFs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sharing meals with other Hobbits in&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire</em>&nbsp;should be a fun experience, though bugs made it a feature I could barely use.</figcaption></figure><p>Besides that, the cooking system sets the tone of the game well. Yes, Hobbits have cravings and want specific flavors, but <em>Tales of the Shire</em> isn’t about perfection. The Hobbits of Bywater are happy to have a meal together, so long as they don’t hate the food, so things don’t have to be perfect.</p>

<p>It’s a small nod to the fact that nothing in <em>Tales of the Shire</em> asks for perfection and rigid solutions. Everything in the game is fluid and requires little to no hustling, and players get to see this from the very start. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Foraging, Fishing, and Farming Are Also Well Done</h2>

<p>While it’s hard to get too excited about foraging every single day, <em>Tales of the Shire</em> makes it surprisingly easy and entertaining enough. Traveling around the map for missions (whether you’re skipping around or walking at a relaxing pace) means passing by quite a few&nbsp;ingredients. It’s very easy to pick these up as you go.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fishing-in-tales-of-the-shire.jpg?itok=tn_lF1Dk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fishing-in-tales-of-the-shire.jpg?itok=TosMcuS9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>fishing is easier than in many similar games, but complex enough to keep players interested.</figcaption></figure><p>Fishing is also pretty relaxing. The actual fishing minigame isn’t too difficult, but it’s just hard enough to make sure the player needs to pay attention. Compared to other games in the genre, it’s a balance that works well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Farming in <em>Tales of the Shire</em> is a bit more in-depth than the other systems. Growing plants vary by season, like most farming-sim players would expect. However, a unique twist comes with how plants are grouped.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Planting can be done freely in various farming spots. By planting an assortment of plants that get along with each other, players can speed up the process and harvest higher-quality plants.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Hobbit Holes Are Truly the Coziest Homes</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/home-customization-in-tales-of-the-shire.jpg?itok=O6zLwY4P 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/home-customization-in-tales-of-the-shire.jpg?itok=usktinAu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There are quite a few gorgeous home customization option in&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire</em>, like these planters and ceiling wallpaper.</figcaption></figure><p>Part of living the Hobbit life is living in a Hobbit hole. In <em>Tales of the Shire</em>, the player’s Hobbit hole can be customized in a near-endless way. Players can tailor every part of the home to their desires, including minute details like the rafters, the transitional flooring, and the chandeliers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you play more, the home expands until the Hobbit hole is a sprawling burrow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On top of it all, there’s a ton of furniture to gather from other Hobbits and from the furniture store in town. Not only is it all pretty stylish, but it can be placed and rotated freely in the home. This includes furniture for outside and the gardening areas, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, the furniture comes from around Middle-earth. Finding various Mirkwood pieces for my Hobbit home was a pleasant surprise, and it felt like small easter eggs for Middle-earth lovers.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Max Relaxation Doesn’t Fit Everyone’s Playstyle, Though</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-thinking-bubbles.jpg?itok=cTt58TOu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-thinking-bubbles.jpg?itok=9S8_TRyC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The writing in&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>was as quirky as one would expect from Hobbits.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Tales of the Shire</em> capitalizes on the fact that some people want to sit back with a game and relax. There are very few time constraints – even the events of each day aren’t dictated by times – and players can take everything slowly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In fact, it’s easy to feel like you’re playing a waiting game. However, the bigger idea is to slow down and enjoy the small parts of the game, which is truly the way of the Hobbits with foraging, farming, and fishing (and, of course, cooking).&nbsp;</p>

<p>In that regard, <em>Tales of the Shire</em> really shines. It truly feels like you’re living the life of a Hobbit. Things like quirky dialogue and random events players can run into while running around the map are really well done.</p>

<p>However, this is held back by a few things. Beyond quests, it’s almost pointless to interact with NPCs at random. Players can talk to some NPCs at random, but there are no interactions and no meaningful dialogue that happens by doing so. It made the actual Hobbits feel a bit hollow.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bywater-villagers-in-tales-of-the-shire_0.jpg?itok=4rHBwr9_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bywater-villagers-in-tales-of-the-shire_0.jpg?itok=jGWmnZV0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The villagers in&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>have potential, but they're hollow shells unless they're talking in the main story.</figcaption></figure><p>It’s also held back by several crashing problems. Talking to different Hobbits just to turn in quests would crash the game more often than not. This problem is supposed to be resolved before launch, but it’s worth noting that it caused a significant problem for me.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Tales of the Shire Needs Work, But Has a Solid Foundation</h2>

<p>Overall, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d95816c7-fd28-4045-9e01-20d255217d3c" href="https://techraptor.net/games/tales-of-shire" rel="nofollow"><em>Tales of the Shire</em></a> offers a niche, yet lovely, experience if you can get past the bugs and you enjoy a more fluid, cozy gaming experience. For those who love Hobbits or Middle-earth, it’s a wonderful, cozy game that expands on the calm lifestyle of Hobbits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is a lot to enjoy, from the core gameplay to the small details like dialogue. However, it’s easy to feel dragged down by the larger stability problems.&nbsp;</p>

		<p>If you’re hopping into the latest Soulslike to hit players in the head with a sneak attack, then you’ll want to know how levelling works in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/wuchang-fallen-feathers">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a>. While it bears some similarities to games you’re likely more familiar with, like Dark Souls, it has enough little quirks that we think it’s worth going into the specifics to make sure you know what you’re getting into.</p>


<p>As with so many of these games, you will be collecting a single currency called Red Mercury. In its base form, you can spend on items and whatnot from different merchants. However, to level up, you need to refine it into Red Mercury Essence. These are sort of like your stat points, and you can spend them in the Impetus Repository at the shrines you rest at, to unlock different skills.</p>


<p>The first time you open this, it’ll seem very bare. This is because skills are tied to different weapon skill trees. Each of the weapons in the game has a specific tree you can follow that not only unlocks better mastery with that weapon, but also stats relevant to that weapon as well. For example, the one-handed sword tree lets you boost your magic stat and your feathering stat.</p>


<p>It’s worth exploring the different weapon types at least a little bit, because each of them has a different combination of stats to it, but also some of the passives are game-changing when it comes ot how you play the game.</p>
<p>Never feel bad for exploring either, because you can actually reset your invested points whenever you want with no actual penalty. That’s a huge deal in games like this, because the chances are you’re not going to know exactly what play style you’ll actually like until you’ve been playing for a little while.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Glen Schofield is a name that horror video game fans have known since the arrival of the first Dead Space game in 2008. He's credited as the creator of the series, and even though he spent some time away from horror during his Call of Duty days in the 2010s, it's clear he was always pulled to the genre since he tried to return to it with The Callisto Protocol in 2022. He's worked in the video game industry for over two decades, with most of that time spent in AAA games. Now, he thinks it might all be coming to an end. </p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/glenschofield_game-industry-its-tough-out-there-activity-7354611327878774785-mvzk?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">LinkedIn</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/maybe-ive-directed-my-last-game-dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-says-a-new-aaa-game-feels-a-long-ways-away/">VGC</a>), Schofield ponders on the fact that he might have directed his last game when The Callisto Protocol released nearly three years ago now. He talks about what he's been doing for the last eight months, and how he has tried, and been unsuccessful, in finding appropriate financial backing for a project he's been developing with his daughter, who is also a game developer and has worked as an artist in games for the last eight years.</p>



<p>"<em>Over the past eight months, I've been quietly working with my daughter, Nicole, on a new game idea. She came to me with it, and I immediately loved the idea. Something I hadn't seen before. We've been calling it a new sub-genre of horror - not just horror, but something more</em>," Schofield writes. </p>



<p>"<em>We pulled the budget down to $17 million, built a prototype with a small, talented crew, and started taking meetings. People loved the concept. We got a lot of 2nd and 3rd meetings. But early feedback was 'get it to $10M.' Lately, that number's dropped to $2-5M.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>So last month, we decided to walk away. Some ideas are better left untouched than done cheap...I've worked on games of every size. From 2 of us to over 300 devs. Spent the last 15-20 years making big AAA titles with great teams. That's what I do. That's what I love. But with the industry on pause, AAA feels like it's a long ways away</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>So I'm back to my art. I miss it all; the team, the chaos, the joy of building something for fans. I'm still around, making art, writing stories and ideas and still cheering the industry on. But maybe I've directed my last game. Who knows? If so thank you for playing my games</em>."</p>



<p>Schofield also added that the members of the team he and his daughter were working with to develop this early concept horror project are all looking for work, and that his daughter was also one of the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-studio-striking-distance-hit-with-devastating-layoffs/">caught up in the layoffs</a> suffered by Striking Distance Studios, the company that Schofield and others founded back in 2020. SDS also seems to have just <a href="https://wccftech.com/callisto-protocol-devs-next-game-project-titan-cancelled/">cancelled a project it was working on</a>.</p>



<p>The video game industry is in a tough place at the moment, no doubt about that. Schofield has been around the AAA block more than a few times now, and if this is his sign to hang it up and take early retirement, then it'll have been unfortunate for him to hang up the gloves on a final game like Callisto Protocol.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-wireless-fight-stick-flexstrike</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstations-wireless-fight-stick-officially-named-flexstrike-launching-2026.1255146/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PlayStation has revealed the name and release window of its upcoming wireless arcade fight stick: it's called the FlexStrike, and it's launching sometime next year.</p>

<p>The FlexStrike was first revealed under the codename Project Defiant back at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-state-of-play-june-2025-recap" rel="nofollow">this year's summer State of Play</a>, but it's now shedding its development moniker. What's more, Sony has revealed more about what you can actually expect from the peripheral.</p>

<p>It'll be compatible with both PS5 and PC, and you'll be able to use it with both via a wired connection or wirelessly (using the included PlayStation Link adapter, of course).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/playstation-flexstrike-fight-stick-blue-background.jpg?itok=HXRoyRYy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/playstation-flexstrike-fight-stick-blue-background.jpg?itok=NccehqMO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The FlexStrike is coming sometime next year.</figcaption></figure><p>On the technical side, you can expect "mechanical switch buttons and toolless swappable restrictor gates", which include "square, circle, and octagon restrictor gates" you can slot into the storage compartments alongside the aforementioned PlayStation Link adapter.</p>

<p>You'll be able to hook both the FlexStrike and a Pulse 3D headset, or the Pulse Explore earbuds, up to your PS5 using a single PS Link adapter, and you can even connect two FlexStrikes up with the same adapter if you want to battle alongside (or against) a friend.</p>

<p>If you're not looking to use the FlexStrike to wander through game menus, you can keep your PS5 controller connected while you're using it, and since the FlexStrike features the same button inputs as a DualSense, you can probably use it as a standard controller as well, if you're so inclined.</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer showing off what the FlexStrike can do and what kind of aesthetic it's sporting (hint: it's pretty similar to the PS5's design) right here.</p>




<p>If you're lucky enough to be attending Evo in Vegas next month, you'll be able to get a first look at the FlexStrike. The rest of us will have to wait until 2026, and we'll presumably learn more about pricing and release dates in the coming months.</p>

Best of all, every skill you buy can be refunded with a simple press of a button, meaning you can experiment to your heart’s content with different builds and strategies. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195922" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Is Alan Wake Worth Playing Before Its Sequel? | Total Recall" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="390" data-playlist="195922,196539,196055" data-current="195922"><div><p>Is Alan Wake Worth Playing Before Its Sequel? | Total Recall</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195922/195922_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195922/195922_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195922/195922_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195922/195922_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21438.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>While you may want to try new things as you work your way through the game, you’ll be more limited in the opening hours of the game. And that’s why I think you’ll definitely want to unlock the early skills below so you’ll be prepared for everything <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> is going to throw at you.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> These skills are easily bought during the opening hours of the game when you have a limited set of weapons. As such, I chose to focus on the Longsword skill tree due to its strong potential for stunning enemies and dealing reasonably fast damage compared to heavier weapons you may discover in the first few areas. If you find that you prefer a different weapon a few hours into the game, rest assured there are comparable skills early in their skill trees, too. </p><h2 id="h1305"><a id=""></a>Skyborn Call I</h2><p>Skyborn Call I is the node located directly to the left of Illusive, which is unlocked by default. </p><p>This skill will increase your maximum Skyborn Might charges by one. Since Skyborn Might is among the most important parts of your kit, you’ll want to grab this one as soon as possible. With more Skyborn Might at your disposal, you can use magic more often (as well as wield stronger spells) or unleash multiple powerful melee skills in a row.</p><h2 id="h1306"><a id=""></a>Manna Capacity &amp; Manna Potency</h2><p>Manna Capacity and Manna Potency nodes are located directly above and below Skyborn Call I, respectively. </p><p>These skills do exactly what you’d expect: increase your Manna Vase’s number of uses and healing power. But they don’t require Red Mercury Essence to purchase. Instead, you’ll need special items found while exploring: Forgotten Remembrance and Lost Remains. You can find quite a few of these throughout your adventure, but I pointed out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-skills-birds-red-mercury-mana-1851787126&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-skills-birds-red-mercury-mana-1851787126">two early locations in our beginning tips guide</a></span>.

Since this combo is quick and easy to pull off, it makes for an excellent early pickup to ensure that you can keep stacks of Skyborn Might rolling in consistently. You’ll be especially happy to have this once you combine it with the skill below.</p><h2 id="h1308"><a id=""></a>Windforce</h2><p>Windforce is a node located in the Longsword tree purchaseable after buying Sword Saint and two Strength upgrades.</p><p>This skill allows you to use a charged heavy attack much more quickly if you have a stack of Skyborn Might. Thanks to Sword Saint helping you consistently build stacks alongside any you get from dodging well, you can pull off these charged heavy attacks with frequency. Doing so will let you stun enemies for critical attacks more quickly, with it being especially effective against small-to-medium-sized human foes. </p><h2 id="h1309"><a id=""></a>Strong Blade</h2><p>Strong Blade nodes are located in the Longsword tree that can be found on either side of Windforce after buying an adjacent node (either Vitality or Endurance).</p><figure id="" data-id="d25f3ef41d5a2a8134656a17e0c54f5b" data-recommend-id="image://d25f3ef41d5a2a8134656a17e0c54f5b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of an item menu shows a red feather." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of an item menu shows a red feather." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Leenzee / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d25f3ef41d5a2a8134656a17e0c54f5b" data-recommend-id="image://d25f3ef41d5a2a8134656a17e0c54f5b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of an item menu shows a red feather." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Regardless of which node you choose, this skill will level up the mastery of the Longsword and increase its damage. But it doesn’t require Red Mercury Essence to purchase. Instead, you’ll need Faint Red Feathers, which you’ll find by exploring thoroughly and defeating specific enemies. One example is a little creature in a jar that spits poison at you. They’re often found down optional pathways or lurking in corners among debris. </p><p>You’ll find more Strong Blade nodes throughout the skill tree as well, each offering three tiers of upgrades (meaning three upgrades per node), so you’ll get more chances to increase the damage of your weapon as you venture further into the game. As you level these higher, however, you’ll need more advanced upgrade materials (feathers). </p><hr><p><br><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series S/X, and Windows PCs.  </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/wuchang-longsword-skills-strong-blade-windforce-1851787137]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">One of the issues the game has experienced so far is related to preorder bonuses, as an update released on July 25 did not properly distribute these bonuses to all players. As compensation for this, those who own the deluxe-edition of the game on Steam will be getting three extra sets of deluxe costumes and four weapons, and both standard- and deluxe-edition owners will get three headgear items on all platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of the game's performance and optimization issues, Leenzee explained that it will "continue to optimize performance issues and will keep adjusting the game based on your suggestions--such as difficulty levels and boss encounters--in upcoming patches." It outlined a preview of some of its "recent optimization efforts," which include things like crash fixes, improved frame rates and reduced lag on certain graphics cards, improved AI logic for monsters and bosses, enhanced texture quality in low-resolution areas, and improved asset detail and precision in some regions.</p><p dir="ltr">Leenzee closed out the post by asking "for your patience as we tackle these optimizations step by step."</p><p dir="ltr">If you're curious as to whether the game is worth checking out despite these performance issues, check out or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wuchang-fallen-feathers-review-aint-nuthing-ta-pluck-with/1900-6418385/">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers review</a>.</p>
