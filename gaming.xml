            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/680893/nintendo-switch-2-eshop-faster<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Ahead of the Nintendo Switch 2’s launch, Nintendo said that the eShop would be improved and run more smoothly on the new console. Based on our initial testing at <em>The Verge</em>, it’s immediately apparent that the Switch 2’s eShop is much better.</p><p>On the original Switch, the eShop can be extremely sluggish. Even just moving from one section to another can have a lag, and clicking into a game sometimes takes a bit to load before you can even go through the process of buying it. The delays and slow navigation make using the shop a huge pain; I personally often defaulted to buying digital games on Nintendo’s website because it was a better experience.</p><p>On the Switch 2, the eShop is way faster. It’s all much more snappy, with <em>much</em> less lag browsing through sections and loading up game pages. Just take a look at this video comparing jumping into the eShop on both consoles, captured by my colleague Tristan Cooper – it’s dramatically faster on the Switch 2:</p><p>And how about if you want to search <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/664621/deltarune-nintendo-switch-2-launch-time">for <em>Deltarune</em></a>? Again, way quicker on the Switch 2.</p><p>“Thanks to the system’s performance capabilities, Nintendo eShop on Switch 2 has been improved and runs smoothly even when displaying a large number of games,” Switch 2 director Takuhiro Dohta said in an interview <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-4%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOop9Dwm1pWdSyk-2keK5d7TMj9CiX6O81ImmGVhH2dA6V1F2MHhE" rel="sponsored">published in April</a>. “We believe the act of finding the game you want to play is itself part of the game system experience.”</p><p>Right now, the eShop feels like one part of the Switch 2 experience that’s a huge upgrade. Hopefully, that will end up making it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/671658/nintendo-switch-indie-games-eshop-legacy">a better place to find great games</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Back in 2023, Nintendo held one of those Direct thingies it likes to do, and as it often does the Japanese version of the stream had some games the western one didn't. In particular, there was one game that drew my attention: <a href="https://rockpapershotgun.com/games/stray-children">Stray Children</a>. It caught my eye in part because it has a really unique pixel art look to it, but also because Yoshiro Kimura was its director, one of the original designers of cult-classic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moon-remix-rpg-adventure">Moon: Remix RPG Adventure</a>. And now, after a bit of a wait, developer Onion Games have confirmed it's getting its English release later this year, and it'll even be doing so on PC.
</p>

<p>
If you haven't heard of Stray Children before, here's the lowdown of the oddball game: you play as a young, dog-like boy who gets whisked away to another world through a strange old console. In this new land, its inhabitants are all children, a wall set up around them keeping out The Olders, "monstrous adults, carrying the heavy load of their own inadequacies, self-doubt, and all of the grievances that grown-ups gather."

<p>
Much like Moon before it, it's not a typical <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> adventure. Battles take place in small arenas with enemies sending out occasionally bullet-hell like attacks for you to dodge. You can either fight these messed up adults literally, or figuratively with your words, all of this adding up to something definitely reminiscent of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/undertale">Undertale</a>, which is a bit ironic given how much of an influence Moon was on that game.
</p>
<p>
Stray Children actually released in Japan last year, but only on Nintendo Switch, and an English localisation was promised right from its announcement. The bad news is that there's still no exact date in place just yet. It'll arrive sometime in 2025, at least, and we're basically halfway through the year already. No, you're having a crisis about the passage of time, bog off, go and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3649490/Stray_Children/">wishlist Stray Children on Steam</a> or something.

June is here, which means Amazon has refreshed its Prime Gaming offerings for another month, and - following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prime-gaming-members-get-22-more-games-in-may">bumper-packed May</a> - it's a comparatively quiet one this time around. In total, June brings nine new games for subscribers to download, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/thief-deadly-shadows">Thief: Deadly Shadows</a>.

</p>
<p>
Then, as June trundles onwards and summer vaguely threatens to emerge, members can look forward to the likes of Thief: Deadly Shadows, the third game in the classic stealth series, and minimalist railway puzzler Station to Station. That's alongside the acclaimed Jupiter Hell, a grimy top-down turn-based sci-fi shooter, plus guns-and-sorcery cRPG Dark Envoy.
</p>
<p>
You'll find the full list of Junes's titles (plus the digital stores they can be grabbed from) below.

In addition to the above, Prime Gaming subscribers in the UK, US, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Austria, the Netherlands, and Poland get the usual access to a rotating selection of titles via Amazon's cloud gaming service, Luna. In June, these include  <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/batman-arkham-knight">Batman: Arkham Knight</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-dc-super-villains">Lego DC Super-Villains</a>, House of Golf 2, RiMS Racing, Mail Mole, Garfield Kart - Furious Racing, The Jackbox Survey Scramble, Ultrakill, Spells &amp; Secrets, and Qube 10th Anniversary.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/05/the-switch-2s-best-feature-might-be-that-the-eshop-doesnt-suck/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Yes, that’s a slightly silly title, but in amongst all of the updates, improvements and all-new features for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, one of the key things I’m happy to see being put out to pasture is the original Switch’s eShop.</p>
<p>The fact is, the Switch eShop sucked. Certainly not because it gave us a window into Nintendo’s incredible library of games, or even because it found itself chock full of dollar-store tat, but because it barely worked, creaking and groaning and whinging and stopping and starting all the way from the moment you loaded it up to the moment you tried to give Nintendo your money. It didn’t even play you a little ditty to shop by! As far as user experiences go, it has to rank amongst the worst in modern gaming. And that includes installing things on the PlayStation 3 and the existence of Amazon Luna.</p>
<div id="attachment_460341"><p id="caption-attachment-460341">The new Nintendo Switch 2 eShop homepage</p>

</div>
<p>The Switch 2’s portal into the eShop starts well by doing the very bare minimum of loading itself up in a timely fashion and displaying all of its wares at the same time. My expectations shouldn’t have been quite so low, but we’re starting from a position below the floor, somewhere down in the substrate. With the dinosaur bones.</p>
<p>The first thing you’ll see is the curated Highlights. These are currently pretty much the entirety of the Switch 2’s launch line-up, with Mario Kart World beckoning us with glee next to the neon-soaked and thoroughly different Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition. As an aside, I love that these seem to be the top choices so far for Switch 2 – alongside Fast Fusion – because, well, it shows that we’re a weird bunch, doesn’t it?</p>

<div id="attachment_460342"><p id="caption-attachment-460342">Nintendo Switch 2 eShop “For You” game suggestions</p></div>
<p>Anyway, moving down with the D-pad results in the cursor going down. Yes! I know! It’s moving in time with my button presses and everything! And you can search, check out your Wish List, and see a series of suggested games that takes you to a very cool discovery tool branded as ‘For You’.</p>
<p>For You gives you a series of weekly recommendations – refreshed every Saturday – showing you a trailer, the price of the game, your friends that have played it, and what games that you own that are similar to it. It also matches the genre and publisher to other things in your library. It’s user friendly, clear, and it works perfectly smoothly.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I’ve just logged back into the Switch 1 eShop to double check they’ve not added it there, and I’m still stuck trying to scroll down through the menu. It turns out that, yes, it is exclusive to the Switch 2 store, which is probably a good thing, since the original eShop struggles to show one game, never-mind ten.</p>
<div id="attachment_460340"><p id="caption-attachment-460340">Trust us when we say this is scrolling really, really fast, and hasn’t had a hitch for a good 15-20 seconds before I got bored.</p></div>
<p>The most wonderful – or you could say, normal – part of the whole experience, is that I can scroll through page after page of Recent Releases, Coming Soon and Charts, and it just scrolls. It doesn’t reach the bottom and force you to wait while it works out where it put the games, reaches behind the sofa or under a rug, and pulls out the next page or so to pacify you while it thinks about it. It just works.</p>
<p>And once you’re done shopping? Well, you’ll find that the Switch 2 is capable of some positively modern-feeling download speeds. Where the original Switch could refuse to go above 40 or 50Mbps, it felt like, the Switch 2’s improved Wi-Fi chipset and faster storage means it can whizz along at up to 400Mbps, though it’s more commonly between 250-300Mbps. Nothing to turn your nose up at.</p>
<p>Thanks Nintendo.</p>

He says he fell in love with the voice that Suno would generate when he uploaded unfinished demos of his songs onto the platform. “It came to a point where I’m like, ‘Yo, this voice, it’s amazing.’”</p><p>There’s no word on when TaTa’s first single will be released, but the Stage Zero team plans to make her seem as real as possible.

So you can imagine that the general reception to Timbaland siding with the machines has been less than favorable:</p><p>Mudaliar believes the public opposition to AI-generated music will subside eventually because “[AI is] not going anywhere,” comparing what he sees as the inevitability of its eventual acceptance to the way that influencers went from laughable to standard. Even though human creators will be involved in the process of creating music for TaTa and other AI artists, it’s hard not to look at this new endeavor as a way to minimize human involvement in music. Timbaland has a track record of making generation-defining music, but this move just sounds off. <br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Probably one of the most appealing parts of an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> is bonding with other characters, right? Building up your player character's relationships with various companions, like in games like the Persona series for example. What I wouldn't say is particularly common is you, the player, having a direct relationship with the character you're playing as. This is where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockpapershotgun.com/games/downhill">Downhill</a> comes in, a fourth wall breaking action RPG whose main character knows you exist and controls them, all the while having to figure out a way to save the world.

<p>
"The idea of power and its abuse is what lies at the core of Downhill," Sisterhood Games, the developer of Downhill, explain in the game's <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sisterhoodgames/downhill-a-unique-4th-wall-breaking-arpg">Kickstarter page</a>. "Each time we start a new RPG game, we take full control of a character, but what if that character had a will of their own? Moreover, what if it oftentimes clashed with your vision for your playthrough?"

<p>
A fourth wall break in an indie RPG is nothing new, that's kind of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/undertale">Undertale</a>'s whole deal to a degree (a game cited as an inspiration, alongside how <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/oneshot">OneShot</a> communicates to the player directly). But what sells me on Downhill is the way in which you develop a relationship with its protagonist Fade. Do you want to help her in any way you can, or do you want to fight against her? You can talk to her at any point throughout the game, various dialogue options affecting how she thinks of you.
</p>
<p>
That might mean doing something simple as asking how she is, or forcing her to fight an enemy. I wouldn't say subtlety is the name of the game here, it's clearly going to be a game where you question your role in the way games play out. I just really like the presentation of it all. There's a really unique dark fantasy aesthetic to it with some good, creepy-looking creatures to fight, and the twist on RPG dialogue options being that you're conversing with your own character is a fun one.
</p>
<p>
You can revive Fade as many times as you want too without having to load your save data, but that comes with the cost of it causing her mental distress. Obviously you can't tell everything from a game without playing it, but it certainly sounds like there's a thoughtfulness as to how commonplace mechanics can affect the characters you play as. Good stuff!
</p>
<p>
As mentioned, the game is currently looking for funds on Kickstarter, so you can chuck a few quid your way if it takes your fancy. It's also available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3433000/DOWNHILL/">wishlist on Steam</a>, and there's a short demo for you to check out too if you're not convinced enough to support the fundraiser just yet.

It even adds a few new bells and whistles to the series’ turn-based combat, lending new dimensions to a typically straightforward system. However, mapping everything this series has to offer onto live-service structures and gacha rolls doesn’t inspire a lot of confidence in what may be one of the last <em>Persona 5 </em>spin-offs before we finally reach <em>Persona 6</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196411,196013" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It’s a shame I’m so hesitant, because the premise of <em>The Phantom X </em>is really compelling to me. This game takes place in a separate timeline in which a different group of high schoolers took up the Phantom Thieves mantle. Instead of playing as Joker, you play as Wonder, a completely different guy who goes to another school and has different friends, but still has Joker’s ability to summon multiple entities called Persona to fight off Shadows in a paranormal world called the Metaverse. Like most <em>Persona </em>heroes, his life is split between fighting monsters in one world and living a normal teenage existence in the other, but the difference this time around is that <em>The Phantom X </em>breaks the traditional RPG grind for a much more elaborate gacha one.</p><p>You build out your party by unlocking characters with gacha rolls. The game’s calendar system is regimented by an energy mechanic, so you can’t just have a breezy marathon running through several in-game days at a time like you could in other <em>Persona </em>games. Stats and abilities are now gated by RNG rather than acquired by simply getting more powerful. You know, the normal free-to-play dressings that keep you booting the game up every day or so.</p><p>I can’t speak to the probabilities for different pulls based on my two hours with the game, but folks who’ve been playing it in the East have said that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PERSoNA/comments/1fkeeue/after_200_hours_of_playing_persona_5_x_the/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PERSoNA/comments/1fkeeue/after_200_hours_of_playing_persona_5_x_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it’s pretty generous</a></span> compared to other gacha games and lets you unlock characters and summonable Personas with relative ease. But even if <em>The Phantom X </em>is less predatory than your average slot machine, I think I’m just kinda bummed that an interesting premise is being overcomplicated by all these chance-based systems. I’ve played every <em>Persona </em>game and can navigate all their complexities pretty easily, but opening a menu in <em>The Phantom X </em>and seeing how all the systems, from the social elements that have long been the draw to the simple act of customizing your party, have been made more complicated so the game can get its hooks into your daily routine and wallet takes the wind out of my sails.</p><p>I love <em>Persona 5</em>.

Every game Atlus put out after the 2016 original has felt like a low-stakes “monster of the week” romp that mostly existed to give the old crew a reason to hang out for a bit. <em>The Phantom X</em>, meanwhile, is the first time one of the <em>Persona 5</em> spin-offs has done something of substance. By sidelining the characters Atlus hasn’t done anything meaningful with since the enhanced edition, <em>Persona 5 Royal</em>,<em> </em>launched in 2019, <em>The Phantom X </em>has the potential to explore something truly different in this world for the first time in years. I haven’t had much time with Wonder’s version of the Phantom Thieves, but I’m interested to get to know new Persona users, even if they’re borrowing a previous crew’s aesthetic. But it’s hard to look forward to those possibilities when they’re all gated behind mechanics designed to tempt me to drop some cash.</p><p>I want to give <em>The Phantom X </em>its fair shake when it comes to mobile and PC on June 26, but I can’t lie, I’m skeptical. I hope I’m proven wrong.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/sony-fight-stick-project-defiant-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><figcaption><span><p>Credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment</p>
</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>I love fighting games, but I am by no means competitive. I am, however, a gear person. I have three different leverless controllers, two of which I made, and am currently <a href="https://aftermath.site/oh-no-i-bought-a-candy-cab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restoring an arcade cabinet</a>. As a result I know a severe amount about fight stick hardware: <a href="https://paradisearcadeshop.com/collections/sanwa-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sanwa buttons</a>, <a href="https://www.brookaccessory.com/Fighting_Board/list.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brook boards</a>, and how to wire a stick. And so I desperately need to know if Sony’s fight stick, code-named “Project Defiant,” is any good or not.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Project Defiant Wireless Fight Stick - Teaser Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oCeba1xfKxg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Though I have been critical of Sony’s hardware in the past, I always know its intended market. If you have a Steam Deck already, <a href="https://aftermath.site/chiaki-chiaki4deck-moonlight-playstation-portal-sunshine-streaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you do not really need a Portal</a>. The DualSense Edge, while fine, I found to be overpriced, and I opted to just <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-modded-my-ps5-controller-and-you-can-too" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">take mine apart and do aftermarket mods</a>. Both of these products make sense if you just wanna go to Best Buy and buy something instead of dicking around with wires. And in Sony’s defense, they have been absolutely killing it in the headphone space.&nbsp;</p><p>Project Defiant was announced alongside <em>MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls</em>, the new Marvel-themed 4v4 tag battle game from Arc System Works. While I would normally be wary of anything Marvel related at this point, the success of <em>Marvel Rivals </em>makes this much more promising, as does Arcsys’ track record with <em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em>. It’s such a good get on Sony’s part that I like to imagine that someone at Capcom is getting yelled at right now.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fbfrV5qqnU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls | Announce Trailer</a></p><p>Project Defiant seems similar to many of Sony’s hardware outings from the little we know about it. It claims to use the proprietary PlayStation Link format for low wireless latency. The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/introducing-project-defiant-the-first-wireless-fight-stick-designed-by-sony-interactive-entertainment-for-ps5-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">product page</a> says it has toolless swappable gates on the stick, meaning you can have your stick movement as either circular, square or octagonal (hey, that’s pretty good!). It also claims to use mechanical switches, although Sony does not specify what kind. Given that this is a low profile stick, I have theories. There’s also a little touch pad on top, which is expected from any Sony controller. Buttons on the render appear to be that shiny translucent plastic on the DualSense, and just by eyeballing it the button layout appears to be something close to “<a href="https://www.slagcoin.com/joystick/layout.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sega 2P</a>.” If that’s the direction they’re going in I gotta give them credit, because it’s an interesting layout, better for your pinky, and also just generally a classy choice.</p><figure><figcaption>I can't tell the dimensions without measuring it but Sega 2P is a similar layout, although the spacing on the stick seems wider. Credit: <a href="https://www.slagcoin.com/joystick/layout.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slagcoin</a></figcaption></figure><p>Aesthetically, Project Defiant follows the PlayStation 5 visual language, <a href="https://aftermath.site/ps5-pro-700-dollars-looks-bad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which I still dislike</a>. Part of this is because I have such an undying love of Sony’s industrial design from the mid 80s all the way to the PS2 era. Sony’s house style used to be something special, clean with straight lines and very utilitarian. Sony devices often implied that you were holding something from the future. Even much of their consumer-facing stuff felt like it was treating you like a professional. This changed radically with PS3, got slightly better during the PS4 era, and then somehow reached its nadir during the current era. Though Project Defiant has the same swooping white accents of the PS5, it looks like they’re doing an OK job of making it more respectable than the console, but it’s hard for me to tell until it’s in my hands.</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment</figcaption></figure><p>One red flag: the white plastic. I have white controllers and it <em>never </em>ends well. White plastic controllers inevitably get grimy and yellow, showing wear more aggressively. This goes doubly so for fight sticks, and I can just see a sweat and wear pattern developing where the heel of the right hand lands. I will concede that it’s possible that the stock plastic in that part is just particularly wear and dirt resistant. I could also see a world where, like the PS5, the controller has swappable custom shells for that part. That would be a smart move, as half the fun of fight sticks is tricking them out with something garish.</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: Mark Julio/@markman23</figcaption></figure><p>A sign that Project Defiant is in good hands is that <a href="https://liquipedia.net/fighters/MarkMan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Julio</a> announced on X <a href="https://x.com/MarkMan23/status/1930378135247446097" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that he’s involved with it</a>. Markman is someone who knows ball and has <a href="https://markman23.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">consulted on a bunch of sticks in the past</a>. Generally speaking it’s a good sign that they’re bringing in people that know what they’re doing.</p><p>Project Defiant comes out in 2026. I have no idea if it actually exists outside of a render at this point. No price point was announced, which will make or break the success of the device. Though I’m often skeptical, there's a lot about this I like: a wireless, mass market, low profile fight stick with a really good button layout sounds incredibly promising. But this is also a community Sony has to try harder with if it wants to be accepted.&nbsp;</p><p>People who play fighting games take pride in their sticks. Unlike regular controllers, which are traditionally harder to make from scratch, the culture of hand crafting or customizing fight sticks is tied up with the fighting game community itself. Everyone has preferences. Do you want Sanwas, Seimitsus, Qanbas, or Samducksas? How about a freak switch that uses moddable keyboard switches inside of it (I am currently <a href="https://github.com/OpenStickCommunity/Hardware/blob/main/3D%20Prints/OSBLP%20v2/Community%20submissions/OSBLP%20v2%20-%20SiTong%20Edition/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying to make some of these from scratch</a>)? What potentially embarrassing art do you want on it? What layout do you want?&nbsp;</p><p>There’s an entire world of niche vendors like <a href="https://arcadeshock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arcade Shock,</a> <a href="https://paradisearcadeshop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paradise Arcade Shop</a>, and <a href="https://focusattack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Focus Attack</a>. There’s people selling smaller parts like <a href="https://sgfdevices.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SGF!</a> and countless Etsy sellers making boutique works of art. There’s an entire project and community just devoted to open source controller firmware, <a href="https://gp2040-ce.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GP-2040CE</a>. It is a deeply competitive market, one with existing standards that encourage tinkering, tweaking and repairability. These devices are serious investments. And while Sony is a giant company that doesn’t live by that support, it substantially invested in it by jointly acquiring <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/press-releases/2021/sony-interactive-entertainment-and-new-esports-venture-rts-jointly-acquire-the-evolution-championship-series-evo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Evo</a> in 2021. This is a community with lofty standards, and it would be an impressive feat indeed to make something worthy of the very tournament they own.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-yasumi-matsuno"><h3>Tell ‘Em</h3></a><p>'The will to resist is in your hands'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/neightreign-is-good-but-lumpy-counter-intuitive-and-experimental"><h3>Nightreign is Uneven And Counter-Intuitive.

That’s what one YouTuber tried to find out, wasting absolutely no time before putting a stomach-churning beatdown on Nintendo’s new hardware.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,196230" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@TechRax/videos&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@TechRax/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TechRax’s YouTube channel</a></span> is best known for smashing all sorts of high-end consumer electronics, usually iPhones and Apple Watches. Sometimes he throws golf balls at Tesla Cybertrucks. When he’s really feeling bored he pours laundry detergent into a car’s fuel tank just to feel something. Today, on June 5, as regular tech fans celebrate the launch of the Switch 2, TechRax decided to put the $450 console that fans spent hours standing in line for through a “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p33K1uuOk-A&amp;t=124s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p33K1uuOk-A&amp;t=124s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">durability test</a></span>.” The results were hard to watch and minimally illuminating. </p><p>What kind of a beating can the Switch 2 survive? That was the question TechRax answered in his latest video. First he dropped it on the floor. No damage. So far so good! Then he pulled out a razor blade and scored the middle of the screen. “That was a big scratch line and that’s not coming off, so guys this is not like an iPhone 16 Pro or something. If you do something like that, that’s it, you are toast,” he said before cutting it a second time just to be sure. <br></p><p>Next, rather than pressing the buttons on the Joy-Con to release them from their magnetic grip slots on the sides of the Switch 2, he bent them until they snapped off. He did it multiple times and much to my surprise, despite the heart-stopping snapping sound, neither part of the connector appeared to be damaged. Good news for everyone whose kids are going to bend and flex the new Joy-Con a dozen times a week. </p><p>Finally, after successfully bending the metal hinge kickstand, TechRax concluded his survey with the hammer test. What is the hammer test? Exactly what it sounds like. First he drops a metal hammer onto the screen. Then he does it a second time from higher up. Eventually he just starts whacking it until the screen cracks. The Switch 2's new LCD screen stood its ground until hammer blow number 10. Not bad. Not bad at all. But if you see TechRax coming into your store, please don’t sell him any more Switch 2s. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The ubiquitous tabletop accessory company Ultra Pro is creating an official product line of deck boxes and sleeves to commemorate the crossover of two iconic franchises.</p>

<h2>The <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> <em>Final Fantasy</em> Accessory Line Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, Ultra Pro is producing an official line of <em>Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy</em> accessories. They are designed not just to protect and preserve any important or rare cards you might get from the latest crossover set, but also serve as collector's items in their own right.</p>

One is he hero of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-vii" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Final Fantasy VII</em></a>: Cloud Strife. The other features <em>Final Fantasy VII's</em> villain: the One-Winged Angel Sephiroth. The product line up is as follows:</p>

<ul><li>Deck Protector Sleeves</li>
	<li>Deck Box Storage Containers</li>
	<li>Premium Deck Boxes</li>
	<li>Several Multi-Pocket Card Binders. A 4-Pocket Binder, a 9-Pocket Binder, and a 12-Pocket Binder Respectively</li>
	<li>Spiral Life Pad</li>

	<li>Double-Sided Playmat</li>
	<li>Holofoil Playmat</li>
	<li>Black-Stitched Playmat</li>
</ul><p>The production of a <em>Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy</em> accessory line was expected given the pedigree of both series. <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> debuted in 1993 and is widely considered one of the most popular TCGs of all time. For over 30 years, it has entertained millions of players with accessible gameplay, complex epic fantasy lore, and crossovers with other properties like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/lord-of-rings-tales-of-middle-earth-details-emerge" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Lord of the Rings</em></a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/doctor-who-commander-decks-will-have-50-new-cards-each" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Doctor Who</em></a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, <em>Final Fantasy</em> is one of the most beloved and enduring RPG series in the world. It debuted in 1987 on the NES and has slowly expanded into a sprawling series packed with iconic characters, imaginative worlds, and compelling storytelling. It has produced sixteen mainline entries and several spin-offs like <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/doctor-who-commander-decks-will-have-50-new-cards-each" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">F</a><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/doctor-who-commander-decks-will-have-50-new-cards-each" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">inal Fantasy Tactics</a></em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy</em> crossover set will release June 13.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rumors-abound-of-a-new-cyberpunk-2077-dlc/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When Cyberpunk 2077 was yet to be released, CD Projekt RED planned at least two major DLCs for the game, just like with The Witcher III: Wild Hunt, which received the widely acclaimed expansions Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine.</p>
<p>However, Cyberpunk 2077 shipped in a way buggier state than The Witcher III: Wild Hunt. On previous generation consoles like PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, the game's state was even more dire, requiring a lot of work from the developer to bring the level of polish that users had come to expect from CD Projekt RED.</p>
<p>That was a major reason behind the studio's decision to ultimately produce only one big DLC, Phantom Liberty, which launched in September 2023. Phantom Liberty was a resounding success, helping uplift the overall perception of Cyberpunk 2077 as a whole. Here's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what I wrote back then</a>:</p>
<p><em>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty builds upon what was an already great game to deliver more fantastic storytelling (with a spy thriller theme, this time around), exciting combat, and very high-quality side content. The perk tree overhaul is a major improvement to progression, and additions like vehicle combat and the overhauled police system are very welcome</em></p>
<p>Phantom Liberty sold exceedingly well, too. Just a few days ago, CD Projekt RED <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2-is-in-pre-production-phantom-liberty-has-sold-10-million-units-the-witcher-3-60-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that the Cyberpunk 2077 expansion surpassed 10 million units sold to date.</p>
<p>Perhaps that's why the studio appears to be working on some additional DLC for the game. Some fans on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/1l2x5z2/new_cyberpunk_dlc_being_written_and_developed_by/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovered</a> the info from the LinkedIn profile of a Senior Writer at Virtuos (the company behind The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered and Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater):</p>
<p><em>• Analyzed existing Cyberpunk 2077 character voices to inform writing their dialogue in multiple new side quests. </em><br>
<em>• Coordinated with the Narrative Designer to conceive, write, and polish side quests for upcoming DLC releases. </em><br>
<em>• Worked with the English Adaptation Specialist to ensure all in-game dialogue and text adhered to English/American and Cyberpunk standards using Red Engine tools. </em></p>
<p>To be clear, though, it is unlikely that this DLC would be something even remotely as large as Phantom Liberty. More likely is a bundle of new DLC missions, or perhaps even a tie-in of sorts with another Cyberpunk 2077-themed Netflix anime following Edgerunners.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, we'll be sure to report any further evidence of a new DLC that arises.</p>

            <p>
Last year, CD Projekt Red released their final update for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. Version 2.2 of the game added in fixes, a few more customisation options for you and your trusty steed (car), alongside some secrets. This version itself got patched with a few more fixes, but 2.2 was meant to be the last big one. Turns out, they lied! As in a stream held earlier today mostly to do with that new video game console that just came out with the kart driving plumber on it (more like Switch 2 another channel, am I right), <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/cd-projekt-red">CD Projekt Red</a> shared that a 2.3 version is on the way to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world game</a> later this month.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Global community director at CD Projekt Red Marcin Momot <a href="https://x.com/Marcin360/status/1930653122650579400">took to Jitter</a> to share that the team is "not done yet! Stay tuned for more info about the next Cyberpunk 2077 update coming later this month. We’ll start spilling the beans closer to the release of patch 2.3 (that’s its name), so for now, we ask for a bit more patience. Let the team cook!"

<p>
Details were very scarce with this update, but it is coming June 26th, a few weeks away. Associate game director Pawel Sasko <a href="https://x.com/PaweSasko/status/1930657862054707704">also said</a> that he's "taking care of the update personally" and that more details will be coming when they're ready to be shared.
</p>
<p>
I wouldn't expect anything massive, it'll probably be similar to what 2.2 offered, especially because CD Projekt Red are all in on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> right now - they even showed off an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-shows-off-a-swanky-ue5-tech-demo-at-state-of-unreal-2025-with-ciri-hunting-monsters-and-visiting-circuses-in-kovir">Unreal Engine 5 tech demo of that one</a>. Really excited for all the side by side comparisons when the game comes out captioned "what a downgrade". <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-sequel-is-now-cyberpunk-2-and-is-therefore-about-burial-mounds-bows-and-pottery">Cyberpunk 2 is in pre-production now too</a>, that's its name now by the way, but again, don't expect much from that for a while either. Just keep your expectations low in general actually, they probably won't be met.

<p>But this kind of online gaming moderation is typically designed for situations where players could be exposed to random strangers in online matches. Nintendo's GameChat is already strictly limited to users whom players have manually added as friends on their system, who would be the only ones able to send a report of bad behavior to Nintendo. GameChat users also have to confirm a phone number matching the one on their Nintendo account for added identification purposes.</p>

<p>Nintendo also goes to extra lengths to ensure parents are informed when it comes to minors using GameChat. If a Switch 2 system has accounts for both an adult and a minor, the GameChat setup requires the adult to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/mobile-apps/parental-controls/?srsltid=AfmBOooJWfbrQwaOeC16VIyZLs5_iPR0NboxtHDQ9c4UMZIN7TVWTxKV">download the Nintendo Parental Controls app</a> to a smartphone and sync it to the console with a code. Setting up that app gives parents the option to approve all new friends added to the child's account and even to require explicit permission through the app when the child wants to use video chat.</p>
<p>Overall, the time-limited, local-unless-reported recordings Nintendo makes here seem like a minimal intrusion on the average GameChat user's privacy. Still, if you're paranoid about Nintendo potentially seeing and hearing what's going on in your living room, it's good to at least be aware of it.</p>
<p>Below, we've copied the full text of the relevant sections of the GameChat Terms (as of June 5, 2025), which currently don't seem to be available for viewing anywhere aside from the Switch 2 consoles themselves, as far as we can tell.</p>
<blockquote><p>GameChat allows players to enjoy voice or video chat with friends while playing on Nintendo Switch 2 (video chat requires a separately sold USB camera).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-walmart-coke-pringles-why<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the stranger storylines to come out of today’s Switch 2 launch – aside from <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-box-staples-gamestop-replacement-launch-1851783684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">receipts being stapled to <em>the device itself</em></a> at a GameStop – has been preorders from Walmart, specifically, arriving with unexpected cans of Coca-Cola and Pringles. Tiny treasure troves of them, in some cases, according to posts across <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1l3wmqn/walmart_added_pringles_coke_to_my_switch_2_order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/4brandonjs4.bsky.social/post/3lqufnkjo5c2u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a>, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zhugeex.com/post/3lquqlkl6rk26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>. Why, though? I asked Walmart.</p><p>A Walmart spokesperson told Aftermath that this was, indeed, an intentional companywide effort, rather than a cheeky instance of a few stores going rogue. They said Coke and Pringles were “included in all deliveries” for the purpose of creating a “feel-good moment.” Though the rep did not specifically mention <a href="https://www.cbr.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent Switch 2 preorder cancellation woes</a>, one could surmise that Walmart might have felt more pressure to create a feel-good moment than usual.</p><p>Why Coke and Pringles specifically, though? No matter how widespread gaming becomes, Gamers – as a singular monolith and, of course, voting block – will never be able to shake certain stereotypes.</p><p>"We kinda know the stereotypical gamer, and of course they're gonna need snacks while they game," the Walmart rep told Aftermath.</p><p>All people who play games are not created equal – especially the wider-than-average audience that buys Nintendo products. There is a world in which some Switch 2 earlybirds might have preferred carrot sticks and sparkling water, and though the latter would make them reprehensible to me, personally, we have to respect that. However, by the same token, I doubt anyone has ever been upset to receive free chips and soda, so whatever. At least Walmart did not send them <a href="https://kotaku.com/i-ate-the-giant-game-controller-gummy-and-i-felt-like-1846282889" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of these things</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sony-fight-stick-project-defiant-announced"><h3>I Need To Know If Sony’s Fight Stick Is Good Or Not</h3></a><p>Along with a new game from Arc System Works, Sony's announced their first fight stick code-named Project Defiant.

Wargaming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-tanks-dev-calls-on-fans-to-help-buy-ambulances-for-ukraine-with-new-charity-bundles/1100-6518517/" data-ref-id="1100-6518517">has also raised money in support of Ukraine</a>, which would be a crime under current Russian law. Lesta Games--which took over the local Russian rights for World of Tanks and developer Mir Tankov--has repeatedly stressed that it has no relationship with Wargaming. That wasn't enough to prevent Russia from seizing control of Lesta Games.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mmo/russia-assures-world-of-tanks-players-they-wont-end-up-in-prison-as-it-takes-full-control-of-the-studio-in-charge-of-it-domestically-accusing-it-of-funnelling-funds-to-ukraine/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, Moscow has frozen all assets that belong to Lesta Games, and accused the company's co-founder, Malik Khatazhaev, of being part of an "extremist group" under the control of Wargaming CEO Viktor Kisly. The evidence cited in court reportedly drew upon footage of Wargaming's support for Ukraine.</p><p>Russian media is reportedly telling World of Tanks players in the country that they won't be arrested for spending money on the game that might have gone to Ukraine. Duma's Information Technology Committee's deputy chairman, Anton Gorelkin, also told players that Lesta Games' assets will likely be handed over to "a specialized Russian company."</p><p>It bears repeating that the World of Tanks game rights in Russia are only limited to that country. Wargaming still has its World of Tanks assets and rights in other countries. Lesta Games isn't the only video game developer to be affected by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Developer GSC Game World continued to develop <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl/" data-ref-id="5000-82469">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> even as some of the devs either fled the country or remained to fight.

                <p>One of the biggest additions to the Nintendo Switch 2 is the inclusion of HDR support. The Switch 2's LCD supports it and, more importantly, so does the dock, letting you enjoy supported games with increased color volume and brighter highlights on an HDR-supported display. But there's a setting you should probably change to get the best out of it.</p><p>Like the PlayStation 5, the Nintendo Switch 2 allows you to force HDR on for all facets of the console, from the Home Menu to all of the games you launch from it, whether they support it or not. This can have adverse effects on the look of some games, and especially so if you're connecting the Switch 2 to a display with poor or nonexistent HDR support.</p>
