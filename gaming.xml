            <p>The map masters who make the madcap map mayhem of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/straftat">Straftat</a> have made more maps for maladjusted mates to mop up their misgivings in machinegunning map-bound mockery. The magnificent maraud 'em up has mustered 37 more maps a mere month after the mapsters mapped <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-1v1-shooter-you-keep-hearing-whispers-about-now-has-an-obscene-226-maps">a further 35 maps</a> into the multiplayer mix-up, meaning that by my map math the myriad maps now measure 263 - much more than many mainstream grudge match manufacturers may have mapped.</p>
<!--more-->
<p> Ahem. </p>
<p>The maps were mentioned in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2386720/view/523090111361976393">major map update</a> that immersed new maps, mechanics and murder machinery into the muzzle misfiring must-play. The makers of the militaristic manshoot have moreover made a stun mine as a means of mystifying your miffed matchmate.   </p>
<p>There's more to mull over. The minicity of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/babbdi">Babbdi</a> now manifests as a multiplayer metropolis, a map which may emerge in your memory as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/explore-a-brutalist-city-with-climbing-axes-and-a-trumpet-in-this-great-free-indie-game">the murky municipality in the magnificent muckabout</a> of the aforementioned moniker (my most memorable moment was mounting the motorbike).</p>
<p>Another minor modification sees maps maximise movement with a mini marathon, a "Racing System" that may amass more malevolence among mates. To mollify matters militant messers may now muss up their mohawks with markedly more cosmetics. Meanwhile, the main menu has been met with a makeover.</p>
<p>The macabre mirror matches of Straftat are unmissable. In a moment when many media misfits like myself are miscontent with modern multiplayer movement shooters, the immeasurably multiplying maps of the Lemaitres make for a minorly mythical tale of unmatchable might. A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/straftat-review">marvellous</a> map for the medium to meet. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Nintendo has updated its Nintendo Account Agreement with a severe warning against "unauthorised use", in a bid to prevent emulation and piracy.</p>
<p>All those with a Nintendo account will have received an email (including Eurogamer) linking to the updated policy. And, as <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/nintendo-emulation-hacking-brick-warning-terms-of-service">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a> spotted, the wording for the Licence for Digital Products section has been altered.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://accounts.nintendo.com/term/eula/GB?lang=en-GB">agreement for UK accounts</a> now states digital products are "licensed only for personal and non-commercial use", and that any "unauthorised use of a Digital Product may result in the Digital Product becoming unusable".</p>

<p>This differs slightly from the US, which states: "You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with the foregoing restrictions Nintendo may render the Nintendo Account Services and/or the applicable Nintendo device permanently unusable in whole or in part."</p>
<p>For comparison, here's the original wording (effective since April 2021): "You are not allowed to lease, rent, sublicense, publish, copy, modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble all or any portion of the Nintendo Account Services without Nintendo's written consent, or unless otherwise expressly permitted by applicable law."</p>
<p>And here's the UK update in full: "Any Digital Products registered to your Nintendo Account and any updates of such Digital Products are licensed only for personal and non-commercial use on a User Device. Digital Products must not be used for any other purpose. In particular, without NOE's written consent, you must neither lease nor rent Digital Products nor sublicense, publish, copy, modify, adapt, translate, reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble any portion of Digital Products other than as expressly permitted by applicable law. Such unauthorised use of a Digital Product may result in the Digital Product becoming unusable."</p>
<p>The US update is as follows: "Without limitation, you agree that you may not (a) publish, copy, modify, reverse engineer, lease, rent, decompile, disassemble, distribute, offer for sale, or create derivative works of any portion of the Nintendo Account Services; (b) bypass, modify, decrypt, defeat, tamper with, or otherwise circumvent any of the functions or protections of the Nintendo Account Services, including through the use of any hardware or software that would cause the Nintendo Account Services to operate other than in accordance with its documentation and intended use; (c) obtain, install or use any unauthorised copies of Nintendo Account Services; or (d) exploit the Nintendo Account Services in any manner other than to use them in accordance with the applicable documentation and intended use, in each case, without Nintendo's written consent or express authorisation, or unless otherwise expressly permitted by applicable law. You acknowledge that if you fail to comply with the foregoing restrictions Nintendo may render the Nintendo Account Services and/or the applicable Nintendo device permanently unusable in whole or in part."</p>
<p>The <a href="https://accounts.nintendo.com/term/privacy_policy/GB?lang=en-GB">Nintendo Account Privacy Policy</a> has also been updated ahead of the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>. Now, Nintendo will be able to record video and voice chats stored on your console for a limited period of time - if you give consent.</p>
<p>This is intended for anyone who encounters "language or behaviour that may violate applicable laws", with the company able to review the last three minutes of recorded footage. This is to ensure a "safe and family-friendly online environment".</p>
<p>The update comes ahead of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-finally-explains-what-switch-2s-mysterious-c-button-does">Game Chat feature on Switch 2</a>, where players can essentially video call each other during gameplay.</p>
<p>Back in March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-latest-legal-win-against-piracy-significant-for-the-entire-games-industry">Nintendo shared a legal victory over French file-sharing company Dstorage</a>, which it stated was "significant...for the entire games industry".</p>
<p>It followed a string of moves against piracy, including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-emulator-yuzu-shuts-down-as-creator-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-24m">shutdown of Switch emulator Yuzu</a> and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-streamer-who-said-he-could-broadcast-its-pirated-games-all-day">lawsuit against a streamer who regularly played pirated copies of Nintendo games ahead of release</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/chrono-trigger-remake-considered/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Chrono Trigger remake may not be in development, but Dragon Quest series creator Yuji Horii, one of the main scenario writers and designers of the classic role-playing game, is "contemplating" developing one.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/exclusive-yuji-horii-contemplating-a-chrono-trigger-remake-1540193/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameReactor</a>, the beloved developer mentioned that it has been a long time since the original was released and that he definitely wants to do something with it. As he has received a lot of requests from fans for a Chrono Trigger remake, he is starting to contemplate it, suggesting that it would be an HD-2D remake and not a full-blown 3D remake in the vein of the Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy.</p>
<p>Besides talking about the possibility of a Chrono Trigger remake, the Dragon Quest series creator also commented on the <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/yuji-horiis-best-tribute-to-the-late-akira-toriyama-we-can-make-a-next-title-using-what-he-had-left-1540733/">future of the series</a> in relation to Akira Toriyama's unfortunate passing. After remarking on how he was shocked at learning that Toriyama-san had passed away, Horii-san revealed that he had left many things before he passed, and he believes that another entry in the series can use what he left to ensure some continuity with the rest of the franchise.</p>
<p data-start="142" data-end="587"><a href="https://wccftech.com/yuji-horii-seems-to-accidentally-confirm-a-chrono-trigger-remake-is-coming/">Last week</a>, it truly seemed like a Chrono Trigger remake was in development, as Yuji Horii reportedly confirmed it during this year's Napoli COMICON. However, expectations were quickly dashed when it was clarified that the statement was a misunderstanding caused by an interpreter error. Still, given recent statements, there's reason to remain hopeful, even if it may be some time before we can embark once again on one of the most epic journeys through time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-multiplatform-strategy-publishers-baffled-no-xbox-versions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The current Xbox multiplatform strategy is leaving certain publishers and developers baffled, so much so that they no longer see the need to develop Xbox versions of their games, considering the consolidated PlayStation dominance on the market.</p>
<p>Speaking during a<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgCII8nnKHg&amp;t=1150s"> recent podcast</a>, The Game Business's co-founder Christopher Dring commented on the current situation of the console market, highlighting how, with Xbox's multiplatform strategy, PlayStation is the dominant player more than ever before in the console space. Almost every Xbox game launching this year is also coming to PlayStation 5 at launch, like DOOM: The Dark Ages and <a href="https://wccftech.com/gears-of-war-reloaded-launches-on-pc-playstation-5-xbox-series-xs-this-summer-with-full-cross-progression-and-cross-platform-multiplayer/">Gears of War: Reloaded</a>. Only Avowed and South of Midnight did not launch on PlayStation 5 this year, but they could be the final Xbox console exclusives for the time being.</p>
<p>While the Xbox multiplatform strategy could be paying off in some way, as Microsoft's published games on PlayStation 5 are doing quite well, certain publishers and developers are reportedly baffled. From their point of view, they want the competition in the console space, and if Microsoft is releasing their games at launch on other systems, seemingly leaving their hardware behind, they don't see the need to create Xbox versions of games. As such, Christopher Dring highlighted, Microsoft will have to strike a balance in the future.</p>
<p><iframe title="Has Xbox’s Call of Duty Game Pass gamble paid off?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JgCII8nnKHg?start=1150&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Though the current multiplatform strategy seems to suggest otherwise, the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S consoles won't be the last gaming systems by Microsoft. The company is hard at work on its <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-release-2027-premium-handheld/">next-generation plans</a>, which include an Xbox-branded handheld in development together with ASUS, of which we saw the first images <a href="https://wccftech.com/asus-rog-ally-2-and-project-kennan-xbox-branded-handheld-pictured-in-us-fcc-leak/">earlier this week,</a> a full-fledged handheld system and a proper home console that will be the successor to the Xbox Series X and that will deliver the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/">largest technical&nbsp;leap to date</a>. With the current market conditions being so challenging, however, plans could definitely change, and it will be very interesting to see how the big console manufacturers will manage to overcome all these hurdles that are making gaming a very expensive hobby.</p>

            <p>I've been meaning to research the Crusades for a while. A series of vicious medieval religious wars for control of the Holy Land, initiated by the Latin Christian Church following the conquest of Jerusalem by the Rashidun Caliphate, they've become a collection of memes bandied around by today's armchair fascists. See also, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/deus-vult">"deus vult"</a>. I've explored them indirectly in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-play-a-fascist-unpacking-the-hideousness-of-the-space-marine">articles about the cultural inheritance of Warhammer 40,000</a>, but never really dipped into any history books or crusader fiction save for ailing 2004 action game Knights Of The Temple: Infernal Crusade, in which Sir Spamalot Go Bonk against a majestic sunset.</p>
<p>One place to start the R&amp;D rollout might be Knights Of The Crusades, a grand <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> 4X game in which players re-enact the period from the perspective of Christian and Muslim factions.</p><!--more-->

<p>Knights Of The Crusades launched into early access this week, and "takes you on a grand journey through the First Crusade and beyond--across the Holy Land, Spain, North Africa, and Eastern Europe." It's from the developers of the Kingdom Wars games, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unknown-pleasures-the-machine-starts">which we have enjoyed in the past</a>, and strikes me as basically Age Of Empires but Paradox-scale.</p>
<p>The main campaign sees you first tooling up to contest Jerusalem and then, growing your holdings as you "shape a world that reacts to your choices across a massive dynamic map filled with cities, pilgrim routes, shifting alliances, and relentless holy wars". There is much talk in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3440120/_Knights_of_the_Crusades/">the Steam page overview video</a> of raiding hamlets and putting innocents to the sword. Glamorising it may be, but it doesn't seem sanitised. There's the endgame prospect of, essentially, becoming the bad guys from Assassin's Creed.</p>
<p>The above describes the initial Eastern European Christian or Templar campaigns, anyway: as regards the early access update schedule, the developers are promising "a lot of focus on making every culture feel unique, with new units, building sets, and mechanics for Pagan, Orthodox, Muslim, and Western Christian factions."</p>
<p>Will it turn out to be a careful study of two hundred years of zealotry and pillage, or will it be another excuse for the scurvy alt-righteous to cosplay as Richard the Lionheart, or will it be some secret third thing? Only you, a hypothetical Crusades historian and/or time-traveller who has played the 1.0 version, can decide. Right now, I'll settle for saying that I'm abstractly interested in the idea of a campaign that begins with a Zerg rush towards a specific location, then phases into a more open-ended and murky 4X structure.</p>
<p>The obvious place to start any video game-skewed Crusades research would be <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings">Crusader Kings</a>, but I fear I am too daft and fickle to play Crusader Kings. Or too time-strapped, anyway. Still, I welcome any advice you have about either the Paradox series or other video games that investigate this terrible period and its legacy. It can't be <em>all</em> strategy sims, surely.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 patch is now live on PC and consoles, introducing some Steam Deck and PC-specific fixes alongside other improvements and balance changes.</p>
<p>The 1.2.3 patch introduces a minor Steam Deck improvement, fixing backgrounds of various menus not displaying correctly on the system, as well as various ultrawide resolutions fixes, including gameplay no longer becoming zoomed after a cutscene, combat UI not properly adapting to ultrawide resolutions, cutscenes no longer getting letterboxed in 32:9 ratio, and more. Mouse and Keyboard controls also received some improvements, such as UI button prompts in the Expedition Menu now being fully visible and triggered with Keyboard, mouse button remaining responsive after first use, and more.</p>
<p>The new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 also packs some fixes for areas where characters would get stuck on the world map, situations where Esquie would get stuck, and some balance changes. The skill that saw the most significant change is Maelle's Stendhal, which was extremely powerful in the previous version of the game, and could be easily used to one-shot even the most powerful bosses with the proper setup. You can learn more about every change the patch brings <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1903340/view/499446847117461384?l=english">here.</a></p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-1-will-continue-to-be-supported-with-new-games-by-nintendo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite the imminent launch of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know-about-nintendos-new-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, the Japanese company will continue to support the older console with new games. The confirmation arrived with <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250508_5e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo's latest quarterly financial report</a>, which included the following statement:</p>
<p><em>These are first-party titles for Nintendo Switch that have already been announced: Pokémon Legends: Z-A and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (2025), Pokémon Champions (TBD). In the Nintendo Direct held this March, we announced plans to release the titles Rhythm Heaven Groove and Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream in 2026.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Going forward, we will continue to bring out new titles for the over 100 million people worldwide who are playing Nintendo Switch.</em></p>
<p>The console's hardware sales have unsurprisingly declined year-over-year. Whereas in fiscal year 2024 Nintendo sold in (to retailers) 15.70 million units, fiscal year 2025 hardware sales stopped at 10.80 million units, a 31.2% drop. Cumulative sell-through (to consumers) lifetime sales are approaching 150 million units.</p>
<p>With such a huge install base, second only in the all-time console hardware charts to Sony's PlayStation 2 (the best-selling console of all time with over 160 million units sold), it's no wonder that Nintendo wants to keep making games for the Switch. At the same time, Nintendo also understands the importance of making exclusive titles to push consumers to buy the new Switch 2 when it lands on June 5. For instance, Mario Kart World <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-launching-exclusively-on-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will only be available on the new console</a>.</p>
<p>Will you be making the switch (pun entirely intended) right away, or will you keep playing with the previous console for some time? Let us know in the comments!</p>

            <p>Bam Margera will officially return in the remake of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a>, but as a secret skater.</p>
<p>Margera first appeared in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</a> and returned in each subsequent game in the series. However, when the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-official-announcement-reveals-deluxe-edition-with-doom-slayer">remake was announced back in March</a>, fans noticed the skater missing from the playable line-up.</p>
<p>Now, Activision has confirmed in a social media post he'll be making his return, along with a video of Margera joking about missing flights in the past due to getting sucked into the second game.</p>

<p>It's unclear why Margera was initially left out of the line-up, with fans speculating it may be related to legal issues he's faced following struggles with drug and alcohol abuse.</p>
<p>However, skating podcast The Nine Club co-host Roger Bagley claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawk-reportedly-intervened-to-get-bam-margera-in-pro-skater-3-4-remake-after-activision-said-no">Margera would still appear thanks to the insistence of Tony Hawk himself</a>.</p>
<p>"Well, here's what happened," Bagley explained in a livestream. "The game was already done. Tony called up Activision and was like, 'Hey, we're putting Bam in the thing', and they were like, 'Hey, we can't'. He goes, 'No, you're gonna do it', and basically made them fly Bam back out there to get body-scanned and everything else, and get him back in the game."</p>
<p>The last minute addition would perhaps explain why he's a secret unlockable skater, rather than being available from the start.</p>

<p>Fans also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-is-switching-up-how-thps4-works">spotted some changes to the career mode in the fourth game</a> - objectives will now need to be completed under a timer instead of exploring levels freely.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deltarune">Deltarune</a> will be a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> launch game, but developer Toby Fox has announced the RPG will be cross-compatible with both Switch consoles.</p>
<p>That means if you buy the Switch 1 version now, you can get the Switch 2 version later at no additional cost. Similarly, on the PlayStation Store, you get both the PS4 and PS5 versions at once.</p>
<p>Fox also <a href="https://toby.fangamer.com/newsletters/release-time/">confirmed the release times for the game</a>, with the Switch 2 version being available from 5th June at midnight local time in each respective region. That does mean Japanese players will have access to the game much earlier than those in the US.</p>

<p>For other platforms, though, the game will launch at a specific time globally - that's midnight Japan time on 5th June, meaning it's actually out on 4th June in other countries.</p>
<p>As such, the launch times for the game will be as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Switch 2</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>5th June 12am local time</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steam, Switch, PS4, PS5</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>5th June 12am JST</li>
<li>4th June 4pm UK</li>
<li>4th June 5pm CET</li>
<li>4th June 11am EDT</li>
<li>4th June 8am PDT</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, Fox shared a handful of trophies that will be available on the PlayStation version of the game. He noted players will need to complete the current "room" where a trophy unlocks in order to receive it.</p>
<p>He added: "But, really, I think you'll enjoy the game more if you don't pay attention to whether you get the trophies."</p>
<p>Deltarune is Fox's follow-up to the cult classic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/undertale">Undertale</a>. Though development began in 2012, it's been released episodically as a series of chapters - the first two were available for free when released in 2018 and 2021 respectively.</p>
<p>This release next month will therefore at long last mark the game's complete release.</p>
<p>"Toby Fox is in a weird position," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deltarune-is-a-game-about-playing-and-its-bloody-brilliant">Eurogamer's preview of the first two Deltarune chapters</a>. "On one level, he has every artist's dream: near unlimited resources, plenty of time, and an eager fanbase willing to lick the dregs of an idea from his outstretched fingertip. He can make whatever he likes. But whatever he makes, be it a cupcake or a clothing brand or a package holiday business, will be compared, inevitably, to Undertale."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alien-rogue-incursion">Alien: Rogue Incursion</a> will get a non-VR release on PC later this year, allowing would-be Colonial Marines access to its Weyland-Yutani black site without first requiring you to force your head inside a pair of microscopic televisions. Subtitled "Evolved Edition" - which feels like a real elbow in the kidneys for VR evangelists - it will sport "even deadlier Xenomorphs and enhanced visuals". Hopefully, that'll be enough to juice the VR version's current <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850050/Alien_Rogue_Incursion_VR/">Mixed</a> user review consensus on Steam. </p><!--more-->

<p>As you may guess from the above, I'm not a VR evangelist, partly because I can't afford a modern VR headset and don't have the living space to play VR games without injuring myself, my loved ones or my precious (scavenged) bedroom furniture. I only own an original PSVR, which is curled up in the corner of my cupboard like a dead servo-skull. It was last used to play <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-squadrons">Star Wars: Squadrons</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paper-beast">Paper Beast</a>, which are the two VR games I consider worth the discomfort, if not the expense, of VR.</p>
<p>I hear that the latest Zucker Buckets and Gaben Goggles are more comfortable to wear, but I still don't trust myself to put them on without becoming a public health hazard. I have terrible, humiliating memories of previewing some Marvel VR game at an event. Surrounded by the minions of Thanos, I swung Thor's hammer with all of my strength and clanged the PR person over the head. This happened in a converted warehouse about 300 metres wide. Now, imagine if I'd been surrounded by digital xenomorphs. That PR person would be dead.</p>
<p>So yes, I'm delighted that Rogue Incursion has decided to trade in its fancy eyestrain helmet for reassuringly non-engulfing 2D displays. Here's some story blurb about Rogue Incursion. It's the first of a two-act story, with the second act promising "new challenges and deadlier enemies".</p>
<blockquote><p>An all-new action-horror entry into the classic franchise, Alien: Rogue Incursion transforms you into Zula Hendricks-the ex-Colonial Marine hellbent on exposing Weyland-Yutani's black-site experiments-on an extremely dangerous mission to the uncharted planet Purdan. With her synth companion Davis 01 for guidance, Zula must infiltrate the infested Gemini Exoplanet Solutions research facility and survive the ever-present threat of the most cunning Xenomorphs ever encountered, with both skilled stealth and serious firepower at her disposal. And when the threat she discovers has extinction-level consequences, Zula suddenly finds herself with humanity's fate on her shoulders.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Evolved Edition launches on 30th September. Read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3655390/Alien_Rogue_Incursion_Evolved_Edition/">Steam</a>. Did you play the VR one? Let us know how you got on with it. While we're talking Alien, I'll conclude by shoving you towards <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/duskers-is-getting-a-ship-building-sequel-years-after-the-sci-fi-roguelike-scared-us-to-bits">the next game from the people behind Duskers</a>, one of the finest unofficial Alien games yet made.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<div><p><em><strong>Minimum:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>

<div><p><em><strong>Recommended:</strong></em></p>

<ul>
<li><em><strong>OS:</strong>&nbsp;Windows 10 / 11</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Processor:</strong>&nbsp;AMD Ryzen 7 5800X / Intel Core i7-12700K</em></li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The game runs on Epic's Unreal Engine 5, having moved off the proprietary engine previously used in Mafia III and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mafia-definitive-edition-old-school-gangster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mafia: Definitive Edition</a>. Because of that, some concerns regarding the often-present stuttering are inevitable. However, the game is not an open world, unlike previous entries in the franchise. Hangar 13 has instead chosen to go with a linear, narrative-driven experience, as explained by studio president Nick Baynes:</p>
<p><em>Mafia: The Old Country is a focused, linear experience that combines quality storytelling, authentic era immersion and a refined take on the familiar Mafia gameplay. That focus allows us to deliver a story that’s gritty, grounded, brutal and emotional. Embracing early 1900s era Sicily, this is a mafia origin story that follows our protagonist, Enzo Favara, as he takes the oath and works his way up Don Torrisi's crime family.</em></p>
<p>Without the need to stream in a large, explorable world, stuttering issues could be less problematic than in <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-is-an-impressive-remaster-with-dire-performance-problems-says-digital-foundry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">games like The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>. Of course, we won't know for sure until the game launches on August 8.</p>
<p>What we do know is that Mafia: The Old Country <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-gets-the-whole-mafia-franchise-including-old-country-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will also be available to stream via NVIDIA GeForce NOW on day one</a> for all those players whose PCs do not meet the above system requirements.</p>

            <p>That's a wrap on Fallout season two. And what better way to celebrate the end of a hard shoot than peeling off your skin? OK, I can think of many better ways, but that is how actor Walton Goggins decided to share the news.</p>
<p>Goggins plays Fallout's gunslinging Ghoul in the Amazon show, and as his character has been exposed to plenty of radiation and harsh conditions, the actor wears a lot of prosthetics to get the look just right.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DJZqMmDOBab/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">post on Instagram</a>, Goggins peeled off his Ghoulish outer layer and threw it at the camera. In true Goggins fashion, though, he made it look good.</p>
<p>Fellow Fallout star Ella Purnell, meanwhile, shared a more wholesome photo to mark the end of production. "aaaaand that’s a wrap on @falloutonprime Season 2 folks! 🤓," Purnell, who plays Vault dweller Lucy in show, wrote with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJZnLWFKUHw/?igsh=MTV6OHNxbWN6ZnZ5Zg%3D%3D">an accompanying photo</a> of the actress next to her on-screen dad Kyle MacLachlan.</p>

<p>The Fallout X account also shared the news, writing "Achievement unlocked! Fallout Season 2 has wrapped production." The account shared Goggins' skin shedding shots, so feel free to enjoy those below.</p>

<p>Fallout's first season was a huge hit for Amazon, and was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">quickly picked up for a second season</a>. Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy - who executive produce the show via Kilter Films - said they couldn't "wait to blow up the world all over again".</p>
<p>As for what we can expect with the second season, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-will-blow-the-first-out-of-the-water-star-walton-goggins-says">Goggins has assured fans it will blow the first season out of the water</a>. New cast members reported to be joining Goggins and co. for Fallout season two include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-reportedly-adds-marvel-actor-kumail-nanjiani-to-its-cast">Kumail Nanjiani as "a high-ranking official within the Brotherhood of Steel"</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-tv-series-second-season-lands-home-alone-star">Macaulay Culkin as "a crazy genius-type character"</a>.</p>

            <p>Rumours of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> remake briefly bubbled up before being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-sorry-put-the-party-poppers-away-chrono-trigger-isnt-getting-a-remake-as-far-as-anyone-knows-anyway">swiftly pin-popped last week</a>, following a mistranslation of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-11-best-jrpgs-on-pc-in-2024">JRPG</a>'s writer, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest">Dragon Quest</a> creator Yuji Horii at a panel. The potion-swilling public were understandably chuffed (you still can't Google Horii's name without being served videos of pog-faced excite-os screaming "Chrono Trigger Remake Confirmed!!!"), but it soon turned out that no such remake was actually planned.</p>
<p>Based on a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/exclusive-yuji-horii-contemplating-a-chrono-trigger-remake-1540193/">Gamereactor</a> at the same event, it sounds like Horii has been considering doing something with Chrono Trigger after all, which isn't too surprising after Square Enix said they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-celebrating-chrono-trigger-anniversary-with-new-projects-sparking-re-release-hopes">planned to celebrate</a> the game's 30th anniversary with "various projects" back in March. From Gamereactor:</p>
<!--more-->
<blockquote><p>"Yes, it is. It has been a long time. Yes, I want to do something", Horii-san tells Gamereactor when asked about the celebrations for the Chrono Trigger 30th Anniversary. "Currently, Dragon Quest has seen III, I-II [HD-2D] Remakes. I get a lot of requests for the remake of Chrono Trigger as well, and so I am starting to contemplate on it",</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is nice, although not all that exciting to me personally for a couple of reasons. Firstly, Chrono Trigger is still extremely playable, and secondly, I've never actually understood what all the fuss was about. I guess I view Chrono Trigger like I view The Beatles: sure, I can accept they pushed the medium forward, but I don't actually care to listen to them for fun except about a third of Sergeant Pepper's. Also, I'm still salty that Frog turned out to be a human named pissing Glenn. Glenn! Just let your talking frog knight be a talking frog knight, game.</p>
<p>That said, the fairground trial scene blew my mind when I first played it, so I can only imagine how wild it was in 1995 to have a JRPG call you a stinking thief for eating a man's lunch after you'd been conditioned to treat layabout items as a purely ludic contrivance. Still, give me a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Arms_(video_game)">Wild Arms</a> remake over this any day. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/airships-dinosaurs-and-robots-meet-in-spiritual-successor-to-chrono-trigger-rpg-threads-of-time">Threads Of Time looks nice though</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-runs-at-1440p-on-the-nintendo-switch-2-with-nvidia-dlss-support/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a Japanese press release <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/897/G089776/20250508027/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported by 4Gamer</a>, SEGA (the game's publisher in Japan) and Avalanche Software have revealed some technical details of the Nintendo Switch 2 port of Hogwarts Legacy.</p>
<p><strong><em>Enhanced Visuals</em></strong><br>
<em>Experience deeper immersion with significantly upgraded graphics, including NVIDIA DLSS support, improved lighting and shadow animation quality, and anti-aliasing. Experience up to 1440p resolution in TV mode and 1080p and HDR in handheld mode.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Smooth Movement</em></strong><br>
<em>Move seamlessly through the open world, including Hogsmeade and its shops, without loading screens.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Smooth Flight</em></strong><br>
<em>Thanks to the improved performance of the Nintendo Switch 2, not only is the frame rate higher than the Nintendo Switch version, but the loading times are also shorter. You can fly around the Hogwarts grounds and beyond comfortably.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Supports mouse operation with Joy-Con 2</em></strong><br>
<em>Supports mouse operation with Joy-Con 2 controller. Enjoy your preferred play style.</em></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 hardware <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-confirmed-to-support-nvidia-dlss-and-ray-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution</a>, but developers can choose whether to actually use it or not. It honestly seems like a no-brainer, though, especially for games that have already implemented the feature on the PC version, like Hogwarts Legacy or <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 also technically supports ray tracing, but there's no mention of it being implemented in this game, even though the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions (and, of course, the PC version) support it. Indeed, it's highly unlikely that open world games will implement ray tracing in any capacity on the hybrid console, as it would simply be too taxing on the hardware. It could, however, be supported for simpler, smaller games. Anyway, the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Hogwarts Legacy will be available at the console's launch (June 5). The game size is 24 GB.</p>

            <p>New York's Strong National Museum of Play has welcomed four new entries into its Video Game Hall Of Fame: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a>, Goldeneye, 1981's arcade side-scroller Defender, and the virtual pet Tamagotchi. It's that last one that's by far the most interesting of the four picks, and I must admit, I'd never actually thought about Tamagotchi in these exact terms before.</p>

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azd68Z8H8Oc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>Here's The Strong on Tamagotchi's inclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Beyond cultivating nostalgia, Tamagotchi offered a distinct form of play apart from the prevailing popularity of video game electronics at the time. In the book Millennial Monsters: Japanese Toys and the Global Imagination (2006), scholar Anne Allison argued that Tamagotchi provided young users with feelings of connection, intimacy, and personalization, a respite from competition and fighting games."</p></blockquote>
<p>This is purely speculative on my part - I'd love for someone to give me a little more context or insight - but the first Tamagotchi was released in 1996, the same year as SNES farming game and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> influence Harvest Moon and the original Pokémon. Taken together, that's an incredibly influential year for contemporary <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-non-violent-video-games">non violent</a> or "cosy" titles, and I do wonder if these three games (or two games and Tamagotchi, depending on your view) themselves share common influences.</p>
<p>When I say I'd never thought of Tamagotchi as a videogame, I don't mean it in "not a real game sense", either. Just that it hadn't actually occurred to me to think about in what we might broadly call videogame canon or history. But I came around the idea pretty quickly, honestly. Now I think about, Tamagotchi might actually have been my first exposure to permadeath. I once lost one for months, eventually finding it under my bed to behold my beloved pet dying in a mountain of its own shit. Brutal stuff.</p>
<p>As for Quake's inclusion, The Strong focuses on its use of 3D space, as well as the popularity of its competitive multiplayer "central to the creation of esports as an industry". It was also, <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/games/quake/">they point out</a>, "the first shooter to get widespread mod support", spawning the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a>.</p>
<p>These four additions bring the hall of fame's total up to 49 games. The earliest entry is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spacewar">Spacewar!</a>, and the most recent is The Last Of Us. We like to complain about irritating uses of punctuation in game names here at RPS but I suppose they've been with us since the beginning. I'm now wishing they'd named The Last Of Us something like Panic! At The Abandoned Supermarket just for the sake of symmetry.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Grand strategy country crusher <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/europa-universalis-v">Europa Universalis 5</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-grand-strategy-game-from-paradox-is-europa-universalis-5">announced yesterday</a>, revealing a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/everything-we-know-about-europa-universalis-5">complex century-spanning historical sim</a>. But one thing we still don't know is the price or how it'll be sold. If you want to buy the previous game in the series, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/europa-universalis-iv">Europa Universalis 4</a>, you'll find a slew of subscription models and a big library of DLC alongside <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/236850/Europa_Universalis_IV/">the base game</a>. Which might cause some fans to worry that the sequel will launch with some sort of similar subscription model. But this won't be the case, say developers Paradox Tinto. They're going to sell it normally. At least for now.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Obviously, when we have enough DLCs there will be subscription models, because subscription models are great," said game director Johan Andersson in an interview with RPS. But when asked if the publisher was planning to have a subscription model straight out of the gate, he said no.</p>
<p>"No, unless we have DLC. I mean, of course, I would love to have a subscription model where people paid me five euros a month, or ten euros, whatever. But unless we actually have any content, I'm not sure people want [to be told]: 'Hey! Pay ten euros now for January, February, March... and in April you'll get DLC!' No."</p>
<p>Paradox started experimenting with subscriptions to their biggest and most expandofied games like EU4 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-are-experimenting-with-a-subscription-service-to-play-europa-universalis-iv-and-its-dlc">back in 2020</a>, and later offered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stellaris-launches-expansion-subscription-offering-access-to-all-dlc-for-850-per-month">a subscription to all Stellaris's space stuff</a> in 2024. It costs £8.50 a month and you don't get to keep anything when you unsubscribe. You can still buy each of these games normally, of course. The sub is just an option - one I don't really recommend. It certainly wouldn't make a lot of sense for the publisher's latest grand strategy sequel at launch, and the devs agree. </p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun / Paradox Interactive</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But there is another familiar problem for Paradox. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/europa-universalis">Europa Universalis</a> 5 will be sized up next to its predecessor. How can the new strategy game compete with a decade of DLCs and extras? Will there be enough in the base game of Europa Universalis 5 to entice veterans to hop over to the new game? Andersson thinks so. </p>
<p>"Almost all of the EU4 features that are in its DLCs right now are part of the base game in EU5," he told us. This means EU5 will inherit all of the systems that EU4 has built up over years of expansions and updates. Which theoretically gives it as much value as the entire catalogue of EU4 expansions. Of course, players will be able to verify that promise once EU5 is fully released.</p>
<p>As for DLC plans, Paradox Tinto are not worrying about that just yet, says Andersson. </p>
<p>"We have visions," says Andersson, "but I think it's a bad idea to write ideas and work on things... before you have wrapped up and shipped the game. That's my experience. Of course, salespeople want [to say]: 'we need to have 12 DLCs ready ASAP!' But, yeah... I don't want to do it because it takes away from the base game."</p>
<p>That's quite refreshing and reassuring to hear. Paradox are sometimes accused of milking it when it comes to their many cosmetic packs and expandobits. They have even been accused of "fixing" games with paid DLC - something the company's CEO refuted by comparing their process of making games to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-respond-to-the-accusation-that-they-fix-games-with-paid-dlc-we-try-to-find-a-middle-ground">painting a piece of art</a>. "When is a painting done?" he mused. "When you stop painting it, I guess."</p>
<p>My own view is that Paradox DLC is always, by its nature, going to be hit or miss. And you can easily dodge the duff stuff by reading up on reviews. It's the best way to tell what's a thin soup of hats and what is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/im-sorry-for-all-the-dead-bodies-i-left-behind-while-walking-from-ireland-to-china-in-crusader-kings-3s-brilliant-new-dlc">rich stew of adventure</a>. You don't need a subscription model when you've got Rock Paper Shotgun, is what I'm saying, friend. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Yesterday, Paradox Interactive unveiled Europa Universalis V, a new installment in the popular grand strategy game. Fans have been waiting for this since Europa Universalis IV launched in 2013. In that regard, they've waited as long as GTA fans.</p>
<p>Europa Universalis V promises more detailed diplomacy, a more sophisticated economic model, a revamped military system, and greater logistical depth. According to Paradox, it offers the following improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>New and Larger Map: Start as a mighty emperor, local chieftain, or warlord in a more detailed and accurate world map with hundreds of playable societies and varied terrain.</li>
<li>Longer Time Scale: Begin in 1337 and guide a nation through centuries of historical change, including the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, and other historical ages.</li>
<li>Population-Based System: Rule over detailed populations with cultural, religious, and class dynamics.</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter is particularly interesting, as the developers are touting that populations are represented on the map in detail for the first time in the franchise. This means provinces may be divided by religion or culture. The player's choices will determine how these populations fare under their leadership.</p>
<p><iframe title="Europa Universalis V - Official Announcement Show" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YaZcN-eVta8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Europa Universalis V doesn't have a release date yet, but you can already add the game to your Steam wishlist <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3450310/Europa_Universalis_V/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">right here</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-simply-do-not-know-where-to-start-writing-about-clair-obscur.1184913/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/clair-obscur-expedition-33-impressions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When you write about games for a living, you rarely just sit down and write about a whole damn game. Even reviews, which some people think <em>should</em> be that, are hopefully something more focused and nuanced. Impressions of a game tend to involve the writer choosing a hook, an angle, something to peg their thoughts on before expanding on them over the course of an article.</p><p>It's why, for example, my <em>Infinite Wealth</em> "review"<a href="https://aftermath.site/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-spoilers-kazuma-kiryu-ending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> ended up</a> as<a href="https://aftermath.site/infinite-wealth-ichiban-kasuga-friendship-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> two separate pieces</a>, or why<a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-ending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I wrote about <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows'</em> ending specifically</a>; it's easier for everyone, me and you, if we just find one thing to talk about in detail. And normally, that's pretty easy to do! I wrote about <em>Shadows</em>' ending because it really stood out, and the <em>Yakuza </em>posts were based on themes and impressions that became clear over my time with the game, which I thought were a lot more interesting than talking about "graphics" and "difficulty".</p><p>This week, though, I am having <em>problems</em>. I have been playing <em>Clair Obscur</em> non-stop, it's that good, but every time I go to write about it I find myself struggling to find that hook. Not because there's nothing good or interesting to write about, but because <em>everything </em>in <em>Clair Obscur </em>is good and interesting.</p><figure></figure><p>That's OK, maybe I can pivot to writing about stuff I don't like and...hrm. I guess traversing the levels can suck sometimes, if I have to name <em>one </em>thing I am not completely enamoured by. They can get a bit sprawly and repetitive at times, and you can get lost if you're not careful; they maybe need a map or clearer marker system or something. It gets a bit tedious. But like, that's it? I can't pad a whole post out into me complaining about that.</p><p>Everything else I cast my eyes, hands and ears over is just the best. The music rules. I love the art design. The battles have <em>got me</em>, someone who doesn't normally dabble in this genre outside of <em>Persona </em>and the odd <em>Final Fantasy</em>. The writing is great, the voice acting is great, the interlocking magic and abilities systems are surprisingly elegant.</p><p>I could write about any one of these things, sure, but every time I've tried I look over at everything else and it feels like I'm about to adopt only one kitten from an entire litter, and those left behind are looking at me with the biggest, saddest eyes. Awwww, character art, I love you, but I can't write about you <em>and </em>Charlie Cox, there are only so many hours in a day!</p><p>Though...ah. Maybe this <em>is </em>the hook. That the game is hookless. And that in my failed attempts to avoid writing about a whole game maybe I have to, just this once, if only to emphasise how fucking good it is.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-analysis-details-rockstar"><h3>A Video Game Trailer Maker’s Take On The Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer</h3></a><p>"If this was a better trailer, then people would be that much more hyped.

                <p>Mafia: The Old Country is heading to PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC on August 8 and preorders are up at digital storefronts. The linear action game will focus on storytelling and immersion, providing fans with a nuanced new take on the series. Two different versions of the game are up for grabs, and there are preorder bonuses for reserving a copy in advance. Best of all, the <strong>standard edition is priced at just $50</strong>--a nice change of pace from all of today’s $70 and $80 releases.</p><h2>Mafia: The Old Country Preorder Bonuses</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4490903-mafiapreorders.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490903" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4490903-mafiapreorders.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490903"></a><figcaption>Mario: The Old Country</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4490903-mafiapreorders.jpg"></figure><p>All Mafia: The Old Country preorders include the Soldato DLC Pack, which offers the following in-game items:</p><ul><li>“Soldato” Outfit</li><li>“Scannaturi Speciale” Knife</li><li>“Tesoro” Horse and Accessories</li><li>“Lupara” Charm</li></ul><p>You can also sign up for a free 2K account to unlock the “Garzia Tumulto Race Car,” plus additional benefits for other Mafia games.
