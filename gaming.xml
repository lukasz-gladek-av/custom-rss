		<p>The original Gothic games played an important role in the history of PC RPGs. Pioneering the RPG subgenre affectionately nicknamed ‘Eurojank’, their immersive worlds and open-ended style attracted a legion of passionate fans. While the third game in the series saw a change of emphasis, titles such as Risen and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/12/21/elex-review/">Elex</a> continued the legacy. It was therefore a huge disappointment when longtime developers Piranha Bytes closed down in 2024, just one of a number of victims of the Embracer Group’s irresponsible purchasing spree.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the legacy of Piranha Bytes games can still be seen in the indie scene and particularly through the long-awaited release of a full Gothic 1 Remake by Alkimia Interactive. Having now been hands-on with the first playable demo – <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1297900/Gothic_1_Remake/">available today via Steam Next Fest</a> – I can spill the beans on how it holds up to the original, both in terms of nostalgia and more recent memories of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gothic 1 Remake | Nyras Prologue Demo Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_3VLY-B-LTg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The original Gothic saw you follow the journey of the iconic Nameless Hero as he was thrown into the magical prison known as The Colony, in which prisoners are forced to mine for precious ore to supply the Kingdom of Myrtana with weaponry to fight off the invading hordes of orcs. This is such a classic fantasy story that still has resonance some 24 years later, but the real draw of the game was the freedom it allowed you in your adventure.</p>
<p>Gothic holds a special place in my own memories, but having replayed it in part recently it is clear where the ‘jank’ part of the subgenre came from. Gothic’s controls were an acquired taste at best and the ease with which you can venture off the path and meet instant death is a far cry from the handholding approach of more modern titles. My main hopes for the Remake were for it to improve the former, but still maintain the challenge of the latter and the demo goes some way to demonstrating that this has been achieved.</p>

<p>Rather than offering the start of the game itself, the demo takes the form of a prologue with a separate character in the spotlight – Nyras (who plays a small role in the original game; a nice nod to longtime fans). The demo is very aware that this could be seen as a big change from the original and most of the loading screen tips serve as confirmation that the Nameless Hero will be the protagonist in the full release. This defensiveness feels a little overdone, but it’s understandable. Nyras also finds himself thrown into The Colony, but the world is deliberately much more closed off in this demo.</p>

<p>Graphically, this remake is obviously a million miles ahead of the original. While not at the very cutting edge of modern graphics, it is far more detailed and benefits from beautiful lighting and design. Animation is much smoother and a vast number of extra animations are included allowing for quality of life improvements such as being able to pick things up without having to sheathe your weapon. There is still a sense of stiffness in the movement though and I hope that this is being refined before the full release.</p>
<p>You can talk to other returning characters, such as Diego, and these show a high level of detail and good voice acting. Background dialogue is suitably earthy and it feels like a land occupied by suspicious criminals. There isn’t a great deal of content here (in many ways it’s a proof of concept and the main game has developed a long way on a separate path since this build) but you get to follow a couple of questlines and carry out some exploration.</p>

<p>Your first challenge is to find a weapon and there are an encouraging number of ways to achieve this. You can either dive into the large pool at the start of the map, explore the caves, or find a sword near the first quest NPC. A weapon is essential, though, as even the most minor of enemies can kill you in seconds. This danger is particularly apparent if you rush headlong into combat with multiple enemies so it’s clear that the feel of the original has been maintained.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the changes aren’t restricted to the graphical details. A far more modern inventory system has been added which feels much more user friendly than the original – though it’s not really utilised in this demo. You can loot a vast number of items still, although there wasn’t a sign of the risk and reward stealing mechanic that is so important to the original. Controls feel much more in keeping with modern games but, as mentioned above, the animations leave it feeling a little stiffer than the original, especially in combat.</p>
<p>All in all, the Gothic 1 Remake holds a lot of promise, looking set to retain the feel and challenge of the original whilst updating the interface and graphics to appeal to modern gamers. It remains a crying shame that Piranha Bytes are no more, but Alkimia seem to be honouring their legacy in all the right ways.</p>
<p>Now to replay the original on Switch before the Remake is released. Weirdly it’s the version that works best for modern controls…</p>

			<p>Bossa Games, previously known as Bossa Studios, has made the unfortunate decision to lay off more staff, with the previous round of redundancies happening at the end of 2023, leaving 40 employees behind to work on its upcoming project, Lost Skies. At the moment, it's uncertain how many staff have been impacted by this latest round of layoffs. The news broke when a statement was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bossa-games_activity-7298367748902912001-h4lt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared on LinkedIn</a> from Co-Founded and Co-CEO Henrique Olifiers. The full statement reads as follows:</p>
<p><em>The past couple of years have brought a significant amount of disruption to the games industry at large, with treasured studios, teams and games being shut down or significantly scaled back. We've all read the news, suffered through the changes ourselves or seen it through the eyes of peers and colleagues affected.</em></p>
<p><em>In our view, this is not a phase, it's a fundamental transformation of the games industry, a reshape of how games are made and by what kinds of teams. The industry of two years in the future will not look like the industry of two years ago.</em></p>
<p><em>We've had to make the painful decision to scale back, focusing on the late-stage production of Lost Skies and its upcoming launch, ensuring the game is successfully released and evolved for its players for the foreseeable future. Once Lost Skies is established and enjoying live operations, we'll reshape into small teams working independently on novel game ideas brought to the players as early as possible.</em></p>
<p><em>This means saying very difficult goodbyes to extremely talented and treasured colleagues, truly some of the best people in the games industry, who have been part of our journey for a long time. We wish we had found a way of navigating this turmoil without resorting to the decision of scaling back our teams, but unfortunately we've failed in this endeavour.</em></p>
<p><em>To our industry peers, who undoubtedly are also fighting their own difficult battles, we wish you all the luck and resilience - and if you are in the enviable position to hire someone, we can't recommend anyone better than a former Bossian.</em></p>
<p>A <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-gameplay-trailer-drops-for-lost-skies-showcasing-floating-islands-more/">new gameplay trailer</a> for Lost Skies was released just two weeks ago, showcasing the floating islands and the traversal system that players will get to experiment with in the upcoming title. At the moment, Lost Skies still doesn't have a release date, so it's uncertain as to how long those excited for the game will have to wait for its release.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-15th-anniversary-livestream-april</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nier-15th-anniversary-livestream-revealed-for-april.1117086/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-15th-anniversary-livestream-april<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has announced that it will hold a&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>15th anniversary livestream in April, and that the stream will feature appearances from key franchise figures.</p>

<p>Per the description for the stream on YouTube (for which we're using machine translation), the presentation will last for around two and a half hours, and will feature "the latest information on events and merchandise" commemorating the franchise's 15th anniversary.</p>

<p>Additionally, developers will hold "talks", and a "mini live performance" will be featured as well, with pianist Shotaro Seo and guitarist Takanori Goto seemingly set to perform, although we don't know what they'll be performing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nier-15th-anniversary-livestream-replicant.jpg?itok=suwFcq76 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nier-15th-anniversary-livestream-replicant.jpg?itok=EKYTcq45 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>franchise will be celebrated in the upcoming 15th anniversary livestream.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, the question on every&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>fan's lips is whether or not a new game will be announced during the stream. Square Enix hasn't given any indication that this is the case, but the franchise's 15th anniversary seems to me to be the ideal time to reveal a new game, assuming such a thing is in the works.</p>

<p>We're also nearing (or perhaps that should be&nbsp;<em>Nier</em>ing) the eighth anniversary of Square Enix and PlatinumGames'&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata</em>, which remains the last major tentpole franchise release, discounting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-replicant-release-date-and-editions-announced" rel="nofollow">2021's&nbsp;<em>Nier Replicant</em>&nbsp;remaster</a>.</p>

<p><em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>has proven to be a solid little seller for Square Enix; the game has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-automata-sales-9m" rel="nofollow">racked up over nine million sales</a> since launching back in 2017, although whether that's enough to match Square Enix's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">notoriously high targets</a> is anyone's guess.</p>

<p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Automata&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Replicant</em>, the&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>franchise also got itself a mobile action RPG in the form of&nbsp;<em>Nier Reincarnation</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-reincarnation-has-opened-pre-registrations-for-ios-and-android" rel="nofollow">launched in 2021</a>&nbsp;and ran for a few years before <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-reincarnation-shutting-down" rel="nofollow">shutting down in April last year</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nier-15th-anniversary-livestream-engels.jpg?itok=YOq7M7oz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nier-15th-anniversary-livestream-engels.jpg?itok=-b5d2mGB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hopefully,&nbsp;<em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>won't be the last major&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>game.</figcaption></figure><p>Two and a half hours is a mighty long time, but it's entirely possible Square Enix intends to use that time simply having&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>personnel reminisce about the franchise, which still wouldn't be a bad way to spend the stream.</p>

<p>In any case, the&nbsp;<em>Nier&nbsp;</em>15th anniversary livestream is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/3FQD3gUBShw" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">set to air on April 19th</a> at 6pm Japanese time, which works out at around 5am Eastern or 2am Pacific. Looks like you're going to have to wake up early for this one.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time Sawyer has mentioned such a project. He said last September that <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/a-pillars-of-eternity-tactics-game-has-been-pitched-by-a-number-of-obsidian-devs-because-fans-will-play-a-lot-of-them-even-if-theyre-not-that-good/">a few developers at Obsidian</a> have "floated" the idea. According to Sawyer, the audience "is not huge, typically, but very passionate. People that are into [strategy] RPGs, tactical RPGs, they'll play a lot of them, even if they're not that good. It's a hard one to make a case for," but "every once in a while we bring it up and go 'oh, we could maybe…"</p>
<p>The Pentiment dev returned to these sentiments in the recent livestream. "Tactics games have a very enthusiastic fanbase, but the fanbase is not humungous," he said. "It's sort of like that floor is high - like, if you make a decent tactics game, those people are gonna buy it. But if all of them buy it, that's still not that many people."</p>
<p>Obsidian Chief Egg Overseer Feargus Urquhart recently revealed in <a href="https://youtu.be/FB9qwiskL18">an Ian Games interview</a> that the studio was still fairly modestly sized for the big budget RPG space, with nearly 300 employees compared to, for example, CD Projekt Red's 615 or Larian's 470 (<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/obsidian-ceo-reveals-its-just-half-the-size-of-many-triple-a-studios-even-as-it-prepares-to-launch-its-4th-game-in-5-years/">thanks PC Gamer</a>). That's not gigantic for a studio that has another RPG project, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">Outer Worlds 2</a>, following Avowed later this year, so it's not surprising they'd want to be careful with how they allocate resources. Their approach to financials is refreshing too, saying in a recent DICE talk that they go into each project assuming "mild success" rather than gangbusters.</p>
<p>I'm extrapolating a bit here, but it sounds to me like (at the studio level at least) they're a team that want to make money so they can make more games rather than the depressingly common inverse. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/avowed-review">Whatever I thought of Avowed</a>, that feels like something to celebrate.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With <em>Captain America: Brave New World </em>and <em>Thunderbolts* </em>wrapping up Phase Five in the ongoing superhero saga before <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps </em>arrives this summer to kick off Phase Six, we thought we’d take a look back at all the ups and downs in the Marvel machine’s cinematic output. Let’s see which movies still stand out after nearly two decades of the MCU, and which are better off forgotten.</p></div><div><p>The second <em>Thor </em>flick has widely become the default selection for worst Marvel movie in series rankings. The first two <em>Thor</em> movies are sauceless but the pieces are there for something great, as <em>Thor: Ragnarok </em>would prove six years after the original. <em>The Dark World</em>, however,<em> </em>utterly lacks the personality and zest that future installments would find. Tom Hiddleston and Chris Hemsworth have great chemistry as Loki and Thor and sell some of the film’s heavier subject matter, but they can only carry it so far when it’s weighed down by some of the least interesting lore in the series and a villain I couldn’t identify in a line-up. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>2021’s <em>Eternals </em>boasted a star-studded cast and an interesting premise following immortal superpowered aliens, but neither could elevate what was ultimately a wooden film that failed to adequately utilize its talent. Additionally, almost everything that happens in this movie has been rendered meaningless by subsequent plot developments, so all that’s left is the interpersonal drama of an ensemble cast that Marvel was quick to cast aside when the audience didn’t latch on. It’s a shame that Marvel had more incredible acting talent on screen than in any film since <em>Endgame</em>, and they just squandered it with a lifeless script. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>The original <em>Thor </em>is better than <em>The Dark World</em>, generating some intrigue as it gradually reveals Marvel’s spin on Norse mythology, but that’s about it. Hiddleston is, once again, the standout in a cast that could have thrived with a better script, but <em>Thor </em>is mostly a dry fantasy film masquerading as a superhero romp. It’s got soap opera dramatics that make the most of <em>some </em>of its actors’ talents, but without the wit and humor of later films, it’s just a forgettable hero’s journey. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>How do you mess up a movie with Paul Rudd, Jonathan Majors, Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Douglas, and Corey Stoll? By employing the blandest CGI imaginable, which makes Stoll’s M.O.D.O.K. look like a poorly resized .jpeg with arms, and by giving us a Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors) who is too easily defeated given his multiversal powers. When the most exciting part of the movie is the post-credits scene with hundreds of Kang variants yelling in a colosseum, you know it’s a failure. In its favor, the meticulous and heartfelt unraveling of Kang’s villainous nature through exceptional dialogue between him and Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) was some of the most emotionally grounded work in the entire series. Overall, though, the MCU would’ve been better without this rushed movie. — Keith Nelson Jr</p></div><div><p>The second movie in the MCU is often forgotten despite being a mostly serviceable origin story for the big green guy. <em>The Incredible Hulk </em>stars Edward Norton, who would be replaced as Bruce Banner by Mark Ruffalo in future appearances, and as such, a lot of people who come in late to the Marvel universe tend to skip it. You’re not missing much if you already know the Hulk’s whole deal, though some references to its characters in <em>Captain America: Brave New World </em>might go over your head. But this was before the MCU became the juggernaut it did, and it’s mostly a bog-standard superhero origin story that Marvel wouldn’t revisit for 17 years. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>While <em>Thor: Ragnarok </em>would perfectly adapt Marvel’s take on Norse gods into a whipsmart, slapstick action comedy, 2022’s <em>Love and Thunder </em>is the result of too much of a good thing. <em>Ragnarok </em>director Taika Waititi also brings his signature brand of rapid-fire joke delivery to this follow-up, but it’s devoid of most of the thematic richness that made its predecessor both sugary sweet and filling. <em>Love and Thunder</em> cranks the jokes up to 11 and makes Thor such a goofball that some of the more emotional beats are hard to take seriously. The movie has easily Natalie Portman’s best performance as Jane Foster and Christian Bale makes the most of his appearance as Gorr the God Butcher, but beyond that, the movie is empty calories. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p><em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier </em>wasn’t my favorite MCU show, but at least it was willing to reckon with what it meant for a Black man to wield the Captain America shield and represent a country that has done nothing but bring Black people down. <em>Captain America: Brave New World </em>finally gives Sam Wilson the suit, but it’s so preoccupied with maintaining the status quo that it doesn’t so much as touch anything controversial. Rather than advocate for people suffering under a broken system, it fence-sits and suggests we just need to see the good in people. The people who are wielding their power to strangle the life out of the marginalized? No thanks. A more radical version of this story, or even one that was consistent with the one <em>The Falcon and Winter Soldier </em>started, would burn it all down. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>The second <em>Iron Man </em>is easily the least memorable entry in the Robert Downey Jr. trilogy. Sure, it introduces Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow and brings in Don Cheadle to take on the role of War Machine, but in the grand scheme of the MCU it’s not all that impactful. Downey remains captivating as tortured genius Tony Stark, though. The MCU was still finding its footing as an interconnected web of heroes and villains in this era, and it would reach greater heights with Stark in the future. But this sequel is mostly just a serviceable follow-up to the film that started the whole thing. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Florence Pugh carries <em>Black Widow</em>, one of the most confounding MCU movies to come out this side of <em>Endgame</em>. It’s a prequel that would have felt more appropriate in the first phase of films but mostly exists to give Scarlett Johansson flowers after she’d played a supporting role in everybody else’s movies. She deserved it, at least. Natasha was dragged into every female archetype Marvel could conceive of as she played second fiddle to a bunch of men and then died in <em>Endgame</em>. By the time <em>Black Widow </em>came out in 2021, going back to finally fill out the backstory of one of the MCU’s oldest mainstays felt odd, but the end result is still a pretty fun spy film that introduces a new dysfunctional family to the Marvel mix. Again, Pugh’s performance as Natasha’s sister Yelena is worth the price of admission. Otherwise? It’s fine. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Robert Downey Jr. is the person who unlocks your inner badass, Tom Holland is the person who reminds you of the innocence of youth, and Chris Hemsworth is the person who reminds you that you’ll never look as good as him. Unquestionably, Paul Rudd as Scott Lang is the most relatable, average MCU superhero, and <em>Ant-Man</em> is the movie that makes that abundantly clear. The climactic duel between Ant-Man and Yellowjacket on a toy train set—a scenario that’s destructive on a microscopic level and yet completely harmless on a normal scale—encompasses the movie’s penchant for artfully balancing high-stakes drama with genuine comedic relief. Plus, this is the movie that introduces the MCU to the Quantum Realm, a crucial yet sorely underused pocket of the MCU that was the key reason Thanos’s <em>Infinity War</em> snap could be reversed in <em>Endgame</em>. In many ways, <em>Ant-Man</em> is one of the most important films in the MCU canon, and is definitely one of its most fun viewing experiences. — Keith Nelson Jr</p></div><div><p>The middle entry in the MCU’s <em>Spider-Man</em> (as of now)<em> </em>trilogy isn’t a bad or boring movie. Instead, it’s just mostly forgettable. A big part of the problem is that it is so intertwined with the MCU, and especially with <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>, which hit theaters just 13 weeks earlier, that it almost feels like an <em>Avengers </em>epilogue more than a proper standalone Spidey movie. And sure, Jake Gyllenhaal is great as Mysterio, but anybody even slightly familiar with Spider-Man knew he was a baddie the whole time. Making matters worse, revealing that his villainous origin is directly connected to the original<em> Iron Man </em>movie just makes this oddball European side quest feel even less like a proper <em>Spider-Man </em>sequel. — Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><p>The second <em>Avengers </em>film is full of fun moments held together by gum and string. We’re past the catty banter of the first movie and the Avengers are mostly friends now. The bit in which heroes take turns trying to lift Thor’s hammer is a classic MCU scene that riffs on the group’s dynamic without devolving into <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/ust2i3/how_do_i_identify_whedonisms_in_my_writing_and/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/ust2i3/how_do_i_identify_whedonisms_in_my_writing_and/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whedonisms</a></span>, and James Spader’s monologues as killer AI Ultron are spine-chilling. <em>Age of Ultron</em>’s greatest asset, however, is the introduction of would-be staples like Vision and Scarlet Witch. Unfortunately, it falls apart in its attempts to tie everything that’s happening into a neat bow to later be unwrapped in <em>Infinity War</em>, struggling to balance its ties to the extended universe with being a coherent standalone film. But hey, at least we got the cool moment of Vision picking up Thor’s hammer without breaking a sweat. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p><em>Ms. Marvel</em> was, I think, Disney+’s most successful TV series set in the MCU. Obviously <em>WandaVision</em> was stunning, but the lower stakes, smaller scale nature of <em>Ms. Marvel</em> belied a show that had enormous, intricate depth. Its coming-of-age focus, echoing the best of <em>Spider-Man</em>, combined with its portrayal of a loving, complicated, and ebullient Muslim-American family, made it feel so warm. And on top of this, it was an astonishing history lesson about the horrors of the 1947 partition of India. You should watch it. Also, you should watch it as a primer for <em>The Marvels</em>, in which we see the union of Captain Marvel, Ms. Marvel, and Monica Rambeau, in conflict with the Kree.</p><p><em>The Marvels</em> may not have the greatest narrative in the MCU, but it’s bursting with happiness, and that’s something we should grab with both arms. It’s just lovely! It’s lovely people being lovely in difficult circumstances, and it offers the most wonderful opportunity for Kamala Khan’s family to shine once more. I love that this movie exists. —John Walker </p></div><div><p>Bringing Benedict Cumberbatch’s Stephen Strange into the MCU gave Marvel an easy magical out it’s overrelied on in situations that followed, but on its own, <em>Doctor Strange </em>is one of the strongest origin stories in the series. Cumberbatch, coming off of his stint as Sherlock Holmes, can sell the insufferable genius humbled by those wiser than he, and watching him go from a selfish bastard to a selfless one is satisfying. This was also the first time the MCU had really delved into the sorcery side of the comics, which leads to some of the most compelling special effects and setpieces the series had up to that point. Doctor Strange may have become a party trick the MCU would whip out in future installments, but his first movie was a breath of fresh air that opened the universe to new possibilities. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>I challenge you to find five cooler villains in all of MCU history than Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), a victim of a quantum accident who can phase in and out of reality while donning a cool grey and silver suit that looks better than Moon Knight’s. Most of the fun of any <em>Ant-Man</em> movie is in how the size-manipulating Pym technology is used in visually captivating and absurdly funny ways, and the sight of a Hello Kitty PEZ dispenser getting enlarged to deadly proportions during a thrilling car chase could get a rise out of a corpse. Add in stellar acting turns from Walton Goggins and Laurence Fishburne, and it’s safe to say <em>Ant-Man and the Wasp</em> is the best <em>Ant-Man</em> movie ever. — Keith Nelson Jr</p></div><div><p>The third <em>Iron Man </em>movie came after the first <em>Avengers</em>, which means it’s the only movie with the name of Tony Stark’s superhero alter ego in the title that gets to really reckon with the bigger picture. By this point, Tony has seen some shit, fought aliens, and met Norse gods. He’s come a long way since his days as a mere billionaire genius playboy philanthropist. <em>Iron Man 3 </em>paves the way for the sacrifices Tony will have to make in <em>Infinity War </em>and <em>Endgame</em>, exposing the broken core underneath the metal suit exterior. On the other hand, its mishandling of villain the Mandarin is one of the MCU’s most notable misfires, though at least <em>Shang-Chi </em>managed to iron out some of those kinks eight years later. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>The first <em>Captain America </em>movie is still one of the most interesting takes on an origin story in the MCU. It starts as a period piece in the 1940s showing Steve Rogers becoming a symbol of the wartime American ideal, fighting Nazis and wielding his iconic shield. (Sadly, as the MCU has become more of a fence-sitting corporate product that’s seemingly scared of alienating anyone, the series has gotten less willing to sit with what it means to be a representative of that ideal, as exemplified by <em>Brave New World</em>.) <em>The First Avenger </em>is an idealistic movie led by Chris Evans at his most golden retriever, and it feels strangely classic Hollywood in a way Marvel hasn’t felt in a while. The funny thing about looking at old MCU movies is that you realize just how much of the identity of individual heroes has been lost as the franchise has been put on the assembly line. <em>The First Avenger </em>may not have been a spectacular film but it at least had a voice and perspective, unlike the several dozen other movies in the series that could have been made by anyone. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Don’t let internet trolls rewrite history—<em>Captain Marvel</em> kicks a lot of MCU movies’ asses. Brie Larson has the perfect blend of snarky defiance with a smile and duty-bound stoicism needed to play someone like Carol Danvers, a cosmic-powered demigod brainwashed by an alien species to be a sleeper cell on a universal level. The origin story is surprisingly fleshed out for the MCU, which usually opts for the “show and not tell” (more like “blow up and then sorta tell”) approach. Also, her snapping the inhibitor chip out of her head to unlock her full powers (powers that almost had Thanos shitting Infinity Stones in <em>Endgame</em>) is one of the best awakening moments in MCU history. Sure, some of the dialogue tries to force Danvers’ wit a bit too hard. Still, <em>Captain Marvel</em> is essential viewing for any and all MCU fans. —Keith Nelson Jr </p></div><div><p>If it were up to me, as it should be, this would be the number one film. Yeah, yeah, it has an almost incoherent plot, and <em>Spider-Man: Homecoming</em> does multiverse cameos vastly better, and it forgets that character development is even a thing…Yeah, I know. But now, imagine if your favorite film growing up was <em>Evil Dead 2</em>. See? Whole different framework.</p><p><em>Multiverse of Madness</em> is, I contend, <em>Evil Dead 4</em>. Everything is there! Obviously, it’s directed by Sam Raimi, the mastermind behind the original <em>Evil Dead </em>trilogy, and of course <em>Drag Me to Hell</em>, <em>A Simple Plan</em> and 2002’s <em>Spider-Man</em>—that’s a great start. Then of course it features all of Raimi’s signatures, from the appearance of his Oldsmobile Delta 88 (the original car from the <em>Evil Dead </em>movies) to a cameo by Bruce Campbell (the star of all three <em>Evil Dead</em> movies), and indeed the camera rushing forward to suggest impending danger (the core camera move in the <em>Evil Dead</em> movies). But more than that—and there are people who pooh-pooh this because they’re wrong—it’s a horror movie!</p><p>Sam Raimi somehow snuck a horror movie into the MCU. I know I’m right, because when showing my 10-year-old all the MCU movies, this is the only one he asked to stop watching because it was scaring him too much. So, fact. It’s made like a horror movie, it’s framed like a horror movie, it’s directed like a horror movie. It’s actually a bit scary in places!</p><p>But perhaps more importantly than anything else, there’s the scene in which Bruce Campbell plays Pizza Poppa. After insisting that America Chavez pay for her pizza roll, Strange casts a spell on him that causes him to squirt mustard in his own face, then beat himself up with his own hands. Which, as you will know, is a callback to <em>Evil Dead 2</em>’s greatest scene, when Ash’s hand becomes possessed. And that makes this <em>Evil Dead 4</em>, and I don’t care that you think the film shat on Wanda, because none of that matters. Thank you. —John Walker </p></div><div><p>Nothing against Jamie Lee Curtis and her hot dog fingers in <em>Everything Everywhere All At Once</em>, but Angela Bassett should’ve won that Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her powerful portrayal of Queen Ramonda in <em>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</em>. The <em>Black Panther</em> sequel shined under the immense shadow of Chadwick Boseman’s death by shifting the entire landscape of Wakanda with an epic flood, dividing the hero duties amongst Letitia Wright, Lupita Nyong’o, and Danai Gurira, and honoring both Boseman and T’Challa’s deaths. The movie’s greatest achievement, other than being the rare post-<em>Endgame</em> MCU success story, is establishing the <em>Black Panther</em> franchise as an irreplaceable aspect of the MCU because the world of Wakanda is ripe with some of the coolest characters. — Keith Nelson Jr</p></div><div><p>Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman came barreling into the MCU right through the fourth wall in 2024, and the meta-action comedy that emerged as a result has some standout moments. <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine </em>serves as a sort of eulogy for all the old Marvel movies that existed outside the “official” canon of the MCU, and the resulting cameos are pretty great. But the best part of the movie is its two leads, who finally get a redemptive team-up after the crime against comics that was <em>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</em>. If you can’t stand Reynolds’ brand of rapid-fire raunchy one-liners, even when it’s balanced by Jackman’s brooding angst, the third <em>Deadpool </em>probably won’t do it for you. But if you can, you should; rather than just wiping the slate clean, Marvel took an opportunity to merge its disparate universes together and ran with it, and the results are as unexpectedly poignant as they are hilarious. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Rewatching 2008’s<em> Iron Man</em>, the movie that kicked off the entire MCU, is wild. After nearly 20 years of movies, TV shows, and spin-offs, the first <em>Iron Man</em> feels so small and contained, with only a few tiny nods to the greater Marvel universe. And then it ends with a post-credits scene setting up <em>The Avengers</em> and the next 20 years of MCU movies, even if we didn’t realize it at the time.</p><p>As a result, <em>Iron Man</em> is a very important piece of the MCU, but it’s a solid sci-fi action flick, too. <em>Iron Man </em>also<em> </em>feels very much of its era, terrified to reveal that it’s a comic book superhero movie at a time before such movies had completely taken over the multiplex. That doesn’t matter because of Robert Downey Jr. and his incredible performance as Tony Stark aka Iron Man. The dude nailed it so hard that every version of Iron Man since has copied him. Meanwhile, Stark has gone on to become—for better or for worse—the most popular character from the MCU. - ZZ </p></div><div><p>Bringing Spider-Man into the MCU after two earlier franchises still fresh in moviegoers’ memories was also going to be tricky. Thankfully, Marvel realized that the key to making Spider-Man work in the MCU was to focus on what made him so different from the other heroes. The MCU is filled with a lot of folks who don’t have secret identities or even traditional powers. It’s a lot of gods, aliens, robots, mercenaries, and enhanced people. But for Spider-Man, Marvel producers kept the character a teen trying to balance crimefighting with high school while living in NYC. It’s a winning formula that is helped out a ton by the fact that <em>Homecoming </em>skips the origin story that everyone knows already. Add in one of the best villains in the entire MCU and arguably one of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/QtfwHjpaUkQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/QtfwHjpaUkQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most tense scenes ever included in a comic book movie</a></span> and you’ve got yourself a damn fine Spidey flick. — ZZ</p></div><div><p><em>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings </em>might be one of the most criminally underrated movies in the MCU’s catalog. Its sequel has been mired in development hell and swallowed up by Marvel’s shifting priorities, but the studio’s take on a superpowered martial arts film is still quietly one of the studio’s most impressive outings. <em>Shang-Chi </em>starts with mostly practical, well-choreographed action set pieces, all framed in a dramatic family soap opera that maintains its grounded humanity even as the otherworldly elements ramp up in the second half. By the time it turned into Marvel CG sludge, I was already too invested to be annoyed at the film’s distinct voice falling victim to the same nonsense plenty of other Marvel movies do. And can we also talk about that soundtrack? I know <em>Black Panther </em>gets a lot of love for its Kendrick Lamar-curated music, but <em>Shang-Chi</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPwelOkz5qo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPwelOkz5qo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is also full of bangers</a></span>. Good film. Gimme a sequel, Marvel. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>I may be an outlier in thinking the <em>Guardians of the Galaxy </em>movies only got better as they went, but I’d argue that the first is the least of the three. Star-Lord and friends’ intergalactic adventures benefit from having one director in James Gunn across all three films, the same cast whose chemistry only grew stronger with each installment, and a clear arc for its heroes that didn’t have to bend to the whims of the MCU’s overarching storyline. The first movie effectively brings five heroes together who should have wanted nothing to do with one another and makes you believe they could become more tight-knit than any other team in Marvel’s catalog. That being said, its villain is forgettable and I don’t think the movie is as funny as it thinks it is. But hey, it led to the other two films which are some of the best in the MCU. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Looking back on <em>The Winter Soldier </em>after having just seen <em>Brave New World </em>only makes this earlier entry look even stronger. Whereas the latest <em>Captain America </em>loves to sit on the fence and say we should find the good in America, <em>The Winter Soldier </em>is all about how deep the rot goes. The espionage thriller explores parts of Steve Rogers’ buried past and how the same monsters he fought in the 1940s have persisted decades later. It was bold of Marvel to completely upend the foundations it had built and force Captain America to make hard choices. What a shame that, when a Captain America who stands against corruption would really hit, Marvel’s put the gloves on and given us a version of the character who doesn’t live up to that part of the legacy.— Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p><em>Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 </em>is about as close as the MCU has come to doing a one-shot comic storyline. It’s mostly disconnected from the rest of the films but uses all that freedom to really dive into its heroes’ deepest traumas, and its best moments come when people are just talking to one another. Mantis touches Drax and feels his grief with her empath abilities, Rocket and Yondu get into a shouting match because they’re two bullheaded men who can’t see past their own noses, and Gamora and Nebula stop trying to kill each other and hash out decades of unresolved sisterly trauma. Then there are the moments that are expressed without words at all, like Star-Lord opening fire on his own father after he nonchalantly confesses to killing his mother. <em>Vol. 2 </em>is not a subtle film. It bluntly has every character look into the camera and tell you how they’re feeling, essentially making it a vibrant two-hour therapy session for them to talk about the things they were afraid to in the first movie. Yeah, they’d still have some raw wounds to poke at in future movies, but the Guardians of the Galaxy are truly united after <em>Vol. 2</em>, rather than a bunch of weirdos drawn together by circumstance. And come on, you can’t tell me you weren’t hyped when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce2a0wWtnJA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce2a0wWtnJA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“The Chain” dropped in the final fight</a></span>. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>I never ever thought this movie would happen. Sure, now it seems like nothing. Marvel characters (and, separately, DC characters) pop up together in films all the time. But in 2012 the MCU wasn’t even five years old and the idea of a shared universe of comic movies was still new; for years before, superhero movies had never crossed over as all the rights were kept separate between different studios.</p><p>And then, Marvel pulled it off. Hot damn, <em>Avengers </em>is fun. It’s not the best MCU movie and the pacing is a bit odd in the middle, but whatever, Marvel did the big comic book team-up movie and it rocked. The action is exciting, each character is given plenty of screen time, and we finally get to see these heroes interact and it’s just the best. Thor fighting Iron Man! Cool shit! I remember seeing this movie twice in theaters because I couldn’t believe it was real. And while the success of <em>The Avengers </em>and the greater MCU contributed to Hollywood becoming a superhero- and IP-obsessed slop machine, it doesn’t change that the MCU’s first big crossover movie was a blast. - ZZ </p></div><div><p>Yeah, <em>No Way Home </em>is basically 90 percent fan service. I mean, there was no way a Spider-Man movie that brings together the last three actors to play Peter Parker alongside villains from past movies in one big Doctor Strange-filled multiverse adventure was ever going to be anything but a massive fan service extravaganza. But that doesn’t diminish the fact that, in the midst of all that fan service, there’s a really good superhero movie with big stakes and some punishing losses. Watching the three Spider-Men (Tobey Maguire, Andrew Garfield, and Tom Holland) together on screen is enjoyable, and not just because they are spitting out references. Instead, we get new insights into these characters and what they’ve been doing since their last film. In one scene Garfield’s Parker is even able to get some much-needed closure<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/FFjFIXVI2xs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/FFjFIXVI2xs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> in an emotional moment that I still tear up watching</a></span>. And by the end, Marvel resets Peter’s life in a way that could lead to some really interesting new Spider-Man movies. -ZZ</p></div><div><p>Ideally, <em>Infinity War </em>and <em>Endgame </em>would be judged as a single work, considering this film was very clearly written as a Part 1 to <em>Endgame</em>’s Part 2. But Marvel released them as separate films, so we will address them as such. <em>Infinity War </em>is the culmination of everything the MCU had been building to at this point, but as its own movie, it’s mostly a bleak setup for a payoff that wouldn’t come for a full year. It is two-and-a-half hours of watching heroes that fans had been following for a decade face their greatest defeat at the hands of Thanos. Portrayed by the charismatic Josh Brolin, Thanos believes so wholeheartedly in the wisdom of his delusional plan to wipe out half the universe that some of the dumbest motherfuckers you’ve ever seen on YouTube are making videos about how he was right, actually. <em>Infinity War </em>feels like half of a film, but it doesn’t feel half-baked. It manages to bring disparate sides of the universe together in a way that is satisfying dramatically and comedically, and that paves the way for some of the most entertaining action scenes in the franchise. It was a huge pop culture moment to see the Avengers, the Guardians, and so many others come together to face a threat unlike any they’d ever faced. Even the most jaded filmgoer had to have felt something being in a theater with people who had watched every movie up to this point applauding as Evans showed up as a vigilante Captain America, or hearing the dead silence as, one by one, heroes were lost to Thanos’ snap. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>While <em>Infinity War </em>was a major crossover event, <em>Endgame </em>mostly goes back to basics, putting the spotlight on the original Avengers as they try to fix the world Thanos broke. Because we always knew that the first film’s ending was a cliffhanger and that much of what transpired was likely to be undone, <em>Endgame </em>is the movie with the higher stakes and the more dramatic goodbyes. It starts out with the MCU putting on its best Oscar-bait face as everyone collectively grieves the events of <em>Infinity War</em>. Yeah, some of it is laughably hokey, like putting one of the Russo brothers <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PjuixX7d5k&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PjuixX7d5k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in front of a camera to be the series’ first gay character</a></span>, but when it’s sitting with the core cast of Avengers, it’s genuinely affecting. From the nostalgic time-traveling tour of the past decade to the climactic final battle, <em>Endgame </em>feels like a goodbye, one meticulously led to and earned over a decade of great films and mystifying stumbles. It’s a shame that the MCU hasn’t been able to capture that magic since. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>The stars aligned for this one. We know that now, after the dull thud of <em>Thor: Love And Thunder</em>. That or the writing team of Craig Kyle and Christopher L. Yost was utterly vital to <em>Ragnarok</em>’s incredible success—neither returned for the Taika Waititi-penned follow-up, although he directed both movies. Where <em>Love And Thunder</em> was a misfiring joke machine, putting plot behind a desire to just endlessly show off, <em>Ragnarok</em> was a dense, engrossing tale that couldn’t help but leak squillions of top-quality gags.</p><p>The stakes are incredibly high in a film that sees the loss of an entire homeworld, all while juggling the myriad of arcs from within the MCU in a way that somehow made sense. The extremes were a joy to be flung between, from an Earthly, dying Odin and the imminent release of Hela, to the camp pantomime lunacy of Thor and Hulk battling on the garbage planet Sakaar for the entertainment of Jeff Goldblum’s adorably awful Grandmaster.</p><p>This is also the movie that best handles the flip-flopping love/hate relationship between Thor and Loki, in which the inevitability of Loki’s betrayals is not something for the audience to sigh at as they see them coming but rather is integral to the plot.</p><p>Perhaps more than anything else, <em>Ragnarok</em> is a collection of wonderful performances. Hemsworth finds the perfect pitch for Thor’s vanity and heroism, Hiddleston is gleeful as Loki, Goldblum is the most gloriously Goldblum he’s ever been, and Cate Blanchett is just fucking incredible as the villainous Hela, the scene-chewingly wicked Disney witch Angelina Jolie wishes she could be. It’s a movie that, despite being a cog in the infinite MCU machine, works brilliantly as a standalone action comedy in its own right. —John Walker </p></div><div><p>The third <em>Guardians </em>movie is an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-rocket-raccoon-animal-vio-1850408326&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-rocket-raccoon-animal-vio-1850408326">animal lover’s worst nightmare</a></span> and also a beautiful culmination of the spacefaring scoundrels’ adventures. Like its predecessor, <em>Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3 </em>has the advantage of being mostly separated from the dumpster fire that is post-<em>Endgame</em> MCU, and just has to focus on wrapping up the titular group’s decade-long arcs. Thank god Marvel wised up and re-hired James Gunn to wrap up the trilogy because I can’t imagine anyone else sending off the original Guardians with this much love and understanding. The crew’s journey to save Rocket Raccoon from the demons of his past is heartfelt and raw, incredibly funny, and most importantly, earned. Working together helped each of the Guardians become the best versions of themselves, and after one final mission to save one of their own, the group decides that if they’re to keep growing, they have to forge their own paths. It’s sad to see the band break up, but at least they do so having learned so much about themselves and each other. <em>Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3 </em>is perhaps the most appropriate finale the MCU has yet created, and that’s including <em>Infinity War </em>and <em>Endgame</em>. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Nearly every <em>Avengers </em>movie has the members of its organization arguing about some shit. It was about time that all that tension came to blows as the core of a full film. <em>Captain America: Civil War</em> adapts one of the most iconic comic book stories into something that should not have worked within the MCU’s smaller scale, but manages to make the most of its smaller roster. Though Cap’s name is in the title, <em>Civil War </em>is effectively an <em>Avengers </em>movie that introduces some of the most important characters to the MCU and sees them stand tall alongside heroes we’d been following for a decade. Black Panther and Spider-Man’s intros are some of the most effective in the series, adding compelling dramatic wrinkles to an already complex conflict between Captain America and Iron Man. The end result is some of the most gripping interpersonal drama in the MCU, punctuated by memorable action sequences that make the most of each of the heroes. It also leaves the Avengers in shambles when their greatest threat is still looming in the distance. As a setup for <em>Infinity War</em>, it’s excellent. As a character study of Captain America and the lengths Captain America he’ll go to in order to do what he believes is right, it’s unmatched. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Getting Marvel fans to agree on anything is like trying to keep the Sacred Timeline in order with a safety pin. Yet when <em>Black Panther</em> roared into the MCU, it earned near-universal acclaim, a supremely rare feat for a superhero film. In his masterful performance as T’Challa, Chadwick Boseman balanced the ferocity of a warrior with the compassion of a king, creating a hero both formidable and relatable. And unlike many MCU entries, <em>Black Panther</em> is deeply rooted in a rich cultural tapestry, eschewing reliance on supernatural gimmicks to craft a compelling narrative. The film’s iconic challenge—”Is this your king?!”—has become the stuff of movie legend, and its fully realized vision of Wakanda and the people who live there resonated so profoundly that audiences worldwide donned African attire to screenings, making <em>Black Panther</em> a significant cultural touchstone as well as a box office hit.</p><p>It’s no exaggeration to say that <em>Black Panther </em> redefined the superhero genre by infusing it with profound cultural significance. Director Ryan Coogler’s vision brought Wakanda to life, offering a glimpse into an Afrofuturistic society that captivated audiences and critics alike. The ensemble cast, featuring standout performances from Michael B. Jordan, Lupita Nyong’o, and Danai Gurira, added depth and dimension to the story, making it a multifaceted cinematic experience. <em>Black Panther</em> transcended traditional superhero tropes, delivering a narrative rich in themes of identity, heritage, and responsibility. Its legacy endures, not just as a box office triumph, but as a grand cinematic achievement that continues to influence and inspire. —Keith Nelson Jr</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It will add new events, mysteries, and a new dungeon. <span id="more-945867"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via Infold Games:</p><blockquote><p>This latest update will immerse players in a hauntingly beautiful atmosphere filled with gothic intrigue, supernatural phenomena, and mysterious new challenges.</p><p>Set to launch on February 26 and running until March 25, “Eerie Season” invites players to explore the forsaken Queen’s Palace Ruins, uncovering secrets hidden in the echoes of a cursed song, and assist the legendary creature, Bullquet, in a heartwarming side event.</p><p>In “The Queen’s Lament,” mysterious singing voices have begun resonating from the ruins of Queen Philomia’s once-grand palace, drawing whispers of a lingering curse. As night falls, the eerie melodies drift through the deserted corridors, instilling fear in the residents of Florawish. Determined to unveil the truth, Nikki and Momo embark on an expedition into the Queen’s Palace Ruins, where long-buried secrets await discovery.</p><p>Once players complete “The Queen’s Lament” event, the “Queen’s Palace Ruins: Inner Court” dungeon will unlock, offering a new, spine-chilling challenge. With its eerie, mysterious aesthetic and supernatural ambiance, this dungeon will provide an unforgettable experience unlike any before.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>After clearing the “Queen’s Palace Ruins: Inner Court,” players can visit the high tower in the Queen’s Palace Ruins at night and interact with the piano stool by Ms. Glove to play the piano by her side. </p><p>Additionally, the gentle but legendary Bullquet has fallen into an unusual torpor, causing concern in the Wondrous Life Association. To uncover the cause, they have enlisted a special helper—Nikki! Sign up to help and join the mission to restore Bullquet’s vitality in this wholesome and charming event.</p><p>During the “Eerie Season,” a total of 15 “Revelation Crystals” and the new outfit “Dream Chaser” can be obtained for free. Additionally, the Heartfelt Gifts Store will offer three more free outfits, bringing the total to nine free outfits across three versions to continue Infold’s commitment to continuously optimize the game and ensure player satisfaction.</p><p><em>Infinity Nikki</em> continues to expand its immersive world with rich storytelling, engaging events, and stunning visuals.

The demo is described as a “unique introduction to the unforgiving world of Gothic,” and it includes a unique achievement that is required for completing all achievements for the PC version of <em>Gothic Remake</em>. <span id="more-946033"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the demo, via THQ Nordic:</p><blockquote><p><strong>A Different Perspective: Play as Nyras</strong></p><p>In this self-contained prologue, players won’t step into the shoes of the Nameless Hero just yet. Instead, they will experience the Colony through the eyes of Nyras, a newly convicted prisoner struggling to survive in a ruthless environment where danger lurks around every corner.</p><p><strong>What to Expect</strong></p><p>“Nyras Prologue” offers an early glimpse at the world, mechanics, and atmosphere of the full remake, built in Unreal Engine 5. However, it is important to note that this experience does not feature the intended progression, freedom, <a title="Genres > Simulation [652 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">simulation</a>, and immersion that the full game will provide. Instead, it takes place in a small section of the world with a limited set of mechanics, designed to give players a first impression of the remake’s visuals and combat.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>The prologue is a standalone experience with approximately one hour of gameplay.</li><li>Players will not take on the role of the Nameless Hero but instead play as Nyras, a convict trying to survive in the Colony.</li><li>The prologue features challenging combat and an immersive world, but it is not representative of the full game’s depth and freedom.</li><li>Built in Unreal Engine 5, it offers a first look at the rebuilt environments and updated visuals of <em>Gothic Remake</em>.</li><li>The demo includes a unique achievement that is required for completing all achievements for <em>Gothic Remake</em> on Steam.</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Gothic Remake</em> is in development for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1297900/Gothic_1_Remake/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/gothic_1_remake" target="_blank">GOG</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">There is one person who already seems keen on seeing more Avowed: the game's director, Carrie Patel. While Obsidian hasn't said anything about an expansion for the RPG--let alone a sequel just days after launch--Patel sounds enthusiastic about exploring the Pillars of Eternity offshoot further.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-02-21/new-xbox-game-avowed-took-six-years-two-reboots?embedded-checkout=true" rel="nofollow ">Bloomberg</a>, Patel didn't dismiss creating a wholly original experience next. But at the same time, she expressed a not-so-subtle hint that more time within the Avowed universe excited her. "Now that we've built this wonderful world, and also built this team strength and muscle memory around the content and gameplay in this world, I'd love to see us do more with it," said Patel.</p><div

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/to-a-t-release-date-katamari-creator<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Keita Takahashi, the creator of games like&nbsp;<em>Katamari Damacy&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Wattam</em>, has revealed the release date for his latest game&nbsp;<em>To a T</em>. It's scheduled to hit Xbox and PC later this year.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer,&nbsp;<em>To a T&nbsp;</em>will launch across Xbox Series X|S and PC on May 28th. It sounds as though the Xbox One version, which was apparently revealed back when the game was <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2023/06/annapurna-interactive-uvula-and-keita-takahashi-announce-to-a-t-for-xbox-series-xbox-one-and-pc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">unveiled in 2023</a>, is no longer happening.</p>

<p>Takahashi and his team describe&nbsp;<em>To a T&nbsp;</em>as "a narrative adventure game...with a strong focus on character, interaction, story, and exploration". You will play the role of Teen, a teenager permanently stuck in a T-pose trying to live a normal life. Hey, at least nobody will challenge Teen's dominance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/to-a-t-release-date-katamari-creator-teen.jpg?itok=X6bxnQjO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/to-a-t-release-date-katamari-creator-teen.jpg?itok=Us_jC-kL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>To a T&nbsp;</em>turns T-posing into a plot element.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll have to help Teen try and live as best they can, controlling them in "a variety of different scenarios" like moving their arm to eat, petting their dog, and more.</p>

<p>As well as helping Teen with their everyday life, you'll also be able to explore the town in which they live, meeting its inhabitants and collecting coins scattered around the streets. <em>To a T</em> will offer a "free mode" that will allow you to explore at your leisure.</p>

<p>Not only that, but you'll also be able to customize Teen in whatever style you like, purchasing clothing from stores you'll find around town. Don't worry, though; I'm pretty sure you won't need to buy those clothes with real currency.</p>

<p>You can check out the (frankly adorable) release date trailer for&nbsp;<em>To a T&nbsp;</em>right here. It features an original song, "Giraffe Song", sung by none other than&nbsp;<em>Steven Universe</em>'s Rebecca Sugar, as well as exactly the kind of visual style you'd expect from the creator of&nbsp;<em>Katamari&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/wattam" rel="nofollow"><em>Wattam</em></a>.</p>




<p><em>To a T&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1875320/to_a_T/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/to-a-t/9NM6NMBJ7ZK4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on May 28th. It'll also be available as part of Xbox Game Pass on day one, although you'll <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier" rel="nofollow">need to be subscribed</a> to either PC Game Pass or Game Pass Ultimate to play it.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-t-1000-dlc-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mortal-kombat-1-t-1000-dlc-release-date-revealed.1117041/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-t-1000-dlc-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warner Bros and NetherRealm Studios have revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>'s upcoming T-1000 DLC, and it won't be long before you get to slice your opponents apart as Robert Patrick's intimidating automaton.</p>

<p>Per a new trailer showing off the T-1000's moves, the character, who is the latest crossover fighter to appear as part of the game's&nbsp;<em>Khaos Reigns&nbsp;</em>expansion, will be released for owners of that expansion on March 18th and for everyone else on March 25th.</p>

<p>The T-1000 wears his (its?) iconic police officer uniform from&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</em>, and since the newer model is a shapeshifter, it can be seen transforming its arms into weapons like blades and Kabal-esque hookswords.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/t-1000-johnny-cage-mortal-kombat-1.jpg?itok=JBwFNUZO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/t-1000-johnny-cage-mortal-kombat-1.jpg?itok=1Xpp0kqp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The T-1000 will fit into&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>'s violent world perfectly.</figcaption></figure><p>During the closing moments of the DLC fighter's teaser trailer, after he's beaten Johnny Cage to a pulp, we see him using his Fatality, in which he uses&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2</em>'s infamous truck to pulverize his opponent before hopping out of the driver's seat and finishing the job with a submachine gun.</p>

<p>It's not just the T-1000, either. The trailer also teases a little of new Kameo fighter Madam Bo, who appears in&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>'s main story mode as the owner of the Fengjian Teahouse and a friend to Raiden and Kung Lao.</p>

<p>In the trailer, she can be seen leapfrogging over the T-1000 to deliver some pretty impressive martial arts moves of her own, so it looks like she'll be a formidable ally.</p>

<p>You can check out the release date trailer for the T-1000 right here, with&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>head honcho Ed Boon <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1893814056609263619" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">promising</a> that a longer trailer will be on the way "soon".</p>




<p>The T-1000 is just the latest crossover fighter to appear in&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>. He's preceded by the likes of&nbsp;<em>The Boys</em>' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-homelander-first-look" rel="nofollow">Homelander</a>, DC antihero&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-peacemaker-gameplay" rel="nofollow">Peacemaker</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Invincible</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-mortal-kombat-1-dlc-omni-man-gets-gameplay-reveal-november-release-window" rel="nofollow">Omni-Man</a> (are you sensing a pattern emerging here?).</p>

<p>The game's roster has also been expanded with fighters from previous&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>games, including telekinetic ninja <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-ermac-release-date" rel="nofollow">Ermac</a> and Netherrealm sorcerer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/john-cena-will-voice-peacemaker-in-mortal-kombat-1-while-quan-chi-gets-release-date" rel="nofollow">Quan Chi</a>.</p>

<p>Patrick's single-minded automaton, as well as the upcoming Conan the Barbarian DLC, won't be the only crossover in&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat</em>'s future, either; Lin Kuei ninja Sub-Zero recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-lawless-update-chapter-6-season-2" rel="nofollow">found his way into&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em></a>, and it's been rumored that his rival Scorpion will be appearing later in the game's newest season as well.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1971870/Mortal_Kombat_1/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/mortal-kombat-1/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/mortal-kombat-1/9N7271QN4SGB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mortal-kombat-1-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. The game's T-1000 DLC launches on March 25th for general players and March 18th for&nbsp;<em>Khaos Reigns&nbsp;</em>owners.</p>

If you plan to go all-in this playstyle, you may want to bring a wand with you too. These have a high attack speed and can build Stun damage on your foes very quickly. Most importantly, of course, is that it rounds out your Wizard vibes.</p><p>Though you can certainly get through the game mixing and matching spells, picking a single element to focus on with a single grimoire can make you ultra-powerful. If you want to go for high damage over time, I recommend choosing fire, because it absolutely slaps in this game.</p><h2 id="h1485"><a id=""></a><strong>Sword and Grimoire</strong></h2><p>Grimoires also pair exceedingly well with a good one-handed weapon like a sword. This allows you to cast spells and beat the hell out of enemies with rapid swings all at once. This Battlemage build can be one of the most rewarding in the game once you learn how to weave all of your attacks together.</p><p>If you decide to go for a fire-focused build, <strong>pick up the quest Dawntreader in Paradis</strong> during the early part of the game. This quest leads you to arguably the best weapon in <em>Avowed</em>, The Last Light of Day, an immensely strong fire sword with one of the most useful enchantments in the game.</p><h2 id="h1486"><a id=""></a><strong>Sword and Pistol</strong></h2><p>If you’re not really feeling the magic thing, maybe you should opt for a sword and pistol combo. The Ranger skill tree has some really great abilities for this playstyle, such as slowing down time for you to line up perfect shots on enemy noggins. When enemies close in, you can beat ‘em down with your sword (or other one-handed weapon of choice).</p><p>Do note, though, that going this route will mean investing fairly equally in the Fighter and Ranger trees to get the most out of the playstyle. As such, you’ll probably want to analyze how you’re approaching fights and make a build that capitalizes just a bit more on one or the other.</p><h2 id="h1487"><a id=""></a><strong>Pistol and Grimoire</strong></h2><p>If you’d like to go for a Bible thumper build, wield a pistol and grimoire. Slinging spells and poppin’ heads is a ranged player’s dream. It might be a good idea to invest in some frost spells if you choose this build, however, as pistols reload a bit slowly.</p><p>As with a Sword and Pistol loadout, opting for this playstyle may stretch your ability points a little thin. But you’re likely to benefit most from leaning more on the Ranger tree, as magic is pretty damn incredible even with limited investment, while pistols require you to level some passive abilities to really shine.</p><h2 id="h1488"><a id=""></a><strong>Wand and Wand</strong></h2><p>Hear me out. You may think dual-wielding is best suited for pistols and one-handed melee weapons, but you might be shocked at how powerful dual wands can be. The rapid attack speed of wands can result in some damn good DPS without the need to line up critical shots as precisely as you would with guns.</p><p>Even more, if you combine two elemental wands, you can rapidly build up status effects on your foes for even more damage. Add in a few magic spells and you’ll be whittling down health bars like you wouldn’t believe.</p><hr><p><em>Avowed</em> is available now on Xbox Series X and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/mecha-break-release/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mecha-break-release-window%E2%80%94platforms-everything-we-know.1117032/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/mecha-break-release/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Mecha Break Release Period is great news to the hundreds of thousands who wishlisted the manic mech title. The beta is proving to be a hit, and the full Mecha Break release could be groundbreaking.</p>



<p>Amazing Seasun Games is an ambitious studio focused on making fun and different games. You only have to look at the difference between Snowbreak Containment Zone—a fully-fledged sci-fi shooter—and Mecha Break to see this. But it’s the latter drawing a lot of eyes in 2025.</p>



<p>Did you know Mecha Break’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mecha-break-announces-open-beta-and-new-game-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open beta</a> hit a monumental <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mecha-break-beta-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">317,000 concurrent players on its first day</a>? Sleep on it if you dare. Let’s get stuck into the latest on the multiplayer mech shooter.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-mecha-break-is-coming-out">Do we Know When Mecha Break is Coming Out?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A spectacle. Credit to Amazing Seasun Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Mecha Break doesn’t have a specific release date, but it’s been confirmed the game is arriving in Spring 2025.</strong></p>



<p>The general release period was confirmed by developer Amazing Seasun Games via an <a href="https://x.com/MechaBREAK/status/1888331963536400723" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X post</a>. They let players know: “Mecha BREAK launches Spring 2025!”</p>



<p>I have to think the open beta feedback will have a bearing on launch plans. If there’s a lot to work on, don’t be surprised to see the release window get pushed back. Very rarely are games brought forward, so expect <a href="https://mechabreak.seasungames.com/index/en/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mecha Break</a> to launch in the months of <strong>March, April, or May</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-mecha-break-platforms">Mecha Break Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Xbox Series X|S and PC players can enjoy Mecha Break at release, and the mech shooter is also coming to PlayStation 5 later on.</strong></p>



<p>In the same post concerning the release window, the developer confirmed its initial platforms: “Play on Steam, Windows PC via the Xbox App, and as a console launch exclusive with Xbox Series X|S.” A curious fan quizzed the Mecha Break X page on the status of a PlayStation 5 launch.</p>



<p>If you are on PS5, don’t worry, a future release is on the cards: “<strong>We look forward to bringing Mecha BREAK to PlayStation players later in 2025</strong>.” </p>







<p>It’s disappointing for PlayStation users, but at least a port is coming! Nintendo Switch players must sit this one out for good—unless the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2</a> can handle it.</p>



<hr>



<p>Mecha Break is one of many incredible games scheduled for 2025. From Soulslike titles like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-platforms-free-demo-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a> to the Devil May Cry-inspired action title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lost-soul-aside-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Soul Aside</a>, and FPS royalty with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-the-doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a>. If you do play Mecha Break, check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-earn-mecha-break-twitch-drops-all-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to get free Twitch Drops</a> for it.</p>

                <p>Asus has announced a new mouse, and while it looks like a casual device that'll appeal to any cottagecore enthusiast with its soft pastel colors, it does have a neat trick up its proverbial sleeve in the form of an oil diffuser. That's right: this mouse has an "internal fragrance compartment" for aromatic oils, perfect for anyone who wants to keep their workstation smelling fresh and not like weeks of accumulated hand-sweat odor.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4448965-asus-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448965" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4448965-asus-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448965"></a><figcaption>Asus Fragrance Mouse</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4448965-asus-4.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4448966-asus-1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4448967-asus-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4448968-asus-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4448969-asus-5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4448966,1300-4448967,1300-4448968,1300-4448969" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4448966-asus-1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4448967-asus-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4448968-asus-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4448969-asus-5.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4448966-asus-1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4448967-asus-2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4448968-asus-3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4448969-asus-5.jpg"></figure><p><a href="https://press.asus.com/news/press-releases/asus-fragrance-mouse-release/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Asus says</a> that the removable vial can be washed and refilled with different scents, so you can customize it to your olfactory preferences.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-layoffs-restructuring<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Surgeon Simulator&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>I Am Bread&nbsp;</em>developer Bossa Studios has announced it will lay off an undisclosed number of employees, and that it will restructure its operations to focus on smaller projects.</p>

<p>In a LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bossa-games_activity-7298367748902912001-h4lt/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/surgeon-simulator-developer-bossa-games-confirms-layoffs-amid-industry-turmoil-" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game Developer</a>), Bossa co-CEO Henrique Olifiers says that the "disruption" brought to the games industry in the past couple of years has seen "treasured studios, teams, and games being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-shuts-down-saints-row-developer-volition" rel="nofollow">shut down</a> or significantly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sumo-group-layoffs-refocus" rel="nofollow">scaled back</a>".</p>

<p>Olifiers calls this a "fundamental transformation" of the industry and says that Bossa isn't immune to it; his studio has made the "painful decision" to scale itself back, which means "saying very difficult goodbyes to extremely talented and treasured colleagues", although he doesn't say how many or in which areas of the studio.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/surgeon-simulator-2-bossa-studios-layoffs.jpg?itok=PYbTtKDg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/surgeon-simulator-2-bossa-studios-layoffs.jpg?itok=o6vevPkx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bossa Studios is to lay off an undisclosed number of employees.</figcaption></figure><p>Olifiers goes on to say that Bossa will be focusing on the upcoming launch of open-world survival-crafter&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies</em>, which is currently in "late-stage production". The game does not yet have a release date.</p>

<p>He says that once&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>is out and "enjoying live operations", Bossa will "reshape into small teams working independently on novel game ideas", with a view to releasing those games "as early as possible".</p>

<p>In closing, Olifiers says he and his team wish they had "found a way of navigating [industry] turmoil without resorting to the decision of scaling back [their] teams", but that they "failed" to do so.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time in the last year or so that Bossa has laid off employees. Back in January, the studio said that it had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-and-archiact-hit-by-layoffs" rel="nofollow">laid off around a third of its workforce</a>, with Olifiers putting those layoffs down to increasing costs, delayed funding, and the troubles faced by smaller games in the market.</p>

In recent weeks, we've seen the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oxenfree-night-school-layoffs" rel="nofollow"><em>Oxenfree&nbsp;</em>studio Night School</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rumbleverse-and-killer-instct-studio-iron-galaxy-suffers-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Iron Galaxy</a> reducing staff.</p>

<p>It's not just smaller studios, either; NetEase recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">laid off the entire team</a> responsible for developing&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>in Seattle, despite the fact that the game had 40 million (admittedly not necessarily active) players <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">at last count</a>.</p>

But if you want to earn every trophy or achievement in the game, you’ll need to do exactly that.

Just don’t forget to replay Level 10 normally so you can finish breaking all of the cages to rescue all the heroes within!</p><hr><p><em>Big Helmet Heroes</em> is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Corporate gaming giant NetEase are hunting for more jobs to slash among their overseas studios, according to insiders who spoke to Bloomberg and Game File last week. The parent company recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netease-reward-us-based-developers-of-live-service-hit-marvel-rivals-by-sacrificing-their-jobs-to-efficiency">cut a bunch of US jobs among their Marvels Rivals developers</a> despite the game raking in a big profit. And it now looks like that was just the start of a larger mauling which may hit up to 20 of the company's non-Chinese studios.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"NetEase is actively shopping around more of its non-Chinese studios—many of the very same ones it announced over the last three years," says Stephen Totilo in a <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netease-studio-cuts">report for Game File</a>. "One of Game File’s sources says NetEase plans to divest itself of the majority of its overseas teams, leading to the potential closure of more than a dozen game studios, if they can’t secure new post-NetEase funding." </p>
<p>Among the overseas studios owned by NetEase are French studio Quantic Dream, who were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netease-have-acquired-quantic-dream">acquired in 2022</a>, and Nagoshi Studio, a venture set-up by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-yakuza-series-director-announces-new-studio-under-netease">a former Yakuza director</a>. The corporate behemoth also own several overseas studios that haven't released a game yet, such as US studio Bulletfarm and Bad Brain Game Studios in Canada, among 16 other studios in various countries. It's not clear which of these studios are on the chopping block. </p>
<p>"[All] studios and projects are in constant review and evaluation," the company told Game File after a request for comment, "and NetEase will determine changes needed to be made throughout that process.” </p>
<p>NetEase are also partial owners of Polish studio Rebel Wolves, the developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ex-the-witcher-3-devs-vampire-rpg-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-gets-a-trailer-looks-witcherish">recently revealed</a> RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dawnwalker">The Blood Of Dawnwalker</a>. But they are minority shareholders, as clarified by co-owner Tomasz Tinc <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tomasz-tinc-314a88a_ive-also-read-the-articles-suggesting-that-activity-7299704037124247552-4dpq/">on LinkedIn</a>, who said that Dawnwalker is "fully funded" and not in danger.</p>
<p>"The development of our game is progressing steadily, and we're facing no financial issues," he said.

</p><p>A pattern of cuts to relatively new NetEase studios has already emerged. As noted by Edwin recently, NetEase have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-mass-effect-writers-studio-worlds-untold-are-pausing-operations-in-what-staff-call-a-studio-closure">pulled funding for Worlds Untold</a>, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/jar-of-sparks-halts-production-on-debut-game-as-it-looks-for-new-publisher">split with Jar Of Sparks</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">laid people off</a> at Liquid Swords. All these studios were recently set up by industry veterans who had worked on game series' like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo">Halo</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/just-cause">Just Cause</a>. </p>
<p>The move is a strategic set of cutbacks envisioned from on-high, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-21/netease-s-billionaire-ceo-slashes-jobs-and-games-in-profit-push">Bloomberg</a>, who report that NetEase CEO William Ding has "reasserted his leadership with a series of dramatic decisions over the past year", including hiring a number of 20-something finance graduates to "lead or supervise gaming units", according to the newspaper's sources. </p>
<p>NetEase laid off almost 900 workers from various games subsidiaries over the course of 2023, Bloomberg also notes. But when asked about the status of overseas studios on a conference call last week, Ding responded via translator to say that the company will continue to support "high-quality studios and really master creators.”</p>
<p>“That is our strategy,” he said. “There’s no change on that.”</p>
<p>If you are one of the 448,000 players who played <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> at the height of its popularity on Steam, you may be looking at those recently laid off and wondering what counts to Ding as "high-quality". </p>

            <p>A former boss of Amazon Games has detailed why the company couldn't compete with Valve's Steam platform for PC sales.</p>
<p>Ethan Evans was VP of Prime Gaming at Amazon until September 2020, and in a recent post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ethanevansvp_as-vp-of-prime-gaming-at-amazon-we-failed-activity-7295834479036702720-cDmX?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAVvKbEB4BSwtr1FhSqcqk72HAWxOtwQlK0">LinkedIn</a> he detailed how Amazon "failed multiple times to disrupt the game platform Steam".</p>
<p>"We were at least 250 times bigger, and we tried everything," he wrote. "But ultimately, Goliath lost."</p>

<p>Amazon tried three times to enter the "online-game-store market", said Evans. The first was by acquiring the small PC games store Reflexive Entertainment and trying to scale it, but this "went nowhere".</p>
<p>The second, after Amazon bought <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, was to create its own PC games store and utilise the Twitch audience for sales. "Our assumption was that gamers would naturally buy from us because they were already using Twitch," said Evans. "Wrong."</p>
<p>The third effort from Amazon was its Luna streaming service, which competed with Google's own ill-fated Stadia - that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stadia-is-shutting-down-in-january">shut down in January 2023</a>. Luna remains live, but Evans admitted neither Amazon nor Google's efforts "gained significant traction". "The whole time, Steam dominated despite being a relatively small company (compared to Amazon and Google)," he said.</p>
<p>So what went wrong? "The mistake was that we underestimated what made consumers use Steam," said Evans. "It was a store, a social network, a library, and a trophy case all in one. And it worked well."</p>
<p>He continued: "At Amazon, we assumed that size and visibility would be enough to attract customers, but we underestimated the power of existing user habits. We never validated our core assumptions before investing heavily in solutions. The truth is that gamers already had the solution to their problems, and they weren't going to switch platforms just because a new one was available.</p>
<p>"We needed to build something dramatically better, but we failed to do so. And we needed to validate our assumptions about our customers before starting to build. But we never really did that either.</p>
<p>"Just because you are big enough to build something doesn't mean people will use it."</p>
<p>Amazon still has its Prime Gaming subscription, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prime-gaming-gets-another-20-games-in-february-including-one-for-xbox">this month includes BioShock 2 Remastered and Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>And after publishing multiple MMORPGs, Amazon Games' next release will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/king-of-meat-is-a-chaotic-new-amazon-published-game-from-ex-lionhead-and-media-molecule-developers">King of Meat from ex-Lionhead and Media Molecule developers</a>.</p>
<p>Steam, meanwhile, has just seen its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-lands-series-second-biggest-start-on-steam">concurrent player numbers peak once again</a> this month, hitting 39.92 million online users.</p>
<p>Steam's other big competitor, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-store-has-more-pc-players-than-ever-295-million-in-fact">Epic Games Store, also now has more players than ever</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/moroi-could-be-one-of-the-weirdest-games-of-2025-and-it%E2%80%99s-all-the-better-for-it.1116966/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/24/moroi-demo-preview-one-of-the-weirdest-games-of-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Moroi grabbed my attention when it was announced late in 2024 with its grimdark aesthetic and grotesque characters. Taking its name from a Romanian folk monster (apparently some kind of vampire) the top-down hack and slash action game looked like a spiritual successor to the excellent Van Helsing series. Having now got my grubby hands on a preview demo – <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2518410/Moroi/">available now via Steam Next Fest</a> – and spent some time in a Q&amp;A with the developer, I am pleased to report that it is actually so much more than I expected.</p>
<p><iframe title="Moroi | Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PeXCOkKuZP0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There is a clear sense of mystery and deliberate confusion in the world of Moroi. You begin by waking up in a prison cell with no memory of who you are and how you got there. The door to your cell is open and you begin to explore your strange surroundings. During the roughly 30 minutes of the demo I encountered a cast of bizarre characters, some fun combat, and a series of enjoyable – if simple – puzzles.</p>


<p>The graphical style that first caught my attention looks great in the demo build. While the bulk of the demo takes place in a dark prison environment there is a good level of detail and excellent lighting to add to the atmosphere. The star of the show, though, is clearly the character designs. Your own player character looks like a mannequin of sorts (in a manner that begins to be revealed as the game progresses) but NPCs look uncannily similar to the nightmarish cenobites of Clive Barker’s Hellraiser series.</p>


<p>Brief conversations with early NPCs do little to unravel the mysterious nature of your plight, but odd characters such as a self-aware furnace are as quirky as they are unsettling. Perhaps the most important character in the early stages is a talking duck that gives you his teeth to upgrade your weapon and enable you to break through barriers. The fact that such a sentence rolls off in this preview is a testament to how strange the world of Moroi really is.</p>
<p>Puzzles here are mostly generally simple find the correct object affairs, but there are a couple which require you to read the various lore messages you find along the way. Combat is either melee or ranged with the chaingun you find – the latter showing the way that the developer is clearly aiming for fun rather than any kind of realism. The chaingun has no ammo counter but is on a cooldown so there is some strategy involved in either dodging around enemies or switching between weapons during fights. The playthrough I watched during the Q&amp;A presentation made the combat look particularly challenging, but on Normal it feels pitched quite well. Attacking enemies builds up a finisher meter that enables a one hit kill which also heals you so there is a good sense of rhythm to the combat.</p>

<p>About 20 minutes into the demo, your player character is seemingly killed and there is a drastic change in tone and scenery. The tonal whiplash from this moment is my abiding memory of my time with Moroi. It is clearly a game that isn’t afraid to take you in some weird and unexpected directions, reminding me in part of recent classics like Indika or the Zeno Clash series.</p>
<p>If the rest of the game comes close to the strangeness of this 30 minute demo then Moroi should be guaranteed to become a cult classic. With a release date of early 2025 we shouldn’t have too long to wait before checking out the full game.</p>

			<p>Unreal Engine 5 adds complexity in some interesting ways that allow the development of games that may not have been possible before but at a cost on PC that will likely only get mitigated in the future by brute forcing better performance.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore's Law is Dead</a>'s Broke Silicon podcast, Massive Damage's Bryan Heemskerk discussed Unreal Engine 5 at length, highlighting the many issues developers face with the engine but also how it adds complexity in ways that is allowing them to do things that maybe couldn't be done before, but with a base cost that was, at launch, two GPU generations behind in terms of performance, a really unsurprising statement considering we have seen, time and time again, how Unreal Engine 5-powered games don't seem to run well even on top-end hardware. On consoles, things are quite different, according to the developer, as the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S have dedicated hardware, such as their IO controllers, that handle data compression and decompression. On PC, on the other hand, there are a lot of data bottlenecks that prevent the process from being smooth, and, as of now, it seems like performance will only get better with the faster interface and CPUs, essentially brute forcing through the issues, getting to the point where latency will be so low and the interface speed so fast that things will get better at least until the next generation of consoles. As such, it may be until the RTX 6000 series when Unreal Engine 5 will run as it should on PC.</p>

<p>Unreal Engine 5 creator Epic is well aware of the performance issues in games powered by their engine and has recently<a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-shader-compilation-systems-prevent-stuttering-not-work-properly/"> outlined</a> what the engine features to mitigate the issues and what they are currently working on to further improve the situation. Some of these systems, however, don't seem to be working properly out-of-the-box, and require developer intervention, so there's definitely more work to be done until shader compilation and other performance issues become a thing of the past in UE5 games.</p>
<p>The latest version of Unreal Engine 5 is version 5.5. You can learn more about some of the features it introduces, including the Nanite of lights, MegaLights, by going <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-5-megalights-performance-improvements/">here</a>.</p>

In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bossa-games_activity-7298367748902912001-h4lt/">statement posted to LinkedIn</a>, company co-founder Henrique Olifers said Bossa had been forced to make "the painful decision to scale back" its size once more.
</p>
<p>
The company will now focus all its efforts on getting its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-featured-in-todays-humble-games-showcase">open-world airship adventure Lost Skies</a> out the door, before "reshap[ing] into small teams working independently on novel game ideas brought to the players as early as possible".
</p>
<p>
It's unclear how many staff have been impacted by these latest layoffs, though Olifers wrote that the changes meant the studio would be "saying very difficult goodbyes to extremely talented and treasured colleagues, truly some of the best people in the industry, who have been part of our journey for a long time".
</p>
<p>
"We wish we had found a way of navigating this turmoil without resorting to the decision of scaling back or teams," Olifers continued, "but unfortunately we've failed in this endeavour."
</p>
<p>
The co-CEO blamed the action on a "fundamental transformation of the games industry, a reshape of how games are made and by what kinds of teams", though did not elaborate further how Bossa had been affected in particular.
</p>
<p>
At the start of 2024, Bossa was thought to employ around 60 people, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surgeon-simulator-developer-bossa-studios-lets-go-a-third-of-its-staff">layoffs saw 19 jobs lost which Olifers blamed on a "perfect storm of events"</a> at the time: higher development costs, funding delays, and a tougher market for indie games.
</p>
<p>
It's been four years since Bossa last shipped a game - I Am Fish. It remains best known for Surgeon Simulator, which it launched in 2013 and followed up with various other versions for smartphones, Switch and VR.
</p>
<p>
Bossa had previously received funding from NetEase, the Chinese giant that is currently pulling back from many of its gaming studio investments across the globe.

In 2022, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tinybuild-acquires-bossa-studios-ips-for-3m">Bossa sold the rights to I Am Bread and Surgeon Simulator</a> to US indie publisher TinyBuild, generating a reported $3m.
