			<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle developer MachineGames has shared new details about the game's story and world structure. In an interview <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-devs-interview-machine-games-lucasfilm-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with IGN</a>, Creative Director Jens Andersson said:</p>
<p><em>Well, in a way it's obviously a linear, very driven story that takes you around the world. We are doing this game a little bit differently than previous games that we worked on, where we're allowed to go back to previous locations and continue playing from there. It's almost like a time jump back. So you will be able to 100 percent the game on a single save lot. And the reason why we're doing it like that is that we have these really wide, big areas like Giza, and then we have stretches of more linear rollercoaster rides, and there's a lot of optional content in there... a lot of hidden mysteries and things like that. So we want players who focus on the story to be able to play through it, and if they really love an area, they can go back and just finish up everything without having to replay the more linear sections. It doesn't fit into the narrative story, but from a gameplay perspective, you can do it.</em></p>
<p><em>It's more of a linear story, to be honest. It's really well-told, well-acted by our amazing cast with a proper conclusion. And then you can keep going and discover everything that the world has to offer.</em></p>
<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Andersson also talked about giving players the option to tweak combat and puzzle difficulty separately in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Understandably, there are more options for combat (Light, Moderate, Hard, and Very Hard), while there are only two versions of the puzzles.</p>
<p>By the way, we have <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-hands-on-preview-swinging-in-style/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> our own hands-on preview of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle based on a play session from a recent press event. Here's what Amy had to say:</p>
<p><em>Overall, I had a great experience with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and I can't wait to dive back into the world once more when the game officially releases. It was highly immersive, the characters were well-designed, the world design was stunning, and it was a really well-polished experience. It's perfect for those who are new and returning to the Indiana Jones franchise, or want a game that feels similar to what Tomb Raider and Uncharted offer</em></p>
<p>The game is out on December 9 for PC and Xbox Series S|X, and in Spring 2025 for PlayStation 5.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-qa-team-strike-over-activision-blizzards-return-to-office-mandate/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-6%E2%80%99s-qa-team-strike-over-activision-blizzard%E2%80%99s-return-to-office-mandate.1022457/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-qa-team-strike-over-activision-blizzards-return-to-office-mandate/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The QA workers for Activision Blizzard have recently been on strike in protest of the company's return-to-office (RTO) mandate, as stated by the Communications Workers of America (CWA). On October 25, the QA team who worked on <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-has-drawn-in-most-traffic-ever-for-a-game-launch-in-the-uk/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> rallied to make sure that there were work-from-home (WFH) accommodations for those who needed them. In this strike, they claimed that Activision and Microsoft had not granted any accommodations for employees with ADA-certified medical conditions. In addition to the QA team striking, over 300 Activision employees signed a petition earlier in the month to ask for the return of work-from-home options. This led to workers in Texas and California joining the Eden Prairie team in striking.</p>
<p>In a statement from the CWA, they wrote: "Despite multiple requests from the Union representing the video-game workers, Activision and Microsoft have been unable to articulate why specifically they are insisting workers must work in the office, even those with serious medical conditions and doctor's recommendations to work from home."</p>
<p>In addition to the CWA writing a statement, the pro-worker group A Better ABK also published their <a href="https://x.com/ABetterABK/status/1849816772670578822" target="_blank" rel="noopener">own statement</a> on October 25 on X, which stated that RTO was decided on the staff's behalf without their input or needs being considered. "We've also learned that the company is unwilling to provide people with remote work accommodations, even when it's the only option that meets an employee's needs, due to this alienating policy," says A Better ABK. It's not a surprise that those working for Activision Blizzard are consistently having to fight for better conditions, as A Better ABK has been working on improving the quality of life of ABK employees for a number of years.</p>
<p>Just shortly after they put out a statement, it was announced that the CEO of Microsoft got a pay raise of 63%, raising his salary to $73 million, despite there being an excessive amount of layoffs at the company and Microsoft subsidiaries.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-developers-strike-over-office-working-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Activision Blizzard made a statement to Eurogamer</a>, saying that it understood "returning to the office has been an adjustment for some. We engage in an interactive process with employees who request accommodations. This is an ongoing conversation at the bargaining table, and we will continue to discuss our respective interests in that forum."</p>
<p>Whether this means that they will make the accommodations needed for their staff is uncertain as of right now, but they are also far from the only company that is trying to push for RTO. For example, other huge companies such as Ubisoft and Rockstar have also been trying to get their staff back into the office to work on big releases, which has also led to protests from Ubisoft staff.</p>

        <p>We consistently evaluate our games portfolio and status of our projects to ensure we are meeting near and long-term business priorities. As part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen SIE’s Studio Business, we have had to make a difficult decision relating to two of our studio— Neon Koi and Firewalk Studios.  </p><p>Expanding beyond PlayStation devices and <a title="Genres > Crafting [21 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a> engaging online experiences alongside our single-player games are key focal areas for us as we evolve our revenue streams. We need to be strategic, though, in bringing our games to new platforms and recognize when our games fall short of meeting player expectations.   </p><p>While mobile remains a priority growth area for the Studio Business, we are in the very early stage of our mobile efforts. To achieve success in this area we need to concentrate on titles that are in-line with PlayStation Studios’ pedigree and have the potential to reach more players globally.  </p><p>With this re-focused approach, Neon Koi will close, and its mobile action game will not be moving forward. I want to express my gratitude to everyone at Neon Koi for their hard work and endless passion to innovate.   </p><p>Regarding Firewalk, as announced in early September (<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/09/concord-to-be-taken-offline-on-september-6-as-sony-interactive-entertainment-determines-the-best-path-ahead">An Important Update on <em>Concord</em></a>), certain aspects of <em>Concord</em> were exceptional, but others did not land with enough players, and as a result we took the game offline. We have spent considerable time these past few months exploring all our options.   </p><p>After much thought, we have determined the best path forward is to permanently sunset the game and close the studio. I want to thank all of Firewalk for their craftsmanship, creative spirit, and dedication.  </p><p>The player-versus-player <a title="Genres > First-Person Shooter [2,556 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter/fps">first-person shooter</a> genre is a competitive space that’s continuously evolving, and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title. We will take the lessons learned from <em>Concord</em> and continue to advance our live service capabilities to deliver future growth in this area.   </p><p>I know none of this is easy news to hear, particularly with colleagues and friends departing SIE. Both decisions were given serious thought, and ultimately, we feel they are the right ones to strengthen the organization. Neon Koi and Firewalk were home to many talented individuals, and we will work to find placement for some of those impacted within our global community of studios where possible. </p><p>I am a big believer in the benefits of embracing creative experimentation and developing new IP. However, growing through sustainable financials, especially in a challenged economic environment is critical.   </p><p>While today is a difficult day, there is much to look forward to in the months ahead from the Studio Business Group and our teams.  I remain confident that we are building a resilient and capable organization driven by creating unforgettable entertainment experiences for our players.   </p><p>Thank you for your continued support.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Developed by Shift Up and published for PlayStation 5 by Sony Interactive Entertainment in April, Stellar Blade has maintained its $70 price since launch. If you've been waiting for a deal, that day is here.

It's a fairly lengthy one, too, as the average playthrough clocks in around 20 hours. Its combat system remains interesting throughout the whole adventure, which features some stunning backdrops.</p><p>"Stellar Blade's influences come from the last two generations of character action games and it wields them proudly, channeling not just ideas but themes, designs, and even stylistic flourishes from games like Bayonetta and Nier Automata," critic Imran Khan wrote.</p><div

data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rise of Ronin</a> is also a 20-plus hour adventure, but this action game leans more into the role-playing genre with its systems. It earned a 7/10 in GameSpot's Rise of the Ronin review.</p><p>With a fast-paced combat system benefitted by a nice variety of abilities and weapons and an engaging story filled with interesting characters, Rise of the Ronin is a solid choice for action-RPG enthusiasts--as long as you're willing to put some time into it without giving up. It doesn't have a strong opening, and the combat system has a rather steep learning curve. And like many open-world games, there's a fair amount of repetition in both the environments and mission structures. But a 7/10 is the type of game that really benefits from a nice discount, as it's less of a gamble when it costs $40 instead of $70.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-games-on-sale-for-great-prices-tears-of-the-kingdom-for-45-echoes-of-wisdom-for-50/1100-6527148/">Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom And Echoes Of Wisdom Get Stellar Discounts</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-collectors-edition-preorders-available-ahead-of-this-weeks-launch/1100-6525830/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Collector's Edition Preorders Available Ahead Of This Week's Launch</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/special-edition-lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-4k-gift-set-releases-this-holiday-preorders-live-at-amazon/1100-6527414/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Gift Set Releases This Holiday, Comes With One Ring Collectible</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/targets-exclusive-shadow-the-hedgehog-lego-set-is-discounted-just-weeks-after-its-release/1100-6525229/">Target's Exclusive Shadow The Hedgehog Lego Set Is Discounted Just Weeks After Its Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-lego-super-mario-and-peach-starter-sets-get-first-discounts-at-amazon/1100-6525381/">New Lego Super Mario And Peach Starter Sets Get First Discounts At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-official-art-books-are-b1g1-50-off-at-amazon-get-both-for-only-59/1100-6527378/">Elden Ring Official Art Books Are B1G1 50% Off At Amazon - Get Both For Only $59</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horror-movie-tv-series-box-set-collection-amazon-halloween-deals/1100-6527353/">Best Horror Movie 4K Box Sets And Steelbook Deals At Amazon Ahead Of Halloween</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-limited-time-amazon-deals-all-6-dune-books-for-38-4k-box-set-for-lowest-price-yet/1100-6527343/">Dune Limited-Time Amazon Deals - All 6 Dune Books For $38, 4K Box Set For Lowest Price Yet</a></li>   </ul> </div>

                <p dir="ltr">Disney has just revealed loads of new content for its hit life-sim adventure game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/disney-dreamlight-valley/">Dreamlight Valley</a>--including details on the game's newest free update and next paid DLC. The announcement was made via a 23-minute showcase hosted by Dreamlight Valley community managers Rachel Annen and Ryan Blanchard, who kicked things off by sharing a redemption code for a pair of free in-game socks (more on those in a minute).</p><p dir="ltr">The hosts then moved on to discuss the six free updates the game has seen <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/disney-dreamlight-valley-review-great-game-grueling-grind/1900-6418193/">since its release</a>, along with its paid expansion DLC, A Rift In Time. It seems <em>another</em> free update is on its way to Dreamlight Valley, with a focus on quality-of-life improvements. The Sew Delightful update launches for free on December 4, and its so packed full of new features, it's practically bursting at the seams.</p><p dir="ltr">Last year, Disney added Jack Skellington to the game via The Pumpkin King Returns update. It seems that Disney has decided to build on this plotline for 2024's holiday season, as Jack's beloved Sally will join him in the Valley when Sew Delightful goes live, bringing her patchwork style to the game in the form of new furniture, clothes, and other customization options.</p><p dir="ltr">Plot-wise, Sally has gotten lost outside the Valley. It's up to players to team up with Jack to "make sense of Sally's creepy-crawly messengers as they craft a plan to reunite with her." Later, once Sally has settled in and adjusted to Dreamlight life, players will need to help her embrace the art of quilting, figure out the meaning of her latest premonition, and set up a spooky-sweet date night with Jack, among other activities.</p><p dir="ltr">As for Sally's Friendship Rewards, game manager Guillame Sauveur confirmed the Dreamlight Valley team stitched together a ton of patchwork loot to fit Sally's spooky-cute aesthetic.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4391723-sallydrip.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391723" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4391723-sallydrip.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391723"></a><figcaption>The free Sew Delightful update brings Sally--and her sense of style--to Dreamlight Valley.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4391723-sallydrip.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Well, inspired by [Sally's] sense of style, you can expect tons of patterns across clothing items and furniture," Sauver said, adding that the new update "Just <em>screams</em> 'Sally!'"</p><p dir="ltr">"This winter, we'll be embracing the ethereal sides of the [holiday] season," Courtney said of the update's new Star Path. "You'll get to step into your own personal fairytale with ice-adorned furniture and bring a sense of whimsy to your Dream Snap submissions with a wand that produces snowflakes."</p><p dir="ltr">The Sew Delightful update also introduces a new feature: magic-infused areas called Floating Islands.</p><p dir="ltr">"These [Floating Islands] act as additional spaces parallel to the Valley, where players can decorate and let their creativity run free," Sauveur explained as a time-lapse recording showed that Floating Islands have day and night cycles. "Each biome in the Valley will have a Floating Island counterpart with the same theme and ambiance [as the biome], but it will start as a clean slate. We plan to roll these out over time, and we'll kick things off with four floating islands in the Sew Delightful update."</p><p dir="ltr">The first four Floating Islands are Plaza Island, Forest Island, Sunlit Island, and Frosted Island, and can be purchased using the game's main currency, Dreamlight. Floating Islands are roughly the same side as their ground-bound Valley counterparts, giving players double the real estate to decorate. Players will also be able to visit each other's Floating Islands during Valley Visits. All previously collected houses, furniture, and decor--along with befriended villagers--will also be available to place on Floating Islands.</p><p dir="ltr">"Ultimately, the goal is to offer ample space to create without [the Floating Islands] feeling overwhelming," Sauveur said. "We will have more to share about the exact size of the Floating Islands a little closer to launch."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4391724-ddlvfloatingislands.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391724" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4391724-ddlvfloatingislands.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391724"></a><figcaption>Floating Islands offer players even more room to decorate.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4391724-ddlvfloatingislands.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Sew Delightful update also includes a new feature players have been requesting since the game's launch: the ability to rotate items more easily. Previously, players could only rotate items in four directions. As of Sew Delightful's launch, players will be able to rotate items in a total of 16 different directions, making house and furniture placement much less tricky.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to details on the Sew Delightful update, the Dreamlight Valley showcase also revealed a roadmap listing the contents of future free updates. The roadmap includes an Aladdin- and Jasmine-themed event set to take place in early 2025, an Alice In Wonderland-themed update scheduled for Spring 2025, and a tropical mystery players will have to solve at Skull Rock (home to Neverland's pirates) sometime in Summer 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">Lastly, the showcase revealed Storybook Vale (Part 1), a paid expansion that whisks players away to the titular world. Unfortunately, the likes of Maleficent and Hades have twisted the gorgeous, peaceful setting into a spooky world that players must navigate, solving puzzles and helping residents to restore Storybook Vale to its former glory. The expansion features tons of new collectible items, including new fish to catch, new berries to pick, and even harvestable lightning strikes--a reference to the gods of Mount Olympus and everyone's favorite on-fire baddie, Hades. Hades' feud with Maleficent has torn the realm apart, and references to both villains (and their origin stories) can be seen throughout the DLC.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4391727-ddlvmalnhades.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391727" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4391727-ddlvmalnhades.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391727"></a><figcaption>The Storybook Vale DLC sees players working to repair a world torn in two by Hades and Maleficent/</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4391727-ddlvmalnhades.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"Expansion passes let us recapture the feeling that we gave players the first time they stepped into the Valley, telling a whole new story with new villagers to meet, mysteries to unravel, and biomes to make all your own," creative director Josh Labelle explained. "They're a great way for us to deliver just a huge amount of content to players."</p><p dir="ltr">Labelle also revealed that unlike A Rift In Time--the game's first expansion pass, which arrived in three parts--Storybook Vale will be told in two parts. Part 1, titled Welcome To The Vale, launches on November 20. The second expansion, called The Unwritten Realms, is scheduled to release sometime in Summer 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">"With this new format, you'll get just as much content without as long of a wait," Labelle said.</p><p dir="ltr">Thankfully, players won't need to pay for Part 2 of the expansion. Just like with the game's initial, three-part expansion, buying Part 1 of Storybook Vale will automatically unlock the second half of the story when it launches this summer. Just like A Rift In Time before it, Storybook Vale will be available to purchase for $30 USD when it launches on November 20. New players can purchase the Disney Dreamlight Valley base game, A Rift In Time, and The Storybook Vale via the Dreamlight Valley Enchanted Edition bundle, which is available for $80 USD. Players who purchase and play The Storybook Vale by November 30 will also earn the Keeper Of Lore outfit for free (the item will arrive via the in-game mailbox).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4391729-ddlveditions.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391729" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4391729-ddlveditions.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4391729"></a><figcaption>There are a multitude of ways for players old and new to get their hands on the upcoming DLC.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4391729-ddlveditions.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">All in all, Dreamlight Valley players have tons of new content to keep them busy well into next year.

            <p>
Firewalk Studios, the Sony-owned developer behind ill-fated PlayStation shooter Concord, has been shut down, and the game will remain permanently offline despite earlier suggestions it could return. Sony's mobile-focused developer Neon Koi has also been closed.
</p>
<p>
Sony <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/an-update-from-playstation-studios/">confirmed Firewalk's closure in a post on its website</a>, sharing an email from Sony Interactive Entertainment boss Hermen Hulst sent to the company's employees earlier today. "We consistently evaluate our games portfolio and status of our projects to ensure we are meeting near and long-term business priorities," Hulst wrote. "As part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen SIE's Studio Business, we have had to make a difficult decision relating to two of our studios - Neon Koi and Firewalk Studios."
</p>
<p>
"Expanding beyond PlayStation devices and crafting engaging online experiences alongside our single-player games are key focal areas for us as we evolve our revenue streams," Hulst added. "We need to be strategic, though, in bringing our games to new platforms and recognise when our games fall short of meeting player expectations."

<p>
"Certain aspects of Concord were exceptional," Hulst continued, "but others did not land with enough players, and as a result we took the game offline. We have spent considerable time these past few months exploring all our options [and] after much thought, we have determined the best path forward is to permanently sunset the game and close the studio. I want to thank all of Firewalk for their craftsmanship, creative spirit and dedication."
</p><p>
"The PvP first-person shooter genre is a competitive space that's continuously evolving, and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title," Hulst added. "We will take the lessons learned from Concord and continue to advance our live service capabilities to deliver future growth in this area."
</p>
<p>
Concord has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">offline since the start of September</a>, when it was pulled from sale just two weeks after its PS5 and PC release, amid suggestions it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-has-sold-just-25000-copies-estimate-industry-analysts">sold less than 25,00 copies</a>. At the time, Sony said the game would remain offline indefinitely so Firewalk could "determine the best path ahead" and "explore options, including those that will better reach our players." Later that same month, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-director-reportedly-steps-down-as-studio-awaits-sony-decision-on-games-future">Concord game director Ryan Ellis had stepped down</a> and that remaining staff at Firewalk were in limbo while they awaited Sony's decision on the future of the game. Firewalk - which employed 150-170 people - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-acquires-firewalk-studios-as-it-continues-work-on-triple-a-multiplayer-exclusive">acquired by Sony last year</a>, as part of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">massive live-service push</a> under former PlayStation boss Jim Ryan. 
</p>
<p>
In addition to Firewalk's closure, Hulst announced Sony is shutting down its mobile-focused Neon Koi studio (formally Save Game Studios) and cancelling the developer's action game. "Mobile remains a priority growth area", Hulst insisted in his email to employees, "[but] we need to concentrate on titles that are in-line with PlayStation Studios' pedigree and have the potential to reach more players globally... I want to express my gratitude to everyone at Neon Koi for their hard work and endless passion to innovate."
</p>
<p>
"I know none of this is easy news to hear, particularly with colleagues and friends departing SIE," Hulst continued. "Both decisions were given serious thought, and ultimately, we feel they are the right ones to strengthen the organisation. Neon Koi and Firewalk were home to many talented individuals, and we will work to find placement for some of those impacted within our global community of studios where possible.
</p>
<p>
"I am a big believer in the benefits of embracing creative experimentation and developing new IP. However, growing through sustainable financials, especially in a challenged economic environment is critical.
</p>
<p>
"While today is a difficult day, there is much to look forward to in the months ahead from the Studio Business Group and our teams," Hulst concluded in his statement. "I remain confident that we are building a resilient and capable organisation driven by creating unforgettable entertainment experiences for our players."

			<p>It's been officially confirmed that Sony is shutting down Firewalk Studios, the game developer behind Concord. It isn't too surprising that this has happened, especially as Concord didn't land in the market the way Sony wanted it to. From the start of Concord's official release, it seemed that this was the way that Firewalk Studios was going to go. It's really unfortunate, as this was their first game with a lot of talented people, but the game wasn't marketed well, and it was a premium hero shooter in a sea of free-to-play hero shooters. Additionally, as soon as Concord was closed down and those who purchased it were refunded,<a href="https://wccftech.com/concords-director-has-reportedly-stepped-down/"> the Director of Concord</a> stepped down. It was noted by many who worked at Firewalk Studios that the developers still left at the studio were in limbo, and many also expected Firewalk Studios to be shut down.</p>
<p>It has now been confirmed by Jason Schreier that Sony is shutting down Firewalk Studios in a <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1851318988489248986?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1851318988489248986%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post on X</a>. Additionally, a<a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/an-update-from-playstation-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> full internal email</a> has been posted on the Sony Interactive Entertainment blog, where an internal email from Herman Hulst, the CEO of Sony has addressed the closure. However, in this email, not only did they announce that Firewalk Studios is being closed down, they also announced Neon Koi's closure, and the mobile action game they've been working on will no longer be going forward.</p>
<p>Regarding Concord and Firewalk Studios, Hulst's statement says: "Certain aspects of Concord were exceptional, but others did not land with enough players... We have spent considerable time these past few months exploring all our options." Hulst then goes on to explain that Concord is being permanently sunsetted, and Firewalk Studios is being closed. This means that Concord will not be going free-to-play after all, after it was noted that the files of the game were<a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-rumored-to-still-be-updating-on-steam-potential-to-go-free-to-play/"> still being updated</a> on SteamDB.</p>
<p>At the moment, there is a lot of uncertainty about where the staff affected will end up. The statement by Hulst says, "Neon Koi and Firewalk were home to many talented individuals, and we will work to find placement for some of those impacted within our global community of studios where possible." The number of staff they are looking to relocate and hire internally isn't stated, but it's possible that the numbers will come out in future updates as Firewalk Studio staff and Neon Koi staff members respond to the tragic news of both studios being closed.</p>

The final game reviewed okay, but critics by and large felt there was not enough to help Concord standout in an already crowded field of other established multiplayer shooters that were mostly free-to-play.</p><p>With some analysts estimating the game only sold around 25,000 copies in its first week, <em>Concord </em>was later taken offline less than a month after it launched. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/concord-firewalk-studios-relaunch-ps5-sony-playstation-1851652811&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/concord-firewalk-studios-relaunch-ps5-sony-playstation-1851652811"><em>Kotaku</em> previously reported</a></span> that game director Ryan Ellis had internally stepped down from his management role on the game while its future was assessed by Sony leadership.

<p>Path of Exile 2 developers, Grinding Gear Games, have revealed that their early access launch has been delayed for three weeks, with the new date set as December 6.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Path of Exile 2’s Game Director, Jonathan Rogers, revealed through a statement on <a href="https://x.com/pathofexile/status/1851096646140166559" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) that the game’s early access will have to be delayed. Rogers explained that they are not behind on “the game itself” but on “some service-side infrastructure work” that is taking much longer than intended.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rogers elaborated that keeping up with one of Path of Exile 2’s key promises is one of the major reasons for the delay. The team promised that all microtransactions would work across both titles, Path of Exile 1 and 2. However, to accomplish this feat, the developers have had to integrate the account systems for both games and console ports; they have changed the backend code and are conducting a bunch of load testing, which is time-consuming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Roger believes the game will still be complete by the launch date, but not without mistakes, and the developers don’t want these errors to happen. Hence, Path of Exile 2’s early access has been delayed by three weeks. Moreover, details about all the content players can expect during POE 2’s early access will be revealed through a live stream “in about four weeks.” This will be the biggest announcement Grinding Gears Games have ever made.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: According to Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, Sony’s closures of Firewalk Studios and Neon Koi will result in 210 people being let go in total. Firewalk sees 172 people lose their jobs while Neon Koi is another 38.</p>



<p><strong>ORIGINAL</strong>: Sony is shutting down Firewalk Studios. The news was first broken by Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, and Insider Gaming was quickly able to corroborate with sources. </p>



<p>Sony made the announcement public shortly after the news broke in a message on its <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/an-update-from-playstation-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official website</a>.</p>

<p>“We consistently evaluate our games portfolio and status of our projects to ensure we are meeting near and long-term business priorities,” PlayStation Studios CEO Hermen Hulst said. “As part of our ongoing efforts to strengthen SIE’s Studio Business, we have had to make a difficult decision relating to two of our studios – Neon Koi and Firewalk Studios.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hulst says that over the last few months the team at PlayStation explored “all [their] options” regarding the game. Despite those efforts, however, the decision was made to close the studio and sunset the game for good.</p>



<p>“After much thought, we have determined the best path forward is to permanently sunset the game and close the studio,” he said.  ” I want to thank all of Firewalk for their craftsmanship, creative spirit and dedication.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>He continued: “I know none of this is easy news to hear, particularly with colleagues and friends departing SIE.&nbsp; Both decisions were given serious thought, and ultimately, we feel they are the right ones to strengthen the organization.”</p>



<p>Concord launched in late August to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concords-launch-is-worse-than-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less than 1,000 players</a> on Steam and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-playstation-shutting-down-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roughly 25,000 copies sold</a>. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-playstation-shutting-down-concord/">game was shut down</a> two weeks later with talk of a potential return as a possible free-to-play shooter.</p>



<p>Ultimately, that didn’t happen and Sony has moved on. There was no mention by Sony if all employees will be let go or move to other areas within the company.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Sony for clarification on employment status for those at Firewalk Studios and Neon Koi.&nbsp;There have been nearly 14,000 known jobs lost to layoffs in 2024 within the games industry across nearly 160 companies.</p>



<p>You can read Hulst’s full memo to staff below.</p>

			<p>Now that Dragon Age: The Veilguard is about to launch, BioWare is expected to largely move on to the next Mass Effect game, the studio's next project. After all, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-mass-effect-team-helping-mark-darrah-advisor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> in March 2023, a sizable amount of the Mass Effect team temporarily helped with iteration and polish for the latest Dragon Age game; the favor is likely to be returned from now on.</p>
<p>Speaking of The Veilguard, some fans aren't too keen on the game's art style. Indeed, I had some criticism on that count myself in the otherwise highly positive review <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> yesterday:</p>
<p><em>From a visual standpoint, the game succeeds in providing many different biomes to explore as the party treks across Northern Thedas, fulfilling BioWare's promise to bring players to more locations than ever before. The environments generally look great, while the characters are a bit more of a hit-and-miss in that some are almost photorealistic and others look more stylized. In that regard, more uniformity would have been ideal.</em></p>
<p>Michael Gamble, who has been the Executive Producer of the Mass Effect series for a long time, has now <a href="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1850994136629068091" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reassured</a> fans on Twitter that the art style will be photorealistic, as it's been the case with previous entries:</p>
<p><em>Lots of people asking me about Mass Effect now that Veilguard reviews are out, and Oct 31 is close. Both are from the studio, but Mass Effect is Mass Effect. How you bring a Sci Fi RPG to life is different than other genres or IPs...and has to have different kinds of love. Mass Effect is photorealistic and will be as long as I'm running it.</em></p>
<p>Gamble also added that the sci-fi franchise would keep the mature tone of the original trilogy, although, on that note, I would say neither Andromeda nor Dragon Age have been any different.</p>
<p>It may be a long time before we see anything concrete about the next Mass Effect. Preproduction has been going on for a while, and we even <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-teaser-trailer-direct-sequel-to-me-trilogy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got</a> a very early teaser trailer showing off an aged Liara T'Soni back in December 2020. However, as insider Tom Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-mass-effect-four-years-away/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> a while ago, it will take at least three years of production from now on.</p>
<p>Based on the aforementioned teaser trailer and subsequent rumors, it seems BioWare will follow up on the original trilogy rather than keep the action in the Andromeda galaxy, given that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mass-effect-andromeda-pathfinder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2017 game</a> hasn't captivated the audience nearly as much as the previous games. However, we'll have to wait until we hear from the studio to know for sure.</p>

            <p>
I missed my chance to write about Hollywood Animal when a certain Nic Reuben swooped in like a rival showbiz talent scout and pinched the summer Steam Fest demo from right under my nose, capitalising on the fact that I was stranded in an airport at the time. I wrote about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-do-not-remember-minesweeper-featuring-this-much-horrible-ai-porno-spam-or-cranial-trauma">a very rude Minesweeper "homage"</a> instead. Hopefully that was for the best. 
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it's finally my chance for a bite at the apple, for developers Weappy Wholesome have just given their slice of throwback La La Land an early access release date: January 16th 2025. To celebrate, they've also published a new and fairly lengthy trailer. Grab yourself a scotch and a cigar and dig in.

<p>
As you might guess from the title and my cunning intro allusions, Hollywood Animal is a tycoon game in which you set up your own film studio at the dawn of sound cinema. You'll buy and furnish buildings such as script and post-production departments, hire a bunch of actors, writers, producers and other minions, and get to work generating a little stardust. 
</p><p>
It's all very involved, and not just at the level of production technicalities. You can dispatch private investigators to gather dirt on your whiniest employees, and bribe the mayor to overlook your many, many crimes. You can time and market the release of your movies perfectly after studying your competitor's projects, or simply ask the mafia to "clear the calendar". This is Hollywood's "golden age" in the sense that it's shiny and cold and hard and people will kill for it.
</p>
<p>
Nic might be a dirty, no-good thief, but his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollywood-animal-is-a-nifty-and-detailed-golden-age-simulator-populated-with-eminently-hireable-alcoholics">demo write-up is a lot of fun</a>. "Each film is rated for both 'audience approval' and 'artistic appeal'," he noted. "This may seem like an unnecessarily stringent binary, but remember this was pre-Boss Baby, so no-one knew you could master both yet."
</p>
<p>
The devs are calling it "a box of spiders disguised as a tycoon game". Good job, whoever came up with that line. I wish it was me. If you need further convincing, there's a new demo on the way in December.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-one-of-2024s-funniest-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Funny games are hard to make, but not outright impossible. Proof of this lies in the small scattering of rare punchlines across gaming’s history, from decades-old point-and-click adventures on Monkey Island to the slapstick-ridden British streets of this year’s Thank Goodness You're Here. Fascinatingly, it turns out 2024 has another, perhaps unexpected contender for funniest game of the year on the way, and it carries a hat and whip. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle stirred up several different feelings within me over the two or so hours I played at a recent preview event. The violent thrill of combat. The brain-tingling joy of solving ancient puzzles. I even felt a little lump in my throat upon hearing the instantly recognisable notes of John Willams' Marion’s Theme as Indy discovered a note from his now-distant love interest. But the overriding thing I did when playing was grin with childlike amusement. The Great Circle delivers physical comedy on par with the Hitman series, and looks set to be a worthy successor to IO’s World of Assassination trilogy when it comes to creating laughs through gameplay.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle - October 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a moment in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade when an over-confident Harrison Ford turns to his on-screen father, played by Sean Connery, to calm his fears about an incoming Nazi tank. “Dad, we’re well out of range”, he says, moments before that very same tank fires a shell that destroys a jeep 20 yards behind them. A combination of sharp scriptwriting, pinpoint performances, and Steven Spielberg’s masterful ability to play action scenes for both thrills and laughs within seconds of one another, it’s a useful reminder of just how humorous the Indy films are.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s very encouraging then that, from what I’ve played so far, the Great Circle is continuing that legacy of action comedy. Pushing enemies off high ledges and hearing their steadily fading Wilhelm screams is one thing, but it's in the malleable disposable weapons system that the chuckles really emerge. During an under-the-cover-of-night infiltration of the Vatican I had too much fun picking up any old item I could and bonking unaware guards over the head with them. Trucheons, shovels, umbrellas, and <em>three </em>different stringed instruments all collided with the backs and skulls of my unsuspecting prey. The combination of everyday object whistling through the air before hitting its bemused target with a thud made me laugh every time. It’s a simple pleasure, but maybe I’m a simple man.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It all built up to my pièce de résistance, though, as I foolishly threw a pocketed biscotti at an Italian bruiser.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It all built up to my pièce de résistance, though, as I foolishly threw a pocketed biscotti at an Italian bruiser. It dealt no damage but did make for a sweet moment of puzzlement on his face before he raised his fists to cover it. It felt like the punchline in an unwritten Indy adventure, one where a desperate Dr. Jones tries his luck with whatever’s in his bag and comes up desperately short. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s this willingness for the Great Circle to let you play with your food – and many other household items – that reminded me of the childish joy that IO Interactive’s Hitman games deliver in spades (sometimes literally). Indy may not have the gameplay design flexibility that Agent 47’s missions possess – given a banana, our favourite archaeologist’s actions would likely be limited to either thumping with or throwing it, instead of laying it down as a trap – but the essence of Hitman’s physical action comedy is absolutely there to be felt.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While The Great Circle may not share Hitman’s freedom of approach, it does try to include a number of pre-baked opportunities. For instance, on a trip to an excavation site at the Great Pyramids of Giza, I had to turn on a generator in order to power an elevator. Doing so electrified the water around me and fried a couple of unsuspecting members of the Third Reich. Whipping guns out of Nazi fingertips and witnessing the shock on their faces is also a thrill, as is wrapping it around their ankles to trip them up. And disguising yourself as a local dig worker shares the same feeling of naughtiness that dressing as one of 47’s many, many outfits does. Get caught and you’ll have to fight your way out of the situation, the panic in itself creating comedy and reflecting Indy’s clumsy, sometimes bumbling nature, as you grab hold of anything close and chuck it at anyone with a swastika on their sleeve.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>MachineGames’ level design encourages you to survey the arena and find a smarter, or potentially funnier solution to each action puzzle.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a professor of history who fancies himself a swashbuckling archaeologist, after all, not a full-blooded action hero. This is best displayed in the game’s opening encounter, where he is quickly knocked out by the man mountain of a mysterious figure played by the Candyman himself, Tony Todd. This rough and tumble is really what I’ve enjoyed about the Great Circle’s combat and general approach to enemy encounters so far. You’d maybe imagine something a lot closer to Uncharted, with vast swathes of battle between the archaeological finds, but in reality, I only shot a gun twice in over two hours. Developer MachineGames’ level design encourages you to survey the arena and find a smarter, or potentially funnier solution to each action puzzle. It’s far more fitting for the character and what we’ve seen from him on-screen for over five decades now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this talk of player-led gameplay should not fully overshadow the great job that MachineGames has seemingly done when it comes to the more authored aspects, though – the story, world, and characters. The tone feels authentically Indy and the snappy writing, combined with Troy Baker’s uncanny Ford impression, goes a long way to evoking the pulpy tone of the original movie trilogy. Jones comes across as that delightful blend of smarts, sarcasm, and cockiness that made us fall in love with him the first time around. A combination of tickling one-liners when delivering knockout punches and charmingly crafted cutscenes, such as Indy's horror at having to feed a friend’s pet snake, are genuinely funny.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It all links back to MachineGames and Bethesda’s collaborators, LucasFilm, and, indeed, the beloved LucasArts games of the 90s. Hits such as The Secret of Monkey Island, Grim Fandango, and of course, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis were not only incredibly fun point-and-click adventures but often hilarious. Not only brilliantly written, they frequently delivered laughs through gameplay and the bizarre use of items such as rubber chickens and balloon animals. It’s exciting to see MachineGames embrace this use of everyday objects as comedy props, too, as well as the more expected humour that traces back to the studio’s Wolfenstein series that also poked fun at the Nazi regime. If B.J. Blazkowicz can find himself auditioning for Hitler at his Venus base, just think of what bizarre situations the Swedish studio has in store for Indy, who himself is no stranger to the occult or otherworldly. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s fair to say I find myself very encouraged by what I played of the Great Circle. Its willingness to be silly, but never compromise smart gameplay systems for cheap laughs, is hitting a sweet spot for me that I want out of an Indiana Jones game. With the tone nailed, I’m left very excited to uncover the full adventure in December. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Stick and stones may break Simon Cardy's bones but fedora hats and whips excite him.

The achievement is called "Fector's Challenge", and it requires the player to beat in-universe minigame Journey of the Prairie King without dying. Only 1.2% of players had the achievement at the time Barone earned it.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Finally got 100% achievements in Stardew Valley <a href="https://t.co/hoaSmDnTWi" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/hoaSmDnTWi</a></p>— ConcernedApe (@ConcernedApe) <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1851124749994455547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 29, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Journey of the Prairie King is an arcade game the player can access in the Stardrop Saloon. It's a top-down, twin-stick shooter where the player must shoot enemies that appear in waves from all sides of the screen while avoiding touching both enemies and their projectiles. The player starts with four lives, and extra lives are available as rewards, so in order to just beat Journey of the Prairie King it's not necessary to never die. You just have to avoid dying too much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What Barone did is considerably more intense. It requires not dying at all, not even once, a pretty challenging feat especially if you've ever seen what gameplay of Journey of the Prairie King looks like. There are three stages total, with the first stage including four levels plus a boss, and the second and third stages each including three areas and a boss. The enemies get more difficult and varied the further you go, and collecting good upgrades at certain points is critical to survival, so there's at least some element of luck involved too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So even though Barone made this ridiculous challenge, it's not exactly surprising that he would struggle to finish it himself on a regular playthrough of Stardew Valley, especially since he probably has better things to do with his time than practice Journey of the Prairie King. Congrats to ConcernedApe! Good luck to the rest of us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stardew Valley remains a masterpiece even eight years later, with our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-review-2024">re-review earlier this year</a> saying that "eight years of updates have grown Stardew Valley into a modern classic with an endless list of enticing activities to complete and a deeply satisfying time management challenge to take on." Its latest update, 1.6, is out now on PC and is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-console-and-mobile-16-update-finally-has-a-release-date">finally coming to consoles on November 4, 2024</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p>As of today, there are seven days left in the campaign for the U.S. Presidential election. Now, the Democratic ticket headlined by Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz is courting the gamer vote by launching their own map on Fortnite.</p><p>Fortnite players can access the Harris/Walz map by entering a code, 733155366547. The name of the map is Freedom Town, USA, and it may be the most pointed political use of Fortnite since it launched in 2015. Harris' team also posted a quick trailer for Freedom Town, including a look at some fighters in patriotic gear.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRv2fIx7-II" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wRv2fIx7-II" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Freedom Town has been planned out to include Harris' campaign promises geared towards small businesses and first-time home owners, as well as a pledge to focus on affordable housing. Additionally, Fortnite content creators including Jordan "Huskerss" Thomas, MODELMORG, Himalyahs, and Khairi "Kdot" Harris will have dedicated streams set in Freedom Town.</p><p>While Harris may not play many games herself, Walz has acknowledged that he was a big Sega Dreamcast fan just over two decades ago, especially for the game Crazy Taxi. Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vice-presidential-candidate-tim-walz-finally-gets-to-play-crazy-taxi-again/1100-6527435/" data-ref-id="1100-6527435">Walz played Crazy Taxi</a> while appearing on a stream with Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. During that appearance, Walz acknowledged that a video game developer made <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modder-adds-vice-presidential-candidate-tim-walz-to-crazy-taxi/1100-6526465/" data-ref-id="1100-6526465">a Crazy Taxi mod</a> that includes the governor as a playable character.</p><p>So far, the Republican campaign led by Donald Trump and J.D. Vance hasn't answered with a Fortnite map of their own. But with the election just a week away, the campaign will all be over soon enough.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> creator Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone has earned one of Steam's most impressive achievements for his own game.</p>
<p>Eight years since the farming sim made its debut, Barone has "finally got 100 percent achievements in Stardew Valley". This means the creator has even completed Fector's Challenge, something only 1.2 percent of other players have actually achieved at the time of Barone's own completion.</p>
<p>Fector's Challenge requires players to beat the mini-game 'Journey of the Prairie King', which may sound simple enough, at least until you realise you have to do it without dying, which significantly increases the challenge.</p>

<p>Barone shared news of his achievement on social media, with an accompanying screenshot. When another player joked they hoped the Stardew Valley development team noticed his feat, Barone replied: "The dev gave me a pat on the back."</p>
<p>He also revealed he had completed the challenge - the only one he didn't have in the bag - over a "couple of days", as he was on a multiplayer farm. "But I didn't 'cheese' it with the reloads, it was a legitimate no-death run," Barone assured.</p><p>As for any advice for others looking to get a 100 percent achievement rate in Stardew Valley by also completing Fector's Challenge? "You need money, so don't use the 'nukes' because the enemies don't drop anything from that," Barone said. "Purchase the best item you can afford in this order: ammo &gt; revolver &gt; boots. Save a machine gun powerup for fighting Fector, you can take him down before he even has a chance to attack [you]."</p>

<p>Things remain on track for this date, Barone said last week.</p>

Nintendo has announced that <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9862024/xenoblade-chronicles-x">a remaster of Monolith Soft’s 2015 action RPG</a>, will launch on the Switch on March 20, 2025. According to the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241029757838/en/">press release</a>, the remaster features enhanced visuals and added story elements.</p><p>Nintendo released a new trailer to mark the occasion and its opening seconds feel hilariously on the nose. There’s something deeply ironic about the trailer for a Switch port of a ten-year old Wii U game starting with the dialogue, “Well, here we are. Not too shabby, huh?” It’s like a tongue-in-cheek joke acknowledging there’s a wealth of Wii U games in desperate need of salvation (<strong>coughs</strong> <em>Wind Waker</em> <strong>coughs</strong>) and <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em> was one of the lucky ones to get a lifeboat off the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/21/22988902/nintendo-wiiu-3ds-eshop-closure-dmca-section-1201">sunken, inaccessible ship that is the Nintendo back catalogue</a>. </p><p>In addition to porting old Wii U games, Nintendo’s still releasing new titles in the twilight days of the Switch. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180608/mario-and-luigi-brothership-release-date-nintendo-direct"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em></a> is due out next week.

            <p>A number of Call Of Duty: Ops 6 quality assurance staff from Eden Prarie, Minnesota have walked out in protest over Activision's ending of hybrid or remote working, which was announced in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activisions-ending-of-hybrid-working-for-qa-staff-leaves-our-most-vulnerable-employees-behind-says-union">December last year</a>. They're being supported by the Communication Workers Of America union, who <a href="https://www.cwa7250.org/index.php/11-news/303-activision-workers-to-rally-for-wfh-accommodations">claim</a> that Activision are forcing the return to the office on staff "with serious medical conditions and doctor's recommendations to work from home".</p><!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-developers-strike-over-office-working-policy">Eurogamer</a>, Activision workers group ABetterABK have also <a href="https://x.com/ABetterABK/status/1849816772670578822">issued a statement</a> criticising the "unequal" ROI policy, which has been in effect for nine months. The ABK union say the move has "unquestionably harmed disabled employees and employees in need of work from home accommodations", who have been refused exemption from the policy. </p>
<p>There's also a reference to staff being "disrespected" by a recent company email discussing the USA's National Disability Employment Awareness Month, which falls in October. The email in question apparently "depicted a disabled person working from home while our coworkers in need are not allowed this essential tool for equal accessibility," according to the ABK statement. As such, it argues that Activision have "been championing [diversity, equity &amp; inclusion] while they continually fail us."</p>
<p>The walkout is small, with about <a href="https://x.com/cwa7250/status/1849961465442136265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">30 people shown holding CWA signs in photographs</a>, but it's caught the attention of local media like Fox9. </p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">Eurogamer</a> also have a statement from Activision, in which an Acti spokesperson comments that negotiations around individual employee needs are "ongoing", despite the many months since the policy was introduced.</p>
<p>"We respect our employees' rights to express their point of view," it reads. "We understand that returning to the office has been an adjustment for some. We engage in an interactive process with employees who request accommodations. This is an ongoing conversation at the bargaining table, and we will continue to discuss our respective interests in that forum." </p><p>The Activision QA walkout is one of many clashes between developers and management over the end of hybrid and fully remote-working since the lifting of pandemic lockdown measures. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/700-ubisoft-staff-in-france-hold-strikes-in-response-to-worldwide-return-to-office-mandate-from-assassins-creed-publisher">700 Ubisoft staff went on strike in protest</a> at a three-day return to the office mandate which the French Video Game Workers Union (STJV) insists was arrived at "without any tangible justification or any consultation with the workers' representatives".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
