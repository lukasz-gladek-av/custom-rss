            <p>
Respawn Entertainment has announced Apex Legends' upcoming Season 22 will make significant changes to the free-to-play shooter's Battle Pass "experience", by releasing two Battle Passes per season instead of one, and then charging full price for each.
</p>
<p>
As of Season 22, Apex Legends will ditch its current season-long Battle Pass in favour of two half-season Battle Passes - one launching at a season's start and another at its mid-point "split" - each featuring 60 levels of rewards, compared to the previous version's 110.
</p>
<p>
Despite the truncated number of progression levels, each new half-season premium Battle Pass costs approximately the same as the older season-long version. Previously, a premium Battle Pass cost 950 Apex Coins (a 1000-coin bundle is priced at $9.99 USD), and Respawn's new half-season Battle Passes cost $9.99 each. A new Premium+ tier (replacing the existing Premium Bundle) is $19.99 every half-season, and a free tier remains available.

<p>
Additionally, the overhauled Battle Pass will no longer be purchasable using Apex Coins (previously,  coins earned in one Battle Pass could be spent on the next) and can only be acquired by spending real money. "The decision to move from [premium currency] is not one that we made lightly," Respawns writes in its <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/battle-pass-update">announcement post</a>, "but it does allow us to decrease the price of Premium+ for our community." It also insists the Battle Pass changes are required to make the system "more approachable and realistic for our global player community", and that the "updated aspects... make the Battle Pass more attainable and valuable for your time and money".
</p>

</figure>
<p>
Respawn's 'value' argument more specifically relates to the reward "refresh" its made across all three tiers of its Battle Passes. These adjustments have seen the removal of lesser-used rewards, twice as many Crafting Materials now being awarded across a season, plus three more Legendary/Epic Apex Packs per Battle Pass, plus additional rewards for the Premium+ tier as per the infographic below. All this amounts to "double the Battle Pass rewards across the entire season", according to Respawn.
</p>
<p>
Unsurprisingly, the community response to Respawn's announcement has been far from positive, with comments over on the Apex Legends' subreddit calling the move everything from an "abysmal decision" and "a truly embarrassing money grab" to "the worst fucking shit I've ever seen". The <a href="https://x.com/PlayApex/status/1810330029265420515">announcement on Twitter/X</a> has over 2.9K replies at the time of writing, all overwhelmingly negative.
</p>
<p>
Will the community outcry be enough to convince Respawn and publisher EA to reverse the decision? Time will tell, but for now, Respawn is hoping to reel players into the new system by giving away its first half-season Battle Pass for free when it launches alongside Apex Legends' Season 22 later this year. As long as players log in and complete a set of challenges within the first two weeks, that is.
</p>
<p>
Apex Legends' 21st season, Upheaval, started in May and is expected to due in August.

When Dead Rising was originally released in 2006, its soundtrack included several licensed tracks, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLYuGZng3s4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heaven's Creepin' In by Supernova Syndicate</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CU_jMx9cCs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slave by The Evolutionaries</a>. Yet the game's most notable licensed music track was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWZVKU5imx0&amp;pp=ygUUTGlmZXNlZWtlciBnb25lIGd1cnU%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lifeseeker's Gone Guru</a>, played every time the character encountered the Convicts while roaming in Leisure Park. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>There had been speculation about whether Capcom would use licensed music from Dead Rising in Deluxe Remaster, especially with Lifeseeker's Marc Lariviere posting on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lifeseeker1/posts/pfbid02ratWyV37dzGAHmbahkPGfT9j4ZqJ8tgxqCFoByDgDnSnA6LkYWVpB9jD34f62GR9l?__cft__[0]=AZX7I7iffXeILj8lVZFcQKACQsCOUuao0cog9Z8wo6gP4g9JuUd6GiHJEp0IikMYPHd9ti9O-FJFp1jO58e3KRSwDE41DMME79W9fhbqM0xkFwh6q5cs8k6Mj1_pN0-mIdK3te6irRJEHGgVg6S4rAruC31nAuomFd-NNHbsDTulDQ&amp;__tn__=%2CO%2CP-R" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C9I3lnLBZv0/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> that he was unsure whether or not Gone Guru would be included. Though Lariviere did reveal that the last time Capcom remastered the game, referring to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/09/dead-rising-re-releases-get-launch-date-and-price">2016 HD re-release</a>, the studio "did not tell him" whether or not the song would be included. </p><p>In the meantime, fans continue to speculate about will be included in the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. Most notably, many were shocked to learn that T.J. Rotolo, who voiced protagonist Frank West, will not be reprising his role because <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/original-frank-west-voice-actor-says-capcom-didnt-ask-him-to-return-for-dead-rising-deluxe-remaster">Capcom did not ask him</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>On the flipside, fans can expect thhe return of the photography mini-game (with some updates such as an Auto Focus feature) and the <a href="https://www.deadrising.com/1/en-us/floormap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mall's directory and map layout</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/07/08/how-romance-and-relationships-work-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is a BioWare RPG, which means a lot of things, including the fact that the game will feature romance. Based on what I learned during a recent trip to BioWare's Edmonton office for the current <em>Game Informer</em> cover story, Veilguard will be the team's most romantic game yet.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Relationship Level</h2>












<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="b1bd3189-2248-412f-9626-b67426ecbf13" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>Every companion in the game has a Relationship Level related to Rook, and the choices you make (and not even specifically about the companion, but in the world in general), what you say to companions, how you help or don't help them, and more all play into it. Every time you rank up a companion's Relationship Level, you unlock a skill point to spend specifically on that companion. Though companion skill trees pale in comparison to Rook's expansive tree, which features passive abilities, combat abilities, and more, as well as paths to three unique class specializations, there's still some customization here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each companion has access to five abilities, but you can only take three into combat. Thus, it's important to strategize which abilities to spend a skill point on and how those abilities can synergize with your current build on the battlefield. Though I couldn't confirm, Dragon Age series art director Matt Rhodes hints that companion issues, problems, and personal quests will play into this Relationship Level and how a companion interacts with Rook.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"[Bellara Lutara, for example] has her own story arc that runs parallel to and informs the story path you're on," Rhodes tells me while I watch game director Corinne Busche play through a linear, story-driven mission in Arlathan Forest where Rook is searching for Bellara. Busche adds that "relationships are key, not only romance but friendships. We wanted to lean into not just the relationships the characters have with you but the relationships they have with each other. It's a found family, and at the end of the day, they need to trust they all have each other's back."&nbsp;</p>














<article data-embed-button="image_browser_uploader" data-entity-embed-display="view_mode:file.body_default_rendered" data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="d9b523b2-4d7b-4eeb-9d32-a3ede2420061" data-langcode="en" data-entity-embed-display-settings="[]">





</article><p>However, fret not, BioWare fans – romance is a key part of relationships in the game, Busche says, noting some of the romances will get quite spicy. However, not all of them will, as "each romance has a very different flavor," according to Busche. Some characters are straight to the point, while others are more awkward, having never been in a relationship before. "You learn who these characters are in how their romances unfold," she says. She likens romantic and platonic relationships to another way to "level up" your companions. It's not just experience and skill points that determine Rook's standing with companions, but diegetic conversations, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>BioWare has already revealed that every companion in Veilguard is pansexual, notably different from the community-dubbed "playersexual" approach in some games, which sees NPCs adjust romantic and sexual interests based on the player rather than their own sense of sexuality. As pansexual companions, they are attracted to people of any gender (or regardless of gender). That's a critical distinction because, in Veilguard, your companions aren't just going to vie for your affection – they might take attraction to other companions in the titular Veilguard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Giving one companion the cold shoulder might nudge them into the warm shoulder of someone else on the team. Busche says companions can form romances with each other, although I'm unable to confirm if that means locking Rook out of forming a romance with them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I saw nothing resembling romance in my very early hours with the game. However, I did see the romantically inclined "emotional" response in Rook's dialogue choices at times, which led to my Rook flirting with ice mage and private detective companion Neve Gallus. Busche says this is the option to flirt and push platonic relationships into romantic territory, though Rook's flirtatious efforts aren't always reciprocated. But that's not to say you should ignore the other options – I saw dialogue choices resembling friendly, snarky, and direct, too, and I can see how these different flavors of dialogue likely mix and mingle into Rook's relationships with companions. It's still a mostly mysterious system to me, but as Veilguard is due out this fall, I don't have to wait too long to learn more and neither do you.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/quests-from-infinite-staircase-dd-review-perfect-for-more-than-one-shot-but-not<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, there's a lot of published content that can be completed in one or two sessions, while the rest will take you over a year of continuous play to complete. Their latest book, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/everything-you-need-to-know-about-quests-from-infinite-staircase-dd-adventure"><em>Quests From The Infinite Staircase</em></a>, is an anthology book of remastered adventures that instead fills the space of "What if I only had a summer to run an adventure?"</p>
<h2>Information Hands To Players Or Potential Infinite Staircase DMs</h2>
<p>Some top-level information about this book for potential players before getting too into the weeds for DMs is that <em>Quests From The Infinite Staircase</em> features six adventures, there adventures range from level 1 up to level 13.</p>
<p>The adventures are all pulled from earlier versions of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons,</em> each published between the years of 1980-1984. The adventures included consist of <em>The Lost City, When a Star Falls, Beyond the Crystal Cave, Pharaoh, The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth, </em>and<em> <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3f193438-c569-4842-9887-3f37e300a96e" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/dungeons-dragons-expedition-to-barrier-peaks-preview-stepping-directly-into">Expeditions to the Barrier Peaks</a></em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3f193438-c569-4842-9887-3f37e300a96e" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/dungeons-dragons-expedition-to-barrier-peaks-preview-stepping-directly-into">.</a></p>

<p>Each adventure has been remade not only for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e</em> but also with an eye on balancing encounters better, adding more tools for the DM to guide the narrative, and a sensitivity pass (at least for Pharaoh)</p>
<p>Unlike <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fd0050cc-2541-4de8-858f-46e54f556d11" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/keys-from-golden-vault">previous anthologies</a> where a book might come with 10 adventures, most only covering a single level of play each of the adventures found within <em>Quests From The Infinite Staircase</em> spans at least three levels of play.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This seems like the right amount of time for any new DM who is interested in running something with a bit more depth than a one-shot, but isn't ready to commit the time to a full campaign (or for a group of friends whose schedules only allow for two or three sessions before things fall apart).</p>
<h2>Nafas and the Infinite Staircase</h2>
<p>Much like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c69efd7c-c5a7-4b44-a82c-59be6e59f819" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-and-dragons-candlekeep-mysteries-review"><em>Candlekeep Mysteries</em></a> had the idea of books as a running theme through adventures, or Van Richten's Guide To Ravenloft was centered on Domains of Dread this book has the Infinite Staircase and the Noble Genie, Nafas, as its central theme.</p>

<p>Introducing the Infinite Staircase the book describes it as "an impossible staircase [that] winds in a surreal demiplane, ascending to every world, every plane of existence, and the adventure found among them."</p>
<p>The book does a good job of introducing who Nafas is and how he can be used to create a narrative tie between each of these adventures. His inclusion is wholly optional to a DM who can just as easily drop any of these adventures into their world, or start with a plot hook that puts the party right at the start of the action.</p>
<p>While Nafas is an optional tool for this book one thing I did enjoy seeing was the way that the book prompted Nafas' use in any other scenario. Being a Genie who hears the wishes of others through the many doors of the Infinite Staircase the book prompts that you might want to use Nafas if your party is looking to learn the true name of a powerful enemy, need to destroy a magic item, or to restore life to a creature.</p>

<h2>Adventures Across Realms And Playstyles</h2>
<p>The adventures that can be found in this book are predominantly dungeon crawls, which makes sense when you remember each adventure is from the 80s. <em>The Lost City</em> has you moving through floors of a Ziggaurat, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3f193438-c569-4842-9887-3f37e300a96e" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/dungeons-dragons-expedition-to-barrier-peaks-preview-stepping-directly-into"><em>Expedition To The Barrier Peaks</em> consists of exploring a buried spaceship</a>, and <em>The Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth</em> is self-explanatory.</p>
<p>While players will be moving from room to room hearing descriptions of caves, pieces of furniture, and getting ambushed by various creatures there is also plenty of story to uncover. Hosting each of these adventures within a contained space helps for a beginner DM to let the party lead the adventure following up to provide them with information where necessary.</p>
<p>From the books first adventure, <em>The Lost City</em>, I enjoyed that while it was a contained Level 1-4 Adventure with a narrative start, middle, and end that there were elements left hanging.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The party is able to work with (or against) the different factions and escape the ziggurat, the book then provides two further options for players. Another, far deadlier, floor of the ziggaurat that might have the party return at level 10+, or an Underground City setting that can be used as a launching-off point for further adventures.</p>
<p>The most impressive adventure in terms of sheer scale is that of <em>Expedition To The Barrier Peaks</em>. This four-level spaceship launches level 11 players into the middle of a science fiction adventure. Adding to the regular roster of Magic Weapons there are Technology Weapons and Items including but not limited to the Antigravity Belt, Needler Pistol, Paralysis Pistol and Powered Armor.</p>
<p>Across the 60+ rooms found in this mega-dungeon players will be collaborating with the onboard AI, meeting different factions that reside among the ship, dealing with renegade androids, and trying to minimize threats onboard. There has been upgrading done to this adventure in the form of making less empty rooms, as well as reordering some of the more interesting encounters to be more directly in the player's paths.</p>

<p>Some other key features of the other adventures include the more narrative-heavy When A Star Falls, and Beyond The Crystal Cave, the latter of which can be completed without needing to resort to combat at all.</p>
<h2><em>Quests From The Infinite Staircase</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p><em>Quests From The Infinite Staircase</em> is a fun collection of 'best of' hits from the early age of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. As always it's good to see these kinds of adventures get the reverence they're owed while also being updated to better fit the game in it's current state.</p>
<p>Overall the most exciting aspect of this book for me is that it fills that space for short and medium adventures that aren't a 'one and done' situation. This is a good gateway for new DMs and new Players to get a taste of what it's like coming back to the table a few times over with the same party configuration.</p>
<p>While the Infinite Staircase and Nafas are only briefly delved into what info is provided does a better job of setting up Nafas as a force to use in a larger game than as the throwaway quest giver within the pages of this book.</p>
<p>If you're interested in playing <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> and find 4-6 session adventures are up your alley then this book is a must have.</p>

		<p>No, nothing is wrong with your email filter. These weekly newsletters are one of the things that fell through the cracks while we were doing our in-person stream in New York City, and then upon our return. I'm sorry. I should've just sent a short email saying "hey, this isn't happening" but there was so little time in-between going to and from New York, recovering from New York, and then preparing to be largely offline during the week after. A huge additional pain involved the monumental effort of getting an above ground pool setup in my backyard, the difficulties of which you'll hear in greater detail on an episode of HOA I'm going to record tomorrow with Rob. My back is still a little sore, and I still have mud that I'm finding under my fingernails, I think. It'll all make more sense soon enough.</p><p>-pk, who wishes he was enjoying this season of <em>The Bear </em>a little more</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>Monday: </strong>Planning! I did my best to keep up with email even when I was off last week, but it still left a million follow-up emails to be sent, not to mention the fact that a vacation I've had planned for a year now happens to coincide with our July 4th break, which means I'm stressed all over again preparing for that family event. My stress strategy is to not think about how much is left to do, and simply do what is in front of me, check it off the list, and then move onto the next. Otherwise, I can feel the anxiety creeping up my neck. It's not helping that the video game I'm mostly playing right now is the stressful <em>Nine Sols</em>, but weirdly, I find my time with that game to mostly un-stress me.</li><li><strong>Tuesday:</strong> We'll record an episode of HOA where Rob talks me through a bunch of apartment stuff happening as he considers whether it's time to sell and move on, and I walk you through what it's like to build and fill a pool, only to realize that you did not account for a few things, and now you have to drain the pool, dismantle the pool, buy a bunch of stone pavers, and spend an afternoon digging holes in the rain. It was a thing, but hey, I've got a pool now.</li><li><strong>Wednesday: </strong>HOA will publish, and we'll return to pushing a boulder up a hill, while chit chatting about how our holiday went. And no, I am not picking up from where I left off from the in-person stream. Instead, I have to start from scratch, because the game does not have cloud saves, and philosophically, it feels right my ass is forced to push that entire boulder up the hill all over again.</li><li><strong>Thursday: </strong>Remap Radio gets recorded—with Janet, of course—and with any luck, we won't have to spend much of that time talking about Dr. Disrespect. Rob and I will hopefully publish a letter series about the summer by then, too.</li><li><strong>Friday: </strong>Remap Radio goes live, and then Rob and Cado return to the world of motorsports with <em>Motorsports Manager</em>. I assume everything is going well?</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to&nbsp;</em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em>support@remapradio.com</em></a><em>.</em></p>

Detractors said it was just another bro movie, dismissing it as fodder for straight men. Supporters, including our very own Carolyn Petit who has been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tumblr.com/agameofme/95352476622/time-is-luck&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tumblr.com/agameofme/95352476622/time-is-luck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">singing <em>Miami Vice</em>’s praises for years</a></span>, said otherwise. But I had never seen it, so I sat down this weekend to watch it. And guess what? <em>Miami Vice</em> rules. </p><p>Watching the opening scene felt like someone broke into my house and stabbed me with a shot of adrenaline before I could even register what was going on. I leaned forward in my seat, absolutely flummoxed that “Numb/Encore” was blasting through the sound bar, confused at the complete lack of a title card or opening credits. When Colin Farrell and his beautiful <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.madison-reed.com/balayage&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.madison-reed.com/balayage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Balayaged</a></span> hair swept into view, a small gasp left my lips. When he ordered two mojitos and proceeded to suck them down while hungrily staring at the bartender, I worried the look on my face betrayed my most impure thoughts.<br></p><p><em>Miami Vice</em> is a hot movie, but it’s so much more than that. Mann is uniquely capable of making a film that feels like it has both a huge dick and a huge heart. The fast cars, the preoccupation with tactile tech, and the long, lingering sex scenes could all push this movie into flatly masculine territory, but Mann’s deft hand steadies it. The <em>plot</em> of <em>Miami Vice</em> follows two almost superhuman cops going undercover in a global drug-smuggling operation, but that’s not what this movie is about.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="46ce21edd05095fc7dfdd47de16f6d03" data-recommend-id="image://46ce21edd05095fc7dfdd47de16f6d03" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gong Li and Colin Farrell look at each other while on a speedboat during sunset.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Miami Vice</em> is about love. It’s about loving the right person at the wrong time, and about how clinging to that love could destroy you. It’s about the illogical nature of love, about falling for someone so immediately and intensely that it intoxicates you, your head swimming like you had too many mojitos, the two of you incapable of keeping your hands to yourselves because touching each other is like taking another shot of liquor.<br></p><p>It happens so fast: Farrell’s Sonny Crockett asks to take Gong Li’s Isabella (the financial advisor for the global drug-smuggling ring) for a drink and before you know it, the two are racing across the open ocean on a speedboat, headed to Havana, where they disappear for a few days, falling into each other and out of everything else. They salsa dance, they fuck in the shower, they trade deeply personal stories, they entwine—all while Sonny is undercover, all while the sting is still ongoing. Periodic shots of darkening clouds, bolts of lightning, and rough ocean waters warn us of how dangerous their dalliance is—but the viewer, like Sonny and Isabella, doesn’t care. You&nbsp;don’t have time to.<br></p><p><em>Miami Vice</em> moves at breakneck speed (so much so I was often confused about what was happening and almost delirious from it), recreating the feeling of falling hard for someone you’ve just met. It sweeps you up in that love, so you yourself feel just as crazy as Sonny, just as willing to put yourself in danger for something that moves you so intensely. How can a movie that manages that not be considered an all-timer?</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In case you were living under a rock in 2021, toward the end of the show (spoilers) it was revealed that Kathryn Hahn’s Agatha Harkness was the evil witch causing much of Wanda’s pain and suffering inside a giant magical hex. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/P8u8md-NiHM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/P8u8md-NiHM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This big reveal happened via an extremely catchy song</a></span> that ended up going mega-viral on social media. That song,<em> Agatha All Along</em>, is also the name of the new upcoming spin-off which just got its first teaser. </p><p>On July 8, after the series underwent numerous name changes, Disney released a teaser trailer for <em>Agatha All Along,</em> which is set to premiere on Disney+ with two episodes on September 18. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/agatha-all-along-trailer-marvel-wandavision-kathryn-hahn-1235320185/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/agatha-all-along-trailer-marvel-wandavision-kathryn-hahn-1235320185/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s the official show description</a></span> courtesy of Marvel and <em>Variety</em>: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“The infamous Agatha Harkness finds herself down and out of power after a suspicious goth teen helps break her free from a distorted spell. Her interest is piqued when he begs her to take him on the legendary Witches’ Road, a magical gauntlet of trials that, if survived, rewards a witch with what they’re missing. Together, Agatha and this mysterious teen pull together a desperate coven, and set off down, down, down The Road.”</p></blockquote><p>In the trailer, we see direct nods to the television-themed <em>WandaVision</em> as well as a bigger focus on creepy witch shenanigans and new stars and characters, like Aubrey Plaza as the witch Rio Vidal. It seems Vidal has a history with Harkness and I’m curious to see how these two are connected. I’m also just really excited for a witchy, creepy, spooky show like this to be arriving right around Halloween season, aka the best time of the year. </p><p>Oh and come on, Kathryn Hahn is great, and giving her a full TV show is wonderful. Hopefully,<em> Agatha All Along </em>lives up to the hype and can match or even exceed <em>WandaVision</em> when it lands on September 18 exclusively on Disney+. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gg-domain-created-no-reason-gamers/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a recent report published by the BBC, the history of the .gg domain extension was explored by the tag’s creator. In 1996, Dr Nigel Roberts, from the island of Guernsey, co-created the .gg domain extension with a friend, but it was never intended to become associated with many of the world’s top gaming brands and platforms.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-good-game">Good Game</h2>



<p>If you’re a gamer, you’ve probably heard or seen the term ‘gg’. It’s a simple thing – it means ‘good game’, and it’s typically said when a match has ended. The more aggravating term is ‘gg ez’, which is known to have an unparalleled level of power over salty gamers worldwide.</p>



<p>When Dr. Roberts created the .gg domain extension in 1996, he did so because ‘all the other good two-letter codes were already taken’. He also created .je, but that hasn’t reached the lofty heights of the iconic ‘.gg’ extension. In <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx726l23dlpo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the article by the BBC</a>, Dr. Roberts explained that the popularity of the extension is great because it brings attention to Guerney, the island in the English Channel where the domain extension is registered.</p>



<p>Officially, it’s the top-level domain for the Bailiwick of Guernsey, so it’s used by sites operating within that region. However, as a result of the popularity of the term in the gaming world, it has become synonymous with gaming brands and platforms. It’s a similar story with .tv, which is best recognised for being the domain extension for Twitch. It’s tied to the Polynesian country of Tuvalu, which has a population of just 11,000, and it’s responsible for almost 9% of the government’s revenue.</p>



<p>Could you think of a better domain extension for the world of gaming? I couldn’t.</p>

<p>This one has been a long time coming. </p>



<p>Fallout 76 has enjoyed a few months of rampant popularity thanks to the wildfire success of the Fallout TV series. From April onwards, Fallout 76’s player count skyrocketed on all platforms, and the community blew up overnight. It also helps that Bethesda Game Studios has pumped the post-apocalyptic MMORPG full of content updates, which has helped to keep things fresh and keep players engaged.</p>



<p>In a recent effort by a dataminer, it was found that a future update could bring about a major update that Fallout 76 fans have been holding out for since 2021.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-never-go-alone">Never Go Alone</h2>



<p>In 2021, Bethesda Game Studios laid out a bunch of plans regarding Fallout 76, and one of the items on that list was a companion mechanic that would allow players to run around with <strong>pets</strong>. It’s a common enough feature for MMORPGs, and even Fallout 76’s ‘sister MMO’, The Elder Scrolls Online, has a pet system – but they’re ‘non-combat’ pets.</p>



<p>Recently, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/it-looks-like-fallout-76-is-finally-getting-one-of-its-most-requested-features" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Windows Central reported</a> on a datamining claim from a user named SugarBombsRADS. In a Discord server dedicated to uncovering unreleased content in Fallout 76’s files, this user found an image related to pets. It was one of the iconic ‘tutorial’ style images from Fallout 76, the three-image banner that explains how <strong>something </strong>works in the game. </p>



<p>Here’s the shot:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>While ‘Allies’ have existed in Fallout 76 for quite some time, they’re unable to leave a player’s C.A.M.P., which often leaves Vault Dwellers feeling lonesome in the harsh and unwelcoming wasteland. The introduction of companions that can roam alongside users will be a game-changer, and the images suggest that it could go beyond just cats and dogs, with Vault Boy cuddling up to a Deathclaw.</p>



<p>It also seems that there will be interactions that the player can perform with their pet, treating them like Dogmeat in Fallout 4, for example. Can you imagine if you could assume control of a Scorchbeast or something and walk around with it by your side?</p>



<p>As with anything datamined, this content is unconfirmed and may never see the light of day, but it’s nice to know that after all this time, it’s potentially on the horizon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Create Your Own Witcher 3 Character With a New Mod]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/witcher-3-character-creator-mod/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/create-your-own-witcher-3-character-with-a-new-mod.921822/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/witcher-3-character-creator-mod/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It was around two months ago that CDPR opened up the REDkit for modders focused on The Witcher 3. This invaluable resource serves as a free add-on to The Wild Hunt, giving modders unprecedented control over the game, and we’ve already seen some stunning creations emerge. Now, a new mod has surfaced called Custom Player Characters, and as the title suggests, it allows players to create their custom character with which they’ll enjoy 2015’s The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-change-everything">Change Everything</h2>



<p>I don’t know why you’d want to, but if you’ve ever imagined stripping Geralt of Rivia from his role in The Witcher 3 and playing as a fresh character, this is the mod for you. The Custom Player Characters mod, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/5940" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">published by nikich340 on Nexus Mods</a> recently, allows users to build their player character from the ground up.</p>



<p>It’s pretty boundless – you can be a sorceress, a different Witcher, or something else entirely. With the character creation elements unlocked by the REDkit-backed mod, you can assume a completely different identity, and when combined with other mods (voice-based ones), you can even change how Geralt sounds, adopting a female voice if you’d like.</p>



<p>The Custom Player Characters mod even utilises new, ‘retargeted’ animations that make female bodies move more accurately. Also, if you choose to be a Sorceress, you’ll pick up a fresh magic-based combat system, assuming control of a set of spells that improve the more you use them.</p>



<p>It’s one of the most ambitious mods I’ve ever seen for The Witcher 3 – who will you play as?</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rogue-company/" data-ref-id="5000-501899">Rogue Company</a>, a free-to-play hero shooter from Smite and Paladins publisher Hi-Rez Studios, is removing its $20 Dr Disrespect skin from sale and refunding players who may have purchased it in the wake of allegations regarding the streamer having sent "inappropriate" messages to a minor in 2017.</p><p dir="ltr">In a statement posted by the official <a href="https://x.com/RogueCompany/status/1810028535882342577" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rogue Company X account</a>, players were informed the skin had been disabled and refunds (in the form of Rogue Bucks) would be rolling out later this week for those who may have purchased the Dr Disrespect content.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhObRmTB8Zw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HhObRmTB8Zw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Dr Disrespect was heavily involved in the promotion of Rogue Company, and even collaborated on a map for the game in 2020 called The Arena alongside the debut of the game's official Dr Disrespect skin. It's currently unclear if the Dr Disrepect map, which heavily features his likeness, will also be removed, but it seems likely.</p><p dir="ltr">The streamer, whose real name is Guy Beahm, was banned from Twitch in 2020. His exclusive streaming contract with the streaming platform was also terminated, prompting Beahm to sue Twitch and later receive a settlement from the Amazon-owned company. At the time, the reasons for his ban were unknown, and Beahm himself claimed he was unaware of why he was banned from the platform.</p><p dir="ltr">However, following a number of recent reports from former Twitch employees who alleged Beahm had been involved in sending messages to a minor and attempting to meet up with them at TwitchCon, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dr-disrespect-addresses-misconduct-allegations-after-turtle-beach-ends-partnership/1100-6524501/" data-ref-id="1100-6524501">Beahm himself admitted to some of allegations</a>. He confirmed he did send what he called "inappropriate messages" to a minor, but said he never did anything "illegal" and did not meet the minor in question.</p><p dir="ltr">Since the allegations surfaced, a number of partners and brands have parted ways with Dr Disrespect, including Turtle Beach and the game studio he co-founded, The Midnight Society, which is working on an extraction shooter called Deadrop that was heavily promoted by the streamer. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dr-disrespects-twitch-ban-was-reportedly-due-to-messaging-a-minor/1100-6524455/" data-ref-id="1100-6524455">The Midnight Society in a statement said it was terminating its relationship with Dr Disrespect</a> immediately after investigating the allegations, and that "while these facts are difficult to hear and even more difficult to accept, it is our duty to act with dignity on behalf of all individuals involved, especially the 55 developers and families we have employed alongside our community of players."</p>

The app, which Microsoft first <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/27/24187164/xbox-cloud-gaming-tv-app-fire-tv-stick-amazon-launch">announced last month</a>, provides access to Xbox Cloud Gaming, allowing subscribers of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to stream a variety of Xbox titles to some Fire TV devices.</p><p>The Xbox app will initially be available only on the Fire TV 4K Max (2023) and Fire TV Stick 4K (2023) and will be identical to the same app available on Samsung’s recent TVs and monitors. All you’ll need is a compatible Fire TV Stick, a Bluetooth-enabled wireless controller, and an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription to stream Xbox games.</p><p>Microsoft is working to allow Xbox Cloud Gaming to stream your entire Xbox library, and not just titles that are part of Game Pass.
