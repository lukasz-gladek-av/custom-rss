		<p>Nintendo has confirmed the next <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-direct">Nintendo Direct</a> will take place tomorrow, Tuesday 18th June, at 3PM BST (UK time).</p>
<p>You can watch it here:</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Direct 6.18.2024 – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kX3BkD5PVUM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The stream will run for around 40 minutes and will mainly focus on Nintendo Switch games coming in the second half of 2024. Sadly for all of us impatient gamers, they also state that “There will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during this presentation.” – this follows up on Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa taking to <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1787736518762881197?t=nK-fpqaQ1GKNCALLmTvVrA&amp;s=19">Twitter</a> to say the same thing just last month, even though <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-is-coming-this-fiscal-year-but-not-at-nintendo-direct-in-june/">a Switch 2 reveal will take place this fiscal year.</a></p>
<p>So what will be featured at Nintendo Direct?</p>

<p>There’s likely to be some last second check ins for soon-to-be released games like Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition (coming 18th July), and it’d be neat to see more of World of Goo 2 ahead of August, or the adorable The Plucky Squire.</p>
<p>Given how late in the Nintendo Switch life cycle we are, and recent trends, there’s also hope for some surprise and/or rumoured remasters as well. The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker and Twilight Princess would be very welcome remasters for Switch, and since we’ve had Metroid Prime Remastered, Nintendo could continue to pad out the time before Metroid Prime 4 with remasters of the rest of the trilogy.</p>
<p>But really, we’re at the point where we don’t really know what Nintendo can announce. They’re surely trying to keep their powder dry on Switch 2 launch games, so it’s best to temper expectations, but there could be some nice surprises, regardless.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24180103/still-wakes-the-deep-review-xbox-ps5-pc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The sea is basically the blue skin of the world, yet we know so little of its depths. Much like the vastness of space, it is filled with mystery. With both comes the unknown — and, therefore, horror. In <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em>, the latest first-person horror from The Chinese Room, the sea births a mysterious terror that takes over an oil rig, and its workers must fight to survive.</p><p>Somewhere in the middle of the ocean, players are introduced to protagonist McLearly, a Scottish oil rig’s troublesome electrician. From the beginning, I was incredibly impressed by the voice acting, writing, and performance. Most of the crew are Glaswegians, who use colloquial terms and slang, which the game warns can be “translated” by turning on subtitles. McLearly (Alec Newman, who plays <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s Adam Smasher and <em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em>’s Beast, among others) is a very likable protagonist. When we first meet him, he’s fired for causing an onshore brawl that’d led police to the rig, much to his boss’s dismay. As he’s leaving via chopper, the rig strikes something — or something strikes the rig — far below the surface.</p><p>From there, everything turns to chaos, as bioluminescent tentacles and large leaves that look like seaweed begin covering the entire rig. But when it interacts with humans, it subsumes them, turning into horrific monsters out of John Carpenter’s <em>The Thing</em>.</p><p>McLearly must use his skills as an electrician to navigate his way out of the nautical nightmare. Environmental puzzles — involving turning levers and wheels, putting out fires, and pushing and pulling in the right sequence — make up the majority of your time, all the while the rig is groaning and coming apart and the screams of turned friends and colleagues echo through the metallic hallways.</p><p>The game is, at times, wonderfully terrifying, and I was impressed by the creature designs. Friends who you meet early in the game now scream and belt out threats and concerns they had while fully human, their flesh permanently tethered to the growing alien menace that has taken over the rig. (It’s never explained what the menace or monster or virus is, only that it comes from the sea.) When you’re stuck in these hallways with the monsters, McLearly can only hide, throw objects, and sneak past. There’s no combat and insta-death, which can prove somewhat frustrating. You’re never certain when or where a monster will hear you, and the game seems to have a very strict, internally consistent idea of how to succeed in cat-and-mouse levels.</p><p>The game is incredibly tactile. Intuitive button mapping meant I always felt embodied in McLearly, from pulling levers to climbing to sliding down ladders. The developers have done an excellent job putting you in McLearly’s shoes, allowing you to see his entire body as he climbs and crawls. McLearly unscrews vents, grabs to pull himself through dark water, slips and slides, cries out, and swears when trying to take leaps. Aside from feeling like I embodied him, McLearly’s reactions to what he was doing also seemed like he was embodying <em>me</em>: taking a huge leap meant I sometimes swore and, hilariously, found McLearly shouting the same when he landed.</p><p>As with previous Chinese Room titles, the original orchestral score is bold and loud when you eventually hear it. But unlike <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/10/9123999/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review-ps4"><em>Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture</em></a>, where Jessica Curry’s score did so much to tell that story, here, it’s muted, with few waves of music rushing in. Much of the ambience comes from the rig collapsing, the sound of destruction serving as the music of annihilation rather than a powerful choir. Jason Graves (composer for Supermassive’s horror titles and <em>The Order: 1886</em>) does a good job here, even if it does not live up to Curry’s work.&nbsp;</p><p>The oil rig itself is impressively detailed, with its lifelike textures and appropriate signage, old switch-operated phones, and realistic monitors. While you can’t interact with much of the world, it still feels lived in, a place people had occupied and made their own — especially when visiting individual crew’s quarters.</p><p>The level of detail, combined with excellent sound direction, really made me feel like I was in the rig. You will be forced to double back to areas, and your familiarity will assist in navigating a level: doors and passageways you walked through untouched are now blocked by debris, or your friend has turned into a giant, tentacled monster. I appreciated the developers’ strict focus on one specific location, with limited areas, allowing them to demonstrate slow destruction in a way that was tangible.</p><p>Though it doesn’t push the genre anywhere new, <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> is a worthy addition to the horror canon — and further proof that the great void of the ocean is something I want to avoid.</p><p><small>Still Wakes the Deep <em>launches June 18th on PS5, Xbox Series X / S, and PC.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A Quiet Place is a very solid horror movie that seemed primed for a video game adaptation from the off. After all, it already had all the ingredients of a video game right there: the whole film is essentially one overlong stealth mission with a punishing fail state - any crunchy glass or other noise would immediately draw the attention of deadly alien monsters - and at one point there’s a whiteboard with the narrative equivalent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a>’s “CUT OFF THEIR LIMBS” graffiti scrawled on it. Lo and behold, we’re getting a Quiet Place video game.</p>

<p>A Quiet Place video game was actually announced back in 2021, though you might’ve missed its blink-and-miss-it reveal consisting of little more than a “yes, we’re making it” statement from developers iLLOGIKA and publishers Saber Interactive, who previously turned fellow horror movie World War Z into a surprisingly fun multiplayer game. At the time, the Quiet Place game was planned for release in 2022, before, erm, going silent for a few years.</p>
<p>Now it’s resurfaced with a proper name, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, a first look at gameplay and even a release date - soon! Replacing OG devs iLLOGIKA are new developers Stormind Games, known for the Remothered series of survival-horror games and hack-and-slash action-RPG Batora: Lost Haven.</p>
<p>The Road Ahead will be an original story set in the universe rather than retreading the plot of John Krasinski’s A Quiet Place, its sequel A Quiet Place Part II or this year’s prequel A Quiet Place: Day One, which is out next week. The story will follow a young survivor trying to creep their way through the apocalyptic world.</p>

<p>The reveal trailer shows off some first-person gameplay, involving the expected level of needing to keep quiet while having various objects - doors, drawers, switches, lights, that blasted floor glass - all make upsetting amounts of ruckus. You’ll have a flashlight to hand, along with something that looks like an improvised decibel measurer.</p>
<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead will be out later this year, though we don’t have an exact release date just yet. Find it (quietly) <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2233120/A_Quiet_Place_The_Road_Ahead/">on Steam</a> when it eventually sneaks out.</p>

That might explain why some of the models in this “new” video game look like they fell out of an Xbox 360 action game. After all, this basically <em>is </em>an Xbox 360-era video game, but with seemingly some enhanced lighting and (hopefully) solid performance. </p><p>Will <em>Captain Blood</em> be good? No idea! Technically, many people have already played a version of this game as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://github.com/storm-devs/captain-blood&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://github.com/storm-devs/captain-blood" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a finished build leaked online in 2022</a></span>. From what I’ve seen of that leaked copy, I’m not expecting some groundbreaking game.</p><p> However, I’ll admit that I’m interested in playing through a linear single-player action game from the Xbox 360 era of gaming. These days, most games like this are big open-world things with crafting and live-service stuff. There’s something oddly charming about the chunky models and simplicity of <em>Captain Blood</em> that appeals to me. This is the kind of game I’d rent over the weekend as a teen and beat by Sunday afternoon. And I miss those games. So I’ll be playing<em> Captain Blood</em> when it arrives later this year. Assuming it actually does launch this time. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>When mod support finally comes to Baldur’s Gate 3 in the future, it’s likely to be the last major update for the game from developer Larian Studios. The studio is going to then shift focus to other non-Baldur’s Gate projects.</p>



<p>“One of the big things for us, and the one that we’re really working towards now, is the ability for players to mod [Baldur’s Gate 3] themselves, because then they will be able to make their own things,” Larian CEO Swen Vincke said during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mod-support-in-baldurs-gate-3-will-be-final-handover-moment-to-players-says-larian-ceo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BAFTA’s An Evening with Baldur’s Gate 3</a> on Friday night. “And I think that will be the point where we’re going to say ‘ok, now it’s yours fully’.”</p>



<p>Development on mod support for the game is still ongoing, and there’s no firm date for its release aside from September. When it comes, though, Vincke says that the team is excited to move on to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/larian-studios-is-working-on-two-new-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">work on its new games</a>.</p>



<p>“We’re working on our new thing, we’re super excited about the new games,” he said. “We’re creative spirits also, we don’t want to keep on doing the same thing, we really want to move forward and do new things.”</p>



<p>Despite major development and updates coming to an end sooner rather than later for Baldur’s Gate 3, support for the game won’t be ending entirely. Vincke said that the team will see support continue but limited to critical bug fixes and the like. Up to now, he said, development has continued as though the game was just launched. </p>



<p>Mod support will be a part of Patch 7 for the game. In addition to mods, Patch 7 will include bug fixes, a photo mode, improved evil endings, and more.</p>

If you like games such as Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem, you're in for a real treat. I myself have put over 100 hours into the game and it is easily one of my favorite RTS games of all time. My only gripe is that I wish it was also released on the PC. Officially, IGN rated Unicorn Overload an "Amazing" 9/10 and you can read up on our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unicorn-overlord-review">Unicorn Overload review</a> to see why this is considered to be one of the best console strategy games in recent history. Here's reviewer Eric Zalewski's final verdict:</p><p>"Reflecting on the incredibly diverse and remarkably creative world I explored across my 45-hour journey, any issues I had with Unicorn Overlord ended up feeling like nothing more than nitpicks. The tactical combat system is unique and complex while also being easy to understand, expertly blending mechanics from many of its peers with smart new additions of its own. The interesting terrain across the continent of Fevrith makes every fight feel unique, with some of the best map gimmicks I’ve seen in any strategy RPG. Because the campaign is told through the eyes of a diverse and creative cast, its trope-filled fantasy story is elevated in a way that a more traditional storytelling style wouldn't manage. The shorter, more personal stories work wonderfully to support a loop of exploration and liberation that had me begging to see one more tale told, one more town rebuilt, and one more battle fought."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Check out more of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals">best Nintendo Switch video game deals today</a>.</p></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jun 17, 2024 4:10 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>At this point in <em>Star Citizen</em>'s drawn-out, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/10/wing-commanders-chris-roberts-returns-to-gaming-with-ambitious-mmo/">11-plus-year development cycle</a>, we're usually reminded of the game <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/a-complete-star-citizens-ship-collection-now-costs-48000/">when it hits some crowdfunding microtransaction milestone</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/star-citizen-devs-scale-back-roadmap-to-avoid-timeline-distractions/">updates</a> its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/star-citizen-dev-offers-roadmap-for-development-of-new-development-roadmap/">increasingly convoluted alpha development roadmap</a>. So last week's announcement that developer Cloud Imperium Games (CIG) has <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/an-update-on-auec-exploits-and-account-suspensions/6978548">banned over 600 cheaters from its servers</a> is a notable reminder that some people are actually enjoying—and exploiting—the unpolished alpha version of the game.
</p><p>Shortly after the May release of <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/190048/thread/star-citizen-alpha-3-23-1-9179031-live-patch-notes">Star Citizen's Alpha 2.23.1 update</a>, players <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/funding-goals">started noticing</a> that they could easily make extra money by storing a freight ship, selling their cargo, and then returning to the ship to find the cargo ready to be sold a second time. As knowledge of this "money doubling" exploit spread, <a href="https://gamersofflimits.com/star-citizen-3-23-1-cargo-duplicating/">players reported</a> that <a href="https://gamersofflimits.com/star-citizen-3-23-1-cargo-duplicating/">the price of basic in-game resources</a> saw significant inflation in a matter of days.</p>
<p>Now, Cloud Imperium Games Senior Director of Player Relations Will Leverett has <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/an-update-on-auec-exploits-and-account-suspensions/6978548">written</a> that the developer has investigated "multiple exploits within <em>Star Citizen</em> that compromised stability and negatively impacted the in-game economy." In doing so, CIG says it "identified and suspended over 600 accounts involved in exploitative behaviors while also removing the illicitly gained aUEC [in-game currency] from the <em>Star Citizen</em> ecosystem."</p>
<p>A ban for "over 600" players may not seem that notable when games like <em>Dota 2</em> and <em>World of Warcraft</em> routinely announce <a href="https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2006/06/7033-2/">ban waves</a> that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/valve-used-secret-memory-access-honeypot-to-detect-40k-dota-2-cheaters/">include tens of thousands of players</a>. Still, it's a reminder that at least a small portion of <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/funding-goals">the game's more than 5.2 million backers</a> are actively playing the alpha so much that they're willing to cheat to see more of what the game has to offer.
</p><p>"From zero, in two evenings, I did make about [200 million aUEC] just to buy ships that [are] unavailable for me, to try it in full!" user ZeroInsideOut <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/an-update-on-auec-exploits-and-account-suspensions/6987894">wrote on the game's forums</a>. "There [are] many things in <em>Star Citizen</em> [which] I would like to try and test, but I am short of money."</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>It’s getting late for “early access” bugs</h2>
<p>Leverett wrote that exploits like these should be expected in <em>Star Citizen</em> "at this stage of development"—a stage that we hasten to once again point out is now <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/07/star-citizen-creator-calls-bullshit-on-feature-creep-and-over-ambition/">part of well over a decade of active development</a>. Finding and squashing these kinds of bugs "early" is all part of the game's crowdfunded development plan and "one of the benefits of open development and working closely with our community," Leverett wrote.</p>
<p>"We've gained valuable insights through your issue council reports, and we thank you for that," he continued. "However, once an exploit is identified and confirmed, continued abuse for personal gain will not be tolerated and will result in action on our part."</p>
<p>However, some players feel that the "open development" process failed to find this significant issue quickly enough. Commenter Nitebird <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/spectrum/community/SC/forum/1/thread/an-update-on-auec-exploits-and-account-suspensions/6978730">took CIG to task</a> for "allow[ing] exploits reported during [<a href="https://support.robertsspaceindustries.com/hc/en-us/articles/115013195927-Public-Test-Universe-PTU-FAQ">Public Test Universe</a>] to go to live despite many people confirming the issue in [the <a href="https://issue-council.robertsspaceindustries.com/">Issue Council</a>] and urging CIG to pause to fix it. The patch is ruined regardless for many people... What is IC good for than to prevent this?"</p>

<p>CIG <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/star-citizen-faces-major-server-outage-still-isnt-close-to-launch/">launched an important "Persistent Universe" update</a> for <em>Star Citizen</em> over a year ago and announced late last year that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/star-citizens-squadron-42-campaign-is-feature-complete-after-11-years/">spin-off <em>Squadron 42</em> had reached "feature complete" status</a>. Despite those signs of progress, though, there's still no target date for <em>Star Citizen</em> to finally transition from its extended alpha to that fabled "Version 1.0" release.
</p><p>CIG founder and CEO Chris Roberts <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/19848-Letter-From-The-Chairman">said in a March update</a> that the development team "is hard at work, heads down, driving toward the finish line" and that the leadership team has now "spent significant time looking at what <em>Star Citizen</em> 1.0 means and what it would take to get there." That includes the planned introduction of long-sought key features like base building and crafting that were apparently not a priority during the game's first 11-plus years of development work.</p>
<p>"As that roadmap [for a 1.0 release] comes together and becomes validated, we look forward to sharing with you both its vision and executional plan later this year," Roberts wrote.</p>

Not only does this allow players to use a mouse and keyboard in controller-only matchmaking, but it gives an additional advantage since any aim assist in the game will also work on mouse and keyboard, since the game thinks it's a controller. Naturally this leads to many players using the device in controller-only lobbies on console to give themselves an advantage, with cheaters running rampant in many competitive shooters on console.</p><p>The head of anti-cheat at Riot Games <a href="https://twitter.com/deteccphilippe/status/1801790659017457839">Phillip Koskinas</a> shared the video on X writing, "a satisfied first customer."

<p data-characters="449" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">More often than not, exotic items in<em> Destiny 2</em> have curated rolls that are the same for everyone. Exotic armor may have certain stats that you can roll for like high Discipline or high Intellect, but perks tend to remain the same (<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-the-hawkmoon-exotic-hand-cannon-destiny-2/">barring Hawkmoon</a>). The first ever exotic class item in the game changes that, offering two different perk rolls using perks from various exotic armors.

<p data-characters="281" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Bethesda Softworks has got some pretty big plans for <em>Starfield</em>‘s post-launch content, and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/starfield-shattered-space-release-window-new-content-drop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the upcoming <em>Shattered Space</em> expansion pack</a>, which is due to launch this Fall, is just the start of it. In fact, the term “annual expansions” is already being thrown around.</p> <p data-characters="544" data-current-count="544" data-injectable="true">This information comes from a new interview held by YouTuber MrMattyPlays, who had the opportunity to spend a full hour talking about all things Bethesda Softworks with none other than Todd Howard himself. The duo discussed a whole slew of topics ranging from the future of <em>Fallout</em> all the way to the company’s immediate plans for <em>Starfield</em>. The plan, according to Howard, is to continue supporting <em>Starfield</em> for as long as possible, and a tentative second year of content is already confirmed with a premium DLC headlining its offerings.</p>

 <p data-characters="464" data-current-count="464" data-injectable="true">MrMattyPlays was, of course, quick to ask about Bethesda’s plans for potential yearly expansions, and Howard was happy to explain what was up with that: “We’re planning for the one after [<em>Shattered Space</em>],” he said. A second major DLC is, then, good as confirmed for <em>Starfield</em>. Sadly, Howard wasn’t keen on revealing much of anything about the DLC, aside from the fact that it’s going to happen, but it’s good news indeed.</p>
 <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-starfield/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Starfield</em> may not be entirely perfect</a>, all things considered, but it sure has been racking up some solid wins as of late. Not only has it received a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/starfield-all-may-update-difficulty-tweaks-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fairly chunky gameplay update</a> just last month, but Bethesda also managed to push out the long awaited <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/starfield-creation-kit-is-finally/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Starfield</em> Creation Kit</a>, essentially opening the modding floodgates for the game once and for all.</p> <p data-characters="529" data-current-count="877" data-injectable="true">Curiously, Howard was also careful to reference Bethesda’s earlier announcement about <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bethesda-aims-to-update-starfield-roughly-every-six-weeks-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the <em>Starfield</em> update cadence</a>, wherein Bethesda promised that there’d be <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bethesda-aims-to-update-starfield-roughly-every-six-weeks-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roughly six weeks between each major patch in 2024</a>. This, as Howard puts it, isn’t necessarily “helpful” in that there may be shorter and longer gaps between updates as Bethesda Softworks continues working on it. It’s not a huge deal, all things considered, but it ought to help set the correct expectations for the foreseeable future.</p>
 <p data-characters="537" data-current-count="537" data-injectable="false">So, good things ahead, that’s for sure. While we’re still some ways away from the release of the big <em>Shattered Space</em> DLC – which Todd Howard specifically compared to <em>Fallout 4</em>‘s beloved <em>Far Harbor</em> DLC – <em>Starfield</em>‘s modding scene is now burgeoning anew both via <a href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/all?platforms=XB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the in-game Creations menu</a> and through <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the usual Nexus website</a>. New armor sets, weapons, gameplay mechanics, rebalancing attempts, and even points-of-interest are already available and come highly recommended, so be sure to check those out.</p>

            <p>Remember Lords of the Fallen? No, not <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lords-of-the-fallen">that one</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-lords-of-the-fallen">This one</a>. Last year’s reboot of the 2014 game of <em>exactly </em>the same name - despite the successor originally being a numbered sequel, then at least having a ‘The’ at the start of its title to help tell them apart a little - will now get its own follow-up in a third Lords of the Fallen game. The upcoming sequel doesn’t have a name yet, but I really hope they stick with the bit and just call it “Lords of the Fallen” again.</p>

<p>Lords of the Fallen, Lords of the Fallen 3, The The Lords of the Fallen, Lords of the Fall3n or whatever they decide to call it, before undoubtedly rechristening it later on for maximum confusion, was revealed by a bit of paperwork filed by publishers CI Games and spotted by Polish financial outlet <a href="https://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/CI-GAMES-S-E-Podpisanie-Binding-Term-Sheet-z-Epic-Games-Inc-8765997.html">Bankier</a>.</p>
<p>The paperwork filed on June 14th pertains to a partnership between CI Games and Epic to give the latter lifetime exclusive distribution rights to the game - currently referred to internally as Project 3. That means you can expect it to be exclusive to the Epic Games Store, though it’ll also release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>The document also notes that CI Games expects to release Lords of tres Fallen sometime in 2026.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lords-of-the-fallen-review">our review</a>, Ed found Lords of the Fallen (2023) to be a serviceable <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">Soulslike</a> waylaid by a litany of irritating issues - from an awkward camera to performance wobbles - that took away from its highlights, notably its dimension-hopping lantern mechanic.</p>
<p>Lords of the Fallen devs Hexworks laid off several of their team at the start of the year <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-layoffs-as-behaviour-interactive-and-ci-games-adjust-scope-and-make-optimisations">as part of redundancies across CI Games</a>. Regardless, the studio have continued to support the game, capping off their patches <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lords-of-the-fallens-steam-reviews-improve-as-performance-patch-lands-devs-advise-players-not-to-use-graphics-settings-their-rigs-cannot-handle">targeting performance improvements</a> and balancing with a final update that added a randomised New Game+ mode and Ironman modifier in April <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lords-of-the-fallens-latest-update-adds-cruel-modifiers-that-turn-it-into-a-roguelike">that together effectively turn the game into a roguelike</a>.</p>

<p>Netflix’s efforts to grow its gaming front seem to be succeeding, at least in one area. According to new data compiled by <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/rockstars-gta-trilogy-hits-30m-downloads-on-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">mobilegamer.biz</a>, the GTA Trilogy has been downloaded over 30 million times on Netflix Games.</p>



<p>The data, which comes from Appmagic, shows that GTA San Andreas has been installed 20.5 million times by players. GTA Vice City sits at 6.5 million installs while GTA 3 has 3.3 million. </p>



<p>As far as the devices being played on, iOS has seen 15.8 million installs of San Andreas compared to 4.7 million on Android. For Vice City, that breakdown is 4.9 million on iOS and 1.6 on Android while GTA 3 had 2.4 million players on iOS and just 929,000 on Android. Lastly, most of the players come from the United States with each game having more than 23% of a U.S. player base.</p>



<p>Netflix continues to invest in its gaming department. As of December 2023, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-has-90-games-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 90 games were in development</a> for the platform.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/msi-raider-ge78-hx-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>As the PC gaming market continues to grow, more and more players are looking for reasons to game on the go. To do that properly, however, you likely want a powerful laptop to make sure you can do what you want, when you want, and how you want. The MSI Raider GE78 HX laptop is one of MSI’s premium gaming laptops that packs the punch you want for high-end performance.</p>



<p>Retailing at $3,000, it’s a pricey computer but comes loaded with everything you’d need to make sure it’s something that will satisfy you for years before needing to upgrade. The MSI Raider GE78 HX laptop I reviewed comes with an Intel Core i9-14900HX processor, an Nvidia RTX 4090 GPU, 32GB of DDR5-5600 memory, and a 2TB NVMe SSD.</p>



<p>I’ve used the laptop as my daily driver for the better part of three months to get a feel for how it works under regular and heavy use. So is the MSI Raider GE78 HX laptop one worth picking up, even today, to be your PC solution?</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Specification</strong></th><th><strong>Details</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>CPU</td><td>Intel Core i9-14900HX</td></tr><tr><td>Graphics</td><td>Nvidia RTX 4090</td></tr><tr><td>Display</td><td>17-inch at 2560×1600, 240hz IPS</td></tr><tr><td>RAM</td><td>32GB DDR5-5600</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>2TB NVMe SSD</td></tr><tr><td>Ports</td><td>Thunderbolt 4, 2x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C<br>2x USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A, HDMI 2.1, Ethernet, <br>SD card slot, and 3.5 mm audio jack</td></tr><tr><td>Battery</td><td>99.9 WHr</td></tr><tr><td>Network</td><td>Wired: Killer E3100G (2.5Gbps)<br>Wireless: Killer WiFi 7 BE1750, Bluetooth 5.4</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>14.97 x 11.73 x 1.13 inches at 6.61 lbs</td></tr><tr><td>Price</td><td>$2,999.99</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-msi-raider-ge78-hx-review">MSI Raider GE78 HX Review</h2>



<h3 id="h-day-to-day-usage"><strong>Day-to-Day Usage</strong></h3>



<p>While everyone loves synthetic benchmark numbers, they aren’t usually indicative of how people will actually use their machine. So, to test this laptop, the focus was on playing games, capturing content, and editing videos.  What is it like if the MSI Raider GE78 HX was going to be your primary computer?</p>



<p>Let’s start with games. The games played for the purpose of testing the laptop were  Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition, XDefiant, Cyberpunk 2077, and Doom Eternal.</p>



<p>Whatever you want to play, this laptop can handle it. Doom Eternal regularly hit 250-300 frames per second (FPS). CyberPunk 2077, a more resource-intensive game, peaked around 85 FPS while stayed at 61-66 FPS on average. Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition, during the most intense in-game action with military on scree, averaged around 115 FPS. Lastly, XDefiant — the newest game on this list — was averaging over 300 FPS. All in all, it’s a great experience when gaming.</p>



<p>Video rendering was fast with five-minute, 1440p videos rendering in less than two minutes. That same video in 4K was done in less than four. Obviously the more transitions, cuts, and edits you have, the longer it might take. But for the average content creator, you will have no issues working on this.</p>



<p>Should you just want to watch movies and videos, the 17-inch 2560×1600 240hz screen is pretty good. The blacks could be better on high brightness, but you shouldn’t find too much to be upset about with the IPS display.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-some-concerns">Some Concerns</h3>



<p>It’s not all roses with the MSI Raider GE78 HX, though. One problem I do have is just how loud the fans get when using it. No matter what you do, the fans will, at times, sound like they are getting ready to send the machine to the sky. Still, even with the high fan usage and volume, I noticed that it did get quite warm to the touch. It’s not a machine you’ll want to sit on your lap without a cooling pad or lap desk underneath it. It also can become a tad bit uncomfortable to the touch, especially at the top end of the keyboard, when using it for extended periods. If gaming, I highly recommend a controller or using an external mouse and keyboard if the games being played are intensive.</p>



<p>Another concern is battery life. It’s too inconsistent to know just how good the life is. Sometimes, it would last over five hours. Other times, I was lucky to get over two hours on a full charge. If you want to just spend your time in a game without being plugged in, expect your time to be closer to the two hour-mark, if not less. Playing games like XDefiant or even Diablo 4 at the highest settings say the battery last just over an hour before needing to be plugged in. So while you can definitely game on the go with this machine, it’s still best to keep your power brick handy and ready just in case. </p>

<h3><strong>Verdict</strong></h3>



<p>Overall, there’s no doubt that the MSI Raider GE78 HX is a powerful computer. It does pretty much everything you’d want from a machine like this. However, when people are looking at gaming laptops, portability might be at the top of their list. The MSI Raider GE78 HX, despite it’s great performance when gaming, creating, or really anything, is a bulky machine that doesn’t really scream “on-the-go gaming”.</p>



<p>That said, if you either travel a lot where you can’t drag a desktop PC with you or you have limited real estate at home where a laptop fits perfectly, then this laptop makes sense even at it’s high price point. It really is going to come down to your specific use case. There’s also a chance you can get one at a lower price point as it’s been on the market for a little while now.</p>

It's a game that will melt away time as you hit play on one run after the next, with each defeat never stinging long enough to dissuade the possibility of victory on the next."</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/target-book-sale-june-2024-buy-one-get-one-50-percent-off/1100-6524101/">Buy 1, Get 1 50% Off Book Box Sets At Target - Manga, Novels, Comic Omnibuses, And More</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/astro-bot-ps5-preorder-guide/1100-6523846/">Astro Bot Preorders Are Live - The PS5 Exclusive Comes With An Adorable Bonus</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-game-sale-features-rarely-discounted-exclusives-ahead-of-summer-game-fest/1100-6524025/">Nintendo Switch Game Sale Features Rarely Discounted Exclusives Ahead Of Summer Game Fest</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (4)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-preorders-come-with-bonus-playable-fighters/1100-6520091/">Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero Preorders Come With Bonus Playable Fighters</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-preorder-guide/1100-6524060/">Sonic X Shadow Generations Preorders Are Live, Includes Doctor Robotnik's Journal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-hit-anime-hells-paradise-is-coming-to-blu-ray-with-an-amazon-exclusive-limited-edition/1100-6523982/">The Hit Anime Hell's Paradise Is Coming To Blu-Ray With An Amazon-Exclusive Limited Edition</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mad-max-5-film-limited-edition-4k-collection-and-furiosa-steelbook-up-for-preorder/1100-6523703/">Mad Max 5-Film Limited Edition 4K Collection And Furiosa Steelbook Up For Preorder</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-season-11-launches-on-thursday-june-20/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Blizzard announced the launch date of Overwatch 2 Season 11: Super Mega Ultrawatch, two months after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-season-10-venture-clash-mode-alignment-swap-event/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch of Season 10</a>. The new season will be available starting this Thursday, June 20, adding a new Mythic cosmetic type, a Push map, the return of Pink Mercy (with the proceed of her cosmetic items going fully to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation), new Hero Mastery Missions, and more.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Runapasi Push Map:</strong> Hike your way to this hidden city in the Peruvian Andes in Overwatch 2's latest push map. This map features narrow streets and nods to the local culture, including the Inti Warrior Historical Museum and Monument. Play it in Quick Play and Competitive upon the launch of Season 11.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Hero Mastery:</strong> Sharpen your kunai and master your aim when the Hero Mastery single-player courses for both Kiriko and Soldier: 76 launch this season. Take on new challenges and earn new rewards and up to 22,500 Battle Pass XP during a limited-time event from June 20 through July 9.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Pink Mercy for a Cause:</strong> Celebrating the power of Overwatch 2's 100 million-player community, Pink Mercy returns to the store on June 25 with a new Rose Gold Mercy bundle. 100% of the proceeds from these items will benefit the Breast Cancer Research Foundation.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Mythic Weapon Skins:</strong> Coming with the Mid-Season Update, players will unlock cool-looking Mythic Weapon Skins. Similar to Heroic Weapon Skins, these come with exclusive sound and visual effects. Redeem Mythic Prisms to earn and upgrade Mythic Weapons to slay in style, starting with the Mythic Bound Demon Reinhardt Weapon Skin, coming July 23.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The Premium Battle Pass for Overwatch 2 Season 11 will include:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Up to 80 Mythic Prisms</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">5 Legendary Skins (Genji, Reaper, and Sojourn already confirmed)</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Lifeguard Lucio Epic Skin</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">500 Credits</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Souvenirs, Weapon Charms, Victory Poses, Highlight Intros and Emotes</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation">Everything in the Free Battle Pass, including two additional Epic skins, 600 Overwatch Coins, an additional 1,500 Credits, and more.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As usual, with a new Overwatch 2 season, there are also several balance improvements to the heroes and the maps. Cassidy has swapped her Magnetic Grenade for a new and improved Flashbang that slows foes in their tracks. The glass on the Colosseo push map has been removed, along with other changes that will allow team fights to take place all over the streets of Rome.</p>

<p>Blizzard is also making weekly challenges more accessible. If you miss a week, you can catch up on the previous week’s challenges before working on the current ones. Weekly milestone rewards are easier to achieve than before, too. Completing three weekly challenges provides 20,000 XP. As each week passes, a new milestone reward becomes available.</p>

  <p id="5WXt9A"><strong>Season 11</strong> of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/overwatch-2-guide"><em>Overwatch 2</em></a> will be a comparatively smaller one for Blizzard’s free-to-play shooter. Players won’t get a new hero this season, but they will get a new map, new Hero Mastery courses, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24176406/overwatch-2-pink-mercy-skin-rerelease-blizzard-charity">the return of Pink Mercy</a>.</p>
<p id="7u5NJQ">Of course, there will also be a new battle pass. The theme for season 11 is Super Mega Ultrawatch, with kaiju and tokusatsu-inspired skins for heroes like Genji, Reaper, and Sojourn. Ashe is the recipient of season 11’s Mythic skin, turning her into a Rita Repulsa-like.</p>
<p id="tamR4W">Oh, and there’s a Transformers collaboration coming to <em>Overwatch 2</em>?! Seems like season 11 will have more than meets the eye...</p>
<hr id="HwufZJ">

<p id="lRh8UJ"><em>Overwatch 2</em> season 11 starts on <strong>Thursday, June 20</strong>.

<p id="wLws7c">The first new Push map in more than 20 months, Runasapi, will give players a new location to escort the robot across in season 11. Runasapi is set in the Peruvian Andes, and serves as support hero Ilari’s hometown. Here’s how Blizzard describes Runasapi, which will be available to play in Quick Play and Competitive this season:</p>
<blockquote><p id="Q3010q">Amble through marketplaces full of fresh produce and pay a visit to the Inti Warrior Historical Museum and Monument. This exciting Push map is vibrant and challenging as you escort TS-1 through tight streets. Watch out as some fights may take place precariously close to the steep cliffs overlooking the sunny farmlands below.</p></blockquote>
<p id="c6RHq7">Another Push map, Colosseo, is getting a slight rework, with changes to structures near spawns and the removal of glass barriers in the hallway at the center of the map.</p>
<h3 id="l4ArY7"><strong>Season 11 battle pass and Mythic skin(s)</strong></h3>

<p id="w4qBOJ">I hope you like Super Sentai styling, because season 11 is rife with bug-eyed heroes and Godzilla-adjacent skins for Genji, Reaper, Sojourn, Roadhog, Zenyatta, Wrecking Ball, and others. Mauga’s vacation look is also here as one of the skins included in the season 11 premium battle pass.</p>

<p id="hRcFcX">In season 11, Blizzard will introduce a new type of Mythic cosmetic: Mythic Weapon Skins. First out of the gate is the Mythic Bound Demon Reinhardt weapon skin, coming July 23, which spruces up Reinhardt’s rocket hammer with the fury of a demon. Like Mythic hero skins, the new type of weapon skin costs 50 Mythic Prisms, with additional levels of customization unlocked with 10 Mythic Prisms. Upgrades include a weapon flourish emote, elimination visual effects, and reactive effects.</p>
<h3 id="lI5rAu"><strong>Hero reworks and Mastery Courses</strong></h3>
<p id="CPOIi3">Blizzard is buffing heroes across all three roles, but Cassidy is getting the biggest change of all. His Magnetic Grenade is going bye-bye and his Flashbang is coming back. The new version of Flashbang will slow enemies, rather than outright lockstun them.</p>
<p id="csBBHu">Kiriko and Soldier: 76 will get new Hero Mastery single-player courses in season 11, and players can take part in a limited-time challenge event with them from June 20 to July 9. Doing so will earn new rewards and up to 22,500 Battle Pass XP.</p>
<h3 id="TOaRB2"><strong>Summer Games 2024 and Transformers</strong></h3>
<p id="n1Satv">Both Summer Games and a mysterious new Transformers-themed collab come to <em>Overwatch 2</em> on July 9.</p>
<p id="xOa4bh">Here’s a quick visual guide to <em>Overwatch 2</em> season 11’s upcoming content roadmap.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/as-starfield-steam-reviews-plunge-to-mostly-negative-todd-howard-responds-to-paid-mods-backlash<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"We are going to take a look at that."</h2></div><section><p>Bethesda Game Studios chief Todd Howard has responded to a backlash over <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a> paid mods, confirming the developer will look at its pricing model for Creations content.</p><p>On Steam, Starfield’s recent user reviews are now on ‘Mostly Negative’ after disgruntled players hit out at Bethesda for charging $7 for a single Starfield mission. The second mission of the recently released Trackers Alliance is only available as a Starfield Creation and costs $7, or 700 credits.</p><p>Creations are built via Starfield’s Creation Kit, and include free and paid-for mods. Creations include new missions, gear, skins, and weapons. Here’s the official blurb from Bethesda:</p><blockquote>Trackers Alliance establishes the first of several missions enabling you to live your best bounty-hunting life. The first mission, The Starjacker will have you in contact with a mysterious Tracker located in settlements throughout the Settled Systems. From there, let the hunts begin!</blockquote><blockquote>The second Trackers Alliance mission, The Vulture is available within the new Creations menu. And what bounty hunter is without their trusted methods to get the job done?</blockquote><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/17/trackers-alliance-1718635757766.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Trackers Alliance's second mission has sparked a backlash.</figcaption></figure></output><p>While this latest backlash revolves around The Vulture mission, Bethesda has faced criticism over paid mods before. Indeed it’s the studio’s continued effort to enable paid mods for its games that has rubbed some players up the wrong way.</p><p>“Really? Another push for curated paid mods no one asked for?” reads one negative Steam review. “There is a simple reason why many players and modders enjoy modding their games for decades: it is done as a hobby, for players by players, without corporate responsibilites and apart from donation opportunities, without asking for or expecting monetary compensation.</p><p>“You are not aiding modding in the slightest. You are trying to turn modding into a business opportunity, to be a parasite that profits from underpaid work you do not want to do yourselves.”</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube channel MrMattyPlays</u></a>, Todd Howard responded directly to the criticism, and confirmed plans to look again at Bethesda’s pricing for Creations content.</p><p>“We hear that feedback, too,” Howard said. “First of all I’ll say that stuff gets priced based on things that we've done before both in Creation Club and then Fallout 76, and we're always trying to be looking at what else is out there, really make sure we're giving value to everybody and where we're not, hey you know, we definitely will adjust.</p><p>“The one thing I want to say on The Trackers Alliance, that was really an attempt to something we did in Creation Club where we'd say, hey you get this special outfit and you get this special weapon, we wanted to put them together, and then thought, let's go the extra mile and wrap those around a quest.</p><p>“But now we definitely see the feedback right? And that's not what we want at all in terms of, oh no, this looks like a faction that we're chopping up and then selling for 700 credits at a time. And so I do think we are going to take a look at that and how we deliver content like that, and whether we're changing pricing or breaking it up or what we should do there. So, great feedback from the community.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Starfield: Shattered Space Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Howard insisted, however, that Bethesda’s policy on paid mods has the health of the modding community at heart.</p><p>“As it comes to, particularly the creators out there, look, our view is, a lot of them have gone from hobbyists to professionals. And it’s part of our job to make sure they can do that and they do get paid and they see the monetary rewards if they make awesome content,” Howard said.</p><p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-isnt-walking-away-from-starfield-its-planning-a-second-story-expansion-for-year-2">Howard has confirmed plans to release a second story expansion for Starfield</a> following this year’s Shattered Space, and commented on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-teaser-is-now-6-years-old-and-even-todd-howard-paused-to-say-oh-wow-that-has-been-a-while">the long development of The Elder Scrolls 6</a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-age-the-veilguard-doesnt-need-to-be-baldurs-gate-3-it-needs-to-be-golden-era-bioware.903492/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-doesnt-need-to-be-baldurs-gate-3-it-needs-to-be-golden-era-bioware<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>When BioWare announced that Dragon Age: Dreadwolf had been renamed Dragon Age: The Veilguard, general manager Gary McKay explained the decision was rooted in a wish to reflect the game’s “really deep and compelling group of companions.” It's a logical pivot considering the immense cultural effect Baldur’s Gate 3’s collection of misfit heroes triggered last year. BioWare no doubt hopes that at least one of the Veilguard will resonate at a scale akin to Asterion, Karlach, or Shadowheart. </p><p>A camp of companions is about as far as the similarities with Baldur’s Gate 3 goes though, if the <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/dragon-age-the-veilguard-official-gameplay-reveal-video">recently showcased 20 minutes</a> of gameplay is to go by. Dragon Age: The Veilguard appears to be a cinematic fantasy adventure with linear momentum, action combat, and huge set-piece moments. Little of what was shown could correlate with Baldur’s Gate 3’s expansive and reactive world. And that’s okay because Dragon Age is not Baldur’s Gate. BioWare is not Larian. And nor should they be. Rather than attempting to hit Baldur’s Gate’s lofty standards, Dragon Age: The Veilguard should instead be seeking to resurrect BioWare’s golden era. An era that produced very different RPGs to what Larian does.  </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Before we start, it’s worth recognising that the term ‘BioWare’s golden era’ will mean different things to different people. For some, it’ll be the Infinity Engine years – the time of deep, crunchy CRPGs like the original Baldur’s Gate and Icewind Dale. For what I suspect is many more people (myself included), it’s the 2007-2014 period of epic and emotional choice-driven storytelling, best demonstrated by the Mass Effect trilogy and Dragon Age. Seeded by Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic’s need to offer a choice between the light and dark side of the Force, BioWare became more interested in the narrative spun by good dungeon masters rather than organic player-driven adventures. As a result, the studio found itself progressively less invested in systemic rules and dice rolls, instead putting all of its efforts into crafting unforgettable stories around a player. The biggest, most impactful moments would be the consequences of weighty decisions that formed narrative tent poles. </p><p>The shift from pre-rendered isometric environments to fully 3D worlds enabled BioWare to push its storytelling ambition, with conversations shot like TV dialogue and set-pieces scripted to appear like blockbuster movies. It’s a format that proved hugely influential on the likes of CD Projekt Red, but has somehow remained singular in video game history. Fans now lament the absence of “BioWare-style RPGs”, which disappeared following the shaky Mass Effect: Andromeda and disastrous live-service shooter Anthem. Meanwhile, renewed interest in old-school RPG design means genre trends have shifted. Companies like Larian, Obsidian, and Owlcat have found ways to advance and evolve BioWare’s original, more systems-driven template, resulting in the likes of Pillars of Eternity, Pathfinder, and Baldur’s Gate 3.    </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The magic of BioWare’s glory days is singular, and still just as valuable to the RPG space as any of Larian’s most important offerings.</p></div><p>With old-school being the norm these days, it’s now the gameplay showcase for Dragon Age: The Veilguard that’s a blast from the past. It feels nostalgic, so much so it seems that we <em>could</em> be on the verge of a BioWare renaissance. Depicting a quest from very early in the game, the 20-minute demonstration carries the same sense of cinematic spectacle and drama that powers some of BioWare’s best moments. Tonally and structurally, it reminded me a lot of Dragon Age: Inquisition’s ‘Here Lies The Abyss’ quest, which saw the party push forward through a besieged castle to eventually clash with a group of Grey Wardens conducting a demonic ritual. This Veilguard quest, however, carries even greater weight because it is Solas that awaits at the climax of the demo: Inquisition’s ally-turned-enemy and the Dreadwolf himself. </p><p>There’s such a strong sense of character in this sequence, both in terms of the personalities within it and the atmosphere of the entire event. It is unmistakably BioWare storytelling. And, despite this being a snapshot shown entirely out of context, the scene successfully conveys the narrative stakes; as fan-favourite dwarf Varric attempts to talk down Solas from his god-summoning ritual, the conversation carries the weight of their former friendship and the uncertainty of the Dreadwolf’s deception. Watching for the first time, I even questioned if BioWare was about to kill Varric off in what is effectively a trailer, which is testament to how well the demo’s writing conveys threat and how strongly it is anchored in the previous Dragon Age stories. </p><p>This effect makes sense when you consider the people working behind the scenes. While detractors like to focus on the key figures who have left BioWare, it’s worth noting that The Veilguard’s creative director, John Epler, is a 17-year studio veteran who was a cinematic designer during the era of Dragon Age: Inquisition, a role dedicated to delivering story beats. Additionally, many of the project’s longest-serving BioWare staff are writers who have penned games as far back as Dragon Age: Origins. The right hands are here to ensure The Veilguard delivers another strong Dragon Age tale.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Of course, Dragon Age isn’t just a story. It’s an RPG, a genre that has evolved significantly since Inquisition released a decade ago. But it is unfair to expect The Veilguard to pilfer from and build upon Baldur’s Gate 3, a game that was only fully launched less than 12 months ago and was built by a team approximately twice as large as BioWare’s current staff roster. However, it <em>is</em> vital that BioWare doesn’t ignore the genre’s recent achievements, especially in the areas that its golden era recipe was once a leader. That means stronger, more impactful, and more nuanced reactivity when it comes to narrative choices. Dragon Age: The Veilguard’s story cannot simply branch into binary pathways at every decision; there needs to be deep, long-held consequences across the entire narrative experience.</p><p>While the demo’s brevity means it isn’t able to showcase how Veilguard’s approach to narrative choice works, there are nonetheless small glimpses that provide hope. You are able to select a background for your protagonist, Rook, during character creation, and that history is said to impact how you navigate the story. The demo makes a couple of references to the Shadow Dragons background (a resistance group from Tevinter who opposes the mage imperium’s corrupt leadership), suggesting that your character’s traits will impact dialogue, relationships, and opportunities. Longterm fans will recognise this as an echo of the first Dragon Age’s origin stories, but I’m actually reminded of the tag system from Larian’s Divinity: Original Sin 2, in which key traits such as race and class would open up new dialogue trees where appropriate. I’m hoping that BioWare has crafted its own version of this system to ensure our Rooks feel significant within their own story. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Veilguard completes Dragon Age’s full transition into action combat with a system that looks to do for swords and sorcery what Mass Effect did for rifles and telekinesis.</p></div><p>The big question is how any new approach to character choices will fold into the larger structure. In an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-the-first-preview">interview with IGN</a>, game director Corinne Busche explained that Veilguard is “a mission-based game. Everything is hand-touched, hand-crafted, very highly curated.” It’s a design that will presumably feel akin to the linear main quest chain that runs through the core of Dragon Age: Inquisition. Or, more likely, Mass Effect 2 (arguably the pinnacle of BioWare’s work in this ‘cinematic RPG’ field.) That means we can thankfully say goodbye to the MMO-like bloat of Inquisition’s busy work-filled hubs, but potentially at the cost of a world that feels alive, organic, and reactive. The narrowed scope means the focus may entirely be on character narrative – a perfectly valid approach, but one that can’t use the same toolkit as Baldur’s Gate 3. Where Larian crafted a <em>world </em>that reacts to your every move, BioWare should focus on building a <em>story </em>that reacts to your every decision. </p><p>To some, that will sound like a low-level ambition. But let’s face it, BioWare has been in a bad place for a decade and realistically needs to get back to what it was good at before it leaps too far into the unknown. That also means addressing its pre-Anthem faults too, which brings us to combat. Without beating around the bush, combat in Dragon Age 2 and Dragon Age: Inquisition sucks. Their design points to a reluctance by BioWare to admit it had moved on from the Infinity Engine era of real time-with-pause battles, and so what we were given was a hybrid action system that was unfulfilling both tactically and mechanically. While I do pine for the robust tactical combat of old, that’s what we have modern CRPGs like Baldur’s Gate 3 for. And so thankfully Veilguard completes Dragon Age’s full transition into action combat with a system that looks to do for swords and sorcery what Mass Effect did for rifles and telekinesis. It appears active and impactful, with an even mix of character abilities and skill-based mechanics. Hopefully it will offer something much more engaging than Inquisition’s barely readable slog-fests. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/14/dragon-age-the-veilguard-ability-wheel-1718361924441.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>While combat is now fully action-led, hopefully the Ability Wheel will offer solid tactical depth.</figcaption></figure></output><p>While I welcome Dragon Age’s shift to proper action combat, I do still hope it’s more reliant on tactics and squad command than Mass Effect. The series’ roots still need to be acknowledged, and so I wish the demo showed more of the new Ability Wheel, which can be used to issue commands to your two NPC allies. While the party size is down by one member, I do hope that Veilguard’s battles are still built on a foundation of interesting interplay between fighters. A screenshot featuring much more developed characters than those in the gameplay demo shows an Ability Wheel populated by skills that can combine and ‘detonate’, indicating the Power Combos system from Mass Effect Andromeda (one of its few good ideas) has been adapted for Dragon Age. It’s stuff like this that makes me hopeful that Veilguard will offer the best Dragon Age combat since Origins, even if it’s of an entirely different format.</p><p>At a time when Baldur’s Gate 3 is incontestably the strongest RPG ever made, it’s understandable to be a little surprised that Dragon Age: The Veilguard looks so unlike it, especially considering the series was developed as the spiritual successor to BioWare’s original Baldur’s Gate games. But while those roots are experiencing an unprecedented surge of new popularity, we shouldn’t forget BioWare’s golden ‘cinematic RPG’ era was really, <em>really</em> good. Dragon Age: Inquisition’s story and relationships remain top-notch. Dragon Age 2’s detonation of the Chantry is one of the most memorable moments in Western RPGs. Mass Effect 2 is one of the greatest games ever made. These games may be not be as systemically advanced as the best RPGs of the moment, but they gave us stories and characters that stir significant emotions in players both old and new to this day. The magic of BioWare’s glory days is singular, and still just as valuable to the RPG space as any of Larian’s most important offerings. If it's back, then that's nothing but a good thing. </p><p>But don’t just take it from me. As Larian’s own publishing director <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1800586064589128019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Michael Douse recently tweeted</a>: “Two deliberately very different games (which is good) joined thematically by a few principle vibes (character, narrative, romance) that should be enjoyed as part of a giant RPG buffet.”</p><p><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-review">Starfield review</a> returned a 7/10. We said: “Starfield has a lot of forces working against it, but eventually the allure of its expansive roleplaying quests and respectable combat make its gravitational pull difficult to resist.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Starfield: Shattered Space Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Howard said Starfield has now seen 14 million players following its launch on PC, Xbox Series X and S and straight into Xbox subscription service Game Pass, although Bethesda has yet to announce a sales figure. The game’s first story expansion, Shattered Space, launches later in 2024, with its debut trailer revealed during Microsoft’s recent Xbox Games Showcase event.</p><p>During the interview, <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>MrMattyPlays</u></a> asked Howard if it is Bethesda’s intention to continue to release annual story expansions for Starfield. Howard replied: “More or less, yeah. How long that continues, hopefully a very long time, but we're planning for the one after this, so there will be another one.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Content wise, we're looking at what we did with Far Harbor on Fallout 4.</p></div><p>As for Shattered Space itself, Howard revealed interesting details about its size and scope, likening it to the well-received Fallout 4 DLC Far Harbor.</p><p>“One of the things we always liked about it from the get-go, but I don’t think people realize, is Shattered Space, the bulk of that expansion pack, once you get to the city and the planet, it takes place there. It allows us to build a landscape like we would traditionally do and have the city and the quest. And so that story takes place there.</p><p>“Content wise, we're looking at what we did with Far Harbor on Fallout 4. This is a scope that works for our development in doing this annual story expansion type of thing. So really excited about that, and it lets us do some things the way we would in previous games and give people not completely that experience because it's still Starfield, but this new kind of alien world that you're able to explore and it takes place there.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>One common criticism of Starfield is that exploration is spread too thin across a thousand planets, many of which were deemed barren as a result of procedural generation. This is in contrast to previous Bethesda games in the Elder Scrolls and Fallout series, which are set in focused areas filled with hand-crafted cities and other points of interest.</p><p>Howard said Shattered Space, which sounds like a more traditional Bethesda experience, is not necessarily a response to that criticism, but the studio’s internal reaction to the game it had made. “It wasn't a reaction,” Howard insisted. “It was our own reaction that we had as well.”</p><p>It’s a busy time for the 450-person Bethesda Game Studios, which currently operates five teams: Starfield; Elder Scrolls 6; Fallout 76; mobile; and external development partnerships. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-teaser-is-now-6-years-old-and-even-todd-howard-paused-to-say-oh-wow-that-has-been-a-while">It’s working on the aforementioned Elder Scrolls 6</a>, ongoing content for <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>, various mobile games, updates for older games, and, eventually, the next Fallout.</p><p>But will Starfield see a sequel? If it does materialize it may be some time before we see anything of it, with Elder Scrolls 6 expected no earlier than 2028 and another Fallout game set to follow.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/welcome-to-my-world-what-makes-for-great-horror-game-settings<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When it comes to playgrounds one can have lots of fun in, the virtual kind provided by video games is hard to top.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Whether that involves running and jumping around planetoids in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Super Mario Galaxy </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">(2007) or causing mayhem in a quaint English village in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Untitled Goose Game </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">(2019), players are spoiled for choice in terms of where they wish to fulfill their power fantasy. This is helped not just by level design and mechanics that invite folks to explore and experiment, but also by aesthetics that make players feel welcome and/or in control of the situation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But let’s say the game wants you to play by its rules. Let’s imagine that the player’s dropped in an environment where the only thing they’re likely to invite is trouble should they get cocky or careless.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All of a sudden, things are looking less like a funhouse and more like something you’d find in one of gaming’s more daunting genres: horror.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Belli Castle in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunting Ground </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">(2005), the titular mountainous area of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mundaun </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">(2021)… Video games bear no shortage of places that initially disempower the player character(s) via their foreboding atmosphere, unwelcoming denizens, and a relative lack of resources for remaining upright rather than six feet under. Long story short, the power fantasy in such settings is just that: a mere fantasy. No point in entertaining it when one’s too busy trying to get out of a jam.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That said, crafting quality settings in horror titles doesn’t mean slapping in jump scares, dim lighting, and calling it a day. That would hardly lead to something that lingers in players’ minds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Via things like loopy level design, unpredictable encounters, haunting aesthetics, and the like, locations in horror games can make players feel apprehensive, compelled to exercise caution, and relieved once they get out of the proverbial tunnel in one piece. In other words, great horror locales should make gamers think that they’ve gone to hell and back—in turn making them feel proud and empowered. After all, one can’t have a diamond without some friction.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And if it’s to shine brightly, the gem needs to emerge from the darkest (and harshest) of places.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>NOTE: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">The tips&nbsp;in this article&nbsp;may or&nbsp;may not be compatible with every game depending on the designer's vision, but they serve as general tenets that can benefit the experience when well implemented. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Spoilers abound</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> since details about the settings shall be discussed.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Imbue them with atmospheric tension to keep players on edge"><span>Imbue them with atmospheric tension to keep players on edge</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Just like any other video game universe, horror settings must look, sound, and feel the part to sell players into the fantasy the genre advertises.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this case, a horror game backdrop should make players feel like they’re in harm’s way just through the mere act of standing in place, sizing up their surroundings, and waiting for the other shoe to drop. Or rather, waiting for an undead and bloodthirsty creature to emerge.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To achieve this, developers should take into consideration the kind of haunting visuals and soundscape they envision for their project. They also have to make sure that they’re tonally consistent enough not to break player immersion but unpredictable enough to keep players from memorizing patterns in the atmosphere and therefore treating the vibes like wallpaper.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Such are the criteria that the Zone from the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">series (2007 – Present) meets in every part of the Eastern European locale players happen to be adventuring in.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The product of a second Chornobyl disaster, the Zone is, aesthetically speaking, very much a reflection of the Soviet Union’s shattered socioeconomic project—courtesy of the ruined infrastructure and decaying vehicles players will often run by.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But it’s the moment players venture into the wilderness for the first time that’ll convince them that they’ve entered a forsaken place best left spared from human meddling. From the howling of feral (mutated?) cats in the distance to the monochromatic and grainy filters that cover the screen whenever players get close to a radiated and/or psychically contaminated area, the Zone’s ambient features pull no punches in the “leave while you can” department.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ergo, no number of supplies or weapons will allow players to purge themselves of the feeling of dread the Zone imparts. The only way to free oneself from it is if they let themselves get killed.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Juxtapose moments of silent dread with bouts of terror"><span>Juxtapose moments of silent dread with bouts of terror</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the same way that a game needs to provide varying vibes to keep the atmosphere from feeling static over several hours of gameplay, horror titles need to provide a contrast and balance between quiet moments and pulse-pounding ones to ensure players never know what to expect around the proverbial corner.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By doing so, a horror setting can make itself routine-proof—meaning that gamers won’t be able to form habits of any kind that can make their playstyle efficient at the cost of negated challenges.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This can be anything from the way players deal with monsters blocking their path to how they expect a specific kind of scripted event to play out in any given sublocation. Whatever the gameplay aspect, players must never feel like they’re in complete control of their circumstances and/or surroundings.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Besides, the first step to destroying the avatar’s sanity is to shatter their expectations about what they may find on the other side of a door, deep in the basement, or further down a dimly lit hallway.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If there’s one location that has not only taken this step but also a mile’s worth of them, it would be the Spencer Mansion from the 2002 remake of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As with its 1996 counterpart, the mansion prides itself on featuring winding and twisting corridors full of locked doors and shambling zombies looking for their next meal. While the blend of (relatively) quiet rooms and enemy-infested areas remains accounted for in the remake, Capcom saw to it that things would be different where enemy behavior was concerned.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Between the delayed appearance of the window-shattering Cerberus dogs and the introduction of nimble and claw-sporting Crimson Heads, the tweaks made to the classic </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">formula ensure that returning players and newcomers alike will always have their composure shattered just as they are about to get settled into the routine of unlocking doors, solving puzzles, and acquiring progress-enabling items. It also doesn’t help that the bouts of terror gamers are bound to experience are amplified by the limited saves they can make.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a result, the Spencer Mansion succeeds in making each trip outside safe rooms a game of Russian Roulette: What are the chances that steady but tense exploration is interrupted by a threat players are unprepared for? What items are they to carry prior to venturing outside or in a specific part of the mansion? In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, respite is as rare as an ink ribbon.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Make them a challenge to navigate and make sense of"><span>Make them a challenge to navigate and make sense of</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course, virtual horrors need more than just scary aesthetics and unpredictable patterns to haunt players in the long term. There’s also the fact that the avatar shouldn’t be able to easily outrun or size up whatever they’ve gotten themselves into.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">More specifically, horror environments should make players feel like a lab rat stuck in a maze they can’t swiftly get out of—a maze with walls and floors that seem to literally and figuratively shift at every turn. While this principle can easily apply to making the levels themselves prone to sudden and unexpected variations in their layouts and contents, it can also pertain to audiovisual tricks and narrative touches that render story details ambiguous and/or unreliable.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Whatever the means, the end goal in that respect should be to make the horror setting something that defies human understanding and treats its visitors the same way a cat toys with its prey to weaken it prior to delivering the finishing blow. This should be the case regardless of how good gamers get at managing resources and exercising caution every step of the way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One horror setting that never seems to let up on that front is STEM from the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Evil Within </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">titles (2014 – 2017). Essentially a perfect mechanism for generating all sorts of horrific imagery via a machine-enabled mental world made up of different human minds, STEM is as fluid and messy as the human psyche.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This isn’t helped by the fact that mad folks can call the shots and hijack the system to carry out their devilish plans.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Whether it’s a decaying metropolis full of masked husks for human beings or a bunch of floating hallways monitored by a giant blue eye that doubles as a camera, each location in STEM operates and differs from one another without rhyme or reason. This adds to the feeling of helplessness that the lead character and innocent bystanders embody as they try to piece out the full story behind STEM and its malicious creator.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Perhaps STEM’s defining and most disturbing characteristic is its ability to shift the environment at a moment’s notice—causing the avatar and nearby NPCs to fall down a hallway-turned-hole and watch as enemies spawn in a way that can only be described as paranormal. That everything is the byproduct of a troubled mind or two further drives home the idea that horrors can fundamentally be a reflection of people’s twisted perception of their world and woes.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Add variety to levels and their contents to surprise players"><span>Add variety to levels and their contents to surprise players</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Horror settings depend on their being unpredictable to ensure that players can’t get used to exploring spooky-looking/-sounding locales. Related to offering bouts of terror and hard-to-understand realities is the need to shake things up a bit in terms of level design and content, the result being that each area surprises players regardless of how far they are into the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Be it through a thematic change, different gameplay style, and/or unforeseen series of narrative beats, areas within a horror setting can benefit from all manner of tweaks to the formula established throughout the player’s journey into the heart of darkness.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While care must be taken to ensure that everything still feels like it belongs alongside the rest of the experience, developers needn’t shy away from a chance to upend player expectations if it means making the adventure more memorable and adding another beneficial gameplay and/or narrative layer to the proceedings.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Besides, horror doesn’t have to rely just on blood and (exposed) guts to remind players of their being in an abnormal place.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is something that’s on full display as players make their way deeper into the eponymous amusement park of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Illbleed </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">(2001). As its purpose suggests, the setting proves itself highly conducive to providing the environmental equivalent of a buffet—keeping the player’s proverbial taste buds from growing numb to the same ol’ taste and texture of whatever they’re hoovering up.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From the graveyard that players explore upon entering the amusement park to the toy department that harbors innocent-looking playthings that can double as traps for unsuspecting observers, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Illbleed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s cornucopia of attractions and dangers maintains a delicate balance between meeting survival horror players’ expectations and presenting its own take on genre tropes out of left field.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fancy a fight with live meat slabs and poultry on an oversized grill? How about taking on the role of a Woody knock-off and having to go to hell and fight not-Sonic the Hedgehog to rescue your loved one? </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Illbleed </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">isn’t afraid (heh) to skew toward the weird and surreal if it means making players look forward to—or dread—whatever’s coming next in the following stage.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The outcome is a horror-coaster ride that delivers copious amounts of blood, scares, and even laughs to offset the grim and prevent things from becoming so depressing that players grow numb to the title’s attempts at unsettling them.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Provide them with some backstory contextualizing their state"><span>Provide them with some backstory contextualizing their state</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As with other video game locales, a believable horror setting must have its reason(s) for being the way it is and/or bearing the stuff players will come across. Besides, it’s only natural for people to wish that they could make sense of creepy surroundings and figure out how best to navigate them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This doesn’t necessarily mean explaining the odd phenomena impacting said setting—for that would make the unknown less terrifying—but lore can paint a picture of a world larger than what gamers will be able to see. This can paradoxically result in them </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>wanting </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">to search every dark (and dangerous) area they can find, even if a part of them wants to get out of Dodge.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Backstory, however, can be more than just flavor text that doubles down on the tension permeating the experience. It can also provide players with ideas of where to look for clues and items that may help them make further progress in the game, making such narrative elements similarly relevant to those wishing to focus on the gameplay side of things.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is an area in which </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crow Country </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">(2024) excels, its titular theme park housing all sorts of baneful attractions and often funny notes that shine a light on how things used to be and what players can do to make it out alive and sane.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Between the set of instructions on how to get a treasure chest to open in a nautical-themed restaurant and the series of messages hinting at shady mining operations in which the park’s owner is implicated, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crow Country</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s collectible notes help shine a light on why and how a seemingly innocuous amusement park went the way of the dodo not long ago. The lean writing ensures that players will get just the right amount of information and context to be compelled to collect more texts, even if it means having to venture into rooms full of traps and monsters.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What’s impressive about SFB Games’ efforts is that the title’s narrative bits and pieces maintain a balance between storytelling and gameplay considerations, providing all players with at least one incentive to bother looking for notes. This, in turn, helps drive the exploration-combat-puzzle loop emblematic of the survival horror genre—satisfying players’ innate desire to explore every virtual nook and cranny and balancing that out with terrifying obstacles that add a risk-reward element to their endeavors.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In other words, the presence and placement of texts—hardly exciting on their own—contribute to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crow Country</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s success in feeling as thrilling (or scary) as riding a roller coaster.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As mentioned in a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-good-within-designing-a-memorable-horror-game-protagonist">previous article</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on horror protagonists, tension doesn’t just arise from a setting looking and sounding like something wholly alien. Such a feeling can also be amplified by the player character’s realization that they might have more in common with their harrowing surroundings than they’d care to admit.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Horror settings are more than just spooky virtual spaces players venture into at their own peril. They can also be reflections of the woes its inhabitants and visitors embody, adding a personal element to the environment’s monstrosities and ghastly happenings that can render even the sturdiest of souls mad. And if the player character’s one that gamers would love to know more about, then they’ll be tempted to wend their way into the darkest reaches of the setting—and potentially learn things about their character that recontextualize the narrative.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ergo, the simple inclusion of a bond between the setting and the player character can add another layer to the narrative and compel players to find everything they can about their avatar—allowing the horrors on display to be more than skin-deep in terms of how greatly they can wound the player character.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Silent Hill 2 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">(2001) is an excellent example of a title sporting a setting that aims to put the player character through the wringer and have them learn something invaluable (about themselves) via the horrors they’re to face.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As James Sunderland, players will make their way through the eponymous resort town to look for their character’s wife. As they do so, they shall come across all kinds of monsters and locales whose scariest trait isn’t their baleful looks, but rather their sheer variety and potent ties to James’s personal struggles as a husband and human being.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From highly suggestive nurses roaming hospital hallways to pyramid-headed executioners looking for their next victim to impale, Silent Hill’s many supernatural denizens carry heavy-hitting symbolism that cuts more deeply into James than the rusty weapons they happen to be wielding. This ensures that the scars James leaves with aren’t the kind people can necessarily see, but rather the sort that time may not be able to fully heal.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The result is a setting that can have horrors lie not just around the player character, but also seep into them as their psyche starts to crack under the pressure of being stalked by unknown forces.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let me know what you think of my post in the comments section, and feel free to ask questions and share the article.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Twitter:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/Watfen64">https://twitter.com/Watfen64</a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Email:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#ef82868c878a839c8e8d8d8e8887dddfdfdcaf829c81c18c8082"><span data-cfemail="3b565258535e57485a59595a5c53090b0b087b56485515585456">[email&nbsp;protected]</span></a></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>LinkedIn:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sabbaghmichel/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/sabbaghmichel/</a></span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The studio is the latest to be closed by the troubled company over the last 10 months.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pieces Interactive’s <a href="https://www.piecesinteractive.se/">website</a> now only features a graphic listing “2007-2024 Thanks For Playing With Us” and a short blurb detailing its history:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pieces Interactive released over ten titles on PC, Console and Mobile since 2007, both our own concepts such as Puzzlegeddon, Fret Nice, Leviathan Warships, Robo Surf and Kill to Collect, as well as work for hire titles such as Magicka 2 and several DLCs for Magicka. Our client list includes Paradox Interactive, Koei Tecmo, Arrowhead Game Studios, Koch Media and RaceRoom Entertainment.</p>

<p>In 2017, Pieces Interactive were acquired by Embracer Group after working with the expansion for Titan Quest, Titan Quest: Ragnarök and third expansion for Titan Quest, Titan Quest: Atlantis.</p>

<p>Our last release was the reimagening of Alone in the Dark.</p>

<p>Alone in the Dark launched on March 20 to mixed reviews, currently sitting at a 63 on Metacritic. The game stars actors Jodie Comer and David Harbour, who lent their voices and likenesses, in a third-person reimagining of the 1992 survival horror classic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the collapse of a $2 billion deal with the Saudi Arabia-backed Savvy Games Group in 2023, Embracer has undergone a massive restructuring to stay afloat, resulting in a significant reduction of headcount across its many studios. That has included laying off over 1,000 employees (including those at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/01/29/embracer-group-cancels-new-deus-ex-game-in-development-at-eidos-montreal-lays-off">Eidos-Montreal</a>), selling off its studios (<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/03/15/embracer-reportedly-set-to-sell-star-wars-kotor-remake-dev-saber-interactive-in-500">Saber Interactive</a>, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/03/28/take-two-purchases-gearbox-entertainment-from-embracer-for-460-million">Gearbox Entertainment</a>), and outright closing others (<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2023/12/12/embracer-reportedly-might-close-free-radical-design-its-reformed-timesplitters-team">Free Radical Design</a>, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2023/08/31/saints-row-developer-volition-games-has-been-shut-down">Volition Games</a>).

<p data-characters="317" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">You would think any company that let go employees might be struggling a bit financially. That’s not the case with EA. In fact, the publisher’s 2024 fiscal year appears to have been very lucrative since it made over $7 billion in net revenue, with CEO Andrew Wilson himself earning more than $25.6 million.</p> <p data-characters="622" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true">As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-execs-earned-60-million-in-2024-despite-layoffs-and-office-closures">Game Developer</a>, EA revealed this in a recent <a href="https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000712515/f0be0a59-dd50-4247-b36e-0513336b6c1f.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Proxy Statement</a> for its shareholders. Said statement also broke down how much each of EA’s executives earned in terms of base salaries and bonuses. Altogether, these executives, including Wilson, made over $60 million. This past February, EA had opted to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/electronic-arts-announces-its-laying-off-5-of-its-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lay off 5% of its total workforce</a> (estimated to be about 670 people), with the only explanation being that it was a result of the company’s decision to move away from developing games based on licensed IPs (although it still has <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/eas-iron-man-and-black-panther-games-to-be-open-world-according-to-job-listings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two Marvel games based on Iron Man and Black Panther</a> in the works).</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via EA</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="696" data-injectable="true">The full statement doesn’t appear to make any mention of the layoffs, though one of Wilson’s listed achievements is that he “oversaw a year of continued employee satisfaction scores above industry benchmarks, with record high talent retention and strong talent attraction.” Additional comments from Wilson himself only highlight how strong EA’s fiscal year has been.</p>

            <p>Recent data states Rockstar's GTA trilogy has hit a combined total of over 30m downloads on Netflix.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-3-vice-city-and-san-andreas-heading-to-netflix-in-december">made their way onto the service in December</a>, following earlier reports that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-reportedly-looking-to-license-gta-title-as-it-moves-into-higher-end-gaming">Netflix had been in talks with Rockstar</a> to licence a GTA game as part of an attempt to introduce "higher-end" titles to its mobile-focused gaming catalogue.</p>
<p>In January, it was subsequently reported that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-monthly-game-downloads-nearly-tripled-to-28m-in-december-thanks-to-gta">arrival of these three games had given a boost to Netflix's gaming endeavours</a>, with monthly mobile game downloads nearly tripling to 28m in the December. 18m of these downloads were a combination of San Andreas, Vice City, and GTA 3.</p>

<p>Now, several months down the road, that number has increased to over 30m Netflix downloads for the GTA games. According to <a href="https://appmagic.rocks/">Appmagic</a> data compiled by <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/rockstars-gta-trilogy-hits-30m-downloads-on-netflix/">mobilegamer.biz</a>, San Andreas has had 20.5m downloads to date, Vice City has had 6.5m and GTA 3 has had 3.3m. </p>
<p>The majority of these GTA downloads have been on Apple devices. Meanwhile, most of the downloads were from the US.</p>
<p>As the publication notes, this means GTA is the biggest game series released through Netflix to date.

<p>Rockstar's GTA series remains one of the most prominent in the industry today. Back in May, it was announced the studio's seemingly evergreen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-sales-have-topped-a-staggering-200m">GTA 5 has now sold over 200m copies</a>. Meanwhile, when Rockstar revealed its first trailer for GTA 6 towards the end of last year, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-proves-its-dominance-as-trailer-breaks-youtube-records">quickly broke YouTube records</a>, becoming the most viewed video in 24 hours (that wasn't a music video), hitting an astonishing 90m in its first day.</p>
<p>GTA 6 is set to release on consoles during the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-coming-in-fall-2025-publisher-take-two-reveals">autumn next year</a> - a launch window <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-publisher-highly-confident-of-autumn-2025-release-window">publisher Take-Two has said it is "highly confident" in</a>.</p>
<p>I do wonder whatever happened to that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/meta-staying-quiet-on-status-of-grand-theft-auto-san-andreas-vr">GTA San Andreas VR port</a> that was announced ages ago...?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fumes-is-a-max-max-tinted-open-world-twisted-metal-full-of-absolutely-furious-rally-cars<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Fumes has starred in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fumes">a few Screenshot Saturday round-ups</a> but this is the first time, to my knowledge, that somebody from the Treehouse has slipped behind the wheel and taken this crusty old banger for a spin. I am glad to have done so. Created by a team of four, Fumes is the Mad Max X Vigilante 8 adaptation somebody really should have made in the 90s, when the very thought of such a thing would have had me flipping tables and then sheepishly righting them again, before being sent to bed with no dinner.</p>
<p>It's an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> combat racer with boisterous arcade handling, pop-out guns that wiggle about like hood ornaments, some kaiju-wannabe boss vehicles, a delightfully crunchy, sooty artstyle and a passably earwormy metal soundtrack. I'm not <em>entirely</em> convinced it has longevity beyond its impeccably scorched and dented PS1 vibes, but I definitely think you should try the demo, now that the early access version is out.<!--more-->
</p>
<p>
At the very least, you can watch the latest trailer, below, though I must caution you that it was made for the PC Gaming Show and contains PCGamer branding. Don't worry: there are representations of rocks and shotguns in the footage, too, and some of those bits of flying detritus are likely pieces of paper. Thanks for the promotion, FUMES team!

<p>
As described on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1920430/FUMES/">Steam page</a>, Fumes "is a single-player game inspired by the golden era of vehicular combat genre. Straight-forward, fast paced, intense gameplay. Get into the car, slap some weapons on and cruise twisted wastes." Don't mind if I do. There's an upgrades treadmill and customisation element in the shape of a mobile chop shop, but it doesn't feel like a game where you've got to add 5% to your spiked fender every 10 minutes to survive. Missions consist of racing or massacring the other drivers that throng the wilderness, delivering packages and wrecking bosses, some of which are large enough I'd love to board them using a jump ramp and play Fumes like a post-apocalyptic rodeo machine.
</p>
<p>
I'm not sure if Fumes has a story beyond the timeless Dostoevskian tale of cars killing cars for parts, but it has a storied landscape. Travel far enough in a direction and you'll encounter beached tankers (some of which have monster tyres), skeletal oil rigs and some surprisingly green and flourishing swathes of forestland. I'm not trying to portray this as a meticulous piece of found storytelling, but there are hints of a pre-apocalyptic past to occupy the voyager when you aren't busy murdering icecream vans. Anyway, they're saying it'll be in early access for roughly a year, with the current build offering "all core features and a few hours of gameplay".</p>
<p>In other news, I've just checked the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicular_combat_game">Wikipedia page for "vehicular combat game"</a> and they're saying it's a dead genre. Iunno what to think of that, but it's certainly been a while since the last Destruction Derby.</p>

And look, those things take time. I don’t think it’s bad for people to miss things. We just want to get it right and make sure that everything we’re doing in a franchise, whether it’s <em>Elder Scrolls</em>, <em>Fallout</em>, or now<em> Starfield</em>, that those become meaningful moments for everybody who loved these franchises as much as we do.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h6108"><a id=""></a>A new <em>Fallout </em>might not happen anytime soon</h2><p>That’ll be bad news for anyone who was hoping Bethesda might pivot to getting the next <em>Fallout </em>game out sooner in the wake of the<em> Fallout</em> TV show’s wild success and breakout popularity beyond the existing fan base. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-5-show-todd-howard-amazon-1851325762&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-5-show-todd-howard-amazon-1851325762"><em>Fallout 5</em></a></span>, or whatever the studio decides to call it, is currently slated to go into production after<em> The Elder Scrolls VI </em>is complete, which is likely still many years away as well at this point. </p><p>The recent boost in popularity, including <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-ps5-ps-plus-steam-mods-game-pass-bugs-1851438302&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-ps5-ps-plus-steam-mods-game-pass-bugs-1851438302"><em>Fallout 4</em>'s next-gen update</a></span> making it one of April’s most-downloaded games, renewed speculation about whether Bethesda would be willing to hand-off the franchise to a third-party again, like it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-new-vegas-timeline-canon-todd-howard-1851416601&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-new-vegas-timeline-canon-todd-howard-1851416601">did with Obsidian Entertainment for <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></a></span>. Given that the studio is now part of Microsoft, there’s a lot of other internal teams it could partner with to potentially put out a smaller spin-off based in that world in the short-term.</p><p>But nothing Howard said in the interview suggested that’s currently one of Bethesda’s goals for the franchise. It doesn’t sound like remasters of <em>Fallout 1</em> and <em>2</em> are on the table either. The CRPGs developed by Interplay Entertainment before Bethesda purchased the license are isometric and more punishing. They’re great but much harder to get into in the year 2024. </p><figure id="" data-id="de6637b15951f66cf3e203948a12314e" data-recommend-id="image://de6637b15951f66cf3e203948a12314e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An astronaut approaches their ship.

He didn’t directly address rumors of <em>Fallout 3 </em>or <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion </em>remasters, so it’s unclear if the studio would feel similarly about modernizing them.<br></p><p>Instead, the director talked about how the team is trying to support existing games for longer. We’ve obviously seen that with <em>Fallout 76</em>, which is now in its sixth year, in the best shape it’s ever been, and is gaining players rather than losing them. Even though<em> Starfield</em> is a single-player game, it sounds like Bethesda might be taking a longer view with its offline RPGs moving forward as well. </p><h2 id="h6109"><a id=""></a><em>Starfield </em>could be supported for years to come</h2><p>For example, Howard said he’d wished the team had supported <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Skyrim</em> for longer given how long it kept selling and being widely-played for. Starfield is currently set to get its first expansion, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-showcase-starfield-shattered-space-1851528944&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-showcase-starfield-shattered-space-1851528944"><em>Shattered Space</em></a></span>, later this year, but it won’t be the only one. “We’re planning for the one after this, so there will be another one,” he confirmed in the interview. </p><p>It also sounds like the currently announced DLC will address some of the bigger criticisms of the base game, namely how empty, scattered, and repetitive it began to feel due in part to its procedurally generated worlds. <em>Shattered Space</em>, on the other hand, sounds pretty hand-crafted, focusing on a particular city and questline.</p><p> “Content wise, we’re looking at what we did with <em>Far Harbor</em> on<em> Fallout 4,” </em>Howard told MrMattyPlays. “This is a scope that works for our development in doing this annual story expansion type of thing. So really excited about that, and it lets us do some things the way we would in previous games and give people not completely that experience because it’s still<em> Starfield</em>, but this new kind of alien world that you’re able to explore and it takes place there.”</p><p><em>Shattered Space </em>still doesn’t have a release date beyond fall 2024, but the expansion looked great when shown during Microsoft’s recent Xbox showcase. It might be exactly what the sci-fi RPG needs to win more people over. The DLC will also be available on Game Pass once it’s out. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In North America at least, the expansion will be launching at 9 PM PDT on June 20 on consoles, meaning it’ll be available on the east coast at midnight on the 21st. Most of the launch times differ more drastically between PC and consoles though, with the former receiving the DLC at 3 PM PDT by comparison.<br></p><p>In most other regions of the world, especially throughout Europe and Asia, console players will be able to access <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>at midnight local time. In many of those same regions, the PC launch is usually off by an hour or two.<br></p><p>Unfortunately for folks looking to preload the expansion and jump in right away, that benefit seems reserved for PlayStation owners. <em>Elden Ring </em>players who purchased the game on the PS4 and PS5 will be able to begin preloading <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>48 hours prior to launch in their respective regions. Xbox and PC players are being forced to download the DLC at launch.<br></p><p>Until then, there’s a lot you can be doing to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-erdtree-dlc-mohg-how-to-access-1851532791&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-erdtree-dlc-mohg-how-to-access-1851532791">prepare for the expansion</a></span>, not the least of which is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-dlc-mogh-achievement-1851531884&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-dlc-mogh-achievement-1851531884">defeating Mohg</a></span>, the optional boss that needs to be beaten in order to access <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>.
