<p>Launching as a Switch 2 exclusive in the West</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>After revealing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/disgaea-7-complete">Disgaea 7 Complete</a>'s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/disgaea-7-complete-is-launching-exclusively-on-switch-2-in-the-west">Western Switch 2 exclusivity</a> last month, NIS America has today lifted the lid on the release date for the upcoming definitive edition: <strong>10th October 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>This 'complete' package arrived in Japan last year on PS5, PS4 and Switch, but only Nintendo's latest will be treated to the Western release (albeit as a Game-Key Card if you opt for the physical version).</p>
<p>For those who have missed it up until now, Disgaea 7 Complete bundles up the 2023 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/disgaea_7_vows_of_the_virtueless">Vows of the Virtueless</a> strategy RPG base game and all of its DLC packs, gameplay tweaks like a new Hell Mode, max stats and more, <em>and</em> new characters and storylines. You can see it all for yourself in the above release date trailer.</p>
<p>We had a great time with Vows of the Virtueless when it arrived on Switch 1 a couple of years ago, calling it "another enjoyable entry in the long-running series, offering up a more refined take on the famously in-depth gameplay systems" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/disgaea-7-vows-of-the-virtueless">our review</a>. The complete edition certainly seems like it'll be <em>the</em> way to play this one, and fortunately, we don't have too long to wait.</p>

            <p>
Itch.io have announced that they are seeking out new payment processing partners who are more willing to handle the purchase of NSFW games, after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-apologise-for-frustration-and-confusion-after-delisting-thousands-of-nsfw-projects">delisting or removing a vast swathe of games</a> in accordance with the content restrictions of companies such as Paypal and Stripe. They've also offered an explanation for why they've recently delisted so many more "infringing" games than Steam, which has carried out its own cull of sexually explicit games under pressure from finance firms. Finally, Itch have acknowledged that their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itch-post-new-list-of-banned-nsfw-content-that-would-rule-out-certain-kojima-games-plus-goty-2024-mouthwashing">recently posted list of newly prohibited adult material</a> is far too vague to be useful.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
To catch you up, all this began earlier this summer, when Valve quietly updated Steam's terms and conditions to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-change-steams-rules-to-let-banks-and-credit-card-firms-prohibit-certain-kinds-of-adult-only-content">give banks, payment processors and internet service providers control over the platform's definition of "adult" content</a>. Following this change of policy, they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-are-now-removing-a-bunch-of-sex-games-from-steam-to-keep-banks-and-card-companies-happy">delisted around a number of projects</a>, including a bunch of incest-themed sex games.</p>
<p>In the wake of Valve's policy change, Itch also began removing thousands of games from search results in the course of a catalogue-wide audit. Itch.io have been asking developers to comply with payment processor regulations for a while, but they have not hitherto tried to enforce this systematically.
</p>
<p>
According to <a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content#addendum-faq">an addendum to Itch.io's latest statement about NSFW content</a>, the difference in scale between each platform's banwave is the result of, firstly, Valve being a much larger corporation with greater capacity to challenge the payment firms, and secondly, Valve exerting tighter control over adult game developers to begin with. On Steam, product pages have to be approved before they will appear on the store. "Because they were generally aware of the content they host, they could identify and act on specific pages," Itch conclude.
</p>
<p>
By contrast, Itch.io is an open-ended platform where "anyone can publish content at any time with minimal barriers". It's possible to tag Itch.io game pages as having adult material, but Itch comment that "we could not rely on user-provided tagging to be accurate enough for a targeted approach, so a broader review was necessary to be thorough."
</p>
<p>
There's no timeline for when Itch.io's audit will be complete, not least because they're waiting on "final determinations from our current payment processors, Stripe and PayPal". They are, however, now getting in touch with alternative payment processors who are more willing to handle the kind of material Stripe and Paypal consider objectionable. They're also looking at stricter age-gating for Itch.io and better content classification.
</p>
<p>Not coincidentally, the International Game Developer have <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/the-igda-calls-wave-of-adult-game-delistings-a-form-of-creative-suppression-">just put out a statement</a> in which they appease all sides by "calling for greater transparency and fairness in how adult games are moderated and actioned across major platforms". The statement lists a couple of "adult-industry-compliant processors" you might want to partner with, if you're platforming a game the likes of Paypal won't touch: Verotel and CCBill. I have minimal familiarity with either, but I'll look into them.</p>
<p>
In their latest missive, Itch also tackle some user complaints about the delistings. They note that even if game pages are removed from search, you can still visit them and download the game if you already own it, even if it has been slapped with a "content notice". Itch are not, they insist, removing previously bought games from player libraries as part of the audit: people who can no longer access their games should get in touch with Itch support. The blog post also encourages players to "download and backup your games and don't let any corporation dictate what you can own".
</p>
<p>
As for complaints that Itch are already withholding payments from developers who infringe their new, albeit rather makeshift content policies, the platform holders comment that this reflects an older policy of stopping transactions in the case of an account breaking their content policies, "to address bad-actor situations where a user joins the site and blatantly violates our terms to make sales before being banned".
</p>
<p>
As for yesterday's list of prohibited themes and topics, which ranges from "animal-related" NSFW material to "real or implied" non-consensual sex, Itch concede that the list is very WIP, and that "we understand the problems that come with a list like this, as it's easy to argue the semantics". 
</p>
<p>
"We decided it was better to give you more information to work with instead of less, even if many of the items on the list can be argued either way," the post continues. "We intend to refine this part of the site with more care, but since there are still unknowns, this is the information we can provide for now."
</p>
<p>
As for why Itch and Steam's payment processing partners have suddenly decided to push for a crackdown on games that infringe their policies, it's apparently the result of an open letter to the payment companies from Australian activist group Collective Shout, who campaign against the sexualisation of women and depictions of sexual violence.</p>
<p>Collective Shout have called for games featuring incest and rape to be delisted, but haven't shared specifics of the individual games they find objectionable, and seem pretty suspect in their motivations. They've mischaracterised certain games they want banned in the past, and have connections to rightwing Christian organisations with queerphobic leaders who want to criminalise all sex work. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown">You can read up on a little of the backstory here.</a> Whatever you may think of Collective Shout, or of Valve and Itch.io's previous moderation of NSFW material, the overarching point is that vast finance firms shouldn't get to police the definition of acceptable sexual material.

It’s true! Most of us will rock some pretty terrible armor as long as we look cool doing it. But that’s why it’s so awesome when a game offers transmog with no downsides, letting us wear the best armor for our character without sacrificing our good looks in the process.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195922" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Is Alan Wake Worth Playing Before Its Sequel? | Total Recall" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="390" data-playlist="195922,196539,196055" data-current="195922"><div><p>Is Alan Wake Worth Playing Before Its Sequel? | Total Recall</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195922/195922_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195922/195922_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195922/195922_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195922/195922_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21438.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Like its approach to respeccing, <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> knocks it out of the park with its implementation of transmog. You have access to this feature right out of the gate, meaning you can swap around your looks as soon as you begin getting any new armor. And even better, you can do so at any time by just accessing the equipment menu. It costs nothing—no materials needed!</p><p>Here’s how to transmog your gear in <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>.</p><h2 id="h449572"><a id=""></a>How to transmog your gear in <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em></h2><p>To transmog your gear in <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>, you first need to open your menu and navigate to the equipment tab. You have four types of armor here: Head, Chest, Bracers, and Legs. As long as you have a piece of gear equipped here, you’ll see an option on the bottom of the screen that says “Alter Equipment”. Press the corresponding button to bring up a list of all of your available armor, then press “Confirm” on the option you’d like to apply as a transmog to your equipped piece of gear.</p><figure id="" data-id="07d67ca774e1edbfffcd96e5641a7af5" data-recommend-id="image://07d67ca774e1edbfffcd96e5641a7af5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a helmet in an item screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows a helmet in an item screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Leenzee / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="07d67ca774e1edbfffcd96e5641a7af5" data-recommend-id="image://07d67ca774e1edbfffcd96e5641a7af5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a helmet in an item screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Alternatively, if you’d like to remove any transmog applied to a piece of gear, simply go back into the alteration menu and look for an option at the bottom of the screen that says “Remove Alteration,” then click the corresponding button. This will reset the piece of gear back to its default appearance.</p><figure id="" data-id="4350c5b3f5a12101edb16ca063691faf" data-recommend-id="image://4350c5b3f5a12101edb16ca063691faf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of an item menu shows various equipment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of an item menu shows various equipment." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Leenzee / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4350c5b3f5a12101edb16ca063691faf" data-recommend-id="image://4350c5b3f5a12101edb16ca063691faf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of an item menu shows various equipment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As for whether or not you should bother with transmog, my vote is a resounding <strong>yes</strong>! This game has some of the coolest armor I’ve seen in a soulslike in quite a while, and it’s well worth trying different pieces together to get the ultimate fit. </p><p>More importantly, transmog is especially useful because you’ll probably want to swap around equipment regularly in <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>, as many areas are home to dangerous status effects. If you need Corruption protection but don’t like the look of that armor, just transmog it to look exactly like your favorite armor set.</p><figure id="" data-id="3f6e9b598b5d339c7358f3577ba9594f" data-recommend-id="image://3f6e9b598b5d339c7358f3577ba9594f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist of Wuchang shows off a new fit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Wuchang shows off a new fit." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Leenzee / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3f6e9b598b5d339c7358f3577ba9594f" data-recommend-id="image://3f6e9b598b5d339c7358f3577ba9594f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist of Wuchang shows off a new fit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For instance, I’m wearing some armor with fantastic Corruption protection in the photo above, but you’d never know it. Instead, I’m slayin’ it with the Pirate Set I was recently given by an NPC. I look rad while still getting all the protections I need for the area of the game I’m working through at the moment. Cool.</p><p>So, just play around with <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>’ transmog until you get something that really suits your vibe. And since you can change it on the fly, you’re not tied down here. If you get tired of a look, switch things up again. You’re the master of your aesthetic now. Go forth and fashion.</p><hr><p><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/wuchang-transmog-alter-equipment-option-change-default-1851787261]]></content:encoded>

                <p>While <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> OG has had a consistently solid player population for months, the mode has been overshadowed by both Reload and Blitz--and so it's only to be expected that Epic would try some new stuff to shake things up. This past weekend's live rocket event has seemingly ushered in the first of these changes, which could be taking the island in a new direction with the mysterious red rifts. And with this latest patch, OG got a retro matchmaking mode with no skill-based matchmaking and no bots.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1950174438562922752" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">OG Duos just went Expert mode!<br>Wanna put your skills to the test? Expert mode has old school matchmaking rules where anyone and everyone could be in your lobby! Good luck ;)</p>  — Fortnite (@Fortnite) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fortnite/status/1950174438562922752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 29, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>To try out this new version of OG, just select the standard OG mode (<em>not</em> Zero build), and click the group-size dropdown menu, where you'll find a new option at the bottom for Duo (Expert). And don't worry: the regular Duo mode is still available for folks who don't want to wade into this sweatfest.</p><p>While the removal of skill-based matchmaking (SBMM) will be celebrated by some, the net effect of its removal is that people who just started playing Fortnite could be matched against pro gamers--which is the reason pro gamers often clamor to get rid of SBMM. This dynamic tends to be less thrilling for normal players, though, who have a better time when they're <em>not</em> constantly being matched with players who have a much higher skill level than they do.</p><p>In this case, however, the removal of SBMM and bots is actually more of a nostalgia play, because Fortnite didn't have either of those things during Chapter 1. So this sort of matchmaking change brings OG more in line mechanically with what it really was back in the day.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> is easily one of the best-looking games of the year, and it looks like it's convincing enough to fool Reddit and Discord's age-checking programs. Over in the UK, new online safety rules went live and now require several platforms to verify the age of its various users there. Brits have been getting around that system using a variety of tricks, and as one Dany Sterkhov noted, pretending to be Sam Porter Bridges is a reliable way to trick the system.</p><p>Like other PlayStation first-party games, Death Stranding 2 has a robust photo mode that allows you to easily and quickly strike a pose with the game's protagonist, who is played by actor Norman Reedus. Game director Hideo Kojima used a sophisticated photography rig made up of dozens of cameras to capture every minute detail of the real-life people who provided their likeness for the game's characters, and with photo mode open in Death Stranding 2, simply pointing your smartphone at your display is enough to bypass the security systems.</p><p>What makes this even more impressive is that even if you're asked to make certain facial expressions, you can do that in Death Stranding 2's photo mode easily. As noted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/714402/uk-age-verification-bypass-death-stranding-reddit-discord" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, Discord and Reddit use their own separate age verification systems, and fooling both of them was remarkably easy. Meanwhile, the UK Government is facing quite a bit of criticism over the introduction of these measures, and it refuses to repeal the Online Safety Act even in the face of petitions that have almost 400,00 people calling for it to be rolled back (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/the-uk-government-say-it-has-no-plans-to-repeal-the-online-safety-act-in-response-to-380-000-strong-and-counting-petition/" rel="nofollow ">PC Gamer</a>).</p><p>In other Death Stranding 2 news, more interesting details were revealed about the game and player behavior. Kojima tweeted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/80-of-death-stranding-2-players-who-finished-it-kept-playing-after-the-credits/1100-6533497/" data-ref-id="1100-6533497">almost 80% of the players who finished it kept playing</a>--got to get those five-star SSS connections!--and that people really loved to rescue kangaroos in the post-apocalyptic outback.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Ubisoft <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1950194611374137730" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> Update 1.0.7 for Assassin's Creed Shadows. The patch adds the highly requested New Game+ mode, allowing players to start a new playthrough after finishing Assassin's Creed Shadows the first time with all the skills, gear, Allies, and hideout progression they had already collected in their first playthrough. A New Game+ playthrough can be kicked off from the Memory Menu in the Animus after completing all of Naoe's, Yasuke's, and Junjiro's journeys.</p>



<p>Upon completing a New Game+ playthrough, players obtain Whisper of Gold and Dragon's Gold. They'll also receive a brand new gold-plated Legendary Long Katana and a Legendary Katana, each with its own unique perk engraving. With each new venture, players must face stronger foes and more demanding challenges of their Shinobi and Samurai skills.</p>



<p>This update also increases the game's level cap from 60 to 80, which means you'll be facing tougher opponents equipped with enhanced tactics and awareness. Furthermore, the Knowledge Rank system has been enhanced to levels 9 and 10, allowing players to unlock and develop a wider range of skills, passive abilities, and combat techniques.</p>



<p>It is also now possible to upgrade Naoe and Yasuke's passives and skills. Assassin's Creed Shadows players will gain one new rank for multiple nodes in their mastery skills and ten new ranks for all existing knowledge passives. The Forge can also be upgraded to level 4, enabling players to upgrade all weapons and gear to the new level cap of 80.</p>



<p>Along with new levels and ranks come three new achievements and trophies waiting to be unlocked:</p>



<ul>
<li>Enjoy the Ride: Reach Level 80</li>



<li>Stars Unseen: Reach Knowledge Rank 10</li>



<li>"Worth Its Wait": Obtain the Gold Katana and Gold Long Katana by completing the story on New Game+.</li>
</ul>



<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-new-game-plus-dlc-claws-of-awaji-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will receive its Claws of Awaji DLC on September 16</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>I Hate This Place, a new isometric survival horror game developed by Broken Mirror Games and published by <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloober-team-announces-partnership-with-skybound-entertainment-developing-a-new-title-by-2025/">Skybound Games</a>, a new publishing label under Bloober Team, has just debuted its first gameplay trailer, showcasing the game's signature '80s aesthetics and the tense survival horror atmosphere it is looking to create.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for anyone who's been keeping an eye on I Hate This Place since its initial reveal <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/open-world-survival-horror-game-i-hate-this-place-announced-for-ps5-xbox-series-switch-and-pc">earlier this year</a>, no new release window is provided beyond what Skybound Games and Broken Mirror Games have already stipulated, which is that the game is due out in Q4 2025.</p>



<p>At least the gameplay trailer is a solid minute and change of gameplay, featuring a few appreciated inclusions like little 'Thud' popping up behind your feet with every step you take, as a callback to the comic series the game is based on.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="I Hate This Place | Official Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BtgCRwEvVsI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>I Hate This Place follows Elena, who is forced to survive nightmarish creatures after unknowingly summoning a power beyond what her nightmares could conjure up. When it does arrive sometime in Q4 2025, it'll be available on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Monster Hunter Wilds Endgame Content Bumped Up to Mid-August]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-endgame-august</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-monster-hunter-wilds-endgame-content-bumped-up-to-mid-august.1256316/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that it's moving some of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' upcoming endgame content forward, so it'll no longer be appearing in the forthcoming Title Update 3, but much sooner instead.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2246340/view/534356720697222823" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post on Steam</a>, the studio says that while the endgame content in question was originally planned for Title Update 3 (which is scheduled for late September), it'll now be arriving on August 13th as part of a smaller update instead.</p>

<p>You can now look forward to a new quest difficulty level and a new rewards system arriving in just a few weeks. The reward system will grant you Talismans with "random skill combinations" for completing quests at the new tier, according to Capcom.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-endgame-content-august-flying.jpg?itok=kkTyDZw- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-endgame-content-august-flying.jpg?itok=kn6YQvAu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More endgame content is coming to&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, and sooner than you might think.</figcaption></figure><p>This does mean that update 1.021, which was originally going to be a more straightforward balance update, will arrive slightly later than planned. However, it'll now contain adjustments for "more weapons than originally planned", so it's not all bad news.</p>

<p>Presumably, since the new quest level and Talisman system are moving out of Title Update 3, Capcom will have something substantial planned to replace those features in order to bring the update in line with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-1-release-date" rel="nofollow">scope</a> of previous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">Title Updates</a>.</p>

<p>The studio is remaining tight-lipped about that for now, however, so it's probably going to be a while before we hear more about exactly what's coming as part of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' third major update.</p>

<p>In the meantime, though, Capcom has announced that the Flamefete event, which is currently underway, will be extended by another week in order to give you more time to unlock its various rewards and try out its quests. It'll now be coming to a close on August 13th.</p>




<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series. Although it's been met with a rather <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">varied response</a> from its player base, that hasn't stopped the game from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" rel="nofollow">breaking sales records</a> for Capcom, both for its franchise and for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-record" rel="nofollow">the company as a whole</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sometimes, you just need to change your approach by resetting all your skill points. This is especially true in any good role-playing adventure that features a smorgasbord of build options like <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>. Thankfully, this soulslike game incentivizes creativity and experimentation in its skill system, giving you a ton of freedom to try out different builds and styles.The game never punishes you for trying new things. Here’s why respeccing in <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> is awesome.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195752" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Baldur's Gate 3's Karlach Actor On Playing The Beloved Barbarian" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="136" data-playlist="195752,197562,196131" data-current="195752"><div><p>Baldur's Gate 3's Karlach Actor On Playing The Beloved Barbarian</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195752/195752_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195752/195752_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195752/195752_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195752/195752_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21263.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h442636"><a id=""></a>Respeccing in <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> is a breath of fresh air</h2><p>Unlike with the respec system of many similar titles, you won’t need any rare items or resources, nor will you need to spend hard-earned money or experience when you’re ready to swap things around. Instead, <strong><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> lets you respec any time you’d like with just a few quick button presses</strong>. </p><p>Better yet, <strong>there are no downsides to respeccing. </strong>Any Red Mercury Essence or upgrade materials you’ve used will be refunded to you in full with no downsides. This means you can respec as often as you’d like, trying entirely new builds or strategies on a whim. And given that the game features a variety of weapons and tons of options for magic and buffing, it’s a good idea to try new things as you progress through the journey.</p><p>While most games in the genre feature upgrade paths that make you feel locked into a certain weapon due to the limited availability of higher-tier materials, <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> does away with this by lumping weapon upgrades into the skill tree. This goes a long way toward eliminating FOMO during your first run.</p><p>You’ll upgrade weapons using Red Feathers, but these are a universal material that applies to any weapon when slotted into a mastery node. So, if you want to swap from longswords to axes, you can just respec your Red Feathers to that weapon type’s mastery nodes. And just like that, any axe you use will be sporting a mastery equivalent to however many Red Feathers you’ve invested. Want to go back? Just pop ‘em back in the longsword tree instead.</p><p>The same goes for magic, skills, and so forth. It’s so refreshing that I just might cry. Whew. Anyway, here’s how to make it all happen.</p><h2 id="h442637"><a id=""></a>How to respec in <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em></h2><p>When you’re ready to respec in <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>, head to the Impetus Repository at any shrine to access the game’s massive branching skill tree. You’ll see “Reset Points” at the bottom of the screen, so you’ll need to press the corresponding button on whichever node you’d like to refund.</p><figure id="" data-id="2d18f80c06b17423c9726c9fbcdbc620" data-recommend-id="image://2d18f80c06b17423c9726c9fbcdbc620" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a skill tree in Wuchang being reset." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows a skill tree in Wuchang being reset." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Leenzee / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2d18f80c06b17423c9726c9fbcdbc620" data-recommend-id="image://2d18f80c06b17423c9726c9fbcdbc620" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a skill tree in Wuchang being reset." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Find a node you want to refund, press the required button based on your platform of choice, then accept the prompt that shows up. Keep in mind that any nodes placed beyond that one will also be refunded, meaning you’ll lose access to any skills or upgrades from them, too. <strong>You can even refund all of your skill points by selecting this option at the large Starting Point node in the center of the tree</strong>.</p><p>As I mentioned previously, any Red Mercury Essence or upgrade materials you’ve used will be refunded in full, letting you improve the mastery of an entirely different weapon and redistribute your overall stats however you’d like. So, if you’re finding a specific weapon or build just isn’t working for you, dive in and try something else entirely. You can always go back to your old build later. What a cool game. </p><hr><p><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/wuchang-respec-skill-tree-red-mercury-feathers-essence-1851787254]]></content:encoded>

<p>Japanese developer ITL is returning to one of its DSiWare titles, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/handy-hockey">Handy Hockey</a>, and bringing it to the Switch 2 in just two days — on 31st July 2025 — for the bargain price of <strong>£5.00 / $7.00</strong>.</p>
<p>The original game launched as a DSiWare title back in 2010 and is a simple, neon-coloured air hockey game. However, it was exclusive to Japan. This version <em>looks</em> to be a polished-up version of the original, making it the first time it's available in the West.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://itl.ne.jp/Products/HandyHockey/en/">the official website</a>, ITL confirms the game is entirely playable in Mouse Mode, and players can take one Joy-Con 2 each and use the mice to play against one another. Even cooler, you can place the Switch 2 screen on the table and play the game as though it were a real air hockey table.</p>
<p>Up to four players can take part in a match, and the game will also run at 120fps, making it one of the first games on the system to reach that cap.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is now set to get an endgame revamp earlier than originally advertised, with Capcom having opted to chuck their established update plans for the next few months out of a window. Well, I say that, all they've really done is move around some bits.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-brings-hope-with-newly-lowered-pc-requirements-then-dashes-it-with-a-benchmark-tool">performance issues</a> have proven to be the main achilles heel of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action game</a> about hunning mons, the stuff you're left to do once you've slapped up Arkveld has been another source of player ire.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Capcom announced this change in plans via Twitter, outlining via both text and graphic that the "expansion of endgame content" they'd originally penned in for late September's title update three will now be dropping as part of August's version 1.021 update.</p>
<p>The latter update's also had its release date penned in for August 13th, 2025. As for what you can expect from this endgame embiggening, there'll be a new level of quest difficulty and a new rewards system for those quests which'll be based around "Talismans with random skill combinations". That's in addition to 1.021's weapon balance adjustments, which Capcom say "will cover more weapons than originally planned".</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>An update on release date and content of update Ver.1.021</p><p>The expansion of endgame content which was originally planned as part of Title Update 3 in late September will now be released ahead of schedule as part of the Ver.1.021 update. To accommodate this change, this update… <a href="https://t.co/aQF1oFMCFR">pic.twitter.com/aQF1oFMCFR</a></p></div>— Monster Hunter (@monsterhunter) <a href="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/1950139099160949156?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 29, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>The studio are also teasing some "other improvements and adjustments", so you may well not be out of luck if you're desperate for more performance tweaks. The ones the developers made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-two-aims-to-defeat-the-biggest-beasts-of-all-shader-compilation-and-vram-issues">late last month</a> do seem to have helped some players, but judging by the still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/latest-monster-hunter-wilds-update-aims-to-rally-the-steam-reviews-and-slay-the-wildest-monster-of-all-fomo">overwhemingly negative recent Steam reviews</a>, Wilds is still a ways from running as well as your hunter would have to if their Seikret were to suddenly take off without them.</p>
<p>Here's hoping that this Wilds update does bring the game a lot closer to what folks ideally want, because clearly the addition of water guns and swimwear as part of its <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1947814137326936487">summer update</a> hasn't quite gotten the entirety of the MonHun masses back on board.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-getting-an-endgame-expansion-ahead-of-schedule-as-capcom-keep-hunting-player-approval]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sony has announced the three monthly games coming to PS Plus in August, available for Premium, Extra, and Essential subscribers.</p>
<p>The three games, available from 5th August, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lies of P (PS4, PS5)</li>
<li>Day Z (PS4)</li>
<li>My Hero One's Justice 2 (PS4)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> is absolutely the biggest draw here, the popular Pinocchio-inspired soulslike from South Korean developer Round 8 Studio.</p>
<p>The game recently received a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-overture-difficulty-options">DLC expansion called Overture</a>, but presumably that's not included in this PS Plus offer.</p>

<p>Day Z is a post-apocalyptic survival game for up to 60 players online, while My Hero One's Justice 2 is a 3D arena fighter based on the My Hero Academia manga series.</p>
<p>Last month's games were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>, Jusant, and King of Fighters 15, so this is your last chance to download these games before 5th August.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s something acutely hilarious about <a href="https://medal.tv/games/peak/clips/kFOTIugoqZOAM6FMD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a video my friend Tyler clipped</a> when we played <em>Peak</em> for the first time. It’s him turning his camera to look for me, and in the distance you see me standing there looking up at the new, even more treacherous jungle terrain we have to scale. Over voice chat, I just go, “Oh <em>no</em>.” The phrase and flat affect escaping from my cherubic character’s mouth as my friend whip-pans his camera back to the terrain to reference what I’m looking at was completely improvised but seemed as taut as a scripted sequence in a movie. This is the most fun I’ve had in a game in a long time.</p><p><em>Peak </em>alchemizes several trends in gaming from the past few years, taking bits of the structure from other popular streamer-friendly multiplayer games like <em>Phasmophobia</em>, <em>Repo</em>, and <em>Lethal Company</em> and mixing them with the cartoony designs and environmental polish of titles like <em>Among Us</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em>. Undergirding all of this is two teams’ (<a href="https://landfall.se/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Landfall</a> and <a href="https://aggrocrab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aggro Crab</a>) talent with strong game writing, eye-popping art direction and clever mechanical choices, coming from scores of people who made both the goofy <em>Totally Accurate</em> simulator series as well as <em>Going Under</em>. Their combined forces have given players not just the ability to fail their way up (and very much down) a mountain, but also acts as a sandbox for their funniest impulses.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Peak</em> does a lot of clever heavy lifting with physics and the camera to make everything from players to items to the environment operate with the kinetic silliness of a cartoon. This creates a space for players to really fuck around, usually punctuated by a swift emphasis on finding out, whether it’s slipping on jellyfish, falling into a poison puffball, or throwing an item to watch it roll downhill. Truly, the best way forward in the game is to fail spectacularly, and when fully embraced, <em>Peak</em> becomes <em>America’s Funniest Home Videos</em>-levels of pranks, pratfalls, sabotaging and hubris.</p><p>Part of the game’s popularity on social media and places like Twitch does seem to come from that cooperatively funny gameplay but also how legible it is to an audience. Camera movement is tied to head and eye adjustments in a naturalistic way, meaning you can see what another player is looking at in real time. Useful teamplay features like little hand widgets for pinging the terrain, using handgrabs and hoisting other players up aid collaboration in a concrete visual way. Proximity-based voice chat that indicates distance between team members but is also animated on character’s faces, with basic lip flaps moving in time with what anyone is saying or looking at. It feels less like a survival game at times and more like if <em>Survivor</em> was populated by vtubers. Streamers have been making quick work at capturing the hilarity in real time, but you can have fun playing it without it being “for content.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Ludwig Crashes Out After Getting Tilted in Peak" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pPfJCgdxyaY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Even just my friend and I playing alone elicited so many funny moments involving cussing coming out of tiny scout mouths or dying unceremoniously, punctuated by the easy bantering back and forth that comes naturally to us after playing games together for nearly 10 years. The game is so well-designed for this kind of Laurel and Hardy relationship, even if no one will ever see it. It made me drift away from some of the cynicism I have around games seeking to create performance from content creators, rather than generating that impulse organically. What ultimately changed my mind is that <em>Peak</em>’s mechanics inspire teamwork as much as pranking your friends. It reminded me that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/adventure/bing-bong-is-talking-to-you-peak-players-are-getting-jump-scared-by-what-seems-to-be-the-developers-possessing-a-little-green-plushie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all adults love to play</a> and goof off, especially in the era when the spaces and frameworks we have for those things (especially in gaming) have largely been boxed into creating value for platforms.</p><p>Games are not always supposed to be fun, but I admire that games like <em>Peak</em> are leaning into that idea. The fact that there’s another gaming space that has a potential for communal mirth only makes me happier post-COVID, and I’ve become increasingly reliant on those things to bridge the gap in my social schedule when my friends all live far away. Spending hours messing up and laughing feels like a cathartic release for the kind of perfectionism a lot of the other games that I normally play demand from me—or perhaps what I demand from myself. When we do finally reach the goal, it feels so much the better.</p><figure><video controls="" src="https://lede-admin.aftermath.site/wp-content/uploads/sites/55/2025/07/O1Um84eEL94eptSQqdGVzA.mp4"></video><figcaption>Nico Deyo</figcaption></figure><p>In the age of <a href="https://aftermath.site/friendslop-peak-lethal-company-social-media-discourse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social media</a> and digital video, any video game can have the potential to be funny even if unintentional, from streamers getting hit by a boulder during their first time in <em>Dark Souls</em> to random clips of people wiping out in Mario Kart. What <em>Peak</em> does is create a framework for the old Mel Brooks maxim about <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/mel-brooks-film-excerpt-the-difference-between-comedy-tragedy-is/2585/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comedy and tragedy</a>, except the open sewer is instead a big rock. A game getting one over on us turns the experience from one of isolated frustration to a human moment where we’re all in on the joke.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/new-york-times-video-games-ai-nyt"><h3>The New York Times Will Never Learn</h3></a><p>We kept getting fed the same bullshit, and it’s being laundered in the same kind of stories</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/anime-manga-disney-jail-netflix-fragrant-flower"><h3>The World Is Conspiring Against Me Legally Experiencing The Fragrant Flower Blooms With Dignity</h3></a><p>The enshittification of manga and anime have reached absurd new heights, courtesy of Netflix and Kodansha’s collective bullshit.
