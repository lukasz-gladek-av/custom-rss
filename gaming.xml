		<p>Chucklefish and co-developer Robotality have announced that the magical life simulator has been delayed into 2026, so it will not be released this year as planned. However, it is not all bad news as an interactive map for the game’s location Mossport. You can check out an image of it below, or click through to the official website to check out the <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/map-of-mossport/">interactive Witchbrook map</a>.</p>



<p>Every colourful area on the Witchbrook map is a playable area, with locations including Shadhollow Forest, Parasol Sands, Mossport High Street, the Student Village, Shadbrook Cottage and, of course, Witchbrook College. In a blog post, Chucklefish stated what would come next in the Witchbrook development journey saying, <em>“The extra time we’re letting the cauldron bubble has opened the door to exploring a few additional exciting opportunities, including additional platforms and language support we hadn’t initially planned! More details on this as soon as we can share them. We’re hoping this glimpse at the map conveys the scale and variety of places you’ll be exploring in Witchbrook, when it releases next year! We’ll be sharing more development updates this side of the year with a blog focused on character customisation arriving in the next few weeks. Also word on the street is that there’s another&nbsp;<a href="steam://openurl_external/https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FWBOracle">The Witchbrook Oracle</a> already in the works. We can’t wait to share more.”</em></p>
<p>Witchbrook is set to release for PC, Nintendo Switch and Xbox consoles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Archetype Entertainment has shared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNkmV0gBClM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new EXODUS Founders Q&amp;A video</a>, which includes plenty new details about the game, and several new screenshots. Additionally, the game is now available for wishlisting on all major platforms: <a href="https://exodus.game/71y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://exodus.game/r3h" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, <a href="https://exodus.game/3us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://exodus.game/rbn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox</a>.</p>



<p>In the Founders Q&amp;A video, Studio Co-Founder &amp; General Manager Chad Robertson and Game Director Chris King answered several questions fielded by EXODUS fans. Regarding inspirations and influences, they admitted that Mass Effect was at the forefront for its deep narrative, branching choices, and continuity across sequels, but also mentioned Guerrilla's Horizon series for its elemental combat interactions and even Retro Studios' Metroid Prime when it comes to exploration, spatial puzzle solving, and the feeling of isolation.</p>



<p>When designing weaponry for the game, the studio employed the Swiss Army knife concept: Travelers don't have unlimited space for gear in their long voyages, so they must bring versatile multi-tools with them. For example, the so-called Recycler is both a salvage tool and a base gun. It can accept scavenged materials as ammo and transform for different purposes, giving players flexibility without managing many resources. </p>



<p>Archetype confirmed that stealth is a fully supported option in EXODUS. Players can stealth through encounters, go loud, or solve conflicts by talking. Ultimately, player agency was the studio's top priority, so multiple playstyles (including companions specialized for stealth and unique Aegis suits) are supported. In combat, players must observe, plan, and execute, but they must also often improvise as needed. Early game encounters will feature human factions and Celestial Constructs (robotic guardians of lost technology). After acquiring a spaceship, though, threats grow more complex and dangerous. For example, the 'Rot' is eventually introduced as a corrupting force for technology and the environment, not to mention a primary story antagonist affecting both enemies and planetary life.</p>



<p>As you would expect from a game inspired by Mass Effect, side quests were designed not to be filler missions. They deepen relationships with companions, offer skill upgrades, and enhance immersion in the universe of EXODUS. Protagonist Jun Aslan was created to be relatable, starting from modest origins and being initially unaware of their full potential. The studio aims for the player to see themselves in Jun. The protagonist's narrative progression will become more and more meaningful as their significance to humanity becomes clear.</p>

<p>At the heart of the story prepared by Archetype Entertainment there are powerful and mysterious Ancient Remnants artifacts. At first, Jun Aslan is driven to seek them to save their homeworld, but throughout the story, Jun will have to make difficult, morally complex decisions about their use. These moral choices are central and were written to be weighty, prompting reflection from the player's side.</p>



<p>It had been a while since we heard about EXODUS, following the debut of the first gameplay trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-looks-a-lot-like-mass-effect-in-the-first-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in December 2024</a>. However, the developers have promised more news and updates before the end of the year. We may see the game once again at The Game Awards: after all, <a href="https://wccftech.com/exodus-is-an-epic-sci-fi-rpg-from-bioware-vet-james-ohlen-features-matthew-mcconaughey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was first unveiled there in 2023</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As individual games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-servers-hit-capacity-at-launch-steam-charts-747k-players/">Battlefield 6</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-2-more-than-two-times-concurrent-players-on-steam-than-hades/">Hades 2</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-shatters-original-steam-user-record-within-minutes/">Hollow Knight Silksong</a> break their own personal concurrent player count records on Steam, Valve's platform keeps breaking its own total concurrent player count records. In September 2024, Steam <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-hits-all-time-record-38-3-million-pc-players/">surpassed 38.4 million concurrent players</a>, breaking all previous records. Now, it's exceeded that record high by three million players, surpassing <strong>41.6 million concurrent players</strong>.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.dsogaming.com/news/steam-has-hit-a-new-all-time-record-with-over-41-million-ccus/">DSOGaming</a>, it seems that a mix of Battlefield 6 having a stellar launch between concurrent player counts on Steam and units sold, paired with the last Steam Next Fest event of the year kicking up, and chart-topping regulars like DOTA 2 and Counter-Strike staying consistent all helped push the PC gaming platform to <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/">41,666,455 concurrent players, per SteamDB</a> on October 12.</p>



<p>Since breaking the record, the player count hasn't gotten back to 40 million, but after first reaching 41 million players <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/753/charts/#1y">earlier this year in March</a>, it shows how Steam numbers are staying consistent, and with big releases like Battlefield 6, are pushing past previous records, even with <a href="https://wccftech.com/newzoo-global-games-market-consoles-lead-growth-nintendo-switch-2/">analysts pointing towards console games as leading the video game industry's growth</a> in the near future.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see how the rest of the year's big releases continue to push concurrent player counts on Steam, and in the case of Battlefield 6, see if Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is able to match, if not best, the shooter series' major comeback. For more on Battlefield 6 ahead of Black Ops 7's launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-pc-performance-benchmarks-wreck-havoc-break-stuff-with-solid-performance-on-all-gpus/">you can check out our benchmarking tests to ensure you're playing at the best settings for your setup</a>. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-new-plants-vs-zombies-remastered-trailer-is-hard-to-watch.1325722/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When I hit play on EA’s new “deep dive” trailer for the upcoming <em>Plants vs Zombies Replanted,</em> I didn’t expect to be presented with a fake stream featuring two actors pretending to be hip and cool content creators playing the new remastered version of <a href="https://kotaku.com/plants-vs-zombies-viral-single-was-so-weird-people-th-1845453037">PopCap’s beloved tower defense game.</a> Yet that’s what this new trailer is. It’s so strange and cringey.</p> <p><a href="https://youtu.be/FTL_utrFfws">Announced earlier this year</a>, <em>Plants vs. Zombies Replanted</em> is a <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/plants-vs-zombies-replanted-interview-popcap/">4K remastered version of the original 2009 <em>PvZ</em></a> with some new content as well as bonus features like the co-op mode first seen in the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions. Think of it as the ultimate version of the popular game, which will finally be available on consoles and PC later this month. I’m very excited to replay <em>PvZ</em> after not touching the game for many, many years. But a new trailer from EA showing off <em>PvZ Replanted</em> nearly made me question my excitement for this remastered classic.</p>

 <p>Released on October 14, EA’s “Deep Dive Trailer” does indeed show off a lot of the upcoming <em>PvZ Replanted</em>, including a new perma-death mode and the return of all the minigames found in past ports. That’s great. What’s not great is that all of this information is, for some reason, delivered to us via two fake streamers playing the game on a fake stream, complete with fake chat and forced reactions. Here’s the trailer:</p>

  <p>Yeah, it’s pretty bad. After watching it the first time, I felt like it must have been nearly 10 minutes long, but it’s not even 4 minutes. It just felt so much longer. I guess hearing a fake streamer yell out “Spud Yeah!” can make you lose track of time.</p>

 <p>The comments below the trailer are, predictably, not positive, with many excited about the game but unsure why EA decided to market it this way. The top-voted comment simply states: “‘How do you do fellow kids’ trailer.”</p>

 <p>Yeah, teens and kids aren’t stupid. They’ll see right through this obvious corporate-approved attempt to recreate a Twitch stream in the most sanitized way possible, say “Cringe,” and move on. <em>PvZ</em> is good. Just show people how much better this version looks and some of the new features. That’s all you gotta do to get people on board. <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/plants-vs-zombies/plants-vs-zombies-replanted">The $20 price tag is also a great selling point</a> that this trailer fails to mention.</p> <p>Anyway, bad, cringey trailer aside, I’m still excited to play <em>Plants vs Zombies Replanted</em> when it arrives on consoles and PC on October 23.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Love them or, more likely, hate them, Minecraft's Creepers are now an iconic part of Mojang's beloved sandbox game. But the explosive creatures probably wouldn't be included today, the developer has said, if it were to design them from scratch now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking in a new developer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBTJIYzJDJw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> discussing game balance and fairness, chief creative officer Jens Bergensten said that Mojang now followed a strong principle when adding any new item, biome or enemy to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> that could cause players grief. In a nutshell, if anything causes the player to suffer, it should be because players brought it on themselves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We want to avoid treating players in a way that feels unfair," Bergensten said. "So we have this guiding principle that bad things [can] happen, but they're technically the players' fault. What we mean by that is either the player caused it, or the player had a chance to prevent it."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That means enemies have to feel fair — so players can choose to take them on if they want or have a decent chance of mitigating the danger if not. Situations that negatively impact a player should also never feel too random.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bergensten listed various examples of things that have been added in the past that haven't felt as fair as intended — such as Iron Golems protecting villages by attacking Creepers (and getting said villages blown up), or Endermen randomly stealing blocks that could have some pivotal signifiance (such as a painstakingly-built Redstone circuits).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This doesn't mean that Mojang won't add in tougher challenges, though the developer said it was now careful to make difficult content feel like something players were opting into — such as when actively making the choice to enter The End and take on the game's climactic Ender Dragon. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/15/the-biome-that-broke-minecraft-00-05-53-1760547479174.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Mojang chief creative officer Jens Bergensten. Image credit: Mojang.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But how about the Creeper? It can be encountered from the very beginning of the game, it can instantly kill players and destroy builds, and it sometimes feels like it appears at random. So why does it still exist like it does?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Even to this day, it's one of the monsters in gaming that I'm still a little bit afraid of," Bergensten admitted. "If you would follow the rules that we have today, we would probably not add the Creeper because it would actually be so controversial to have a monster just show up and destroy what you've built."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And yet? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The Creeper is very iconic though," Bergensten concluded — which is true enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>In a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/disney-dreamlight-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-563578">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a> showcase, Gameloft has shared new info on the cozy game's upcoming Wishblossom Ranch expansion, which introduces a selection of new characters, biomes, and gameplay features when it launches on November 19. Oh, and there are a <em>lot</em> of horses.</p><p>Today's Disney Dreamlight Valley showcase gave players a glimpse at the story they can expect to experience in the Wishblossom Ranch expansion, revealing that Cruella de Vil has taken control of the ranch and brought it to ruins with her villainy. At the same time, a giant flower beneath Wishblossom Ranch has been disturbed, causing wish magic to run rampant through the biomes. This expansion's tale will revolve around solving the mystery of the wish magic, as well as finding all of the missing horses that once inhabited the ranch and rebuilding it to its former glory.</p><p>Cruella de Vil isn't the only new villager coming in the expansion, though, as players will also get to befriend Tigger, Snow White, and Tinkerbell. They'll encounter these beloved Disney characters while exploring the expansion's new biome: the snow-covered Wishing Alps, Cruella-inspired Glamour Gulch, and oversized fauna-filled Pixie Acres. And as usual, each of these biomes features new critters to meet and feed, including geese, skunks, and adorable little bees.</p><p>Speaking of horses, Gameloft has confirmed that these majestic creatures will play a huge part in the Wishblossom Ranch expansion, both in terms of story progression and as rideable mounts. In addition to working with and riding horses from Disney films--such as Tangled, Mulan, and Hercules--you'll even be able to customize horses with a wide variety of flairs to make them uniquely your own.</p><p>The horse-related elements aren't exclusively about customization and leisurely rides, though. Horses also bring new ways to work around the valley, as they allow you to run through Night Thorns, Splinters of Fate, Inkies, and brand-new Dead Wish Blossoms to clear them away. And your horse can even stomp the ground to dig holes, hold a watering can to water your crops, and kick mining nodes to help you collect gems.</p><p>The good news doesn't stop at having a helping hand (hoof?) around the valley, either. Unlike previous expansions, which were split into multiple parts that released over the course of a year, Wishblossom Ranch will release all of its content on day one. This means all four villagers and the full story will be available right away, incentivizing players to get to work rebuilding Wishblossom Ranch at their own pace.</p><p>For existing players, the standard version of the Wishblossom Ranch expansion will come with 5,000 moonstones--the game's premium currency--while the Deluxe Edition will come with 10,000 moonstones, the Arendellian Riding Outfit and Snowy Alpine House Style cosmetic items, and an exclusive Sven mount from the film Frozen. And yes, Sven is rideable!</p><p>Meanwhile, new players can purchase a Wishblossom Ranch Edition of Disney Dreamlight Valley that comes with the base game and the expansion, or opt for the Ultimate Edition, which includes the base game, Wishblossom Ranch with all Deluxe Edition bonuses, and all previous expansions.</p><p>Lastly, anyone who purchases any version of Wishblossom Ranch between November 19 and December 3 will receive the Springtime Festival Outfit and Festival Tack cosmetic items for free.</p><p>Disney Dreamlight Valley's Wishblossom Ranch expansion launches November 19 for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and PC. We've also learned that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-dreamlight-valley-teases-cinderella-new-dreamteam-multiplayer-feature-and-2026-updates/1100-6535429/" data-ref-id="1100-6535429">Cinderella is coming to DDV</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outlast-trials/" data-ref-id="5000-505577">The Outlast Trials</a> has long been one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-horror-games/2900-4900/" data-ref-id="2900-4900">best horror games</a> to play, but in its next update, it's going to get even scarier. Coming in a patch on October 21, Invasion mode is adding an optional PvP mode to the game for the first time, and the way developer Red Barrels has designed it adds a ton of horror and paranoia to the experience.</p><p>As devoted players already know, the normally PvE co-op horror game can be disrupted by "impostors," NPC characters who appear on the map as violent doppelgangers. These impostors are caught somewhat easily by their tell-tale laughs--they don't easily fool experienced players, though their behaviors have grown more sophisticated since the game first launched. But Invasion mode is about to overhaul that element in a major way.</p><p>During Invasion rounds, an enemy team of up to four players can join a game as impostors, taking turns infiltrating the round while disguised as players on the other team and armed with a kitchen knife. When waiting to spawn in, impostors can spy on the other team using security cameras, while those players can break the cameras as a counter.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4585339-image%287%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4585339" data-ratio="0.55786163522013" data-width="1590" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4585339-image%287%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4585339"></a><figcaption>Invasion mode brings even more paranoia to a game that already loves toying with players' sense of safety.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4585339-image%287%29.png"></figure><p>It's the goal of the impostor team to sabotage the mission for the other side. Gone are the impostors' signature laughs that would give away the ruse, and impostors can even unlock a number of unique skills that will help them move faster, blend in better, and kill more efficiently. In the final moments of a round, all impostors are released onto the map, adding a final touch of chaos. In an added bit of fun, impostors can hear a moment of their victim's voice comms just before they kill them off, too.</p><p>I recently played a live preview of the mode and it was the scariest thing I've experienced in the game to date. At the same time, it was hilarious, in that "I'm so nervous, I'm laughing" sort of way. Each round of Invasion becomes fully enveloped in an air of paranoia. Even just working with another player on your team becomes an unnerving exercise. I didn't feel safe turning my back to my allies, because they may have been killers only wearing their face.</p><p>The mode looks like it'll be a hit for the horror game, and it comes alongside a bigger update that also adds an in-game shop, new missions, and the annual Halloween event, Geister. Twitch Drops are coming for the first time, too. All of these things come bundled in the October 21 game patch on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5.</p>

                <p>Nearly two years ago, Rockstar Games shared the first look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>, one of the most highly anticipated titles in the history of the video game industry. Since then, numerous analysts and gaming industry figures have speculated or openly wished for the game to be sold for $100 in order for other AAA games to reach the same price. Now, Saints Row design director Chris Stockman has shared his wish for GTA 6 to be $100 as well, but not for the same reason as some of his peers.</p><p>"They're the only ones that can get away with it," said Stockman during an interview with <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2025/10/saints-row-creator-interview-gta-vi" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Esports Insider</a> (via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-deserves-100-saints-row-director-insists/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>). "I don't think it's a rising tide that floats all boats. I think that [there will] be a tremendous amount of backlash if everyone switched to $100. Not all games are created equal. I think GTA is the only one that can get away with it, and I hope they do. I really hope it’s $100. I think it deserves to be $100. The scope and magnitude of this production deserves that price tag, but not everything is treated equally. It would be a disaster if everyone tried to match them."</p><p>Earlier this year, Wedbush Securities argued that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-100-could-reward-players-too-analysts-argue/1100-6529948/" data-ref-id="1100-6529948">selling GTA 6 at $100 could benefit players</a> by giving them a massive amount of in-game currency for GTA Online. Alinea Analytics' Rhys Elliott disagreed and said it was a bad idea because <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-doesnt-need-to-cost-100-because-gta-online-is-the-real-cash-cow-analyst-says/1100-6533731/" data-ref-id="1100-6533731">GTA Online is the real cash cow</a> of the franchise. Elliott also cited the rising cost of living as a primary reason not to charge players a higher price than the industry standard. Most of the newer AAA games are now going for $70.</p><p>Take-Two was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-defends-nba-2k21s-price-increase/1100-6482168/" data-ref-id="1100-6482168">among the first publishers to raise its prices from $60 to $70 back in 2020</a>. However, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-addresses-rumored-price-hike-for-grand-theft-auto-6/1100-6533788/" data-ref-id="1100-6533788">non-committal about raising prices</a> again during an investor call in August.</p><p>"We believe that any consumer experience is the intersection of the thing itself and what you paid for the thing," said Zelnick. "So our goal is to vastly exceed expectations. We want to put out the best entertainment on Earth, and we want to deliver more value than what we charge for it. We think we've generally speaking, gotten that right."</p><p>Grand Theft Auto 6 will hit PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on May 26, 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Just the endless recycling of fashion trends from 20-odd years ago, the PSP is having something of a spiritual resurgence in 2025. We always knew that Sony’s handheld was incredibly influential – fundamentally, its feature set was folded into every mobile phone on the planet – but a console can’t exist without iconic software to go with it.</p>
<p>We’ve recently seen Sony’s one-eyed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/10/patapon-12-replay-review-rhythm-action-repeat/">Patapon</a> return to screens (and their spiritual successors, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/10/ratatan-early-access-review-rhythm-action-warfare-is-the-best-kind-of-warfare/">Ratatan</a>), and now it’s the turn of blocks that drop. Lumines was one of the most important block-dropping games of its time, standing as a Sony exclusive take on a Tetris-style experience, and now, Enhance are returning to the series with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/lumines-arise">Lumines Arise</a>, fresh from their masterful sojourn into spinning different-shaped blocks for Tetris Effect.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lumines Arise - Exclusive Preview | PS5, Steam" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ilo5NSlpDfw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Lumines is a block-dropping game where timing and the passage of time are key to achieving a high score. The Timeline passes across the screen over and over again, and each time it does, it wipes, or collects all of the 2×2 blocks you’ve created by spinning and dropping the falling blocks into place. Doing this over and over again,will increase your combo, while also keeping you alive as the blocks start to stack up, and it becomes increasingly tricky to manoeuvre.</p>
<p>You can make those blocks bigger and bigger, combining 2×2 shape together, creating 3×3 blocks for an even bigger score, or chaining scores together by having them drop into place just as you clear other blocks. It’s beautifully simplistic, riffing on Tetris’ original block-dropping gameplay, and making it into something more modern and visually exciting.</p>


<p>So far, that’s all as true for the original Lumines as it is for Arise, but the team at Enhance have built on their work on Tetris Effect to maximise the audio-visual experience, while also making a few changes to the moment-to-moment gameplay. The newest addition is Burst. Entering Burst sees blocks of the opposite colour jumping to the top of the playing field, giving you further opportunity to grow a single huge Burst block, with the other coloured blocks continuing to leap out of the way as it grows. Not only will it earn you even more points, it’s a great last-ditch way to try and survive the impending doom of a full screen, adding an exciting extra wrinkle for players to iron out.</p>
<p>Lumines Arise is all very Tetris Effect, which was, in turn, very much Tetris by way of Lumines. At this point, it’s practically block-dropping inception, but all you really need to know is that Enhance are masters of this genre and style, and Lumines Arise is the next step on that audio-visual pathway.</p>
<p>Lumines Arise responds to your gameplay with more feeling, more emphasis, than ever before. Blocks pulsate, breathe, or beat, while your controller throbs, rumbles and thumps in time. It makes you feel like you’re part of the musical track, rather than an observer, and for all that there are moments of frantic, abject terror at losing your streak and failing a level, this is an experiential game that needs to be played and taken part in, rather than simply spoken about.</p>

<p>Much like Tetris Effect, Lumines Arise looks spectacular. The visuals make this feel like a simple block-dropping game that’s come to life, that’s been inhabited by the very spirit of the music that accompanies it. Nothing is still; nothing is permanent, apart from your score and the frame of the gameboard. It’s a perfect juxtaposition of minimalism and maximalism, contained in one screen.</p>
<p>That would all be for nothing, if the soundtrack wasn’t good. Based on our early hands-on, this boasts the same mixture of progressive emotional dance music as Tetris Effect, and even if it’s not necessarily your genre, you can’t help but feel something while you’re playing. Soaring vocals, swelling soundscapes, all fit perfectly with the distinct thump of the drumbeat. It changes and evolves with every level and area, constantly shifting your attention, and the feel of the game, even while you’re performing the same fundamental task throughout.</p>
<p>It’s incredible how a shift in change, colour and tone can alter how the game feels. Circular pulsating shapes within the blocks feel completely different to the cold, harsh lines of straight-edged blocks, and they perform differently when they connect. One early level sees tiny astronauts appearing within the constructed block, floating off into space when the Timeline passes, and it’s hard not to be awe-struck and utterly put off at points. That will probably lessen with time, but, I have to say, I hope it doesn’t.</p>
<p>Pulling on that musical thread, once you’ve worked your way through Journey mode, you can take all of the tracks and create your own playlist. This is a perfect way to curate your own experience, and you can even watch the computer play while you just listen to the music by selecting Theater Mode.</p>

<p>There’s also multiplayer. Here you can compete side by side against other players, with Burst Mode coming in both ranked and custom flavours, while you can also fight your way to the top of the global leaderboards. This wasn’t active in our preview build, and I can’t wait to face off against some other players to see how I fare after years of playing Lumines. Probably not as well as I think I will.</p>
<p>Customisation comes in the form of your avatar, the Loomi. This diminutive floating fella is your in-game representative, and you can spend any Pon you earn while playing on customising them to make them truly unique amongst the other Loomi. It’s all random though, utilising the Loomi-Pon Rubiks-style cube to spit out a random cosmetic. If you want to get your avatar looking just right, you might have to play for a quite a while. Based on our hands-on, that shouldn’t be a problem.</p>
<p>Lumines Arise is the next evolutionary step in Enhance’s journey through audio-visual gaming. Once again, it builds on a framework that’s instantly comprehensible, but layers in an evocative set of visuals alongside some of the most compelling audio design you’ll find. Is Lumines Arise already essential? We won’t have long to find out, with the game set to release for PC and PS5, with PC VR and PSVR 2 support, on 11th November.</p>

<p>Serving up on Kickstarter</p>

<figure data-uuid="5278cd6ac7f6f"><a title="Paper Plates" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5278cd6ac7f6f/paper-plates.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/legendscookbook.jobjobllc.com/post/3m3ampcvlrs2c">JobJobLLC</a></em></figcaption></figure><p>We've seen a fair few game-inspired cookbooks in our time, though few have looked quite as delicious as Paper Plates, a newly-revealed recipe book that's absolutely rammed with <strong>Paper Mario</strong> sweetness.</p>
<p>This one comes from JobJobLLC, the team behind the Zelda-inspired culinary venture '<a href="https://jobjobllc.com/collections/cookbooks/products/the-legends-cookbook-reprint">The Legend's Cookbook</a>', and '<a href="http://brawlinthefamily.keenspot.com/">Brawl in the Family</a>' artist Matthew Taranto. It promises 35 recipes, all with a Paper Mario twist, and enough of the series' iconic art stylings that you'd assume it's been plucked from the backdrop of an unassuming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">Thousand-Year Door</a> locale.</p>
<p>The book recently launched on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/437762268/paper-plates-a-fan-made-cookbook-inspired-by-paper-mario">Kickstarter</a>, where it hopes to raise $35,000 (around £26,000) by 15th November to make its dishy dreams a reality. It's already almost halfway there (and that's after just one day), with some pretty appealing Backer Rewards from a hardcover copy of the book to a denim overalls-esque apron — we're particularly fond of the idea of the latter.</p>
<p>While the adorable aesthetic was enough to draw us in, the recipes themselves look super appetising. Every dish has a pinch of Paper Mario to it too, so if the likes of Honey Shrooms or Checkerboard Cookies sound up your street, you're in luck.</p>

<p>Naturally, all of this is dependent on Paper Plates hitting its Kickstarter goal in the coming weeks, so be sure to keep an eye out for updates on its fundraising page if the mere idea has already got your mouth a-watering.</p>

<p>Sonic Rumble, after multiple delays, will finally release in November on mobile devices and PC.</p>

Meant to capitalize on the Fall Guys trend, Sonic Rumble lets fans play as their favorite Sonic characters and duke it out with friends in speedy mini-games. Early tests went well, but the game saw <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-rumble-delayed-yet-again-by-sega/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a few delays</a> this year and last. Now, it seems it has finally&nbsp;landed on a release window, as well as addressed some fan feedback.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/en/news/000209/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blog post</a>, as well as <a href="https://youtu.be/_FP6XoAMZYA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a new trailer</a>, the team announced that Sonic Rumble will release in November. No exact date was given outside of the month. The game is expected to release on Steam, Google Play, and the Apple App Store. In the trailer, we see all our favorite Sonic characters like Shadow and Cream, as well as a pack dedicated to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sonic-3-is-the-second-highest-grossing-video-game-movie-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a>. We get a look at some of the game modes and the intense 32-player gameplay. The video also teased future costumes and members like Excalibur Sonic and Wave from Sonic Riders. </p>



<p>The team also took feedback from fans who joined Sonic Rumble’s early tests. As for what’s being changed, the progression and rewards system is being simplified and fine-tuned.

The game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2017/09/01/stardew-valley-publisher-teases-upcoming-39-stardew-valley-meets-harry-potter-39-game.aspx">first teased way back in 2017</a>, was slated to release this winter.</p><p>Witchbrook has been described as a mix of Stardew Valley and Harry Potter, placing players in the shoes of an aspiring witch/wizard who is a new resident in the magical city of Mossport, where they attend Witchbrook College. Here, players can form friendships, engage in romantic relationships, and interact with citizens who have fully fleshed-out daily schedules and lives. As a student at Witchbrook, you’ll attend classes, complete assignments, and sharpen your spellcasting and potion-making skills to become top of your class.</p><p>Outside of classes, you can freely explore Mossport to engage in activities such as starting a business, renovating your home, and more leisurely excursions. As the school year progresses, Mossport and its residents change throughout the seasons. Witchbrook can also be played with others in four-player online co-op.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TIKSGazNOqg"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TIKSGazNOqg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Witchbrook is an ambitious game, and developer Chucklefish <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/development-update/">posted a developer update</a> stating that, despite making good progress en route to launching this year, the team realized it needs more time to ensure Witchbrook lives up to its years-long hype.</p><p>“Witchbrook is a big project – and it’s taking shape exactly as we hoped; full of charm, depth and detail! In our first blog, we shared our goal to create a living, breathing world for you to explore, and as we bring all those elements together, we’re taking the time needed to ensure the world feels rich, immersive, and alive,” reads Chucklefish’s statement.</p><p>The developer update also revealed the game’s world map. Chucklefish also says a silver lining of the delay is that it allows them to explore the possibility of bringing Witchbrook to more platforms. The game is currently slated to launch on Xbox, PC, and was <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/03/27/the-magically-cozy-life-sim-witchbrook-comes-to-switch-this-holiday">recently confirmed for Switch</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/04/02/from-silksong-to-elden-ring-heres-every-third-party-game-from-the">Switch 2</a>. The team is also looking to add additional language support and promises more developer updates in the future, including a blog post focused on character customization.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/15/wizarding-life-sim-witchbrook-delayed-to-2026]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Workers on Blizzard’s Battle.net platform have voted to unionize under the Communications Workers of America. The nearly 400 workers under Blizzard Entertainment's Platform and Technology department have created two new unions: one for software engineers, product and project managers, designers, and others; and a second for localization, quality assurance, and customer support.</p><p>The unit made up of Battle.net's tech workers has roughly 300 members, and the localization, QA, and customer support unit has around 80 members. The decision to split the unit into two instead of a single union was "mutually agreed" to by both Microsoft and CWA, according to a CWA spokesperson.</p><p>Microsoft has recognized the units after workers voted by signing union authorization cards and voting through an online portal. The Platform and Technology workers squeezed in their vote ahead of the expiration of <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/2022/06/13/cwa-microsoft-announce-labor-neutrality-agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft and CWA's neutrality agreement</a> this week, which was signed in 2022 when Microsoft was looking to finalize its $68.7 billion <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/source/2022/01/18/microsoft-to-acquire-activision-blizzard-to-bring-the-joy-and-community-of-gaming-to-everyone-across-every-device/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a>. The neutrality agreement gave game workers at the company a more streamlined process for unionizing and meant that the voting units under Microsoft did not have to go through the National Labor Relations Board's process, making things quicker.</p><p>Unions existed under Activision Blizzard before the neutrality agreement, like at <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/12/02/wow-diablo-blizzard-albany-union/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blizzard Albany</a>, but a bunch more have formed since its signing. The teams that work on <a href="https://aftermath.site/wow-activision-union-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>World of Warcraft</em></a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/diablo-union-activision-blizzard-microsoft-cwa-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Diablo</em></a>, <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/overwatch-game-developers-secure-union-recognition-communications-workers-america" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Overwatch</em></a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/blizzard-union-story-franchise-cwa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story and franchise development</a>, and <a href="https://www.austinchronicle.com/screens/austin-workers-unionize-at-game-studio-blizzard-13286381/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quality assurance</a> all unionized into separate units. The neutrality agreement did not mean Microsoft or Activision Blizzard <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-zenimax-cwa-union-contract-negotiations-strike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supported</a> unions, but that they didn’t interfere in their formation. It's not immediately clear how unionization efforts will fare without such an agreement, or if a new agreement will be signed.</p><p>Daniel Weltz, a principal software engineer who's worked at Blizzard for almost 20 years, told Aftermath that seeing the <em>World of Warcraft</em> team unionize was a turning point for him. "Even just the fact that <em>World of Warcraft </em>organized first, the biggest and most profitable team, gave a big push that made us think, 'we could do this too,'" he said.&nbsp;</p><p>The Platform and Technology department unions had the support of the other Microsoft and Activision Blizzard unions behind them, too. Blizzard senior software engineer Chris Myles, who's been at the company for 18 years, said several of the organizing committees across the company met to "compare notes" and "share what worked and what didn't." He continued, "We also had an organizing committee summit to get together to discuss where we are and where we’re going."</p><p>From here, the Platform and Technology unions will negotiate with Microsoft and Activision Blizzard on their first contracts. Just two unions under Microsoft and Activision Blizzard have completed negotiations: <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/raven-software-workers-secure-first-contract-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raven Software</a>, which announced its QA union in 2022, ratified a contract in August, while ZeniMax Media QA workers, who unionized in 2023, <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-union-contract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached a tentative contract agreement in May</a>. Both had been in negotiations for years.</p><p>Alex Kohn, a senior data scientist at Blizzard Entertainment, said he's looking to negotiate for "policies regarding layoffs and [return-to-office.]" Myles added that watching his long term colleagues get pushed out of Blizzard because of <a href="https://aftermath.site/activision-workers-speak-out-against-return-to-office-mandate-that-they-see-as-soft-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">return-to-office policies</a> is what moved him to get involved in the union. He said that "more equitable treatment of QA and [customer service]" is a priority, too. "The industry always treats the majority of QA and CS like they’re a separate entity, when in fact, we work very closely with them and we can’t really do our jobs without them," he said.</p><p>Aftermath has reached out to Microsoft for comment.</p><p>"We’re past having to wonder what happens if we don’t succeed," Myles said. "I got that question from multiple people—what happens if we don’t get the results that we want? Do we take another swing at it or do we give up? We don’t have to confront those questions anymore."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bus-bound-demo"><h3>Look Out, I’m The Bus</h3></a><p>The Bus Bound demo is pretty fun</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hasan-piker-dog-collar-kaya-nontroversy-twitch"><h3>I Can’t Believe We’re Still Talking About This</h3></a><p>CollarGate is one of the internet's dumbest psychosis events yet</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-party-wooooooo"><h3>We’re Throwing A Party, And You’re Invited</h3></a><p>Celebrate our two-year anniversary with us!</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-assassins-creed-reconstruction-ubisoft"><h3>Everything Is Assassin’s Creed</h3></a><p>"You can look at 15-ish games at this point and watch, nearly yearly, the progression toward the world we live in today"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/battle-net-workers-unionize-blizzard-entertainment-cwa]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-rog-xbox-ally-x-receives-glowing-reviews-but-its-still-pretty-pricey.1325641/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="f637b568ebc0f"><a title="ROG Xbox Ally X" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f637b568ebc0f/rog-xbox-ally-x.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Microsoft/ASUS</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ahead of its release on <strong>16th October 2025</strong> (yes, tomorrow), the ROG Xbox Ally X has received a whole bunch of reviews, and it sounds like this thing might be the new king of PC handhelds.</p>
<p>Heck, at <strong>£799 / $999</strong>, you'd hope so, wouldn't you?</p>
<p>We're going to highlight the review over at <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/reviews/rog-xbox-ally-x-an-amazing-handheld-pc-with-plenty-of-console-like-potential">Pure Xbox</a> first and foremost, with the team calling the Ally X a "superb PC handheld with outstanding ergonomics, terrific cooling and natural-feeling controls for Xbox fans". Criticisms include the lack of an OLED screen (welcome to the club), a few software frustrations, and the lack of a trackpad for mouse controls.</p>
<p>All in all though, with a score of 9/10, it sounds pretty great.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:189623 @ 1760550593 -->
<p>The folks over at IGN were similarly positive with another <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review">9/10 review</a>, going so far as to call the Ally X a potential "device for the history books", providing it receives a few software updates.</p>
<p>So it sounds like the Ally X is the PC handheld to beat right now, eclipsing the Steam Deck in raw power, but also commanding a hefty price tag to boot. The standard Xbox Ally is a bit cheaper at <strong>£499 / $599</strong>, but even this is a big ask these days.</p>
<p>It makes the Switch 2 look like somewhat of a bargain by comparison, priced at <strong>£395.99</strong> in the UK and <strong>£449.99</strong> in the US. Yes, it's not as powerful, but you're getting a true console experience with the Switch 2, not to mention the plethora of incredible first-party games that simply won't be available elsewhere.</p>
<p>We do like the Ally X though, and who knows, maybe we'll wind up getting one at some point down the line. Right now, however, the price is just a little bit steep for us, and it's clear that this thing has a very specific target audience in mind.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:185922,192339 @ 1760549406 -->

            <p>If you've been looking forward to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/witchbrook">Witchbrook</a>, your broomstick's going to have to stay grounded for a little bit longer. Developers Chucklefish have opted to push the cosy magic schooler's release from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/magic-school-stardew-like-witchbrook-gets-its-first-proper-trailer">this winter</a> to 2026. At the same time, they've put out an interactive map offering the first proper look at its setting, Mossport.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>A <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/development-update/">blog post</a> seemingly penned by a pair of socks said the "difficult decision" to delay has been made "despite great development progress this year". "Witchbrook is a big project – and it’s taking shape exactly as we hoped; full of charm, depth and detail," they continued. "In our first blog, we shared our goal to create a living, breathing world for you to explore, and as we bring all those elements together, we’re taking the time needed to ensure the world feels rich, immersive, and alive."</p>
<p>Further on in the post, pushing back the date's also teased to have "opened the door to exploring a few additional exciting opportunities, including additional platforms and language support", with more info on those promised soon.</p>
<p>Aside from that, there's the <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/map-of-mossport/">interactive map</a>, which you can open up and click around to get an idea of the distances you'll have to run (or fly on a broomstick, per the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/5-things-i-demand-from-witchbrook-chucklefishs-new-magical-stardew-like">wishes of Alice B</a>) between the spring festival and Shadhollow Forest. Or how feasible a post-class trip to the Parasol Sands beach will be.</p><p>If it is, maybe you can use magic to overcome that issue. After all, what's the point in living with the stuff if you can't use it to get rid of life annoying's quirks, such as the need to use your legs. Then, you can chop off your legs and lob them in some potion which grants you uber-fast spectral legs. You could also hope that the entire map's on the slope of a hill, so you can hop in your cauldron and roll from place to place like a sentient boulder.</p>
<p>You've now got a bit more time to choose between all of those options, some of which probably won't be in the actual game. The cauldron rolling better be there though.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98gta-6-deserves-to-be-100%E2%80%99-saints-row-director-insists-%E2%80%98not-all-games-are-created-equal%E2%80%99.1325626/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Everyone is waiting patiently to see what Grand Theft Auto 6, Rockstar Games’ next open-world epic, will be priced at. For the longest time, the belief has been that the game will be priced at a whopping $100 for the standard edition, and the divisive potential price point has split the community down the middle.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, one of the creators of Saints Row spoke about Grand Theft Auto 6 and insisted that Take-Two and Rockstar Games can charge what they want for what might be the biggest game ever made.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-gta-6-push-the-pricing-boundaries">Will GTA 6 Push The Pricing Boundaries?</h2>



<p>If there’s one game that can ‘get away with’ a $100 price tag, it’s probably Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>



<p>That’s what Chris Stockman, Design Director on the first Saints Row game, insisted in a recent exclusive <a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2025/10/saints-row-creator-interview-gta-vi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with Esports Insider</a>. When asked about the <strong>potential </strong>for Grand Theft Auto 6 to emerge with a $100 price point (and likely more for a special edition), Stockman offered his two cents:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>They’re the only ones that can get away with it.</p>



<p>I don’t think it’s a rising tide that floats all boats. I think that there’ll be a tremendous amount of backlash if&nbsp;everyone switched to $100. Not all games are created equal. I think GTA is the only one that can get away with it, and I hope they do. I really hope it’s $100. I think it deserves to be $100.</p>



<p>The scope and magnitude of this production deserves that price tag, but not everything is treated equally. It would be a disaster if everyone tried to match them.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Stockman revealed that Grand Theft Auto 3, released in 2001, was so awe-inspiring that it opened his eyes to the possibilities of gaming. In his words, he believed it was ‘the future of games’. Five years later, he’d play a pivotal role in bringing Saints Row, a solid GTA competitor, to the market.</p>



<p>It was predicted in July that GTA 6 will make <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-make-7-billion-two-months-analyst-predict/">an eye-watering <strong>$7 billion</strong></a><strong> </strong>within two months when it’s released in May 2026. These unprecedented predictions are based on the expectation that GTA 6 will be the fastest-selling game in history. It will easily surpass anything made to date.</p>



<p>Do you think GTA 6 could get away with a $100 price point? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

Over the last few months, <em>Sonic Rumble</em> has seriously evolved, with every single change aimed at making your experience better.

A super smooth, intense, and incredibly fun game right from the jump.</p><p>We took feedback directly from our Early Rumblers and have made major improvements in three key areas:</p><ul><li><strong>Building a Deeper, More Dynamic Core</strong> – We added some awesome features that boost the competitive play. Use iconic skills to obstruct your opponents, and join a Crew with your friends to participate in time-limited events and earn extra rewards. Plus, we added a ton of new stages and new game modes, to keep the arcade royale chaos always at its peak.</li><li><strong>Refining and Streamlining the Journey</strong> – We completely revamped the new player onboarding journey to get new Rumblers into the <a title="Genres > Action [3,127 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> faster. We also drastically improved the user interface by putting all mission and achievement-related tasks into one easy-to-navigate hub, so you spend more time playing and less time searching.</li><li><strong>Improving Progression and Rewards</strong> – We carefully updated and simplified the cosmetic and character progression systems, making sure every unlock feels meaningful and impactful, while making upgrades less of a chore. We also fine-tuned the game’s rewards and shop systems to create a clear, generous, and exciting progression path for all players. This even included expanding the score ranks and simplifying certain achievements to make every accomplishment feel like a celebrated win.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->

Global launch times for Ninja Gaiden 4 have been officially confirmed, and if you're in the US, you won't have to worry too much about FOMO during working hours because the game will go live toward the later part of the day on October 20.</p><p>For the middle part of the world, those times translate to a <em>very </em>early launch on October 21, so if you're in London or Paris, at least you can wake up and start playing right away if you preloaded the game. Here's a quick breakdown of the exact Ninja Gaiden 4 launch times across the globe. As a reminder, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/game-pass-adding-these-12-games-soon/2900-7116/" data-ref-id="2900-7116">Ninja Gaiden 4 will also be a day-one release for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>.</p><h2>Ninja Gaiden 4 release times</h2><h3>Monday, October 20, 2025</h3><ul><li>5 PM PT</li><li>6 PM CST</li><li>8 PM ET</li><li>11 PM CST</li></ul><h3>Tuesday, October 21, 2025</h3><ul><li>1 AM BST</li><li>2 AM CEST</li><li>9 AM KST</li><li>9 AM JST</li><li>11 AM AEDT</li><li>1 PM NZDT</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4585662-ninja-gaiden-4-release-times.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4585662" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4585662-ninja-gaiden-4-release-times.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4585662"></a><figcaption>Ninja Gaiden 4 global release times</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4585662-ninja-gaiden-4-release-times.jpg"></figure><h2>Ninja Gaiden 4 preloading times and install sizes</h2><p>Ninja Gaiden 4 should be a relatively quick download--depending on your home internet connection--as sizes range from 36.82GB on Xbox Series X|S consoles to 54.9GB on PC. PS5 users can expect the smallest download here, as the game clocks in at 23.55GB in size. These are just the install sizes, and they're likely to change with any potential updates or future patches. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-preorders-are-live-supports-play-anywhere-on-xbox-and-pc/1100-6532333/" data-ref-id="1100-6532333">Ninja Gaiden 4 preorders are still live</a> and come with several bonuses.</p><p>Following the release of Ninja Gaiden 2 Black and Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound earlier this year, Ninja Gaiden 4 follows Ryu Hayabusa and a new protagonist, Yakumo, as they explore the underworld of Tokyo. "Ninja Gaiden 4 is shaping up to be a fun reunion for series veterans, as well as a great entry point for newcomers," Jessica Cogswell wrote <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-is-the-ninja-gaiden-game-youre-hoping-it-will-be/1100-6533763/">in her preview of the game</a>. "Ninja Gaiden 4 is whatever style of Ninja Gaiden you want it to be."</p><p>While the series has a reputation for being challenging, this new entry in the franchise looks like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-could-be-the-easiest-or-toughest-game-in-the-series-to-date/1100-6535013/">it could be the most approachable yet</a> thanks to several accessibility options. If you're looking to breeze through the storyline and feel like a master ninja, you can tone down the difficulty for your playthrough, or if you're feeling masochistic, you can dial it up to a sadistic level that's designed to feel purposefully unfair.</p>

                <p>Late last month, Electronic Arts confirmed that it had struck <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/" data-ref-id="1100-6535078">a $55 billion deal</a> to go private under new ownership including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and the private equity firm Silver Lake. There are a lot of unanswered questions about what this means for EA and the industry at large, but now two US Senators are raising the potential "foreign influence" Saudi Arabia could enact with EA under its control.</p><p>Senators Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren--both of whom are Democrats--co-authored a letter to EA CEO Andrew Wilson and Department of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent about whether Saudi Arabia will take over EA's editorial independence if the deal is approved. As reported by <a href="https://www.404media.co/senators-warn-saudi-arabias-acquisition-of-ea-will-be-used-for-foreign-influence/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">404 Media</a>, they also suggested that Saudi Arabia's ownership may rise to the level of a "national security" risk.</p><p>"The deal's potential to expand and strengthen Saudi foreign influence in the United States is compounded by the national security risks raised by the Saudi government's access to and unchecked influence over the sensitive personal information collected from EA's millions of users, its development of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, and the company's product design and direction."</p><p>Saudi Arabia's PIF has spent a lot of money to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-gaming-companies-saudi-arabia-owns-or-has-invested-in/2900-7081/" data-ref-id="2900-7081">invest in multiple video game companies</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saudi-arabia-is-now-nintendos-largest-outside-investor/1100-6511622/" data-ref-id="1100-6511622">including Nintendo</a>. The country also struck a 12-year pact with the IOC to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2025-olympic-esports-games-will-be-held-in-saudi-arabia/1100-6524936/" data-ref-id="1100-6524936">bring the Olympic Esports to Saudi Arabia</a> for multiple events. Saudi Arabia has been accused of numerous human rights violations as well as the 2018 assassination of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Investing in video game companies and other diversified holdings has been interpreted as a way for the country to whitewash its image on the international stage.</p>

            <p>
Halloween season is well and truly upon us, and there's plenty of spookiness to be found in Sony newly unveiled October additions to its PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium catalogue, including developer Bloober's stellar <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake and the slightly less stellar remake of Until Dawn.
</p>
<p>
These and more - including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/yakuza-like-a-dragon">Yakuza: Like a Dragon</a> - join PlayStation's Premium and Extra tiers from Tuesday, 21st October, with the full line-up as follows:
</p>
<h3>PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium</h3>
<ul>
<li>Silent Hill 2 (PS5)</li>
<li>Until Dawn (PS5)</li>
<li>V Rising (PS5)</li>
<li>Yakuza: Like a Dragon (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Poppy Playtime: Chapter 1 (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>As Dusk Falls (PS5, PS4)</li>
<li>Wizard with a Gun (PS5)</li>
</ul>
<h3>PlayStation Plus Premium:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Tekken 3 (PS5, PS4)</li>
</ul>
<p>
So you go! Halloween highlights obviously include the aforementioned Silent Hill 2 remake - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">got the five star review treatment from Eurogamer</a> last year - alongside the rather more divisive do-over of developer Supermassive's brilliant 2015 interactive horror Until Dawn. The original, incidentally, turned ten this year, and we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-at-10-how-supermassive-overcame-sony-scepticism-and-used-the-science-of-fear-to-make-a-modern-horror-classic">delved deep into the fascinating story of its development back in August</a> if you'd like to learn how it came to be.
</p><p>
Also on the spooky front is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/poppy-playtime">Poppy Playtime</a>: Chapter 1, alongside hugely enjoyable vampire survival game V: Rising. But if you're not in the mood for ghosts and ghoulies, there's acclaimed interactive drama in As Dusk Falls, enjoyable RPG action in Yakuza: Like a Dragon, and twin stick shooter chaos with Galvanic Games' Wizard with a Gun. And for Premium subscribers, there's classic fighting action, courtesy of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-3">Tekken 3</a>.
</p>
<p>
As a reminder, all the above don't arrive until next Tuesday, 21st October, meaning you've still got some time to focus on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-our-ps-plus-extra-and-premium-games-for-september">last month's PlayStation Plus Premium and Extra additions</a> before your attention is yanked elsewhere.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>What a crazy crossover event Ball X Pit is! Who could have foreseen the rotund, spherical ball franchise matching up so well with a great big hole IP? Well, golfers, I suppose. In all seriousness, Ball X Pit is a melding of so many genres and games that the titular ball and the pit feel like the nominal components here, with solo developer Kenny Sun having crafted one of the best arcade roguelite crossovers we’ve ever seen.</p>
<p><iframe title="BALL X PIT – Release Date Trailer – Nintendo Switch &amp; Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/npSBksOTz8c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You’re a treasure hunter, out to delve into the depths of The Pit, bracing yourself to fight off hordes of monsters on your way towards a huge boss. What does that mean in terms of gameplay? Your character fires a steady stream of balls to cause damage, projectiles bouncing around the arena like a riff on Breakout or Arkanoid, and you’re left thinking about angles, avoiding arrows and ice spears, while collecting experience gems from the fallen.</p>


<p>Here’s where it gets interesting. You can carry up to four special ball types. These range from balls that cause bleeding or inflict poison, to slow and ultra-powerful types, or ones that cause lightning to arc between enemies. As you progress, you’ll find Fusion drops alongside the experience gems, and these can do various things to your special loadout. Fission will upgrade them, by up to two levels, increasing damage or area of effect, while Fusion can happen between two, fully levelled special balls, amping them up and combining their effects into one ball.</p>
<p>Evolution is what you’re really looking for. Certain ball types can be combined through evolution into hybrids, gaining additional effects, and making your chances of success even higher. The thing is, you really have to plan ahead, and Ball X Pit isn’t necessarily the kind of game to allow you to do that.</p>


<p>There is a frantic pace to Ball X Pit, though you do have some control over that, with a speed control that’s been nabbed from an RTS. The oncoming hordes that move down the screen are insatiable, and the start of each foray into the Pit is generally balanced on a knife-edge, and it’s that which makes planning ahead difficult. You have three choices each time you level up, but you are still at the mercy of a random drop, so having specific builds in mind is all well and good, but you might have to abandon them in the heat of the moment, and hope that something good comes your way next.</p>
<p>Ball X Pit is a roguelite. Each run into the Pit earns your character experience, permanently levelling their stats, and gaining various other boons along the way, making it more likely that you can tackle the increasingly difficult levels as you descend further.</p>
<p>Ball X Pit throws a swift curveball into this mix, with the way it deals with your ongoing growth. Outside of the Pit, you work on building a settlement on the surface. This hub plays host to the housing for each of your characters, buildings that offer permanent upgrades that carry across all of your team, and then forests, fields and boulders that you use to accrue the resources to build and expand further.</p>

<p>This in itself is a unique addition to the formula, but then Ball X Pit messes with it some more by making it an offshoot of the ball-bouncing gameplay itself. In order to collect resources, or finish buildings, you have to bounce your characters around the town area like pinballs, hopefully completing the jobs you want, or nabbing enough of the particular resource you need.</p>
<p>There’s a really in-depth spot of tactical town planning needed here, and you can rearrange the buildings and fields to your heart’s content. So, you can make a narrow corridor of buildings that need finishing if you want, or a slew of forests at the front of the town to ensure you get plenty of wood. Equally, you can shift other buildings out of the way if they don’t have anything useful to offer at that moment, and it gives you a real shift in atmosphere and thought compared to the main game.</p>
<p>It can introduce some early frustration, though. I initially wasn’t thinking it through fully, and through repeated harvests, I didn’t manage to grab the things I needed. There’s a balance between predictability and chaos that feels quite slim, but there are ways to make things more certain by changing the layout, which I really started to appreciate as I got deeper into the game.</p>

<p>Crucially, it all fits together incredibly well. The central gameplay is exciting, and immediately rewarding, feeling like a vertical shooter as much as a Breakout-style ball bouncer. It is arcade-y and, by its nature, repetitive, but if you find that feeling of zen from a million things pinging around the screen, there are few games that can come close to Ball X Pit’s immersion.</p>
<p>The town building adds to that, with your downtime bringing you a host of things to consider, and upgrades and resources to focus on. It’s slightly retro-esque looks complete the experience well, and they’re topped off by the constant gothic rave of the soundtrack. I have to say, Ball X Pit feels like more or less a perfect game to me, building on several classic genres and ideas, while infusing them with unique and rewarding new ideas.</p>

<figure><a title="BALL x PIT Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159605/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Here comes a ball – a great big wrecking ball, ready to smash down the headquarters of productivity that might otherwise control your life. Kenny Sun Studios’ <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ball_x_pit">Ball x Pit</a> is a mercilessly addictive mix of, well, a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>First, take a big dollop of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> and a healthy scoop of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/breakout_recharged">Breakout</a> – then just mix in little pinches of almost whatever you feel like: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/neogeo/puzzle_bobble">Puzzle Bobble</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/balatro">Balatro</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/space_invaders">Space Invaders</a>… and maybe even a tiny sprinkle of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a> for good measure.</p>
<p>But if this roguelite concoction sounds like a pure distillation of all the addictive gameplay ideas from history — and if that puts you off — just hang around a little longer. Ball x Pit definitely brings enough structure and variety, and demands enough creative thinking, to be well worth the time it will inevitably eat up.</p>
<p>You start as a knight at the bottom of a vertical channel. Up top, a small horde of skeletons drops in and starts clomping slowly downwards. They need smashing, and for that, you have a collection of balls. Here’s where the Breakout-ness comes in: bounce the balls to gradually smash the skeletons. Unlike Breakout, you don’t need to stop the balls from falling off the bottom of the screen (although you can catch them if dexterous enough): they’ll just bounce back into your hands, ready for another throw.</p>
<figure><a title="BALL x PIT Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159602/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The super-satisfying strat in Breakout is to get the ball on top of the blocks, so that it ricochets about, wreaking havoc without you having to do anything. That’s a killer move in Ball x Pit, too, but there’s a catch. If you’ve got your balls bouncing about up above the enemies, then the enemies on the front line are marching in untouched.</p>
<p>You need to balance the high damage-per-second latticework of rapid bounces with route-one attacks on the clear and present danger edging towards screen bottom. Any beastie that gets there will make a final lunge and bite off a chunk of your health meter. That’s where you’ll frequently meet your demise – drowned in swathes of enemies, pinned to the bottom edge.</p>
<p>Now, where do the Survivors ideas come in? Well, you start with a handful of “baby balls” that deal minimal damage, plus one special ball that delivers greater damage of different kinds depending on the ball. These include burn, poison, freeze, various area-of-effect attacks, and more. Pressing 'X' toggles auto-fire. I pressed it exactly once, turning it on, then concentrated only on moving in two dimensions with the left stick while aiming with the right.</p>

<p>As enemies are dispatched, they drop crystals, which can be collected to get new special balls, help items, or buffs. You can hold up to four special balls at once, but once you reach capacity, rainbow collectibles allow you to fuse or evolve balls to combine two into one, presenting you with a spare slot to pick another. Each special ball can also be levelled up twice, enhancing its power.</p>
<p>The result of all this is total chaos. Enemies are launching projectiles, you’re launching projectiles, your projectiles are launching projectiles, and even little golems or turrets you can pick are launching projectiles. In summary, there are a lot of projectiles.</p>
<p>Reading the action is confusing at first, but soon becomes clear as you learn what you need to dodge and what you can collect. Consistently fluid performance helps no end in enabling this flow state that is the powerful hook of the game.</p>
<p>To assist in finding that flow, the soundtrack offers a haunting, trancelike electronic beat, with enough drive to pump the adrenaline as bosses arrive and enough dreaminess to drift off into ball heaven when a rare safe patch arrives. The sounds are wonderfully moreish rattles and bounces, clicks, pops, growls, and grunts: rhythmical and tight, firing happy feelings in the brain.</p>

<p>So far, so compelling. But how does this formula avoid getting samey? If we zoom out a bit, there is actually a narrative setting for the game. The city of Ballbylon (yes) has been destroyed, leaving behind a vast pit. Descending into the pit via an enormous lift is what takes you to ever deeper levels, each new one unlocked by completing an earlier one with two different characters and gaining special cogs. This overworld provides a space to gain those new characters and to buff them, and it’s managed, remarkably enough, through a base-building mechanic.</p>
<p>You gather gold while playing the main game, then can use it to purchase a wheat field. Harvesting wheat lets you buy a forest and harvest wood, and so on. Harvesting is done by firing your characters across the base like balls themselves. They ricochet off things and collect resources from the tiles they touch.</p>
<p>Among all this, you can build. Blueprints collected in the pit enable construction of homes for new characters (more play variety and more harvesters) and other buildings that increase stats or improve the rate at which characters develop.</p>

<p>The base building is a different flavour of addictive; it keeps you wanting more, but gives you a break at the same time. A round of building and harvesting clears the mind and sets up the next run in the pit. Jumping back in is satisfying, but it’s also a good time to turn off, knowing your next go is ready to take you even further than before. A built-in reality check is a welcome addition to such a compulsive genre.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Ball x Pit is a tremendous brew of so many ideas it ought to collapse under the confusion. However, it operates in such perfect balance that it appeals both to the one-more-go instinct and to more cerebral planning and creativity. Kenny Sun Studios set itself a heck of a challenge but, fortunately, hasn’t dropped the ball.</p></section>

			<p>Earlier today, when we covered <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-until-dawn-ps-plus-extra-october-2025/">Billbil-kun's report on Dealabs</a> that leaked a few of the games coming to the PS Plus Extra Games Catalogue, we wrote that the official announcement probably wasn't too far behind, and that if it didn't appear today, it would surely appear before the end of the week. Well, we were right the first time, as a new <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/15/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-october-silent-hill-2-until-dawn-v-rising-yakuza-like-a-dragon-and-more/">PlayStation Blog post</a> confirmed most of the Dealabs report, with some additional announcements not in the report.</p>

Dealabs also got one of the PS Plus Premium games right coming into the Classics Catalogue with the original PlayStation version of Tekken 3 entering the service. Everything will also arrive, as predicted, next week, on October 21, 2025.</p>
