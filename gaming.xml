And of course, just like recent weeks, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> is also hanging out in the top ten, producing yet another double-whammy for Nintendo.</p><div><figure data-videoid="_PuEn0ZOn5c" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_PuEn0ZOn5c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_PuEn0ZOn5c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_PuEn0ZOn5c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f036jozvlm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_PuEn0ZOn5c" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>It'll be interesting to see how <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> does when it launches later this year. Be sure to keep an eye out for the upcoming Direct presentation on <strong>19th Aug</strong> for more information!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>One of 2025’s biggest and most important titles is a remake—Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. It’s a full remake of MGS3, and the review embargo will tell us if it’s lived up to the original game’s legend, or if it’s fallen flat on its face in Tselinoyarsk mud.</p>



<p>Metal Gear Solid is an all-time franchise. Its stories still stand the test of time, and there are gameplay ideas that had they not been done previously would be unthinkable in 2025—although looking at the back of the game case would be slightly problematic in the digital era. I don’t think there’s a finer example of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-boss-fights-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MGS than Snake Eater</a>.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-a-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater remake</a> is a fitting first reimagining. Even though Hideo Kojima isn’t at the helm of the project, we still expect this to be a hit. So let’s check out its review embargo details.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Fans will hang onto the word of reviews. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Several sources have quoted August 22 as the game’s review embargo date, with a release time of 12:01 AM PT.</strong></p>



<p>Many outlets and critics already seem to have gotten their hands on Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. You can see from Destin Legarie’s <a href="https://x.com/DestinLegarie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> page that this is the case.</p>



<p>Destin is quoted as saying: “I’ve played Metal Gear Solid Delta on PS5 and PC. Embargoed for Friday, August 22nd, 2025 as 12:01am PT. Coverage beyond me fanboying will be live at embargo.”</p>



<div><article><p><span>I’ve played Metal Gear Solid Delta on PS5 and PC.

Embargoed for Friday August 22nd, 2025 as 12:01am PT

Coverage beyond me fanboying will be live at embargo.</span></p></article></div>







<p><strong>Expectations for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater are sky-high, and I expect the reviews to follow suit with a Metacritic score in the region of 90-95.</strong></p>



<p>A telltale sign that Konami is confident about Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is that review copies are already out weeks in advance. The other sign is the review embargo date being a week before launch. Companies only do this if they’re confident about their product.</p>



<p>I would suggest Konami is more than happy with the state of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater. This is great news when you consider 2004’s original Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater has a <strong>91/100 rating</strong> on Metacritic. As long as the remake builds upon existing greatness and adds some modern-day quality of life changes, it’s hard to see the score dropping below 91.</p>



<p>Using my reasoning, I don’t think a <strong>92 or 93</strong> score is out of the question.</p>



<hr>



<p>The wait for the Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater review embargo will be more excruciating than Naked Snake using CQC to battle a crab. Let me know what score you think the Snake Eater remake is going to score. Be sure to check out the Insider Gaming forum for more MGS discussions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're still on the hunt for a Switch 2 console, here's a rare opportunity to get one at a discounted price. In fact, this may very well be the only Switch 2 deal we'll see for 2025. AliExpress is offering a genuine <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wR6Ay?object_uuid=01572a01-6e23-42b9-be2f-996e784ab5e0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2 console</a> for just $428.99 after you apply a $100 off coupon code "<strong>AEUS100</strong>" or "<strong>USAFF100</strong>" during checkout. Alternatively you can bundle it <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxA4Lk?object_uuid=01572a01-6e23-42b9-be2f-996e784ab5e0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">with the Mario Kart World game</a> for just $452.11 after the same coupon. Both consoles ship free locally from the United States and arrives within 1 to 2 weeks, however you will still have to pay local sales tax.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The catch? Although these are genuine Switch consoles, they are Hong Kong imports. Like all Switch consoles, they are <strong>region unlocked</strong>, meaning you can play them in the US without any problems. You'll also be able to select English as your default language just like any console you buy here. They'll come with a Hong Kong style plug, but a US adapter is included. Imported consoles do not get a US-based Nintendo warranty. AliExpress does include a 90-day free returns window for the Switch 2 console and a 15-day free returns window for the Mario Kart bundle.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nintendo Switch 2 Is on Sale at AliExpress</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Brand new, genuine, imported, region unlocked units</strong></em></p><div catalogid="36a3b9f5-2ced-42c2-8fd0-f4fa3b4e7cdd" id="223120"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Switch 2 console was released on June 5. It is backwards compatible with nearly all Switch 2 games as well as the original Joy-Cons and Switch Pro controller, although the new Switch 2 controllers offer more functionality. In his <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review">Nintendo Switch 2 review</a>, Tom Marks sums up the Switch 2 as "a vital but unexciting upgrade to a console I already love."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two major Switch 2 video games have been released: Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bananza. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-review">Logan Plant reviewed Mario Kart World</a> and wrote that "Mario Kart World may not make the most convincing case that going open-world was the boost the series needed, but excellent multiplayer racing, incredible polish, and the thrilling new Knockout Tour mode still more than live up to its legacy." <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp7xlD?object_uuid=01572a01-6e23-42b9-be2f-996e784ab5e0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mario Kart World</a> currently sells for $79 if purchased separately, so it makes a lot of sense to buy it as a combo with the console for only about $23 more ($57 in savings), even if it means going through the workaround process mentioned above.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Donkey Kong Bananza is the Only 10/10 Masterpiece of 2025</h2></div><div catalogid="7e14ca20-d3b4-46c3-be95-0d920f6e2169" id="227037"><div id="227037" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Donkey Kong Bananza</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only did we rate Donkey Kong a 10/10, it's the <em>only</em> game we've given a Masterpiece rating so far this year. In his <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-review">Donkey Kong Bananza review</a>, Logan Plant writes that <strong>"</strong>The leader of the bunch is finally back to kick some tail in Donkey Kong Bananza, a brilliant successor to Super Mario Odyssey and a smashing return for a classic Nintendo character. Granted there isn't too much competition in the way of Switch exclusive games for 2025, this has been a fantastic year so far for console gaming in general. We've seen some of the best games released in recent history, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/17/kingdom-come-deliverance-review">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review">Death Stranding 2</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-review">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, all of which got close to a Masterpiece rating but didn't quite hit the mark. That's not to say that Donkey Kong Bananza is necessarily better than those other games since, after all, different people have reviewed each of these games, but it's a testament to just how outstanding Donkey Kong Bananza is on its own merits to have achieved that score.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

<p>If the above image wasn't enough of a giveaway, we're talking about Rayquaza, the Gen III legendary dragon. As it turns out, there are a few different ways that folks have been pronouncing this one, with the big split being between 'Ray-KWAY-zuh' and 'Ray-KWAH-zuh'. At least, that <em>was</em> the big divide, because TPC laid out the <em>official</em> pronunciation at this week's competition — it's <strong>Ray-KWAY-zuh</strong>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fswnjql&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLc1VHm8D80" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Now yes, more than a few of you are likely shouting "well, of course it is!!" at your screen of choice right now, and you would be correct. After all, that's how the name has been pronounced in the anime for years, and even the 3DS' <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds-eshop/pokedex_3d_pro">Pokédex 3D Pro</a> was perfectly matched in its emphasis. But that's not to say that everyone agrees.</p>
<p>A brief glance across social media reveals a swathe of Pokéfans who aren't about to back down from their own pronunciation, official or not. The big question is, how do you say it? Have you always been on the side of TPC, or do you opt for something else entirely? You can let us know in the following poll.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Destiny: Rising is a new mobile title from developer and publisher NetEase, licensed by Bungie, and it's due out in just 10 days from the time of this writing. It was first announced back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-rising-brings-the-sci-fi-franchise-to-mobile-thanks-to-netease/">October 2024</a>, and since then the hype around it for mobile gaming and Destiny fans has built to the point where now, days before release, NetEase confirms that over 10 million players have pre-registered for Destiny: Rising.</p>



<p>NetEase has also debuted a new trailer for Destiny: Rising, featuring Gwynn the Reaper, a new character who will be playable in Destiny: Rising when it arrives in a little more than a week's time.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Destiny: Rising | Gwynn Character Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cUEDuuYEkG4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The pre-registration milestone doesn't just mean a moment of celebration for NetEase, as it's also a boon for the millions of players ready to jump into the fight on August 28. NetEase set rewards that players would receive the more people pre-registered, with 10 million being the final goal to be reached to unlock an exotic ornament.</p>



<p>While these pre-registration numbers are good news for NetEase, it can't help but seem like mixed news for Bungie, because it feels like the most significant Destiny release players are excited for is a game that they didn't have very much to do with.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Bungie's in hot water trying to figure out how to re-introduce <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-release-march-2026/">Marathon</a> to players following its plagiarism scandal, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-edge-of-fate-out-now/">Edge of Fate</a>, the latest expansion for Destiny 2 seems to have come and gone without much fanfare.</p>



<p>We'll see if the rest of the year can potentially get a bit better for Bungie. In the meantime, NetEase is prepared to enjoy having two of the biggest games of the year in their portfolio between <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-converted-kevin-feiges-son/">Marvel Rivals</a> and Destiny: Rising.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/rewilders-the-lost-spring-new-action-roguelite-bafta-winning-herobeat-studios/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bafta-winning-developer-herobeat-studios-announces-next-title-action-roguelite-rewilders-the-lost-spring.1272975/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2217470/Rewilders_The_Lost_Spring/">Rewilders: The Lost Spring</a> is a new action-roguelite game from the BAFTA-winning developer, Herobeat Studios, the team behind 2022's heart-wrenching indie, <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-dominates-bafta-games-awards-2023-with-five-wins/">Endling - Extinction Is Forever</a>.</p>



<p>Only the studio's second project and its first self-published title, Rewilders: The Lost Spring, will be heading to PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch at some point in the future, as a release date or even a release window for the title was not announced. </p>



<p>According to a press release, Rewilders will feature "<em>some themes with Endling on the story and narrative</em>," but the gameplay is significantly different as Herobeat calls Rewilders a "<em>creature collection</em>" game with <em>"metroidvania-like progression</em>" that's also a "<em>Soulslite</em>," on top of the other descriptors already put to the game as an "<em>action roguelite</em>."</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Rewilders: The Lost Spring puts you in the shoes of Abi, who is returning to their home planet after surviving a terrible event that poisoned the surface of their home. You'll collect creatures called Hântu, and bring them along on your missions into the various corrupted biomes you'll attempt to heal.</p>



<p>Levelling up, feeding, and bringing different Hântu along with you on each excursion can help shape your strategic approach to each run, while planting and growing different resources back at your sky base helps unlock permanent upgrades, as is the roguelite tradition.</p>



<p>Even though the narrative will share some themes with Herobeat's debut game, it's good and interesting to see the talented team flex its skills with a new gameplay approach. Hopefully, we'll hear more on Rewilders: The Lost Spring, soon.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shenmue-iii-enhanced-announced-for-consoles-and-pc.1272951/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Shenmue III is the latest game to be polished up for the current generation of consoles, that being PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and “Nintendo” – presumably Switch 2.</p>
<p>The enhancements are fairly minor, the game never really pushed Unreal Engine, and all you’re getting this time are 4k Textures and “Enhanced Graphics and Performance”. These are not specified but that’s probably because they don’t want to say 4K 60fps when Switch 2 might not manage that.</p>


<p>You also get faster load times, which are entirely due to the game upgrade and not because everyone has a SSD these days. DLSS/FSR Support will be added along with a Classic Camera mode and minor gameplay tweaks. Here’s the full list of improvements.</p>
<p><strong>Key Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced Graphics and Performance</strong>&nbsp;– Sharper textures, richer details, faster load times, and smoother gameplay.</li>
<li><strong>4K Texture Uplift</strong>&nbsp;– Refined, more detailed environments and characters.</li>
<li><strong>DLSS/FSR Support</strong>&nbsp;– High-quality upscaling without sacrificing performance (supported platforms only).</li>
<li><strong>Increased NPC Density</strong>&nbsp;– The city village Niaowu feels more alive with more characters populating the streets.</li>
<li><strong>Classic Camera Mode</strong>&nbsp;– An optional camera perspective inspired by&nbsp;<em>Shenmue</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Shenmue II</em>, alongside the modern view.</li>
<li><strong>Gameplay Tweaks</strong>&nbsp;– Optional stamina system adjustments, health restoration before fights, and reduced money barriers for smoother progression.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Interactions</strong>&nbsp;– Cutscene and conversation skip options, expanded quick-time event timing window for more accessible gameplay.</li>
<li><strong>Menu and User&nbsp;Experience&nbsp;Enhancements</strong>&nbsp;– Streamlined navigation and helpful purchase alerts.</li>
<li><strong>Optionality First</strong>&nbsp;– All major changes can be toggled to preserve the original experience for purists.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you own the PS4 or PC version, there will be an upgrade path. A release date for Shenmue III Enhanced has not been announced.&nbsp; There’s no trailer or screenshots either, so here’s a kitten instead.</p>

<figure><a title="titanic scion preview" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/20a90ece310c0/titanic-scion-preview.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Marvelous</em></figcaption></figure><p>When Nintendo Life reviewed the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/daemon_x_machina">Daemon X Machina</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/daemon_x_machina">back in 2019</a>, Chris Scullion called it "a solid mech action game that controls well and gives the player a generous helping of customisation options." However, he noted that mission structure, performance, and overall story were lacking, which dragged things down a little.</p>
<p>Fast-forward six years and I'm back in the land of Femto and giant laser swords for Marvelous' supercharged sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion">Daemon x Machina: Titanic Scion</a>, which makes a whole raft of big changes that should, in theory, alleviate some of the downsides with the original experience.</p>
<p>Let's rewind a minute first to give newly interested parties — and those, like me, with a short memory — a quick rundown of what this series is all about. You assume the role of an Outer (that's the name for a new breed of human that arrived in the aftermath of the "Moonfall calamity") and, as a result, you're a bit of killing machine. Outers, you see, have been exposed to Femto, a mysterious red alien material that's spread around the planet, and they can therefore upgrade aspects of themselves for battle - which is very useful when you're starring in a video game about battles.</p>

<p>As a mech-suited Femto merc, then, you're on the front line of a desperate war for humanity's survival against corrupted AIs who're currently rebelling against their human creators. Piloting a fully customisable mech known as an Arsenal, you team up with other mercs (CPU and/or human) to complete missions to defeat the AI "Immortals" once and for all. So, it's kinda like a standard Saturday night in Glasgow, basically.</p>
<p>It's in the customisation and building of mechs that the first game found a lot of its depth, attempting to give us a proper meaty robot experience for folks who love to build, paint and outfit these great big death machines, whilst also giving us large areas to blast around in. 2019's effort did well, for the most part, in presenting all of this on Switch, and on systems where it didn't struggle with performance (whilst also looking quite a lot nicer, it has to be said), it's a game that still warrants a playthrough. Think <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/armored_core">Armored Core</a>, but newer and a bit sexier, and you're almost all of the way there.</p>
<p>Moving on to Titanic Scion, and having played up to the end of the first nine chapters for this preview, I'm heavily impressed thus far with what Marvelous is getting up to. This is a much bigger and more open game than its predecessor, that's immediately apparent, and although it's not a fully open world, its segmented regions are huge (well, so far anyway) and the time it takes to travel betwixt them means it's got the necessary sense of epic scale and draw which was somewhat missing from part one.</p>

<p>Movement, whether on land or in the air, has also seen some big changes, or at least it feels that way to me. Everything is zippier and more approachable, and combat in general is a different beast as a result of this. Part of it comes down to the actual physical size of the mech suits, as the ones I've used so far are more slimline and fast-moving exosuits than any sort of traditional, tanky robot design. Another part comes down to new systems in place to make the whole thing more interesting.</p>
<p>I've already seen some comparisons online to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/monster_hunter_rise">Monster Hunter</a> in the approach that Marvelous is taking, you can see it in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion-drops-two-new-gameplay-videos">the combat trailers</a> and other things that they've released so far, but in practice...wow...yeah, it really does feel quite like a big robot take on Capcom's series in its more modern form.</p>
<p>Missions are carried out in much the same way as the original, with preparation crucial in your downtime. Buying new weapons, crafting, re-speccing, and outfitting your mech, and then jettisoning yourself out into huge big landscapes where you are free to explore as you wish, before heading towards whatever objective marker is up next. Heck, you can even knock parts and materials off enemy mechs to use in crafting. How much more Monster can this Hunt get?</p>

<p>Yep, as you might have pieced together yourself if you've checked out any of the reveal trailers, Immortal enemies all now have, well, it's kinda like DNA. They each have their own little genetic marker collectibles that you can strip from them once they are dead, and these are then collected to unlock a ton of skills and buffs, new weaponry, new moves and mech parts. It feels deep. I haven't fought enough huge mechanised beasts or robots to really see where it all goes, but so far it makes for gameplay that has real motivation where the first game didn't. There's a lot of cool gear, a lot of upgrades and skills and ways to build, and seeking out big scraps and hunting down rare bad guys seems to be how you're going to get your hands on a lot of this stuff.</p>
<p>So, once you get your materials stripped off (and note that you can also whittle down a baddie and then get in close to start yanking off parts), you can start getting into the game's fusions. These give you upgrades split across four sections — Genes, Skeleton, Might, and Shell — and there's so many new weapon skills and moves to unlock here that you're going to be playing this one for <em>a long time</em> if it grabs your interest in any way.</p>
<p>Once you're out into the game's world and into any of its huge big hunting grounds, you can take on groups of bad guys, as well as lots of mutated local wildlife, wrestle back control of fast travel locations, and get busy hoovering up the contents of chests (the loot thus far has been pleasing) whilst also mining for materials. There's even an entire card game to play, which I have yet to find - even though I've already discovered quite a few special playing cards hidden around on my travels.</p>

<p>It's all great fun right out of the gate because it gives you the freedom to do all this stuff fairly quickly, and most of the huge arsenal of weapons you can acquire simply give you a tutorial on-the-fly as you pick them up. There's a balance being struck here between keeping things moving, keeping it exciting, and giving you the time, space, and depth you would want in a mech game. Listen, I am a big mech game fan, okay - we like to look at numbers and make the numbers go up and spend lots of time doing decals. All that stuff is here, too.</p>
<p>Oh, and I want to give a shoutout to a very small detail in how nabbing gear from fallen foes works, because it pleases me. When you open up the inventory to see what they've got, you'll be presented with multiple options, but you only get to choose <em>one</em> thing. Again, this might change with a perk, but it makes grabbing gear more interesting and exciting in the early hours. Place this on top of the fact there's just so many varieties of gear on offer, from great big auto-lock missile turrets down to schematics for graceful swords, and you've got a whole big bunch of ways to gear up, level up and grow into your role as an AI-killing machine.</p>
<p>In terms of the combat, once it gets going, it feels excellent. Locking onto targets is a simple matter of clicking the right stick - à la any Soulslike - and weapons can easily be cycled between your main left and right, two side weapons, and a bunch of different throwables, including grenades and lots of poison and fire traps so far. At the moment, I'm switching between two sets that give me dual-wielding SMGs, which work really well for smaller airborne enemies, and a sword and shield because it looks bad-ass.</p>

<p>You also have big old shoulder weapons and an auxiliary slot to place grenade launchers and other gadgets. Emergency dodges feel great to pull off, grabs (which you can do to dazed foes) make for a fun way to throw airborne enemies around, and the game's search mode does a neat and clean job of picking up hidden loot in your vicinity. Oh, and have I mentioned laser swords yet? I have? Good. There's loads of them.</p>
<p>I've got to say, too, that being able to ride around on horses you find in the wild whilst still in your mech suit, or driving around in regular army vehicles in the thing, besides the aesthetic of future-mech-badass-on-horseback (which is fairly epic as these things go), it also makes exploring feel a little <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/halo_the_master_chief_collection">Halo</a>-esque at times in how knockabout and silly it can be. Add in an early vehicle sequence and I get the feeling I'm in for a lot of huge big set pieces alongside action that, on the ground and in the air, feels great so far.</p>
<p>Nine chapters might sound like a lot, but in actual fact it's only brought me to what I would consider the first proper boss battle-of-sorts in the game. At this point, I've got the hang of fighting gangs of mechs in the air and on the ground. I've nailed the timings on my dodges, boosts and, to a lesser extent, barrel rolls (barrel rolls are back, baby...I just don't really know how I'm doing them yet!). I've also got the hang of the mining minigame that has you target and shoot little circles in order to knock down a gauge - the more critical hits you get, the better your haul.</p>

<p>I'm also getting a good feel for how smartly designed these initial areas are, with crystallised shards of Femto placed everywhere, you can just shoot at it from range and collect it up (Femto doubles as your fuel), meaning that I'm never really worrying about having to stop flying. Hooray! Indeed, flying around feels great. However, it's also where my one major issue with the game thus far begins to raise its head. Well, in docked mode it does, at least.</p>
<p>Now, for full transparency, prior to a Day One patch dropping during the preview period, I had to get a <em>little</em> negative about a few aspects of the game's performance in docked mode. It was pretty much fine in handheld, but once hooked up to a TV, it struggled as you pelted around the open world in places. Not a game-breaker, but a little worrying when playing a new game on a new console. However. Joy of joys! Now that patch is live, I have very few negative things to say.</p>
<p>Let's start with docked mode, where now both the resolution and frame rate are rock solid, thankfully. The only place I'm really seeing any notable stutters are when zipping into a new area. You'll notice that tell-tale micro-stutter as you make your way to the same point in the tunnels that link landmasses, for example. For a game this big, this action-packed and this nice-looking, I'm impressed.</p>

<p>In handheld, any little issues you may have in docked mode with textures or pop-in are minimised hugely on the smaller screen, and everything just feels that bit zippier and smoother. Where big open-world-esque adventure games on Switch 1 could often feel as though they were about to fall apart in trying to present high-octane action together with expansive landmasses (with the notable exception of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_x_definitive_edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X</a>), on Switch 2 it feels like we can breathe a bit more easily.</p>
<p>As for the controls, I was dreading there would be input lag and latency issues but they are nowhere to be found, and taking on huge monolithic robots who rise up dramatically from the sand when disturbed, or flocks of tiny mechanised annoyances as you zoom through the sky (there's an altitude limit in place so you don't get too close to the sun), things feel responsive whilst looking just-about on-point.</p>
<p>In fact, as I've just mentioned it, Xenoblade Chronicles X is a good frame of reference here. Take its mech combat - once it really gets going in the latter stages - and place it in a much more action-heavy and adult-oriented world. Now add a ton of depth to the robot weaponry, design and build aspects, and you're sort of getting close to what's going on here.</p>

<p>So, overall then, I'm thoroughly impressed with Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion so far. The narrative is only just getting started, so there's very little to discuss on that front. But in terms of spectacle, action, and depth with the mech builds, we could be onto a winner. I've arrived at a point in the tale where important characters, future squad mates and things of this nature are beginning to take shape and show up, and it's got me fully onboard. Indeed, I've already spied one or two potential new team members who I'm quite looking forward to getting to know.</p>
<p>There's also a nice, adult, grown-up feel to everything so far. It's dark, the stakes are high, and consequences are dire when mistakes are made. Throw in combat and exploration that's doing the business, (and the very exciting prospect of co-op mode once the thing actually releases) and I'm fairly excited to see where the rest of the game takes me.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> open beta is over. I'm sure everyone let out a final burst of fire that sounded equally triumphant and tragic at its conclusion. But wait, say EA, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> lovers, where do you all think you're going?</p>
<p>It's at this point the publishers whip out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>, the much-maligned at release previous entry in the series, like they're yanking a rabbit out of a marine's helmet. He's not Battlefield 2042 anymore, they say, he's the "road to Battlefield 6". A road one can only assume is littered with IEDs and checkpoints where five people are standing around looking mean. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>This boulevard to blast central is update 9.2, and it's chunky enough that I'd class it as a full-on repaint the road markings affair. Classic map Iwo Jima makes its 2042 debut, with "boat landings, bunkers, and trenches on a reimagined 700x200 map". Oh, and an active volcano in case you want to renounce your warlike ways and take up volcanology.</p>
<p>Weapon-wise, there are two new guns - the KFS2000 assault rifle and the Lynx sniper rifle. Only the former's being dished out to everyone, with the Lynx only being given to folks who played the Battlefield 6 beta to start with. EA insist anyone who didn't hop into the beta will get a chance to grab it "later down the line". Meanwhile, two new attack jets, the A10 Warthog and SU-25TM Frogfoot, have been added in. EA say they come with some revamped abilities and are designed to be "vehicle busters".</p><div>

<p>That sounds a bit rough for folks down below, trundling along the "road to Battlefield 6" in tanks or jeeps. Anyway, I'll drop the metaphor. The "road to Battlefield 6" is actually a 60-tiered free battle pass featuring a bunch of gear inspired by the series' history. It includes some stuff to unlock for Battlefield 6 itself and will run from August 18th to October 7th.</p>
<p>If you want a reminder of what Battlefield 2042 was like when it first debuted, here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-2042-pc-review">Ed's review</a>. It's also evolved a fair bit since then, so a run through our 2042 news archives is probably a good shout if you want cluing up on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-2042-will-revive-its-old-class-system-next-week">some of the changes EA have made</a> over the years.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><span>Everyone who grew up playing text-based games has some proper noun they mispronounced until they heard it said out loud. I still get in arguments about whether </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-ff16-14-grapes-7-aerith-10-tidus-rpg-snes-1850721904/9"><span>Tidus</span></a><span>, the name of the main character in </span><i><span>Final Fantasy X</span></i><span> which is never spoken in dialogue because you can change it, is pronounced “Tee-dus” or “Tide-us” (it’s “Tee-dus,” by the way). One of the earliest examples of this phenomenon I encountered as a kid concerned the pronunciation of Rayquaza, the sky-ruling dragon from </span><i><span>Pokémon Ruby </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Sapphire</span></i><span>. As American children without the internet, it could be months or years before my friends and I would hear a Pokémon’s name spoken in the anime, and that was just long enough for some mispronounced names to sneak their way into our speech like an Ekans. Well, after over 20 years, The Pokémon Company has heard the mispronounced version of the dragon’s name so many times, they decided to put people on blast for it at <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-world-championship-closing-ceremony-recap-z-a-2000618195">Pokémon Worlds</a> in Anaheim.</span></p> <p><span>Rayquaza’s name is pronounced “Ray-kway-zah.” The “qua” syllable uses the long vowel to make an “ay” sound, but a lot of people didn’t know that 20 years ago when </span><i><span>Ruby </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Sapphire </span></i><span>originally launched. However, the correct pronunciation has been long-established, as the dragon has shown up in the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQLKxCOrULg"><span>anime</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://chfoo.github.io/pbrchase/"><span>voiced games</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://x.com/SaturnYoshi/status/1957188527453569355"><span>official pronunciation guides</span></a><span>. Breakdowns of its </span><a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Rayquaza_(Pok%C3%A9mon)#Name_origin"><span>name’s origin</span></a><span> even trace the “qua” syllable to the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar"><span>quasar phenomenon</span></a><span>, given its ability to fly and breathe in outer space. Nevertheless, people love to say the long boy’s name wrong, and it’s a bit of a running joke within the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>community.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Is it pronounced Rayquaza or Rayquaza? #pokemon #legendarypokeman" width="422" height="750" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q9CJc0Pdt28?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Well, The Pokémon Company is tired of it, and made sure everyone at the World Championships in Anaheim knew the right way to say Rayquaza’s name.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a> may be an offer you can probably refuse, but it does have a lush-looking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> - "clearly designed with care and a sharp eye for capturing the beauty of a fairytale landscape that alternates between serene and rugged," as Mark "Ice Pick" Warren <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mafia-the-old-country-review">wrote in our review</a>. </p>
<p>The game's focus on shootybangs and stabfights does the backdrop a disservice, as does its rather barren and easy-to-miss Exploration mode, which I hear is basically a chance to snaffle up some collectibles. Devs Hangar 13 and their godfathers at 2K Games aim to fix all that with a forthcoming Free Ride mode, which will "add some new activities and gameplay, arriving free for all players in the coming months," according to a developer update.</p>
<p>Hangar 13's previous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mafia-definitive-edition">Mafia: Definitive Edition</a> also had a Free Ride mode, which let you roam Lost Heaven taking on new missions and races and even tussling with alien invaders. I would assume The Old Country's version will be similar in both content and direction. Can't wait to see what flying saucers look like in 1900s Sicily.</p>
<p>I'm always happy when blockbuster devs add modes that encourage you to revisit and savour the texture of the world. Projects such as Mafia: The Old Country typically pour tens of millions into the creation of art assets that are doomed to be appreciated for around five seconds while players zip fecklessly from cover to cover.</p><p>I guess that mingled decadence and disposability is part of the triple-A thrill, like burning 100 dollar bills to light a cigar. Have you ever done that? I once set a five pound note on fire for a dare, but I extinguished it immediately and, I think, bought a coffee with it. This is why I will never run 2K Games.</p>
<p>Again, there's no hard launch date yet for Free Ride in Mafia: The Old Country. In the shorter term, Mark has dug up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mafia-the-old-country-now-has-a-first-person-driving-mod-thats-ideal-for-capo-cruisin-when-its-not-utterly-terrifying">a first-person driving mod</a>, which allows you to savour the period detail at the modest expense of occasionally seeing your own eyeballs floating in front of your face.</p>

              <p>PlayStation fans have been waiting to hear what’s next from <a href="https://kotaku.com/why-god-of-war-took-five-years-to-make-1825653009">Sony’s <em>God of War</em> studio, Santa Monica,</a> amid rumors that the 2018 game’s director, Cory Barlog, is busy creating a new IP. The veteran developer appears to have finally provided them with their first official details, albeit in the strangest way possible: via his Facebook account.</p> <p><strong>Update: 8/18/2025 12:38 p.m. ET: </strong>The Facebook profile reported by <em>Game Informer</em> to be Cory Barlog’s appears to be fake. <em>Kotaku</em> spotted a now-deleted post in Turkish on the account. The account also has a post from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cory.barlog.357128/posts/pfbid0tJcFxoSMPPQASvPEuCgppzFkFajMTPvDCDt4eRX4R2WZ5hDJiojr1vfy4KZma1ypl">May 14 linking to a BlueSky account</a>. However, that account is fake and not Barlog’s actual BlueSky profile, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/corybarlog.bsky.social/followers">which is followed by Sony Santa Monica Studios</a>. The fake Facebook account seems to have fooled a lot of people, as it appears to be friends with industry veterans like former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden, who even communicated directly with the account in the replies to that specific post about BlueSky. <em>Kotaku</em> has messaged the fake profile but has not heard back.</p> <p><em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Jason Schreier <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot47-the-wolf-pack.1243551/page-129#post-144005094">posted on ResetEra</a> about the Turkish post that was deleted shortly after <em>Game Informer</em> reported on the announcement, stating, “Either it’s a fake account or Cory is a big fan of Turkish.”</p>

 <p>Original story follows…</p> <p>“I’d like to share a little bit about our new project,” Barlog <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cory.barlog.357128/posts/pfbid0JHwrN1fGFLZGN5BBa7qneq6Qcc3prpVKvHpfPnZBewgcnZ4sehaHporp97xaLq3Jl">wrote on&nbsp;Facebook</a>, as first reported by <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/18/god-of-war-developer-sony-santa-monica-is-working-on-a-new-technically-ambitious-ip">by <em>Game Informer</em></a>. “I’m incredibly proud of what the team at Santa Monica Studio has been accomplishing. It’s a technically ambitious project, something that’s not easy to achieve. This is a new IP we’ve been working on for years, and if all goes well, we’re planning to show it to you later this year. I couldn’t be more excited.”</p> <p>While many have shared doubts about the veracity of the post, the account behind it is listed as friends with<em>&nbsp;God of War</em> composer Bear McCreary and former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida, among other industry figures. Sony did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>As rumors have swirled about what exactly Santa Monica is making, <em>Bloomberg</em>‘s Jason Schreier <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot46-back-to-the-beach.1172010/page-406#post-142670637">reported</a> earlier this year that, contrary to popular speculation, the studio was not making a sci-fi game. He was more cryptic on whether the current project is related to <em>God of War</em> or not. “It’s not a new IP but it might feel like one,” he wrote. “Maybe that’s why people are confused.”</p>

 <p>This led some fans to speculate that the upcoming game could be a <em>God of War</em> spin-off that is so different from the existing third-person action franchise, it’s being treated internally as a new IP. It’s unclear right now how many projects Santa Monica has going at the same time, with a rumored <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1leijyp/jeff_grubb_greek_god_of_war_game_internally/"><em>God of War</em> set in Greece</a> reportedly delayed and an online spin-off at fellow PlayStation studio Bluepoint <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-multiplayer-bluepoint-days-gone-2-concord-1851742012">reportedly canceled earlier this year</a>.</p> <p>One thing’s for sure: the new game’s announcement, whatever it ends up being, is something PS5 superfans have been desperate for as this console generation drags on without many first-party single-player blockbusters to point to. If Barlog’s next game does get announced this year, presumably at the Game Awards, it’ll suggest the PS5 is shaping up to have a strong last few years when it comes to Sony-made exclusives.</p>

Currently, the livestream is just a still that reads: "The Next Tales Of Remastered is...?"</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Next Tales of Remastered project will be announced on Aug 19th - 7 AM PT <a href="https://t.co/pIlI4mrGeF" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/pIlI4mrGeF</a> <a href="https://t.co/BiZ7Q42qUV" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/BiZ7Q42qUV</a></p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1957447195914887439?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 18, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">However, as has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tales/comments/1mpzywl/tales_of_newsxillia_leak_youtube_screenshots/?share_id=0uqQYmDmE5O1zVvyd5Pxy&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointed out on social media</a>, a version of this video accidentally went live on the Bandai Namco Europe page a few days ago that showed the remaster to be Tales of Xillia. So it looks like that's what we're getting tomorrow in an early morning livestream, surprisingly hours ahead of Gamescom Opening Night Live later in the afternoon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tales of Xillia first launched in 2011 in Japan and 2013 elsewhere, and follows two characters, Jude and Milla, who uncover a powerful and destructive weapon and set out on a quest to stop its use. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/06/tales-of-xillia-review">gave it an 8/10 back in the day</a>, making it a great candidate for a remaster especially given that it's been a PS3-exclusive up til now and difficult to go back and play. It also sparked a sequel, Tales of Xillia 2, which was similarly locked to PS3.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">All that said, some fans will likely be disappointed that this isn't the Tales of remaster they were hoping for. Last year, Bandai Namco <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-graces-f-dev-talks-about-tales-of-the-abyss-remaster-possibilities-and-the-future-of-the-series">announced a Tales of Remastered Program</a>, starting with Tales of Graces f (a Tales of Symphonia remaster was released the year prior). At the time, we asked producer Yuki Ishikawa about the very popular Tales of the Abyss, widely-regarded as one of the best Tales games, and whether it might be up for a remaster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If [a Tales of the Abyss remaster] could happen and I could share that joy with the rest of the fans, that’s something I’ll work hard towards,” Ishikawa said. Meanwhile, I'm over here as the only person carrying the torch for Zestiria, but I can wait my turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

If you're a bit of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-tcg-pocket/">Pokemon TCG Pocket</a> aficionado, then you'll probably be excited to hear that Mega Evolution will be coming to the mobile card-collecting game later this fall. The Pokemon Company shared a trailer announcing the news, where it also showed off three Mega Pokemon cards that will be available to pull whenever the set drops.</p><p dir="ltr">First up is the "ever-fluffy" Mega Altaria.

<p>Mouse in the house</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Annapurna Interactive has today announced that Furcula's weird roguelike-meets-creature collector <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/morsels">Morsels</a> will be landing on Switch on <strong>18th November</strong>.</p>
<p>This one briefly popped up in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-august-2024-every-announcement-and-game-reveal-from-the-indie-world-and-partner-showcases">August 2024 Indie World</a> showcase, where it was accompanied by a 'February 2025' release date. That wasn't meant to be (obviously), but it's nice to hear that it's still coming our way.</p>
<p>For those who haven't heard of Morsels before, this is a strange, top-down roguelite where you play as a mouse who is transformed into a Morsel — a weird little creature that possesses wicked combat powers — and sets out into the upper world to take down the oppressive forces of... street cats? Hey, we said it was weird.</p>
<p>In your trips up top, you'll be collecting other Morsels, which can be swapped out as you play to tackle feline foes with different abilities. They're weird-looking fellas, but the retro aesthetic gives a cute sheen to the whole thing.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from the Morsels <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1719040/Morsels/">Steam</a> page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Fight enemies using your rotating roster of captured Morsels, switching between them at any time<br>
- Each Morsel has its own abilities and strengths, and can become afflicted with ailments or boosted with power-ups and quirks<br>
- Multiple hidden bonus levels with unique art styles and surprising gameplay twists<br>
- Charming and addictive gameplay, with endless replayability</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have enough roguelikes on Switch to last us a lifetime, but we'd be lying if we said that the weirdness of this one didn't leave us a little intrigued. Hey, in a few months, we can see it for ourselves.</p>
<p><em>What do you make of this one? Will you be checking it out on Switch later this year? Dive into the comments and let us know.</em></p></section>

			<p>Shenmue 3 Enhanced is a new "<em>upgraded</em>" version of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/shenmue-iii-steam-launch-now-officially-scheduled-for-november-19th/">2019 entry</a> to the series from developer Ys Net that'll arrive on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and for the first time in the series history, Shenmue is coming to a Nintendo platform, but there's no specification if it'll arrive on Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, or both.</p>



<p>Unlike the original release published by Deep Silver, this new version of the game will be published by ININ Games, which acquired the <a href="https://wccftech.com/shenmue-iii-publishing-rights-transferred-to-inin-games/">publishing rights to Shenmue 3 last November</a>. Also, if you already own Shenmue 3 on PlayStation 4 or PC, you'll be able to upgrade to this new version, though the details regarding whether it's a paid update or a free one are still to come.</p>



<p>According to a press release, this new version of the game will feature "<em>overhauled visuals, performance boosts, and quality-of-life updates</em>." A few of those upgrades include new 4K textures, support for DLSS and FSR, and faster load times. </p>



<p>There are also a few gameplay-specific improvements, like increased NPC density in Niaowu, a classic camera mode for those who want to play Shenmue 3 as if it was made immediately after the original two titles. Adjustments to Ryo's stamina, health restoration between fights, and a reduction of money barriers have also been added, alongside the ability to skip NPC conversations and cutscenes if you want to get back to the action as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>And, for those who perhaps want the visual improvements but don't want any of the gameplay adjustments, all of these additions are optional, and can be toggled from the menu if you'd rather play without them.</p>



<p>No specific release date has been announced for Shenmue 3 Enhanced Edition, though with Gamescom 2025 set to kick off hours away from the time of this writing, it could be the case that we don't have to wait too long before hearing more about this new enhanced edition. We'll see what the week holds.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bigger-maps-found-in-battlefield-6-by-dataminers.1272882/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>A group of dataminers has reportedly shared visual evidence of some very large maps that will be available in <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> at launch or shortly after the online shooter’s October release on PC and console.</p> <p>Over the last two weekends, <a href="https://kotaku.com/oh-thank-god-the-battlefield-6-open-beta-is-back-2000617797"><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s open beta</a> was a <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-call-of-duty-record-2000616838">big hit with players</a>. The upcoming military sim’s ground combat, explosive destruction, and <em>Battlefield 3</em>-like vibes were well received online. I had a blast putting over 15 hours into the beta by myself and with friends. But it wasn’t a perfect beta, of course, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-bf6-rush-mcom-change-wnba-mafia-news-2000618000">EA having to tweak Rush shortly after adding it</a>, and some players complaining that the maps in the beta were too small. Well, good news for those people: We have our first reported look at some of the bigger maps that will likely be available in <em>BF6</em> later this year.</p> <p><a href="https://mp1st.com/news/battlefield-6-large-scale-map-images-leak-comparisons-alleviate-beta-concerns">As reported by <em>MP1st</em> on August 17</a>, a group of <em>Battlefield</em> dataminers known as 1BF was recently able to extract files from <em>Battlefield Lab</em>s. This is a version of <em>BF6</em> that EA uses for testing out new features, early gameplay ideas, maps, and modes. The group claims to have datamined two maps from <em>BF Labs</em>: Mirak Valley, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/features/maps">which was already confirmed by EA to be in the full game</a>, and another, known as Eastwood, that is rumored to be <em>BF6</em>‘s first post-launch map. And both of these maps are much bigger than the compact, urban warfare maps featured in the beta.&nbsp; According to the dataminers, Mirak Valley will be the largest map available in <em>Battlefield 6</em> at launch.</p> <h2>Leaked images of two big <em>Battlefield 6</em> maps</h2> <p>In renders leaked online via Imgur, which are included below, you can see various shots of Mirak Valley. Keep in mind the map won’t look like this in-game, but it does show us what looks to be a very big and open map, something <em>Battlefield</em> vets will appreciate.</p>

     <p>Meanwhile, the other large map, known as Eastwood, is reportedly set in California and will feature a golf course, fancy houses, and a new vehicle: a golf cart. <a href="https://youtu.be/X96xvDjEaVw">When EA teased a battle royale-like mode last month</a> coming to <em>BF6</em> in the future, it showed what looked like a mansion’s pool and people driving a golf cart. Perhaps Eastwood, which is likely the map’s codename and not its final title, will be the setting for this teased mode. You can see renders of Eastwood below:</p>   <p>A size comparison of Mirak Valley and Eastwood to the <em>BF6</em> beta map Siege of Cairo has also been doing the rounds based on the datamined renders, and it does show that, yes, there are seemingly much bigger maps in <em>Battlefield 6</em>. This shouldn’t be too surprising to learn, though, because <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6-dev-says-the-betas-small-maps-are-to-make-sure-we-hit-the-full-octane-version-of-battlefield-on-the-head-and-dont-worry-large-maps-exist-too/"><em>Battlefield</em> lead producer David Sirland</a> said that bigger maps would be included in the full game last week.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Datamine of previously (mostly) unseen maps from the beta files</p> <p>Mirak Valley, based on the official description, will be the largest map on release</p> <p>source: Happysufigeee <a href="https://t.co/Hrr3YDyOTX">pic.twitter.com/Hrr3YDyOTX</a></p> <p>— 1BF | Battlefield 6 (@onebattlefield) <a href="https://twitter.com/onebattlefield/status/1956751064587239657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It should be noted that datamined content isn’t guaranteed to be included in the full game. Development is messy, plans shift, and things get delayed or canned all the time. That said, these maps look very far along, and at least one of them is listed as a launch map in <em>BF6</em>. So while there might be some changes made between the datamined renders and the final maps in the shipped game, I’m expecting both of these maps to be included at some point in<em> Battlefield 6.</em></p> <p><em>Battlefield 6</em> launches on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC.</p>

<p>The remaster will stay true to the original story, with graphics enhancements and a better frame rate than the original. There’s also a remake of Snake vs Monkeys for those on PlayStation and PC, while Xbox players will be able to enjoy a brand-new creation, Snake vs Bomberman.</p>







<p><strong>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will be available from 4pm PT on August 28, according to the PlayStation Store listing.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Peak’s popularity continues to rise with almost two million sales last week during a sale on Steam, according to new data.</p>



<p>The title received a significant update recently, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peak-adds-cannibalism-in-its-latest-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adding cannibalism</a> to the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peaks-first-major-update-adds-a-new-biome-items-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alongside a new biome</a>, complete with new items and mysteries to solve.</p>



<p>A 38% discount on Steam then went live on August 11, which is still running, propelling Peak to staggering numbers with almost two million sales in the week alone, putting the game on the cusp of 10 million sales overall.</p>



<h2 id="h-peak-approaches-10-million-sales-mark">Peak Approaches 10 Million Sales Mark</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Huge boost. Image via Alinea Analytics</figcaption></figure>



<p>New data published by <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/peak-sold-18-million-copies-last" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Alinea Analytics</a> revealed the impressive numbers, with 1.8 million sales last week, pushing the title to 9.7 million copies sold overall. With the sale price still available, the 10 million mark should be surpassed this week.</p>



<p>Sales have pushed revenue to over $55 million, it’s added, and should Peak pass the 10 million sales mark, it will become the second budget indie title to hit the milestone in 2025, following on from R.E.P.O (16.8 million sales). Last week, revenues are reported to have been $6.9 million.</p>



<p>Those numbers gave Peak the accolade of being the highest-selling title on Steam last week (August 11 to 17), with charts showing the huge rebound in sales numbers for the title, which had seen week-by-week sales steadily decrease since release.</p>



<p>Impressively, Peak sold over 550,000 copies on the weekend alone, while the launch of the Mesa Update on August 11 also brought legacy players back to the game, resulting in a boost to concurrent players.</p>



<p>Is Peak one of the best games to release in 2025? Should it be a Game of the Year contender? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/3332/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

    <div id="main-content">
  

        <p>Well, I say that, they've actually addressed "certain irregularities"</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>South Korean publishers Nexon are investigating a recent bit of TikTok marketing for their free-to-play shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-first-descendant">The First Descendant</a>, after players spotted some ads that feature AI-generated 'human' streamers bigging up the game. Well, we at least have to assume it's following that, as Nexon's statement omits mentioning AI in favour of the wonderfully nebulous phrase "certain irregularities".</p>
<p>If you've not seen one of these ads that look to have been posted by The First Descendant's official account, allow me to show you, because you'll see right quick why folks have been asking questions. <a href="https://x.com/MoxsyOG/status/1956400478855573771">Boom</a>. There are further booms compiled into one Reddit post by user iHardlyTriHard down below.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As you can see, them be some weird renderings of streamy blokes, especially the one who says <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a>: Automata in a fashion that'd be hilarious if this wasn't terrible AI sloppage. Seriously, he pronounces it NEER (pause for ten seconds) audomada. He also gets points for doubling up on his use of free-to-play in his attempt to get you hyped about an F2P update to the F2P looter shooter, which has launched F2Ply.</p>
<p>Anyway, in addition to the more obviously not-streamers, it appears the first one in the compilation below may be based on the likeness of streamer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DanieltheDemon/videos">DanieltheDemon</a>. He's since taken to the comments section of a TikTok about the clips to make clear he didn't agree to any of this. "I have no affiliation nor contract with The First Descendant," the streamer <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@game.central/video/7539498130065214742">wrote</a>. "They stole my face/reactions from my most viral video and used AI to change what my mouth says and a voice that isn't mine. I did not consent for my likeness to be used..."</p> 
<p>While you can't find these full ads if you go to The First Descendant's official TikTok account, you can see some of the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@firstdescendantofficial/video/7525009515557932296?lang=en">gameplay</a> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@firstdescendantofficial/video/7525333042924211463?lang=en">clips</a> the AI streamers have been paired with to deliver their samey sales pitches.</p>
<p>What do Nexon have to say about this? The <a href="https://x.com/FirstDescendant/status/1957361838964006977">following</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We would like to inform you of certain irregularities identified in the operation of our TikTok Creative Challenge for creators. As a part of our marketing campaign for Season 3: Breakthrough, we recently ran a Creative Challenge program for TikTok creators, which allows creators to voluntarily submit their content to be used as advertising materials. All submitted videos are verified through TikTok’s system to check copyright violations before they are approved as advertising content.</p>
<p>However, we have become aware of cases where the circumstances surrounding the production of certain submitted videos appear inappropriate. Thus, we are conducting a thorough joint investigation with TikTok to determine the facts. We sincerely apologize for the delay in providing this notice as the review is taking longer than expected. Once the verification is complete, we will promptly share an update through an official notice.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, the company ran <a href="https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/quicktok/online/tiktok-creative-challenge-introduction/pc/en">a competition of sorts</a> that let anyone create ads for the game, which is a strange example of outsourcing at the very least, then seemingly left final approval for publication to TikTok's copyright checker, which merrily waved this dodgy stuff through. Either that or Nexon potentially gave it all the green light themselves. Either way, oof.</p><p>We'll have to see what the company say once that investigation's concluded, but here's hoping the next statement's a bit more like the easier-to-parse response offered when Nexon were accused of taking <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-descendant-has-decided-to-make-adjustments-to-barely-changed-destiny-2-icons">a bit too much inspiration</a> from some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> icons.</p>

              <p>There’s a new reason to revisit <em>Battlefield 2042</em>, <em>Euro Truck Simulator</em> 2 gets ported after 13 years, and I don’t need another <a href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-goty-game-awards-app-store-steam-sale-1851709617"><em>Balatro</em>-like in my life,</a> but I might make an exception for fellow dopamine drip machine <em>Raccoin</em>. Welcome to another edition of <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/morning-checkpoint">Morning Checkpoint</a>, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s round-up of gaming news and cultural discourse. Also, ongoing updates on the fate of D.C.’s most infamous sandwich slinger. A 20-person goon squad was sent to his home last Friday <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-goons-sent-swat-team-to-bust-the-dc-hoagie-hurler/">to re-arrest the guy</a>, but murals memorializing the moment <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ianlivingston.bsky.social/post/3lwmpmzwl322h">will be harder to detain</a>.</p> <h2><em>Raccoin</em> is a coin pusher for roguelike deckbuilder freaks</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="RACCOIN: Coin Pusher Roguelike | Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yy1FcT6sfIo?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Playstack’s next game is about watching coins fall off a ramp as you use special items and tricks to generate giant, super-satisfying combos. It’s certainly being presented as <em>Balatro</em> for coin-pushers, complete with a nice, quirky arcade cabinet art style. You select different characters with unique advantages and unlock special coins you can deploy to rack up bonuses. There’s a physics simulation element and lots of jingling.</p> <p>The developer is Doraccoon, and this appears to be their first game. If you’ve ever wandered by someone hunched over a coin pusher in the wild with a zombie look in their eyes and shook your head in dismay, well, hey, that could be you when<em> Raccoin</em> launches. There’s no release date yet, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3784030/RACCOIN_Coin_Pusher_Roguelike/">a free playtest on Steam is live starting August 18</a>.</p>

 <h2>Keeping <em>Anthem</em> online forever might have made it a worse game</h2> <p>Ex-BioWare producer Mark Darrah recently mused about<em> Anthem</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-bioware-dragon-age-mass-effect-1851786136">servers shutting down next year</a> in light of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/stop-killing-games-break-switch-2-cart-size-ign-layoffs-pilotwings-music-2000614692">Stop Killing Games movement</a>. Had it been designed to stay online forever, “it would have been an uglier game, probably would have had more latency issues,” he recently told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pd9OG3HmN0">YouTuber MrMattyPlays</a>. “It would have been a worse experience second-to-second in order to get something that basically wouldn’t need to ever be sunset.”</p> <p>But he also added that those tradeoffs might be worth it in the long run. “I think maybe it is that we want to be in a world where we’re willing to sacrifice some fidelity, sacrifice some things in order to get it so that games don’t just vanish one day.”</p> <h2><em>Battlefield 2042</em> gets a big surprise update called “<em>Road to&nbsp;<span>Battlefield</span> 6</em>“</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Road to Battlefield 6: Iwo Jima" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Xq0BbFJ0DU?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>EA’s last beleaguered multiplayer shooter is being repurposed into a bridge to the future. A new update that goes live today adds a new free pass full of unlockable nods to the franchise’s past as well as new rewards for <em>Battlefield 6</em>. A version of the Iwo Jima map is also returning, alongside other new content. Fans are grudgingly on board. “<span dir="auto" role="text">Okay <em>2042</em>, ill bite one last time,” wrote one YouTube commenter.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><em>Euro Truck Simulator 2</em> is coming to console</h2> <p>A PlayStation store listing for the hit highway-and-chill series <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EuroTruck2/comments/1mthopc/ets2_is_coming_to_ps5/">leaked over the weekend</a>. The PS5 version is arriving <a href="https://truck-simulator.fandom.com/wiki/Euro_Truck_Simulator_2_Version_history">over a decade</a> after the game came out, though regular updates have continued adding new vehicles and fleshing out the sprawling continental road map.</p> <h2>There’s an enhanced version of <a href="https://kotaku.com/shenmue-3-the-kotaku-review-1840175041"><em>Shenmue III</em></a> on the way</h2> <p><em>Shenmue III Enhanced</em> will have more NPCs in the streets, better graphics, menu and gameplay fixes, and a new camera mode inspired by the original two games. It also brings the game to Xbox and Switch 2, with an upgrade path for those who already own it on PC and PS4.</p>

 <h2><em>The Last Of Us</em> <em>Online</em> game director teases new multiplayer project</h2> <p>Vinit Agarwal left Naughty Dog <a href="https://kotaku.com/naughty-dog-last-us-online-vinit-agarwal-1851785806">earlier this year</a> to set up a new game studio in Japan. He recently shed more light on what fans can expect from the studio’s new project, whose team also includes fellow <em>Last of Us Online</em> lead Joe Pettinati. “A big part of what inspired me to [go independent] was seeing the potential in combining Naughty Dog’s specialty, cinematic action, with multiplayer,” he <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/08/13/155975.html">told GameSpark</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/director-of-scrapped-the-last-of-us-online-says-his-new-us-japan-studio-is-making-a-cinematic-multiplayer-title/"><em>VGC</em></a>).

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/does-helldivers-2-have-cross-progression/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/does-helldivers-2-have-cross-progression-on-xbox-playstation-pc-cross-platform-status-explained.1272846/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hell may not have frozen over, but the release of Helldivers 2 on Xbox Series X|S is rapidly approaching and shows that nothing can be ruled out. If you want to know whether the release on the platform includes cross-progression, we’ve got all the details you need.</p>



<p>Due to be released on Xbox on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-helldivers-2-release-on-xbox-exact-release-date-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 26</a>, though there are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-devs-have-no-plans-of-putting-it-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no plans to bring the title to the Game Pass service</a>, Arrowhead Games’ title is one of the biggest releases of the summer for the platform and shows a major shift in approach from Sony, which published the title.</p>



<p>If you’ve already played Helldivers 2 on PC or PlayStation and want to know whether you can transfer your progress and any unlocked content to a different platform, like Xbox, we’ve got a full explanation on the feature.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-helldivers-2-have-cross-progression">Does Helldivers 2 Have Cross-Progression?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Squad up. Image via Arrowhead Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, Helldivers 2 does not support cross-progression between platforms, and any unlocked content is only available on the existing version.</strong></p>



<p>An<a href="https://arrowhead.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/12517679456156-Does-Helldivers-2-have-cross-progression-Can-I-transfer-my-stuff-to-another-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> FAQ published by Arrowhead</a> in July, it was confirmed that any progression, including limited-time content, cannot be transferred between accounts. It was also confirmed that accounts cannot be merged.</p>



<p>This means, for example, that Xbox players will not be able to show off any content from earlier seasons in Helldivers 2, with any unlocks before the Xbox release being unavailable on the platform. However, you also can’t share your account between PlayStation and PC either.</p>



<p>Although cross-progression is unavailable, crossplay support is offered between PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, so you can play with friends regardless of their platform.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-cross-progression-be-added-to-helldivers-2">Will Cross-Progression be Added to Helldivers 2?</h2>



<p><strong>It is unlikely that cross-progression will be added to Helldivers 2, as Arrowhead stated there are “no plans to implement cross-progression at this time.”</strong></p>



<p>While you can never say never, it’s clear that cross-progression is not a priority for the development team, and if the stance were to change, it would likely take a lengthy amount of time for the feature to be implemented.</p>



<p>There could be additional demand for cross-progression following the launch of Helldivers 2 on Xbox Series X|S, particularly as many players may have opted to purchase the game on PS5 or PC due to the previous unavailability on Xbox. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/will-there-be-another-battlefield-6-open-beta/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/will-there-be-another-battlefield-6-open-beta.1272843/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Battlefield 6 community is now without BF6 content again. Two weekends of betas have seen you all rack up millions of eliminations, building destructions, and more. So let’s see if EA and Battlefield Studios are planning another Battlefield 6 beta before the game’s release window.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs</a> was a limited testing phase for BF6. Early indicators were good, but all this did was make the BF community feverish to try it out for itself. The first chance arrived with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-early-access-to-the-battlefield-6-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access Open Beta</a>. Another couple of days passed, and it was time for worldwide destruction. </p>



<p>This couldn’t have been more fitting as the BF6 beta destroyed all expectations, the game blew up, and Battlefield 6 destroyed CoD with over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-battlefield-6-conucrrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">500,000 concurrent players</a> in the betas. With the Weekend 2 beta now finished, we need to see if you get one more chance to play before launch.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-going-to-be-more-battlefield-6-betas">Is There Going to be More Battlefield 6 Betas?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It was a good run. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Battlefield 6 Comms page suggests that there will be no more Battlefield betas, and the next time you get to play BF6 is when the game comes out.</strong></p>



<p>If you’ve been playing the BF6 beta at any point, chances are you’ve been keeping up with the Battlefield Comms X page. This has been a constant source of information since day one. From <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-dlss-dlaa-not-working-issue-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DLSS and DLAA updates</a> to general bulletins on matchmaking, it has provided up-to-date details.</p>



<p>On August 18, it posted what appeared to be a farewell message on <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> for BF6 beta testing:</p>



<p>“Thank you all for playing throughout these Open Beta weekends. You made this truly special for us as you captured flags, controlled sectors, blew holes in buildings, charged into combat, nailed vehicles with RPGs, dove into fire to resurrect a teammate, sniped from different angles, pushed the line forward in tanks, and circled the battlefield in aerial combat. You truly showcased the huge variety of action-packed gameplay that is coming in Battlefield 6.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-battlefield-6-come-out">When Does Battlefield 6 Come Out?</h2>



<p><strong>Battlefield 6 is due for release on October 10, and this is likely the next time you get to play BF6.</strong></p>



<p>Unless something catastrophic happens between now and October 10, I think it’s a case of waiting a while until the full launch, as there won’t be any more betas. Battlefield Labs testing lasted many weeks. Thousands of hours were accrued during the Open Betas, too. I would hazard a guess that Battlefield Studios has accumulated all the data and feedback it needs.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Servers Closing Down Soon

The playlist options and game servers for Open Beta Weekend 2 will begin closing down in 1 hour at 12:00 UTC. Once the shut down starts, you’ll be able to continue to play until your match ends.

                <p>Pokemon's video game competitive scene has an onboarding problem.</p><p dir="ltr">It's had one since the birth of the Pokemon Video Game Championship (VGC for short) in 2008 due to hidden mechanics, tedious grinding, and some devious RNG. Now, almost two decades later, The Pokemon Company has the opportunity to make competitive Pokemon the most approachable it's ever been. Thanks to Pokemon Champions, a battle simulator akin to Pokemon Stadium coming to Switch and mobile, players will be able to quickly and efficiently train and battle Pokemon. Not only that, but at the Pokemon World Championship last weekend The Pokemon Company announced that it will be the official way to compete in 2026's Worlds.</p><p dir="ltr">This is huge.</p><p dir="ltr">For the uninitiated, getting a Pokemon "competitive ready" isn't as simple as catching one. Factors such as Nature, Individual Values, and Effort Values can affect a Pokemon's stats and all must be considered when training. On top of this, abilities and movesets can drastically change a Pokemon's use case. Two identical Pokemon could have wildly different stats and moves in order to fill different roles on a team. For example, a Gyrados with a high speed stat, Intimidate (an ability that lowers opposing Pokemon's attack), and Thunder Wave could serve as a support Pokemon that weakens tough opponents and slows them down with paralysis. Meanwhile, a Gyrados with a high attack stat, Moxie (an ability that increases the user's attack after each knockout), and Earthquake could snowball into a serious threat. The problem is, apart from moves and abilities, stat information isn't clearly presented in-game. Every generation--especially Pokemon Sword and Shield and Scarlet and Violet--have made minimal efforts to simplify the process with new items and mechanics.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4551437-tempimageinokif.gif" data-ref-id="1300-4551437" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="4032" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4551437-tempimageinokif.gif" data-ref-id="1300-4551437"></a><figcaption>A giant Pikachu hanging over the crowd at Pokemon Worlds 2025</figcaption></figure><p dir="ltr">And with those additions being so minor, competitive play can still be daunting. Building out a team in Scarlet and Violet--assuming you've completed the story and have plentiful resources--can take hours. Building a <em>good</em> team can take weeks, if not months. Because of this, many players turn to fanmade, web-based battle simulators like <a href="https://pokemonshowdown.com/" rel="nofollow ">Pokemon Showdown</a> in order to quickly build and test out different teams before committing the time and resources to create the team in-game. As someone who is entrenched in the competitive world, this makes sense. This is how things have been done for years, and because getting a Pokemon competitive ready has become marginally easier over the years, it doesn't seem too bad. However, all it takes is a small step back to realize that for the vast majority of Pokemon players, the competitive scene is still inscrutable.</p><p dir="ltr">Let's say you want to build a team around Raging Bolt in Pokemon Scarlet. For starters, in order to catch one, you'll need to complete the game, most of its DLC, and the Blueberry Academy Pokedex. Then you'll need to invest hours tweaking its stats through grinding or copious amounts of Pokemon dollars. Next you'll need to find or craft the TMs needed for your desired moveset. Finally, you'll need to give it an item that gels with its playstyle. All told, this can take hours, and you'll need to do it at least five more times to build out a competitive team. A few weeks ago I did a video about <a href="https://youtu.be/iqxKW0Cid0U?si=9gn7vz7jdW_G0kRG" rel="nofollow ">why I have 500 hours in Pokemon Violet</a>. This is why.</p><p dir="ltr">Enter Pokemon Champions. Based on the <a href="https://champions.pokemon.com/en-us/" rel="nofollow ">official website</a>, Champions aims to keep the strategic depth of the mainline series while making it much easier to train and alter a Pokemon's stats. Once you've recruited a Pokemon (or transferred one from Pokemon Home), you can use the training feature to manually adjust stats like attack and defense, change their nature (or stat alignment, as it appears on the website), and swap moves and abilities. All of these actions cost Victory Points, which can be earned by battling and <em>cannot</em> be purchased. As of this writing, we don't know how much VP you'll get for battling and what the in-game economy will look like; regardless, the entire training process looks far more streamlined--even if there's still some math involved.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4551438-img_4676.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551438" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4551438-img_4676.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551438"></a><figcaption>The EV spread for Tyranitar. It has full HP investment, a lot of Attack investment, and a little bit of speed.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4551438-img_4676.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">On top of a Pokemon's base stats, there's something called Effort Values. Buried in a Pokemon’s Summary page you can technically track a Pokemon’s EVs, but it doesn’t give you an actual number value making it functionally useless. Every four Effort Values gained through battling--or specific items, like vitamins or feathers--equates to one stat point. Any Pokemon can have up to 510 EVs with no more than 252 on a single stat. If you bust out a calculator, you'll quickly realize that the math doesn't math. If you do an even EV split across two stats, you'll have six EVs left, and because four EVs equal one stat point, two of those points do nothing. If these numbers make your head spin, Google the damage calculation formula--it's wild.</p><p dir="ltr">Pokemon Champions, at least on the surface, does away with Effort Values and lets you allocate 66 stat points (with a max of 32 per stat) across your Pokemon as you see fit. That means that if you fully invest into Special Attack and Speed, you'll have two stat points left over instead of one. This may seem insignificant, but one extra stat point can be the difference between a knockout and an extra turn.</p><p dir="ltr">I realize I'm getting into the nitty gritty here, but for decades now competitive Pokemon has been gated by these hidden stats and obtuse mechanics. As a longtime fan, it's been frustrating because the competitive side is the most exhilarating part, but the barrier to entry has always been thick. If Champions manages to capture the casual audience and get them to engage with Pokemon's deeper battling mechanics, it could energize millions of Pokemon fans to take the leap into the competitive scene.</p><p dir="ltr">If that's not enough of an incentive, consider things from a financial point of view. In order to compete in Pokemon battles, you need to own a Nintendo Switch and Pokemon Scarlet or Violet. If you want to keep up with the meta you'll likely need both versions to cover for version-exclusive Pokemon. Pokemon Champions, however, is a free-to-play app coming to mobile and the Nintendo Switch. Meaning, you don't even need to own a Nintendo console or Pokemon game to compete.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4551442-f43ebd5cdac98ed79b9e15c399b87e2c0d354757906f90eb3bd02aa01edc01e8.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4551442" data-ratio="0.56290322580645" data-width="1240" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4551442-f43ebd5cdac98ed79b9e15c399b87e2c0d354757906f90eb3bd02aa01edc01e8.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4551442"></a><figcaption>The key art for Pokemon Champions</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4551442-f43ebd5cdac98ed79b9e15c399b87e2c0d354757906f90eb3bd02aa01edc01e8.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are still a lot of questions, though. The most recent trailer showed off how to reallocate stat points, but what about Individual Values? These are inherent stats that a Pokemon is caught or hatched with. They can be maxed, but doing so can require significant resources. A simple solution would be to set every Pokemon's IVs in Champions to 31 (the max value). However, this would limit the Trick Room strategy, a technique in which trainers enable their slowest Pokemon to go first. Naturally, a lot of Trick Room teams revolve around using Pokemon with zero speed IVs, meaning that if two Torkoals are out on the field, the one with zero speed IVs would move first under trick room. Without IVs, every Torkoal with zero speed investment would result in a speed tie, which leaves attack priority to a coin flip.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, we haven't seen anything official around held items. Like abilities and stats, a held item can dramatically change a Pokemon's role. A Dragonite with a Choice Band can hit harder than a standard Dragonite, but the Choice Band locks it into one move. Alternatively, one with a Silk Scarf boosts normal type moves making Extreme Speed even deadlier and doesn't lock Dragonite into one attack.</p><p dir="ltr">What about bespoke mechanics like Z-Moves and Dynamax; will those be represented? Terastalization and Mega Evolutions are there--and that makes sense given that's what Scarlet and Violet and Legends: Z-A are centered around--but can players use Z-Moves? How will it handle new Pokemon generations? Will every Pokemon be usable in Champions? I have a lot of questions, but in order for this to be the best way to experience Pokemon battles, it needs parity with the current generation. When the next generation drops, Pokemon Champions needs to reflect those new competitive defining mechanics as quickly as possible if it intends to keep competitive players engaged.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4551443-img_4398.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551443" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4551443-img_4398.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551443"></a><figcaption>A shiny, competitive ready Metagross in Pokemon Violet</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4551443-img_4398.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">And then there's the monetization of a free-to-play game looming over everything. If Pokemon Champions is free-to-play, what does the monetization look like? The Pokemon Company has already confirmed that you won't be able to purchase Victory Points with real money. And while this likely means you won't be able to train or recruit Pokemon using a credit card, surely the company will implement <em>some </em>means of bringing in cash. Hopefully this is limited to cosmetics.</p><p dir="ltr">So where does Pokemon Worlds, the official yearly championship competition, fit into all this? For starters, once Champions is implemented into the official tournaments, it could explode. It's steadily gotten bigger thanks to streamlined mechanics and big personalities like Wolfe Glick, but it's only tapped into a fraction of the player base. As of 2025, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet has sold over 27 million units. Obviously, not everyone comes to a Pokemon game for combat, but shattering the barrier to entry could motivate a latent audience to dive into competitive.</p><p>Pokemon often gets derided by older fans for being <em>too </em>easy. I can't argue with this. The story is designed for players of all ages after all. However, there is an immense amount of depth in competitive battling that people often overlook. A few years ago Wolfe Glick, arguably the best Pokemon player in the world, released a video titled "<a href="https://youtu.be/71BG08fOEwg?si=RDUbdO1HLyBDWVf5" rel="nofollow ">Pokemon is Way More Complex Than You Know</a>." In it, he compares it to chess and breaks down how all the mechanics and the intense mental game interact in order to create one of the deepest combat systems of all time. The depth and difficulty is there, and always has been for folks willing to push through the barriers, but I can't blame people for writing it off. Selfishly, as a longtime Pokemon fan, I just hope Pokemon Champions will be enough to finally convince more of my friends to give competitive Pokemon a shot.</p>
