More like space the final funtier am I right (cue canned laughter that goes on a touch too long)? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/besiege">Besiege</a>, the physics <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">building game</a> about building all manner of medieval machinery to destroy your enemy, has taken you to all kinds of lands and with its 2024 expansion, The Splintered Sea, a few oceans too. But with its newly revealed follow-up expansion, there's nowhere to go but up (because it's set in space, hence my absolutely hilarious opening line).
</p>
<p>
This next expansion, only sort of shown off in a brief teaser trailer, is called "The Broken Beyond," and sees you doing your usual thing of putting some wood and metal together until you've got something that could wipe out an army, but against aliens this time. "Put your engineering talents to the test as you master space flight, navigating gravitational fields, avoiding asteroids and other challenges using a suite of exciting new blocks," the expansion's Steam page description explains.

There's a new campaign to play through where you'll head to different planets, build some spacecrafts, and presumably make a space catapult. You'll also find new space themed blocks, a new sandbox to play around with, and suitably, some new physics mechanics. Details are slim aside from that, but I'm quite tickled by the commitment to sticking with that medieval aesthetic even in the far corners of the galaxy. It's certainly not a vibe for those who are particular about anachronisms, but to them I say find a different hobby.
</p><p>
The expansion doesn't have a release date as of yet, though its trailer says it should be coming in Q2 this year, so you don't have all that long to wait ultimately. And if you like, you can add it to your infinitely growing Steam wishlist right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3639470/Besiege_The_Broken_Beyond/">here</a>.

              <p><a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-une-grosse-exclusivite-ps5-debarque-ce-mois-de-fevrier-61029"><i><span>Dealabs</span></i></a> <span>is reporting that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-spider-man-2-review-ps5-venom-miles-morales-1850929271"><i><span>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</span></i></a><span> is coming to PlayStation Plus this month. So if you have a subscription and still haven’t gotten around to Insomniac’s latest open-world superhero romp, it sounds like you’ll be able to play it soon for free.</span></p> <p><span>Though Sony hasn’t announced it yet, </span><i><span>Dealabs</span></i><span> says that </span><i><span>Spider-Man 2</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Neva </span></i><span>will be part of February’s PlayStation Plus offerings. </span><i><span>Spider-Man 2 </span></i><span>is obviously the headliner, and it’s also coming to the service at a pretty opportune time, as the next game in Insomniac’s Marvel universe is imminent. </span><i><span>Wolverine </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvels-wolverine-trailer-ps5-release-date-bloody-2000628275"><span>is coming to PS5</span></a><span> later this year and while it won’t star Peter Parker and Miles Morales, it will take place in the same shared universe, so there will likely be a nod or two to the Spider-Men’s stories.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Spider-Man 2 </span></i><span>launched on PS5 in 2023, then came to PC </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-2-pc-steam-psn-login-nycc-2024-ps5-1851676683"><span>a little under two years later</span></a><span>.

The first two games, </span><i><span>Spider-Man </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Spider-Man: Miles Morales</span></i><span>, are both part of the PlayStation Plus catalog if you have an Extra or Premium membership, so the whole series will be available to you if you’re a subscriber.</span></p> <p><span>We’ll probably get official confirmation from Sony this week, especially with the State of Play presentation </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-showcase-sony-marvel-wolverine-release-date-2000666866"><span>scheduled for Thursday</span></a><span>. I can already see them showing off new footage of </span><i><span>Wolverine</span></i><span>, giving that game a release date, and being like, “Hey, you can play all of Insomniac’s other Marvel games now on PlayStation Plus.” Brand synergy, ya know?</span></p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/marvel-cosmic-invasion-update-adds-crossover-character-palettes-here-are-the-full-patch-notes</link>
            <guid>1431397</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>

<p>Well, that didn't take too long! After launching on the Switch eShop back in December, Dotemu and Tribute Games have today updated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a> to ver. 1.0.5, bundling in a fresh batch of hero colour palettes to boot.</p>
<p>The 'Cosmic Collabs' update includes a new wardrobe option for 12 of the 15-hero roster, each inspired by a different Marvel game. Spider-Man and Venom each get a crossover fit from <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/marvel_rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, Black Panther and Rocket Racoon take theirs from <strong>Marvel Snap</strong> art, She-Hulk and Wolverine's new looks come from <strong>Marvel Strike Force</strong>, Captain America and Nova take inspiration from <strong>Marvel Future Fight</strong>, Phyla-Vell and Beta Ray Bill's palettes are all about <strong>Marvel Contest of Champions</strong>, and even <strong>Marvel Puzzle Quest</strong> gets a nod in Storm and Iron Man's fresh threads.</p>
<p>Of course, that's not all. The update also includes its fair share of bug fixes, gameplay tweaks, and new features, so you can be sure things are running smoother than ever before as you put these new palettes to the test.</p>
<p>The full patch notes were shared on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2753970?emclan=103582791475080003&amp;emgid=519737782627731794">Steam</a>, and we have gathered them together for you to check out below:</p>
<h2>Marvel Cosmic Invasion Ver. 1.0.5 (10th Feb 2025)</h2>
<h3><strong>Epic MARVEL Games Collaborations!</strong></h3>
<p>We’re bringing in tributes to our favourite MARVEL Games experiences, including palettes for:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>MARVEL Rivals</strong></em> - Spider-Man and Venom</li>
<li><em><strong>MARVEL Snap</strong></em> - Black Panther and Rocket Raccoon</li>
<li><em><strong>MARVEL Strike Force</strong></em> - She-Hulk and Wolverine</li>
<li><em><strong>MARVEL Future Fight</strong></em> - Captain America and Nova</li>
<li><em><strong>MARVEL Contest of Champions</strong></em> - Phyla-Vell and Beta Ray Bill</li>
<li><em><strong>MARVEL Puzzle Quest</strong></em> - Storm and Iron Man</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>New Features!</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hero Lab Upgrades</strong> - with new palette previews to help you get a great view of new cosmetic options, and a new Team Level indicator.</li>
<li><strong>Tweaked Arcade Modifiers</strong> - swinging into danger with modifications. The Double HP modifier is now an HP Multiplier - where enemy HP can now be multiplied by 0.5, 1, 2 or 3 times their standard amount!</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Gameplay Improvements!</strong></h3>
<p>We’ve made a number of visual changes based on your feedback, designed to make it easier for you to keep up with the on-screen action, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heroes will now be highlighted when HP is low</li>
<li>The Focus bar has been split to make it easier to read</li>
<li>Special Damage number visuals have been changed to red - making them easier to identify</li>
<li>The Heteropteron Level Larva Bug has been tweaked to make the enemy stand out. In addition, we’ve added flashes on the Larva during throw animations and introduced colour cycling effects on the attack!</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve also taken some time to go back for further balancing on boss fights, tweaking these to provide a little more fair play:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hela</strong> - Increasing cooldowns for both Grudge and Hellblades attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Venom</strong> - Reducing block and parry actions and removing combo parry, increasing reaction cooldown, lowering damage on the Bite attack and removing some post-Grudge attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Phyla-Vell</strong> - Reducing block actions and lowering chance of using Cosmic Attack. We’ve also added cooldown on some attacks, increased the cooldown on cosmic Fury and lengthened the initial block action to prevent instant parry.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Bug Fixes!</strong></h3>
<p>As well as all this, we’re squashing some bugs of our own!</p>

<li>Fixed an out-of-bounds issue when performing a dive attack during Master Mold’s Double Fist move</li>

<p>Marvel Rivals is ready to launch Season 6.5. A new hero joins the action, Team-Up abilities change, and more.</p>



<p>Launching on February 13, Elsa Bloodstone will join the action as a Duelist. The news was announced in a social media video presented by GuangGuang from the development team.</p>

<h2 id="h-changes-to-the-team-up-abilities-in-marvel-rivals">Changes to the Team-Up Abilities in Marvel Rivals</h2>

<p>Bloodstone will team with Deadpool for a new attack that forces enemies to hear Deadpool’s non-stop talking.</p>



<p>The Thing has been added to Hulk’s Gamma Charge Team-Up, and Mr. Fantastic joins the Rocket Network team-up with Rocket Raccoon and Star-Lord.</p>

"I'm still playing now," he added. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/10/gettyimages-82648008-1770741008273.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ghost in the Shell director Mamoru Oshii. Image credit: Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So what is the appeal of Fallout 4 to Mamoru Oshii? The 74-year-old called it a "game that seems to have been made for my own desires," and described how he wanders the ruins of the post-apocalyptic world carrying a rifle and accompanied by the game's canine companion, Dogmeat.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of Fallout 4, Oshi explains that he's also a big Hideo Kojima fan and plays every new game from the Metal Gear Solid creator — he recently finished playing Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, in which he actually appears as an NPC known as The Pizza Chef. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But for almost a decade, Oshi said he had followed a cycle where he breaks off from playing Fallout 4 to play Kojima's new game upon release, completes it, and then... returns back to Fallout 4 once more. "There are no other games I want to play," Oshii simply said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I once tried PUBG and racked up 250 hours," he casually noted, but said that he didn't really like online multiplayer games or first-person shooters that require quick reflexes. "They're not for me," he noted.  (He does recall taking a commemorative screenshot after getting a Chicken Dinner in PUBG, but only once.) "After all is said and done, I prefer playing games on my own," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Fallout 4 is just right," he continued. "Although it's an action game, as people who play it will know — it has the VATS system." Fallout's slo-mo aiming system allows even people who are no good at aiming to land shots, he suggested. "If the game didn't have this, I probably couldn't play it." </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fallout 4 Next-Gen Update Makeshift Weapon Pack Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mamoru Oshii previously revealed in great detail to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/yes-ghost-in-the-shells-director-is-obsessed-with-fallout-4-and-we-have-a-record-of-his-chaotic-escapades-in-the-game-penned-by-the-man-himself/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a> that he has a rather eccentric way of playing Fallout 4 - that he doesn't ally with any factions, and has ignored the main storyline in favor of spending hours on side quests and raids with Dogmeat as his sole companion. His playstyle seems to be that of a community-minded lone wolf, stripping all the gear off raiders and gunners. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's a win-win," he noted, "I get to enjoy the pleasure of stripping scumbags naked while also contributing to the local community’s welfare." He's said that he is particularly hostile towards Brotherhood of Steel members (who he likens to Nazis) and always sneak kills whole units (at one point, he amassed so many Brotherhood of Steel Power Armors that he used them to build a moat). Back when he played on console, Oshii apparently gathered so much loot at his base that his PS4 struggled to run the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Around 4 years ago, I ran out of things to do (in Fallout 4)," Oshii explained. "So I installed mods." However, the Angel's Egg director noted that Fallout 4's new version (i.e. the 2025 Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition update) rendered his mods unusable. Upon launching Fallout 4 after the update, Oshii says that instead of his customized character, "some random bald guy wearing a suit suddenly appeared, and it took a lot of effort to get the game back to normal. I wish they'd stop changing things without asking."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

So what makes CrossWorlds stand out? It "fires on all cylinders with a fantastic roster, excellent courses, and lengthy list of customization options." And as for Sonic X Shadow Generations, it "takes an already excellent game and spring jumps it to new heights with a creative Shadow campaign and an appreciable graphical upgrade."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other hand, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-superstars-review">Sonic Superstars</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-frontiers-review">Sonic Frontiers</a> each earned a 7 in their respective reviews. Griffin found that Sonic Superstars "has a mix of both interesting and ill-advised new ideas, making it an enjoyable Sonic game but not exactly a Super one." Sonic Frontiers was reviewed by writer Travis Northup, who said it's "an ambitious open-world adventure that mostly succeeds at mixing up the Sonic formula, even when some of its ideas fall flat."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No matter what kind of Sonic adventure you're looking to drop into, these offers seem well worth taking advantage of before they're gone.

Clearly, work has now begun on Fares' next game — and intriguingly, he seems to be doing his best to disguise who the actors are. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With his arm outstretched and thumb raised, Fares is successfully blocking most of all three actors' faces — and this appears to be by design. "Next game in the making," Fares captioned the post, with a thumbs up emoji. "We're back in the kitchen, cookin' up something really delicious," the official Hazelight Studios social media account responded, adding: "Now with Strategic Arm Placement Tech."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>✌️We’re back in the kitchen, cookin’ up something really delicious! 🥘</p><p>Now with Strategic Arm Placement Tech®️</p></div>— Hazelight Studios (@HazelightGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/HazelightGames/status/2021176093907009637?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 10, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of Fares' games have commented on the post to say they are suitably uncertain who the actors involved might be — though many more have noted the fact that Fares is using this first sneak peek to showcase <em>three </em>actors being visible. Could this signify a three-player game, after the studio's recent focus on titles featuring a pair of prominent characters?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Three-player Hazelight Game?" wondered one fan, Spenny99. "It Takes Three?????" questioned Jcbartlett25. "It Takes Three lookin great Mr. Fares," added hotpicklepizza.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Co-op adventure Split Fiction launched last year to rave reviews, and went on to sell more than 4 million copies. Its story focuses on a pair of writers, Zoe and Mio, who become trapped in their interweaving sci-fi and fantasy narratives. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"An expertly crafted co-op adventure that pinballs from one genre extreme to another, Split Fiction is a rollercoaster of constantly refreshed gameplay ideas and styles – and one that’s very hard to walk away from," IGN wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/split-fiction-review">Split Fiction review</a>, awarding the game 9/10. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fares' previous game It Takes Two also proved popular, with its story focused on a husband and wife who plan to get a divorce. We called it "a beautiful, breakneck-paced, co-op adventure that’s bubbling over with creativity," in IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-two-review">It Takes Two review</a>, which also returned a 9/10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before that, Fares previously released prison escape adventure A Way Out, starring two convicts, and Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, starring... two sons. Should Fares actually be making a three-player game, it would indeed be a break from the norm.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-so-do-you-prefer-hollow-knight-or-silksong</link>
            <guid>1431355</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="afbb73de2ace7"><a title="Hollow Knight vs Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/afbb73de2ace7/hollow-knight-vs-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Despite pledging that we'd take a break from games of this ilk when we finished pouring blood, sweat and tears into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> last year, Team Cherry has somehow found a way of dragging us back in with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, we put the halls of Hallownest behind us for good many years ago now, but the promise of buttery smooth performance had us flying back to it like a Markoth to a flame — <em>mmm, "additional effects"</em>. The more we played, the more we remembered just how much we love this world, these characters, this floaty little knight.</p>
<p>'Oh no,' we suddenly realised, ' without the performance argument in our arsenal, there's nothing stopping us from asking the ultimate question: do we prefer Hollow Knight or Silksong?'</p>
<p>When Silksong launched last year, it felt like a foregone conclusion. In this sequel, Team Cherry had done everything in its power to take what made the first game so wonderful, and make it even <em>wonderfuller</em>. Hornet is quicker and more acrobatic than the Knight. Her tools open more combat possibilities than we ever thought possible. The map makes Hallownest feel piddly.</p>
<p>We even said as much in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our 10/10 review</a>: "It elevates map design and purposeful challenge effortlessly, and is an improvement on Hollow Knight in every single way." And yes, for reference, we <em>only</em> awarded its predecessor a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/hollow-knight">9/10</a>.</p>
<p>But, returning to Hallownest on Switch 2 in recent days, our preference isn't quite as clean cut as it was back in September, when the long-awaited Silksong was still so shiny and new in our hands. The map may be smaller, but it feels just as dense. The overarching narrative of the fallen kingdom is sublimely woven into your surroundings, with a simplicity that's tough to knock. And can anything ever truly replicate the feeling of pure dread experienced with your first steps into Deepnest?</p>
<figure data-uuid="2ec88e322390e"><a title="Hollow Knight / Silksong Bench" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2ec88e322390e/hollow-knight-silksong-bench.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>So... come here often? — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honestly, there are voices for both sides of the argument here at Nintendo Life Towers, so we thought it was only right to throw it out to you, our lovely readers.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Later this week, <strong>Sony</strong> is set to host its first <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/">State of Play</a> </strong>event of 2026. This hour-long showcase will include several announcements we could guess at, and many we won't be able to, but a new report from <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-une-grosse-exclusivite-ps5-debarque-ce-mois-de-fevrier-61029">Billbil-kun at Dealabs</a> has pretty much cemented one of the announcements that we'll see at Thursday's show (if we don't see it tomorrow): the games entering the <strong>PS Plus Extra Catalog</strong> for February 2026. Which, according to the report, will be headlined by <strong>Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</strong></p>



<p>The first of <strong>Insomniac's</strong> Spider-Man titles, <strong>Marvel's Spider-Man</strong> (the remastered variant, that is), entered the PS Plus Extra library of games <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-extra-premium-august-2025-mortal-kombat-1-marvels-spider-man-remastered/">back in <strong>August 2025</strong></a>. With <strong>Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales</strong> already included in the catalog, this means that players who sign up for the second tier of <strong>PlayStation's</strong> subscription service will be able to play all three of Insomniac's Spider-Man games so far.</p>



<p>Spider-Man 2 isn't the only game mentioned in the Dealabs report, as it also cites that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/neva-the-gris-follow-up-from-nomada-studio-receives-beautiful-new-gameplay-trailer/">Neva</a>,</strong> the follow-up to the critically acclaimed <strong>Gris</strong> from <strong>Nomada Studio</strong>, will enter the catalog alongside Spider-Man 2, as will <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown/">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a></strong>.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🚨 EXCLUSIVE 🚨</p><p>A big PS5 Console Exclusive is Coming to PS Plus Extra (Game Catalog)</p><p>Yes, it will be<br>🕷️ Marvel's Spider-Man 2</p><p>We reveal 2 other headliners in our latest report<br>(Other titles may be revealed tomorrow or during next State of Play)<a href="https://t.co/BqKAr24wqR">https://t.co/BqKAr24wqR</a></p></div>— billbil-kun (@billbil_kun) <a href="https://twitter.com/billbil_kun/status/2021255882273620133?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>There will undoubtedly be more games than just those three entering the catalog, but those are the only ones mentioned in the report. Normally, it's worth taking any leaks you see ahead of showcases like Thursday's upcoming State of Play with a grain of salt, but in this case, you'll want to add more salt to the pile. Dealabs and Billbil-kun have an extremely strong record of revealing PS Plus news ahead of time.</p>



<p>So, at least in this case, we can bet that we'll see Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Neva, and Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown as part of the PS Plus Extra games for February 2026.</p>



<p>PS Plus subscribers at every tier can already enjoy <strong>Undisputed, Ultros, Subnautica: Below Zero</strong> and <strong>Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown</strong> as part of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-essential-february-2026-games-undisputed-ace-combat-subnautica-ultros/">PS Plus Essential games</a> for February 2026 (which, unsurprisingly, were leaked ahead of time by Dealabs).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Scarlet Hollow </em>Episode 5, which was originally set to debut in its entirety later this week, will instead be releasing in two parts, developer and publisher Black Tabby Games has announced.</p><p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1609230/view/519737782627731799" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a post</a> on Steam, the studio says that Episode 5's first part will still be launching on Friday (which, appropriately enough, is the 13th of the month), but that the second half will now be arriving on February 20th, one week later.</p><p>The split is happening because "the art for the ending" of the fifth episode "has taken a little bit longer than [Black Tabby has] anticipated", according to the studio, and so rather than rushing the climax or delaying the entire episode, the decision has been made to cut the fifth chapter in two.</p><figure role="group">

<p>According to Black Tabby, the first part of Episode 5 "is still roughly the size of all of Episode 4", so if you are still planning to dive into the fifth episode on Friday, there should still be plenty to keep you occupied.</p><p>Black Tabby says the split release will also have the added benefit of allowing <em>Scarlet Hollow</em>'s community to theorize and digest the events of the fifth episode, promising "twists and revelations" as part of the chapter.</p><p>Just in case you're unfamiliar with <em>Scarlet Hollow</em>, it's a horror visual novel from Black Tabby Games, the developer behind <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slay-princess-sales-1m-scarlet-hollow-100k" rel="nofollow">the breakout hit</a> <em>Slay the Princess</em>.</p><p>Unlike that game, <em>Scarlet Hollow </em>is episodic, and not all of its episodes are out yet; the game is planned to span seven chapters, with four currently available and the fifth now arriving across the next two weeks.</p>
<p>If you'd like to get caught up with <em>Scarlet Hollow </em>ahead of the fifth episode's release on Friday (and then the climax's arrival next week), you can pick the game up right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1609230/Scarlet_Hollow/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam</a>.

            <p>
The single most offputting thing about a game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, i.e. an extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>, is that every single other person you meet in-game is Schrödinger's asshole. They could be a friend who you share a story or some loot with, or they could mercilessly gun you down at the drop of a hat. It's certainly not for everyone, but in the game's latest update, a new PvE event has arrived encouraging everyone to walk hand in hand together to defeat those big bad bots.
</p>
<p>
This new event is called Shared Watch, described in-world as an "annual holiday that reminds us of the true enemy, by celebrating those that look out for their fellow Raiders. Tolerate, team-up, or take out some Arc - it’s all in the spirit of the Shared Watch." The event is running from right now as you read this, through to February 24, and anyone that destroys, helps to destroy, or simply damages any Arcs can earn merits and rewards for doing so. However, killing others in PvP encounters won't get you anything, obviously to discourage you from doing so.
</p>
<p>
It's an interesting choice to leave friendly fire on, and I think conceptually one I broadly agree with. In an ideal world more people will help others than debilitate them, though the odd griefer is still all but guaranteed. This does raise questions as to how developer Embark should handle such people - are they shunned or punished for their nastiness, or are they ignored and the law of the people takes precedence? A moral quandary that will come to light in the coming days.
</p>
<p>
Outside of this, the Cold Snap map condition is returning to the rotation, so dress up warmly if you're heading out. You'll also be able to pick up the Vulpine and Slugger cosmetic sets. There's a few fixes and tweaks in this update, like an annoying issue where some couldn't reconnect after disconnecting from a game, and another where crafting would just randomly be cancelled. You can read the full patch notes on this handy blog post right <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-15-0">here</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[10 Things I Wish I Knew Before Starting Mewgenics]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-tips-beginnner-guide-roguelite-poop-2000667291</link>
            <guid>1431334</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The latest game from&nbsp;<em>The Binding of Isaac&nbsp;</em>creator Edmund McMillen is out today, a roguelite unlike any other in which you must master the RPG-like turn-based battles of a group of cats, who upon victory will all immediately retire and require you to start over with their kitten spawn. Think&nbsp;<em>Rogue Legacy</em> meets&nbsp;<em>Slay the Spire</em> but played like <em>X-COM</em>. With poop. So much poop. Here’s a bunch of stuff I’d love to have already known when I started playing.</p> <hr> <figure id="attachment_2000667314" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000667314"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000667314">© Edmund McMillen, Tyler Glaiel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Never fall in love</h2> <p>So the central conceit of&nbsp;<em>Mewgenics</em> is that you don’t get to keep your cats. While it’s so tempting to think of them like a deck in a deckbuilding roguelite, and thus start to rely on particular aspects of a particular kitten’s abilities, or even more the way two or three cats’ skillsets can seamlessly work together to create one-two-three punches that dominate in battles, they’re always going to be cruelly taken away from you. If you <em>do</em> have the purrfect team, all that means is you’re going to reach a new goal, defeat a new location, and as such be forced to return home and see your menagerie retire. And even if you try to recreate it, pick a Hunter, Cleric and Fighter like last time and set up that same synergy, they’ll have different skills, spells, and abilities next time out. That teleport you’d built your whole game around? Nope, you don’t have that now. And even if you did, your Fighter won’t be able to spawn rocks this time, and…It’s about letting go, moving on, never getting attached.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Food goes down faster than you think</h2> <p>At the start of the game you’ll have 50 portions of cat food, and it seems like it’ll last forever. Each cat requires one portion per day, and when you’ve got just four of them in the house you feel safe for the foreseeable future. But after, say, another four nights you’ll now have at least eight cats via the arrival of strays, and likely another two or three kittens by the magic of nature. That’s at least 10 cats to feed per night, and your supplies have already dwindled getting here. So pick up food whenever you can. It’s gathered while out on adventures, but that of course requires either successfully reaching a goal farther than you’ve been before, or abandoning a run after a boss and not making vital progress. So when you see it on the shelves in the stores, grab it. In fact, think about saving up for that 100 coin expansion to your food supply stores with some urgency. I wish I’d done that straight away.</p> <hr> <h2>You need to clean up poop</h2> <p>To say that&nbsp;<em>Mewgenics</em> is obsessed with poop is to understate things. This is a game where poo plays a vital role in battles, used to boost your cats, or to block tiles. Then there’s the pee, and the farts, and well, it’s an Edmund McMillen game. But given this fecal focus, it’s odd that it forgets to tell you early on how important it is to remove it from your base. The cats’ wellbeing depends on a bunch of factors, including the furniture you add later in proceedings, but early on the simplest way to keep them happy and healthy is to click on the sweet curlers to make them disappear.</p>

 <hr> <figure id="attachment_2000667310" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000667310"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000667310">© Edmund McMillen, Tyler Glaiel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Middle click for clarity</h2> <p>Something I stumbled on quite by mistake, as&nbsp;<em>Mewgenics</em> didn’t mention it, is that holding the middle mouse button down offers a far clearer view of what’s happening in any battle. (It’s Y on a controller.) The game is splendidly drawn, but it’s also very cluttered. Holding down the middle button causes a level to represent itself like a far simpler board game, with red counters for enemy positions and green counters for your squad. This is so very, very helpful when trying to get a clearer idea of the challenge, especially when so many enemies can be teeny maggots or flies, pretty much the same color as the background, not least when they’re hidden in long grass or behind a rock. Hold down that button, get a good sense of the situation, and then crack on.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Eat stuff you find on the ground</h2> <p>Like in life, you’ll be far better off if you pick up any food you see lying on the ground and eat it. While it’s generally a good idea to have one of your cats be a Cleric on any run, since that’s the most reliable source of vital healing, it’s not the only way to improve health. Levels tend to be covered in all sorts of debris, and a lot of it turns out to be edible. Hover you mouse over anything and it’ll pop up letting you know if you can eat it, and if a cat stands on that tile it’ll automatically gobble it up. This can make a really big difference, and is too easy to forget when thinking about the 790 other vital parts of positioning for battles, causing you to over-rely on your healer.</p> <hr> <figure id="attachment_2000667312" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000667312"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000667312">© Edmund McMillen, Tyler Glaiel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Kill the birds</h2> <p>Birds on the battlefield are an early mystery. You’ll immediately assume they’re part of the enemy team, but that’s not the case at all. They are in fact neutral, appearing with a grey counter when you middle-click (a great way to be sure they’re not enemies), and as such will most likely leave you alone but for annoyingly taking up a tile. But kill them anyway! They fly off of their own accord a few rounds in to any battle, so you need to prioritize them, but not only will they likely drop useful items but they’ll also see the killing kitty’s stats all increase for doing so. That can be a big advantage, especially when taking on mini-bosses or especially irritating foes.</p>

 <hr> <h2>This game is way bigger than you think</h2> <p>It’s tempting, given the&nbsp;<em>Slay the Spire</em>-like delivery of the paths down which you adventure, to assume&nbsp;<em>Mewgenics</em> is about mastering those levels and then trying to outdo your previous runs. But that’s not it at all: this is a game far more focused on progress. And there’s a lot more of it than you’re expecting. Not only does each level have multiple routes through of varying difficulty, but there are far more of them than you might imagine. A great way to make this clear to yourself is to play non-stop for six hours, then go look at your save game to see it tell you that you’ve completed eight percent of the game. There’s <em>so</em> much to find in here, and it wants you to find it.</p> <hr> <figure id="attachment_2000667311" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000667311"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000667311">© Edmund McMillen, Tyler Glaiel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>You can’t lose…sorta</h2> <p>Well, you can lose all the time. But you can’t&nbsp;<em>lose</em> lose. While all four of your kitty-cats can fall in battle, causing you to lose the lot and return home empty-pawed, that’s not a game over. Even if they were your last four available cats, it doesn’t end. Instead, you just need to keep accepting new strays until you have four to take on a new run. Heck, even if you’re out of food you’ll just take surviving starving creatures with you. There’s no way to completely fail, but boy are you in a hole when you reach that point. Unless you get super-lucky and feel super-confident with the four cats you happen to have, you’re going to want to deliberately do some single-section runs just to guarantee bringing back some coins and food to start digging your way out. Don’t forget that all your retired cats can be sent off to the various other characters for extra bonuses, so even if you’re burning them on short runs, they’re still proving useful.</p> <hr> <h2>You can switch off the film grain</h2> <p>I’m not normally one for turning off grain effects—if they’re there I tend to consider them part of the aesthetic the developer intended for me to experience. But&nbsp;<em>Mewgenics</em>‘ effects are somewhat egregious, and the flickering of its old-timey film projector ways began to really wear on my tired eyes. This can all be tweaked, turned down, or turned off in the game’s settings.</p> <hr> <h2>Keep your donkey-faced fuggos in the basement</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000667315" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000667315"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000667315">© Edmund McMillen, Tyler Glaiel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure>

			<p>PlayStation is ready to reclaim the spotlight after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-where-to-watch-confirmed-games-and-what-to-expect/"><strong>Xbox Developer Direct</strong></a> and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-here-where-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a></strong>.

<h2 id="h-what-to-expect">What to Expect</h2>



<p>On the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official PlayStation Blog</a></strong>, Sony has explicitly stated that this broadcast will feature a look at "<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">eye-catching third-party and indie games headed to PS5, along with&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">the latest from teams at PlayStation Studios</strong></em>." With no game officially confirmed to be shown, however, speculation has begun on what we should expect to see.</p>

<p>With the <strong>PlayStation 6 and rumored PlayStation handheld console still far from release</strong>, no next-gen hardware reveal should be expected. However, there still could be some hardware announcements, as a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/a-low-key-success-and-a-very-good-idea-the-rumored-updated-playstation-portal-could-be-the-best-answer-to-hardware-price-increases/">PS Portal OLED model is rumored to be in the works</a></strong>.

<p>As the latest news from teams at PlayStation Studios will be shared during this State of Play, it stands to reason we will hear more about multiple first-party games, including <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-wolverine-new-trailer-provides-first-look-at-gameplay-confirms-fall-2026-release-window/"><strong>Marvel's Wolverine</strong></a></em>, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-playstation-5-pro-shows-its-muscles-by-delivering-5k-resolution-rendering-in-marathon/"><strong>Marathon</strong></a></em>, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a href="https://wccftech.com/new-saros-trailer-shows-provides-new-look-at-story/"><strong>Saros</strong></a></em>, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-hunters-gathering-guerrilla-cartoonish-coop-game/"><strong>Horizon Hunters Gathering</strong></a>,</em> and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-system-works-shows-more-marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-closed-beta-december/"><strong>MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls</strong></a></em> (whose <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3787240/MARVEL_Tkon_Fighting_Souls/"><strong>Steam page</strong></a> was recently updated to confirm the 20-character big launch roster).

			<p><strong>Supermassive Games</strong>, the studio you'll recognize as the team behind games like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-reportedly-effectively-closed/">Until Dawn</a></strong> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-quarry-supermassive-big-screen/"><strong>The Quarry</strong>,</a> has announced the release date for their next narrative-driven horror adventure, <strong>Directive 8020</strong>. This new sci-fi entry in Supermassive's <strong>Dark Pictures</strong> anthology will arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this coming <strong>May 12, 2026.</strong></p>



<p>The news was announced with a new release date trailer, which also ushered in the launch of pre-orders going live on both PS5 and Xbox Series. Pre-orders for the game on Steam will go live "<em>soon</em>" according to the video description, so just keep an eye on your Steam notifications if you already have it wishlisted for when those pre-orders are ready.</p>



<p>The trailer dubs Directive 8020 as "<em>a new chapter of horror</em>," while showcasing plenty of gameplay and the difficult decisions you'll be forced to make in Supermassive's latest terrifying adventure. You can check out the new trailer below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Technically, we first heard about Directive 8020 all the way back in 2022, but that notice came from the public release of a bundle of titles Supermassive had <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/five-new-the-dark-pictures-titles-trademarked-supermassive-games/">trademarked</a></strong>. It wasn't until <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etXhOhzbXso">2024</a> that the game was properly announced, with a release date initially set for 2025.</p>



<p>However, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/supermassive-games-layoffs-directive-8020-delayed-2026/">a round of layoffs</a></strong> at Supermassive pushed the game out of its October 2025 release window and into 2026. Thankfully, today's announcement confirms that we didn't have to wait too much longer after it missed its October release, as it is still arriving in the first half of 2026.</p>



<p>The last time we saw Directive 8020 was at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a></strong>, where Wccftech's Francesco De Meo got to spend half an hour with the game. <a href="https://wccftech.com/directive-8020-gamescom-hands-on-previews-a-new-page-in-the-anthology/">In his preview</a>, he highlighted how the addition of real-time threats sets Directive 8020 apart from other games in the Dark Pictures Anthology, and how, alongside its new tier of graphic fidelity and all-star cast, Directive 8020 looks set to "<em>mark a new beginning</em>" for Supermassive's Dark Pictures games. Or, as Supermassive puts it in today's trailer: "<em><strong>a new chapter of horror</strong></em>."</p>

              <p>Starting next year, Hasbro will begin making most of the<em>&nbsp;Harry Potte</em>r-related toys available on shelves around the globe. But even though its parent company announced a massive licensing deal with <a href="https://kotaku.com/hogwarts-legacy-review-harry-potter-rowling-transphobia-1850127849">WB and </a><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/hogwarts-legacy-review-harry-potter-rowling-transphobia-1850127849">Harry Potter</a>,</em> Wizards of the Coast confirmed it has no intentions to bring the wizard-filled franchise from author J.K. Rowling to <em>Magic: The Gathering.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p> <p>On February 10, <a href="https://newsroom.hasbro.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hasbro-and-warner-bros-discovery-global-consumer-products">Hasbro and Warner Bros. Discovery announced</a> a massive licensing deal involving <em>Harry Potter</em> that will see the toy company become the de facto manufacturer of toys and merchandise for the<em> Harry Potter</em> franchise in 2027. Hasbro plans on making and selling “dolls, role play, action figures &amp; collectibles, interactive plushes, and board games” with “more to be revealed later this year.” This is obviously a very big deal for Hasbro, and with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/harry-potter-tv-cast-harry-ron-hermione-jk-rowling-hbo-1851782496">new<em> Harry Potter</em> series arriving on HBO Max next year</a>, the company is likely predicting a huge influx of interest around the popular wizarding franchise.</p>

 <p>On February 10, in response to a Reddit post mentioning Hasbro’s big new licensing deals, a Wizards of the Coast rep denied any <em>Harry Potter</em> crossover was in the works despite its parent company jumping all in.</p> <p>“The Magic Multiverse has its own school of Magic at Strixhaven with plenty of secrets still to explore,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1r12ed3/comment/o4metfg/">said WOTC’s community team on Reddit</a>. “Our Universes Beyond roadmap currently doesn’t have us visiting any others.”</p> <p>Of course, you can’t talk about <em>Harry Potter</em> without mentioning franchise creator and author J.K. Rowling, a<a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/a-complete-breakdown-of-the-jk-rowling-transgender-comments-controversy"> woman who has spent years saying terrible things about trans people</a> and <a href="https://www.advocate.com/news/jk-rowling-anti-trans-organization">has used her vast wealth to support anti-trans initiatives</a>.</p>

 <p>So it makes sense that some fans of <em>Magic</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-the-gathering-monty-python-holy-grail-crossover-1851604859?_gl=1*bj20lt*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzk4MjY4Ni4yMDkuMS4xNzI3OTgzODc1LjU2LjAuMA..">which in recent years has found big money in IP crossover cards via its Universes Beyond brand</a>, wondered if the card game owned by Hasbro would soon start releasing<em> Harry Potter</em> cards as part of this deal. But WOTC’s Reddit comment suggests that, for now at least, <em>Harry Potter</em> won’t be coming to <em>Magic</em>. Of course, plans change, and WOTC’s wording is just vague enough that, in a few months, this comment could look very silly in retrospect.</p>

              <p><span>Little Saint James, informally known as Epstein Island, saw a sudden influx of virtual visitors over the weekend after </span><i><span>Pokémon Go</span></i><span> players spotted that the location was home to a Pokéstop. The Pokéstop in question has since been removed from the game by developers Niantic, but not in time to stop an unquantifiable number of players from flocking to the island once owned by deceased convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</span></p> <p><span>The inciting post that caused the flood of </span><i><span>Pokémon Go</span></i><span> to Little Saint James seems to be </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonGoSpoofing/comments/1qvhkj9/can_someone_see_if_theres_anything_on_epsteins/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>this post</span></a><span>, dated February 4, on r/PokemonGoSpoofing, titled “Can someone see if there’s anything on Epstein’s Island?” In this context, “spoofing” refers to a method that allows </span><i><span>Pokémon Go </span></i><span>players to alter their in-game GPS data so that they can visit any location they desire. Prior to its removal, I was able to verify the existence of the “Sun Dial” Pokéstop on Little Saint James by using a spoofing method.</span></p>

 <p><span>From there, several viral posts began to surface on social media, </span><a href="https://x.com/Pirat_Nation/status/2020090411990077784?s=20"><span>including this</span></a><span> February 7 post on X. There’s no exact way to quantify how many players visited the island, but there are numerous posts on r/pokemongo detailing methods to reach the location. On February 9, developer Niantic confirmed to </span><a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/news/pokemon-go-epstein-island-sundial-pokestop-376117-20260207"><i><span>GAMINGbible</span></i></a> <span>that the Sun Dial Pokéstop had been removed from the game.</span></p> <p><span>However, Niantic wasn’t quick enough to stop one user on r/pokemongo from figuring out exactly how the Pokéstop made it into </span><i><span>Pokémon Go</span></i><span>. In a </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/1qz5osi/comment/o48yrkb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>now-deleted thread</span></a><span>, the user discerned that the Sun Dial Pokéstop was submitted as a point of interest through </span><i><span>Ingress</span></i><span> at some point between 2020 and 2021. </span><i><span>Ingress</span></i><span> is Niantic’s other augmented reality mobile title, and served as a precursor to </span><i><span>Pokémon Go</span></i><span>. As a result, a lot of the data in </span><i><span>Pokémon Go</span></i><span> has been scraped from </span><i><span>Ingress</span></i><span>. The same user also figured out that the image used for the Sun Dial Pokéstop was taken from a </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUUQqNdJrHI"><span>YouTube video</span></a><span> dated July 2019, which features drone footage of Little Saint James. As its name indicates, the Pokéstop was indeed at the exact location of a large sundial on the island.</span></p>

 <p><span>Oddly enough, this is one of many Epstein-related video game stories to spawn out of the three million pages released by the Department of Justice on January 30, as Epic Games had to debunk a “</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/littlestjeff1-epstein-files-fortnite-v-bucks-conspiracy-epic-2000666464"><span>Jeffrey Epstein Is Alive</span></a><span>” </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>conspiracy last week.</span></p>
