              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911">The newly revealed </a><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved,</em> an Unreal Engine 5 remake of 2001’s <em>Halo</em>, isn’t just a graphical update of the original game. The devs are making some big changes to the classic <em>Halo</em> experience, and this includes changing levels. And yes, if you were wondering, The Library is one of the levels getting tweaked.</p> <p>Ask 100 random <em>Halo</em> fans what the worst level in the first game is, and 90 or more will likely say “The Library.” This late-in-story level is very long, filled with never-ending waves of Flood, aka space zombies, and has limited supplies, checkpoints, and waypoints. It also lacks visual variety and can be a dull experience on lower difficulties and a pain in the ass for those playing on higher difficulties who enter unprepared. To help players in 2025, Halo Studios is making some changes to <em>Halo’s</em> infamously annoying level.</p>

 <p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-answering-the-big-questions/">In an October 24 blog post</a>, Halo Studios and Xbox explained that with Library, “it felt right to make tweaks to several areas” to create a “new experience that balances nostalgia with the expectations of today’s gamers.”</p>

 <p>“We learned from&nbsp;<em>Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary</em> that there was still an appetite for things like better wayfinding, navigation, and diversity in enemy encounters,” said <em>Halo </em>creative director Matt Szlagor. “In The Library specifically, which features several Flood encounters, we wanted to reevaluate the pacing and enhance the environmental storytelling. We’ve added new lines to Guilty Spark, which guide players through the level, and there’s new dialogue that gives more insight into the narrative as it plays out.”</p>

 <p>He further added: &nbsp;“We’re not changing the stories, it’s about refining and adding context to this moment, and other levels like it, so players can stay on track.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-impressions-1235451111/">Speaking to <em>Rolling Stone</em>,</a> executive producer Damon Conn claimed that every mission, encounter, and cinematic in <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> has been “rebuilt and retouched with the spirit intact of the original’s awe, sense of discovery, and heroism.” Hopefully, that means the Library won’t look like the same boring grey corridors over and over again for 20 minutes.</p> <p><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> launches on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo, once the flagship Xbox exclusive, the video game Microsoft launched its first console with, has finally jumped ship. Microsoft has announced Halo: Campaign Evolved — a remake of the original game’s campaign — and it’s coming to PlayStation 5 day one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Unreal Engine 5 remake of the Bungie-developed 2001 campaign is set for launch in 2026 on PC, Xbox Series X and S, and, crucially, PS5. It is the first new Halo game since 2021’s Halo Infinite, and the first Halo ever to release on a PlayStation console. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-xbox-pc-and-yes-ps5-heres-everything-we-know-so-far-including-new-missions">IGN has played Halo: Campaign Evolved and has all the details right here</a>, including first info on the new three-mission prequel story arc. And yes, if you were wondering, there’s crossplay, which means Xbox, PC, and PlayStation owners can play Halo co-op together for the first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo: Campaign Evolved is the final nail in the coffin for the Xbox exclusive, then, although in truth the shooter series’ release on PlayStation does not come as any surprise. Xbox Game Studios is already one of the most prolific and successful publishers on PlayStation, and just this week <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-idea-of-locking-it-to-one-store-or-one-device-is-antiquated-for-most-people-xbox-president-says-microsoft-is-seeing-players-evolve-way-past-big-blockbuster-exclusive-games">Xbox president Sarah Bond called the idea of exclusive games “antiquated,”</a> so Microsoft’s thinking on this is crystal clear.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But what has prompted Microsoft’s multiplatform push? A recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a> report alleged that Microsoft is pushing Xbox studios to deliver a 30% margin — much higher than the industry average — and one of the ways studios can help bring in more money is by releasing their games on rival platforms, such as PlayStation and Nintendo Switch as well as PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One prominent critic of the exclusive is former president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment America Shawn Layden, who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-playstation-boss-shawn-layden-says-exclusivity-is-your-achilles-heel-if-game-costs-exceed-200-million"><u>last year said that when a video game’s costs exceed $200 million, “exclusivity is your Achilles’ heel.”</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It reduces your addressable market,” Layden told <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/how-former-playstation-boss-views-gamings-tumultuous-time-shawn-layden-interview/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GamesBeat</u></a>, before citing the success of Arrowhead’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a>, which launched on PlayStation 5 and PC to explosive success. “Particularly when you’re in the world of live service gaming or free-to-play. Another platform is just another way of opening the funnel, getting more people in. In a free-to-play world, as we know, 95% of those people will never spend a nickel. The business is all about conversion. You have to improve your odds by cracking the funnel open. Helldivers 2 has shown that for PlayStation, coming out on PC at the same time. Again, you get that funnel wider. You get more people in.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Layden said single-player games have a similar audience consideration as multiplayer games, though not exactly the same. “For single-player games it’s not the same exigency,” he said. “But if you’re spending $250 million, you want to be able to sell it to as many people as possible, even if it’s just 10% more.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Halo: Campaign Evolved – First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Layden’s comments echo those of former Xbox boss Peter Moore, who in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-will-be-debating-right-now-whether-xbox-consoles-have-a-future-says-peter-moore"><u>a recent interview with IGN</u></a> suggested Microsoft will be debating internally whether to release Xbox poster-child Halo on PlayStation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If Microsoft says, wait, we're doing $250 million on our own platforms, but if we then took Halo as, let's call it a third-party, we could do a billion… You got to think long and hard about that, right?” Moore said. “I mean, you just got to go, yeah, should it be kept? It's a piece of intellectual property. It's bigger than just a game. And how do you leverage that? Those are the conversations that always happen with, how do you leverage it in everything that we would do?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft’s stance on exclusives has become one of the biggest talking points in the Xbox community, and that conversation will only grow louder now we know Halo has made the jump to PlayStation. Microsoft’s approach is in stark contrast to Nintendo and Sony’s. Nintendo has the most hardline policy on its games, releasing them on its consoles only. Sony has softened its approach in recent years, releasing its multiplayer, live service games on PC at the same time as PlayStation (and in the case of Helldivers 2, eventually on Xbox). But Sony still refuses to launch its big single-player games on anything other than PlayStation day one (the latest example of this is Sucker Punch's Ghost of Yotei).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now Campaign Evolved is confirmed for PS5, there is no going back for Halo. Indeed, it seems Halo is from this day forward as much a PlayStation game as it is an Xbox game. Speaking tonight on a panel at the Halo World Championships 2025, Halo Community Director, Brian Jarrard, teased: "It's really a new era. Halo is on PlayStation going forward, starting with Halo: Campaign Evolved."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-project-update-2025-everything-announced-updating-live">everything announced at Halo Studios’ Halo: Campaign Evolved panel for more</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-is-a-pretty-remake-coming-to-ps5-but-not-an-exact-one</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/halo-campaign-evolved-is-a-pretty-remake-coming-to-ps5-but-not-an-exact-one.1334566/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I honestly wasn’t sure what to expect when I sat down in front of an Xbox Series X to play an early demo of Halo: Campaign Evolved, the just-announced Unreal Engine 5 remake of the original-Xbox killer app (and yes, it’s a proper remake, not a remaster like Halo Anniversary was). And I’m honestly still not sure exactly how I feel about it after playing it. I definitely wanted to be blown away by the visuals, in the same way that the original Halo: Combat Evolved knocked my socks off back in 2001. Heck, we know Unreal Engine 5 is fully capable! I also didn’t want Halo Studios (nee 343 Industries) to mess with too much. Or did I? Would Halo 1 just feel old no matter what? And will PlayStation 5 gamers even care about this 25-year-old Xbox classic when it hits Sony’s consoles for the first time ever, day-and-date with Xbox and PC? So I went in with lots of questions, and I left with, well…some answers. Let me explain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I suppose we might as well start with the obvious: how it looks. Is my face properly melted? No. But maybe yours is? I’ll be curious to read the comments on this one. Anyway, Campaign Evolved does look very nice, no doubt. It certainly doesn’t look like it’s two decades old anymore. I played a chunk of the legendary Silent Cartographer mission from early in the campaign, and the skybox is beautiful, the water looks great, the trees look very nice, and the terrain texture looks sharp and clean. Once you get indoors, the alien architecture has a unique sheen to it that the original obviously never had. Meanwhile, the weapons all look exactly how you’d expect them to look in the modern era, and the Grunts, Jackals, Elites, and Hunters all look convincingly new rather than reskins of quarter-century-old creatures. Everything looks clean, but not in a soulless way. At least not to me. It works as a cohesive art-directed space in the new engine. I appreciate that VO from the principal actors (read: Steve Downes and Jen Taylor, at the very least) has been rerecorded, while mocap has all been redone for the rebuilt-from-scratch cutscenes. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Halo: Campaign Evolved – First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But let’s talk about my biggest concern coming into this demo: the classic Halo feel. Movement, aiming, jumping, vehicle controls – it’s all got to have that semi-floaty Halo feel to it, and I’m pleased to report that even in this very early state, Campaign Evolved is a good bit of the way there. No doubt they’ll continue to tweak it over the coming months – this release has no official release date beyond “2026,” by the way, but I’d be stunned if it’s not timed to release at or very near the 25th anniversary of Halo: Combat Evolved in November of next year – but there have been some gameplay modernizations implemented here that have been ported back from subsequent Halos into this remake, and while purists might bristle at it, most of these seem like they’re for the best for a 2026 first-person shooter release.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Vehicles are boardable and destructible now.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For starters, vehicles are boardable and destructible now, as they were in subsequent Halo games. That means a Ghost can no longer torment you endlessly, nor are you effectively invulnerable in a Scorpion tank. On a related note, a fourth player can now sit on the back of a Warthog. Oh, and though I didn’t get to try it out on The Silent Cartographer, the Wraith is drivable now, too, as it first became in Halo 2. Also, any weapons the bad guys wield, you can too. As such, the Energy Sword is now in your toolbelt if you take one off the corpse of a Gold Elite. Halo Studios says there will be eight weapons in Campaign Evolved that aren’t new to Halo but are usable for the first time in Master Chief’s first adventure. On the movement front, sprint has also been added. It’s not on a cooldown; you can run endlessly. I could see this one annoying the Halo 1 purists most of all, but not only do the developers say you can turn it off, but you can also just…not use it. I found it handy when running down the beach back towards my mission objective after wandering off to go stare at more of the new Unreal Engine 5-rendered spaces. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What about co-op? After Halo Studios fumbled that in Halo Infinite, you’re probably wondering about it for the remake. Two-player split-screen is confirmed, though sadly it wasn’t available in my short preview build, and the development team also promises four-player online co-op with full cross-play and cross-progression support. As for proper competitive multiplayer, though? Unfortunately, the answer to that is right in the name of this remake: Campaign Evolved. There’s no multiplayer here, which is a shame because it’d sure be fun to see Blood Gulch or Sidewinder or Hang ‘Em High in Unreal Engine 5 with online cross-play support. I asked Halo Studios about this, and Executive Producer Damon Conn gave me an extremely media-trained answer, saying the team is “very focused on recreating the original campaign that started it all” and “[Halo] Infinite and [Master Chief Collection] provide really great experiences for multiplayer.” Sure…for Xbox and PC players. That doesn’t help new PS5 players fall in love with Halo’s glorious multiplayer, though. Presumably they didn’t want to pull any players away from MCC for this, and/or adding full multiplayer support would’ve likely meant the project couldn’t get done in time for the 25th anniversary. But it’s still disappointing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That led me to wonder about pricing. Would this be a full-price $70 release (or perhaps even $80 by the time it comes out, since Microsoft already tried to push to that price point this year)? Or will it be priced lower – particularly since it’s campaign-only? The Halo Studios team wouldn’t say when I asked them directly, so that remains to be seen. Personally, $50 feels right for this, but that’s just my opinion. I also think that $20 per month feels like the right price for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate… </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">OK, so no multiplayer, but there is one significant addition I’m legitimately excited about: a new three-mission prequel campaign that revolves around Master Chief and Sergeant Johnson. This could be extremely cool, but unfortunately that’s literally all we know so far. In fact, Halo Studios wouldn’t even tell me if it’s accessible out of the box or if you have to complete the campaign in order to unlock it. I also asked if they’d be repurposing existing music from the Halo 1 soundtrack to score those missions, or if they might commission something new (dare I dream they reach out to Marty O’Donnell himself!), and they didn’t have an answer for me there either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Getting back to gameplay, I must say that I still had fun hooning across the beaches of The Silent Cartographer in a Warthog, my UNSC Marine buddies in the passenger and gunner seats helping to mow down Covenant bad guys while I attempted to turn them into hood ornaments with my front bumper. Just like old times. I also manned the gun turret at one point to test out the friendly AI and…it still needs work. In fact, someone on the development team acknowledged this later without me bringing it up, so it’s clearly something they’re aware of. Honestly, though, it’s not something I’m even worried about when there’s still (probably) upwards of a year of development time left. It’s the same with the framerate: no doubt some folks went straight to the comments to note any inconsistencies they saw (because I definitely noticed some), and while it is certainly important, it’s not something I’m sweating this far away from the end of the project. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/hce-general-4k-07-1761260005069.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, and I should also mention that Halo Studios is adding Skulls to Campaign Evolved. Lots of them, in fact. “Dozens” was the word they used, with an emphasis on this remake having the most Skulls of any Halo campaign ever. Replayability is clearly a focus for the studio here – which is understandable, given Halo’s strong history in that department as well as the lack of adversarial multiplayer – and hopefully the Skulls will spice things up for Xbox players running through this thing for the umpteenth time. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Halo Studios says this remake having the most Skulls of any Halo campaign ever.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">On that note, I couldn’t help but wonder if PlayStation 5 players getting their first crack at Halo are really going to care about this in a way that turns a lot of them into new fans of the franchise. It’s a genuine question; I’ve got a lot of personal history with Halo, so I simply can’t answer this one. For someone with no nostalgia for Master Chief, will those players find Campaign Evolved as compelling as I found Combat Evolved? And if they do, then what? Will Halo Studios remake Halo 2 in Unreal Engine 5? And then 3? 4? 5? Reach? ODST? Infinite? Or will they just port The Master Chief Collection and Halo Infinite to PS5 to catch those players up? I asked the team about this and again got a very media-trained half-answer: “There is an opportunity for us to grow the fanbase,” Executive Producer Damon Conn told me. “We're bringing the most players, we believe, to Halo, ever. And so that growth is what we're truly interested in, and again, I hinted before this paves the way for future stories and Halos.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/24/hce-warthong-4k-03-1761333970798.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">And so, as you can now see, I’m still left with many unanswered questions about this remake project. But to Halo Studios' credit, this early demo did answer a couple of key ones about how good it could look and how Halo-y it could feel. So far so good there. I’m very excited about the new three-mission prequel campaign featuring Sergeant Johnson, as it will be the first new single-player content in a Halo game in, by that point, five years. Can Campaign Evolved relight Halo’s spark? That’s the biggest question of all, and it’ll have to remain unanswered for a bit longer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Halo Studios has created something special for the 25th anniversary of <em>Halo </em>next year. <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> is a full remake of the original <em>Combat Evolved</em> that launched alongside Microsoft’s first Xbox console in 2001. It has a fully rebuilt campaign with 4K visuals, new weapons and vehicles, a four-player online co-op mode, and brand-new story content.</p><p>And it’s all coming to the Xbox Series X / S, PC, and — for the first time — PlayStation 5 in 2026.</p><p>I’ve been playing a prerelease demo section of The Silent Cartographer mission this week to get a feel for all the changes. It’s the same level that was used as the demo version of <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> for both Mac and PC, but this remade version opens immediately with updated cinematics, improved voice lines, and greatly overhauled visuals and animations.</p><p>It looks and feels distinctively <em>Halo</em>, but then I started sprinting toward a rebuilt Warthog that has an extra seat at the rear and I realized there’s a lot going on in <em>Campaign Evolved</em> beyond its Unreal Engine 5-powered visuals.</p><p>“We did this work on <a href="https://halo.fandom.com/wiki/Halo:_Combat_Evolved_Anniversary"><em>Halo</em> <em>Anniversary</em></a>. There were certain things that we weren’t able to achieve at that time, there were certain things we weren’t able to do,” says Greg Hermann, technical director at Halo Studios. “As we were building this out, we didn’t just put a coat of paint over the original cinematics. We ended up revisiting exactly how they were blocked out, how they were sequenced, and how they were put together. We’ve done that across the board.”</p><p>Halo Studios even brought in the core voice actors of <em>Combat Evolved</em> to re-record their lines. It was something I noticed immediately as The Silent Cartographer mission loaded in. “This really provides a degree of fidelity that we weren’t able to do for <em>Halo</em> <em>Anniversary</em>,” says Hermann.</p><p>The iconic vistas in <em>Halo </em>have also been rebuilt, as well as the alien architecture and environments. It’s really designed to be the ultimate remake of the original campaign that’s both welcoming to new players and also built in a way that respects Bungie’s original creation and story.</p><p>“Whenever we make a change, the number one thing is to be true to the original game,” says Dan Gniady, lead game designer at Halo Studios. Gniady joined Halo Studios last year and previously worked on the original releases of Bungie’s <em>Destiny </em>and <em>Destiny 2 </em>titles.</p><p>Halo Studios has access to the original source assets and code for <em>Halo</em>, as well as the original storyboards. That’s allowed the team to remaster and remix the music alongside the cinematic change and huge visual upgrades. All of the new content in the game is created in UE5, and it’s layered on top of the systems and code used for the original game to maintain that unique <em>Halo</em> feel.</p><p><em>Campaign Evolved </em>includes three new bonus missions. “It was really important that we preserved the original story as it is, so these missions are meant to be a prequel setup for the main chorus,” says Max Szlagor, studio design director at Halo Studios. “These new missions are going to offer some new opportunities for character interactions between Chief and Johnson.” The missions will include new environments, gameplay, characters, and enemies.</p><p>There are also new mechanics and AI behaviors. Perhaps the most obvious is the ability to sprint in the game, which makes everything from combat to moving around missions feel a lot faster. There’s even a new seat in the Warthog, affectionately referred to as the golf cart seat or bumper seat by Halo Studios’ developers. It will be ideal for co-op missions, as someone can now hang off the rear of the Warthog.</p><p>Up to four people can play this campaign together online, regardless of what platform they’re on, thanks to crossplay and shared progression across console and PC. There’s also two-player split-screen co-op local play on consoles, just like the original game. “We will make some of the spaces larger, and we also want to make sure we’re authentic to the encounters themselves,” says Szlagor. “So it’s a balancing act between that difficulty tuning and making those encounters the right size for the right space.”</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Halo Studios has rebuilt every part of the original game so movement, aiming, and weapons and look and feel like a modern </em>Halo<em> game.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>All of the weapons have been remodeled and rebuilt with higher fidelity, so the look, feel, and sound of weapons is far better than what Halo Studios achieved with the remastered versions; the plasma effects from guns will even fully light up the indoor environments. You can also aim down sights with all guns now, and there are nine additional weapons from across the <em>Halo </em>series available in <em>Campaign Evolved</em> — including the ability to pick up an Energy Sword after you’ve killed an Elite. If you’re a fan of the vehicles in <em>Halo</em>, you’ll even be able to hijack enemy ones, so you can pilot a fully drivable Wraith in this campaign.</p><p>If you want to amp up the difficultly, Halo Studios is leaning even more on skulls in this remake, the gameplay modifiers from <em>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</em>. There are dozens of skull options in <em>Campaign Evolved</em>, “the most we’ve ever had in a <em>Halo </em>game,” says Szlagor. There are so many that the developers don’t think it will even be possible to complete the game on legendary mode with all skulls turned on. “There’s a lot, so if you can do a true legendary all-skulls-on run, let us know because I’d love to see it,” says Gniady. I’m sure a hardcore <em>Halo </em>fan will find a way next year, though.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Halo Studios has remade entire environments in </em>Campaign Evolved<em>.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The one thing that’s missing from <em>Campaign Evolved</em> is multiplayer. The original game had local multiplayer and maps, but it launched before Xbox Live, so there was never any official online multiplayer. While the PC version added online play, Halo Studios is sticking purely to the campaign element of the original <em>Halo </em>game. The <em>Halo </em>franchise is known for its multiplayer, but this really started with <em>Halo 2</em>. I did ask Microsoft to comment about the lack of multiplayer, but the company refused to discuss it.</p><p>Even without multiplayer, <em>Campaign Evolved</em> is a blueprint for future <em>Halo </em>games. “For future titles, we will continue to push the boundaries of technology while ensuring the core <em>Halo </em>gameplay for that game can be seen, felt, heard, and evolved where needed,” says Hermann.</p><p><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> is coming in 2026 to the Xbox Series X / S, PC, and PS5. It’ll be a day one game with Game Pass Ultimate / PC Game Pass, and will also support Xbox Cloud Gaming and Xbox Play Anywhere.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/805174/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-xbox-ps5-release-date]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/halo-remake-campaign-evolved-playstation-cross-play-2000638951</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-confirms-halo-will-be-on-playstation-%E2%80%98going-forward%E2%80%99.1334506/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Today, Microsoft and Halo Studios announced they’re remaking the original&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>again as&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911"><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em></a>. The remake is sprucing up the shooter’s campaign, adding three new prequel levels, and will support up to four-player cooperative runs. The biggest news out of the announcement, however, is that the game is also coming to PlayStation 5, and it sounds like Master Chief’s adventures will also be coming to PlayStation for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>This was confirmed on a livestream from the Halo World Championship after the remake’s announcement. Halo Studios community director Brian “ske7ch” Jarrard said that&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>is a multiplatform series “going forward.” The remake supports crossplay between platforms, so if you want to get your old co-op buddies together after 25 years, you can do that no matter what system they’re playing on. And it sounds like that will be the case with future games, as well.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Confirmed: Halo will be on PlayStation "going forward" starting with the Combat Evolved remake. <a href="https://t.co/y23v1B3mfV">pic.twitter.com/y23v1B3mfV</a></p> <p>— AmericanTruckSongs9 (@ethangach) <a href="https://twitter.com/ethangach/status/1981827679667290555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>In a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-launches-on-ps5-in-2026/">PlayStation Blog</a>, Jarrad teased that Halo Studios may have more&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>announcements for PlayStation 5 owners in the future, saying, “As the Master Chief once said: ‘I think we’re just getting started.'” If the series is coming to a new audience this many entries in, I wouldn’t be surprised if we also see the <em>Master Chief Collection&nbsp;</em>on PlayStation in the coming years. The compilation includes all the&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>games up to&nbsp;<em>5: Guardians</em>, including the spin-offs&nbsp;<em>Reach&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>3: ODST</em>, which don’t follow Master Chief but instead tell separate stories in Bungie and Halo Studios’ sci-fi universe. This would also be as good a time as any to bring <em>Guardians</em> and&nbsp;<em>Infinite</em>, the two most recent games in the series which aren’t included in the collection, to PlayStation 5 as well.</p> <p>All of this comes after <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546">reports of Microsoft enforcing new profit goals</a> on its Xbox division, seemingly resulting in a complete rethinking of the gaming brand’s direction.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The Halo: Combat Evolved remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-studios-whats-next-for-halo-halowc-2025/">we've all been anticipating today</a>, as part of the Halo WCC, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-CA/games/store/halo-campaign-evolved/9N683TDT5M7R/0010">has finally been announced</a>. Halo: Campaign Evolved is a remake that Halo Studios and Xbox describe as "<em>a faithful yet modernized remake of Halo: Combat Evolved’s campaign</em>." It'll arrive on Xbox Series X/S, PC, and PlayStation 5 sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>We've officially seen it all now, with all of Microsoft and Xbox's biggest first-party franchises making their way to PlayStation. It was the inevitable endpoint we all saw when Halo Studios (formerly 343 Studios) confirmed that it would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-halo-infinite-impact-vision/">dropping the Slipspace Engine and moving to using Unreal Engine 5</a>.</p>



<p>It's both exciting and surreal to see Halo making its way to PlayStation for the first time. You can check out the trailer for the remade campaign, below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Halo: Campaign Evolved | The Silent Cartographer Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/efThjRym-ks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As far as what's new in this remake, the answer is pretty much everything, since all of the assets, models, environments, everything has been redone and retooled for Unreal Engine 5, and to take advantage of all the features that engine brings along with it that Halo Studios couldn't do within the Slipspace Engine.</p>



<p>There are also three brand-new bonus missions that act as a prequel setup to the main campaign. The actual Combat Evolved campaign hasn't been changed with regards to how the story goes, these are new missions to give players a bit more than just a remake of the campaign.</p>



<p>Campaign Evolved also introduces four-player co-op for the whole campaign, letting you play through the campaign with three other people online. Also, even though Halo Studios never got it done for Halo Infinite, couch co-op is available for Campaign Evolved for two player co-op.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Halo: Campaign Evolved | Roundtable Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e-tXi1NC_aU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Alongside the trailer, and the above roundtable, which shares a little more about why Halo Studios went forward with Halo: Campaign Evolved at this point in time, we also got a full 13-minute gameplay showcase, which shows off the The Silent Cartographer level towards the beginning of the game.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Halo: Campaign Evolved | The Silent Cartographer – 13 Minute Gameplay Demo" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hSjbIM0iegY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As far as what this new remake doesn't have, the big aspect missing that should be obvious, given the title of the remake, is that it doesn't include the game's multiplayer. It's just the campaign. If you want to play multiplayer in the style of Halo CE, then the Master Chief Collection remains your best option.</p>



<p>All things considered, this remake definitely looks impressive at first glance, but a huge element of what made Halo unique was how the game felt thanks to the Slipspace Engine and everything that Bungie got right about what makes a good first-person shooter all those years ago. It'll be interesting, to say the least, to see how players react when they get their hands on it at some point next year.</p>



<p>For now, you can wishlist the game on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.</p>

<p>PlayStation is finally getting a Halo game, Halo Studios confirms.</p>



<p>The battle between Xbox and PlayStation has gone on for almost two decades. Each company would try to outsell the other in consoles and games. However, despite all that the Sony-backed company had, Microsoft had Halo. The premiere FPS multiplayer series was seemingly undefeatable, even at its lows. Now, as Xbox has brought exclusive franchises like Gears of War to PlayStation 5, its golden goose has been let loose from the cage.</p>



<h2 id="h-playstation-is-getting-halo-combat-evolved-remake-in-2026">PlayStation is Getting Halo Combat Evolved Remake in 2026</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>At the Halo World Championships, Halo Studios confirms that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> will launch on PlayStation 5 alongside Xbox and PC consoles. The news appears at the end of the trailer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efThjRym-ks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shown above</a>, which reveals gameplay of the Combat Evolved remake. Furthermore, all upcoming Halo games will release on PlayStation consoles. However, it’s unknown if other titles, like Halo: The Master Chief Collection and Halo: Infinite, will come to the Sony console. The game, a remake of Combat Evolved, releases in 2026, but there is no release date. In addition, cross-play is now in the game, letting you play with players from other consoles.</p>



<p>Despite the competitive nature of the two companies, having Halo on another console is a good thing. As we’ve seen with games like Final Fantasy XVI, staying exclusive can hurt sales and restrict player bases. With Halo: Campaign Evolved coming to PlayStation, more people can finally experience the series the way many of us had back in the day.</p>

<p>Halo: Combat Evolved Remake has now been confirmed by Halo Studios, and it’s coming quite soon.</p>



<p>For almost 30 years, Halo has revolutionized the FPS genre with its space opera military setting and great combat. As Xbox’s semi-flagship series, it’s now a household name and one every Xbox fan has played at least two times over. However, it all started with one of the original Xbox’s launch titles: 2001’s Halo: Combat Evolved. Now, at the Halo World Championships, the team at Halo Studios revealed that what has relentlessly been leaked is, indeed, true.</p>



<h2 id="h-halo-campaign-evolved-remake-of-combat-evolved-revealed">Halo: Campaign Evolved, Remake of Combat Evolved, Revealed</h2>

<p>Today, Halo Studios finally confirmed that a remake of Halo: Combat Evolved is in development and will be released in 2026. The trailer, <a href="https://youtu.be/efThjRym-ks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shown above</a>, shows off some impressive gameplay of fan-favorite scenes, complete with Master Chief in all his glory. The game, which brings back the original 2001 title, is called Halo: Campaign Evolved. As you can guess, the remake is now confirmed to be only the campaign, so no multiplayer will be included. It will also launch on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-playstation-announcement-xbox-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, a first for the series. The game will bring back split-screen and new crossplay across all consoles. During a development video, the team also said that new content, like interactions and scenes, will be added. </p>



<p>As mentioned before, a remake of Halo: Combat Evolved has been rumored for a while. After Halo Studios’ tease last year, leaks regarding an in-development, campaign-only version of the classic game showed up, with evidence becoming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-ce-remake-virtuos-studio-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more and more real</a>. Luckily, they can be put to rest, as we’ll see the title reborn for the next generation of consoles.</p>

Included in the lineup of developers are Halo Studios' Brian "ske7ch" Jarrard, Max Szlagor, and Damon Conn, who finally, officially pulled back the curtain on Halo: Campaign Evolved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team's Halo World Championship 2025 debut for the Halo remake includes behind-the-scenes details on the project, including interviews with the developers, where they promise two-player couch co-op on consoles and four-player online co-op – and there's even crossplay and cross-progression support. Don't worry, the Warthog has been updated to account for those larger party sizes, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interviews with the team also reveal how Halo Studios revisited classic stories fans know and love. This includes clips of Steve Downes (Master Chief) and Jen Taylor (Cortana) back in the studio to rerecord some of their most iconic lines. As for the story cinematics themselves, fans can expect the Halo remake to deliver something familiar but new.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We want to tell an authentic story, and we want to level up the cinematics from the source," Halo Studios says. "As we were building this out, we didn't just put a new coat of paint over the original cinematics. We ended up revisiting exactly how they were blocked out, how they were sequenced, how they were put together, and we've done that across the board."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Halo Studios team signs off by welcoming the PlayStation community to the world of Halo, promising to provide updates as we move closer to the yet-to-be-confirmed Halo: Campaign Evolved release date in 2026. For those attending Halo World Championship 2025, a demo for the Halo remake, featuring The Silent Cartographer, is available to play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As the community person," Jarrard said, "seeing this community grow, welcoming all of our friends and new players to the franchise is just so exciting. [We're] just kind of knocking down walls. We're going to come together, we're going to sing kumbaya – it's going to be great. Blue and green, coming back together again."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

So even though this is licensed by PlayStation, it's more useful as extra PC storage.</p><p>You can preorder the Astro Bot Limited Edition Game Drive for $160 from <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Adorable+New+Astro+Bot+Collectibles+Are+Waiting+To+Be+Rescued+By+You&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-10-24+13%3A38%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-10-24+13%3A38%3A37&amp;fnarticle_id=6535705&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=Features&amp;fntype3=Gift+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D53538%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.seagate.com%2Fproducts%2Fgaming-drives%2Fspecial-editions%2Fastro-bot-limited-edition-external-hard-drive%2F&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fastro-bot-ps5-best-official-playstation-figures-plush-collectors-box%2F1100-6535705%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Seagate</a> or <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Adorable+New+Astro+Bot+Collectibles+Are+Waiting+To+Be+Rescued+By+You&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-10-24+13%3A38%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-10-24+13%3A38%3A37&amp;fnarticle_id=6535705&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=Features&amp;fntype3=Gift+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fsonyps.prf.hn%2Fclick%2Fcamref%3A1110l56fv%2Fpubref%3Asubid_value%2Fdestination%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fbuy-accessories%2F5tb-seagate-external-game-drive-astro-bot-limited-edition&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fastro-bot-ps5-best-official-playstation-figures-plush-collectors-box%2F1100-6535705%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Direct</a>.

"Focusing on the campaign experience means we can concentrate fully on really capturing the atmosphere, tone--the emotional impact of what made the first campaign so special and iconic," Conn said.</p><p>While there is no multiplayer in the new Halo: Campaign Evolved, the game delivers some extras that weren't in the original 2001 release, including three new prequel missions and the ability to sprint.

"Starting here means people that have never played the game before will be able to understand the story from the very beginning, and that can help us chart a course forward with new Halo stories."</p><p>For more, be sure to watch the trailer above to see the new Halo: Campaign Evolved in action.

                <p dir="ltr">Arguably <em>the </em>Microsoft crown jewel franchise, Halo, is coming to PlayStation for the first time. It's true that the sci-fi series has seen better days and may no longer be Microsoft's top-performing franchise, but Halo is basically synonymous with Xbox, and now it's making the jump to PlayStation in a development that would have shocked anyone reading this years ago.</p><p dir="ltr">Halo will come to PS5 via Halo: Campaign Evolved, the just-announced remake of the 2001 original. It's slated for release in 2026 on PS5, as well as Xbox and PC, featuring brand-new prequel missions, split-screen co-op, new weapons, visual and audio updates, and more. You can read more about Halo: Campaign Evolved in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-remake-announced-for-2026-features-new-prequel-missions-and-sprint-but-no-multiplayer/1100-6535695/" data-ref-id="1100-6535695">GameSpot's news post.</a></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSjbIM0iegY" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hSjbIM0iegY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Halo is not the first Microsoft series to make the jump to a rival platform, as Gears of War--another iconic Xbox franchise--landed on PlayStation via Gears of War: Reloaded in August. Forza Horizon 5 also came to PlayStation this year, while Microsoft Flight Simulator 24 is headed to PS5 this December.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this year, Microsoft announced a new business strategy to launch its own franchises on competitor consoles as opposed to keeping them locked to Xbox as was the tradition for years. The move, it seems, is part <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/">Microsoft's reported mandate that Xbox needs to improve profits</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft's releases for PlayStation consoles have been successful thus far, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-are-dominating-sales-charts-thanks-to-ps5/2900-6605/">Xbox games regularly populating the PlayStation sales charts</a>. Xbox president Sarah Bond recently made headlines when she said the idea of exclusive games in 2025 is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/exclusive-games-are-antiquated-xbox-president-says/1100-6535625/">"antiquated"</a> because these days, she said, people expect big games to be available on all devices.</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft may be backing away from full exclusivity for its own games, but the company still does give Xbox users preferential treatment for launch timing in some situations. For example, Forza Horizon 6 will launch as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-6-release-date-trailer/1100-6535015/">timed-exclusive for Xbox consoles in 2026 before landing on PlayStation sometime later. </a></p><p dir="ltr">The announcement of Halo for PS5 is no big surprise, as it's been one of the worst-kept secrets in gaming and had been the subject of leaks and reports for many months.</p>

Following 2021’s <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/halo-infinite/a-return-to-form-and-something-new">Halo Infinite</a>, Halo Studios (previously 343 Industries) is doing just that with Halo: Campaign Evolved, a full modern remake of one of the most beloved and influential games of the 21st century. Halo: Campaign Evolved takes the original Master Chief adventure and fully remakes it in Unreal Engine 5. Cinematics have been completely redone, voice acting re-recorded with the original principal cast, and the combat is snappier than ever before.&nbsp;</p><p>For the first time ever, Halo is also coming to PlayStation, complete with crossplay and cross-progression. Additionally, two-player splitscreen co-op remains intact, while four players can attack the story missions together – another first for this trailblazing title.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On top of the remade original story, players can expect three new missions, which center on Master Chief and fan-favorite Sgt. Johnson prior to the events of the original Halo story. “It was really key for us to maintain the original story as it is, to not insert sort of a new story in there,” creative director Max Szlagor says. “[These new missions] actually take place in a fairly short timeline in a way that the lore works. So, finding a good place in the lore to tell this story with Chief and Johnson, it’s going to have new story, new gameplay, weapons, enemies, environments. Also, a lot of cool, new stuff there.”</p><p>I didn’t get to see the new missions, but I played through the iconic Silent Cartographer mission, where Master Chief must find an ancient Forerunner installation that holds the key to unlocking the map of the Halo. It’s perhaps the greatest Halo campaign level of all time, and a sight to behold in Unreal Engine 5. The stage begins with a silent shot over water. Just as three Pelican dropships come into the shot, the Halo theme kicks in, giving me goosebumps; that well-executed needle drop continues as the scene progresses into the ensuing gunfight. It’s an effective tease of what to expect from the rest of my gameplay session. And for those difficulty-loving players, Halo: Campaign Evolved will have the most game-modifying Skulls of any game in franchise history.</p>

<p>In 2001, Halo: Combat Evolved showcased that you can have excellent shooter experiences on consoles and helped establish the then-nascent Xbox brand as a major player in the industry. But things have changed. Xbox is no longer the new kid on the block, and Halo: Combat Evolved is no longer the revolutionary game that set the industry ablaze in 2001. The team recognized that and did to the campaign what the name invokes: evolve.</p><p>The studio, which got its start through the Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary remaster in 2011, is intimately familiar with the first entry in the series and was cautious about changing too much. “As we're rebuilding the campaign, we're making sure that we stay true to the tone, the atmosphere, and the emotional impact of the original that made the game so iconic and so special,” executive producer Damon Conn says. “There’s an opportunity to modernize where it makes sense, but we’re not modernizing for modernization’s sake. Everything we do, we think about the impact on Halo and make sure that it fits.”</p>

<p>This is most evident in the visuals, as the water glistens and flows in a realistic manner, but everything from the textures and lighting to the character models and enemy AI is improved. The gameplay also features the right modernizations, as the left trigger allows you to aim down the sights of any weapon, plus you can sprint with a click of the stick. Finally, Halo Studios brought other improvements from subsequent games, like eight weapons not present in the original Halo, and the ability to pick up dropped Energy Swords, hijack vehicles, and drive Wraith tanks. To account for the new four-player co-op play, a fourth seat was added on the Warthog, so a full crew can cruise together.</p><p>Though I didn’t get to see it in action, Halo Studios also teases that once you get to the part of the story where The Flood arrives, the horror atmosphere is hammered home in ways never experienced in the franchise, leveraging the upgraded tech. I saw some environmental teases to that effect in a video shown by the developers, and I can’t wait to learn more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From my limited time playing on Xbox Series X, the campaign is accomplishing the task of bringing forward a modern version of the title responsible for putting Xbox on the map. However, it is worth noting that this is exactly what the title says: the campaign. The competitive multiplayer suite, for which the Halo franchise is arguably most known, is not a part of this package.&nbsp;</p><p>Last week, rumors circulated about the franchise's use of AI in development after insider Rebs Gaming&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4dWoH0Pa0E" target="_blank">posted on YouTube,</a>&nbsp;citing sources who told him the studio was using the tools in a variety of ways. Though Rebs Gaming did not have specifics about the use of the AI in development, rumors intensified when the series' art director, Glenn Israel, left Halo Studios after 17 years, saying that he would share more on his decision when it was safe to do so, alluding to wanting to preserve his health, dignity, ethics, and values.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I want to be very clear: I know that article hit," Conn starts. "Humans, people are creative. People make games. AI can improve workflows, it can do things for the game, but I want to be very specific and clear that the people are the ones who are creating the game, and if there's an opportunity to improve a workflow or something along those lines, we'll look at it. Again, it should be additive to the creation of a game. I think that's the best way to look at that."&nbsp;</p><p>Halo: Combat Evolved was a formative game for me when I first played it in high school, and it, along with Rare’s GoldenEye 007, molded my love for first-person shooters. I don’t know how impactful Halo’s original campaign from 25 years ago can realistically be in the modern gaming landscape, but for those, like me, who have replayed it several times, or those on PlayStation who have never played it, Halo: Campaign Evolved is an enticing proposition.&nbsp;</p><p>Halo: Campaign Evolved comes to Xbox and PC&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-coming-to-ps5-xbox-and-pc-remakes-halo-1s-story-with-new-content]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>During the first day of Xbox’s big <em>Halo</em> esports event, a previously rumored remake of the original <em>Halo: Combat Evolved </em>leaked ahead of a reported announcement. And surprise, surprise, after over two decades of being an Xbox-only series, <em>Halo</em> is making the leap to PlayStation in 2026.</p>   <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-6-infinite-unreal-engine-ue5-ce-remake-343-1851666611">This new remake, officially titled <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved, </em>was previously teased at last year’s HWCS via a tech demo</a> that looked to contain remade assets from <em>Halo CE</em>.&nbsp; There have also been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBaqo2AZxRY">multiple reports</a> of this newly announced remake of the very first <em>Halo</em> game, which is the first new game from Halo Studios since 2021’s<em> Halo Infinite</em>. Despite positive reviews, the open-world spin on <em>Halo</em> failed to achieve the long-term success that Xbox had hoped for. Two years later, the studio suffered layoffs in 2023 and was then completely rebranded in 2024. The studio has also ditched<em> Halo Infinite’</em>s custom-made engine, Slipstream, and is now using Unreal Engine 5.</p>

 <h2>Here’s What The New <em>Halo</em> Remake Looks Like In Action</h2> <p><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> is a totally different game from the <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> remaster we got back on the Xbox 360. As seen in this extended gameplay trailer, which Xbox published shortly after the store page went live, this is a brand new game based on the OG title with incredible visuals and new features. <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-impressions-1235451111/#:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20also%20just%20the%20campaign%3B%20there%E2%80%99s%20no%20multiplayer%20mode%2C%20which%20will%20ruffle%20some%20feathers.%20Previously">According to a preview from <em>Rolling Stone</em></a>, <em>Campaign Evolved</em> doesn’t feature any competitive multiplayer modes. It will support two-player split screen and four-player online co-op, though.</p>

  <p>In the gameplay video above, we see someone playing through one of the game’s best levels, The Silent Cartographer. And at the end of that 13-minute gameplay trailer, it’s confirmed this upcoming remake of the classic FPS is coming to PlayStation 5 as well as Game Pass, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Xbox Cloud. What a world we live in. <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-gears-of-war-ps5-remake-remaster-halo-forza-port-1851779186"><em>Forza, Gears of War, </em>and now <em>Halo</em> are all PlayStation games. Wild.</a> The game will support both crossplay and cross progression across all platforms.</p>

 <p>According to Microsoft, as confirmed in a livestream during the <em>Halo</em> esports event, <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1981827679667290555">“going forward,” <em>Halo</em> will be on PlayStation</a>. This seems to indicate that all future <em>Halo</em> games (and maybe past games) will ship on both Xbox and PlayStation. And Halo Studios teased this further, quoting the Master Chief in a post about the new remake: &nbsp;“<a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-launches-on-ps5-in-2026/#:~:text=As%20the%20Master%20Chief%20once%20said%3A%20%E2%80%9CI%20think%20we%E2%80%99re%20just%20getting%20started.%E2%80%9D">I think we’re just getting started.”</a></p>

 <h2>The New Stuff Being Added To <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em></h2> <p>In a PlayStation Blog post from <em>Halo</em> community director Brian “ske7ch” Jarrard, he welcomed PS5 gamers to the <em>Halo</em> universe and outlined some of the new content being added to this remade version of the 2001 classic. This remake features improved combat and nine new weapons, with some pulled from other <em>Halo</em> games. It also includes “three brand-new prequel missions starring the Master Chief and Sgt. Johnson.” According to both the PlayStation post and Xbox store listing, these missions are “set before the events of <em>Halo: Combat Evolved” </em>and will add “new environments, gameplay, and characters” to the remake.</p>

 <p>Players will be able to hijack vehicles, a feature introduced in <em>Halo 2</em>, in this new remake. This means you can even hijack the powerful Wraith tanks and drive them around, something that wasn’t possible in the first <em>Halo</em>. This new version of <em>Halo</em> also contains the largest number of “Skulls” in the franchise’s history, letting players remix missions with various effects, like, yes, the Grunt Birthday Party skull. Oh, and you can sprint now in the remake, though Halo Studios confirms that the feature can be disabled.</p> <p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-answering-the-big-questions/">In an Xbox blog post</a>, it was confirmed that <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> is running on Unreal Engine 5 and will support 4K visuals and include updated animations, remastered music, and re-recorded voice lines. “The campaign has been rebuilt to feel handcrafted and immersive, true to what players remember, not just visually, but emotionally,” explained the game’s executive producer, Damon Conn.</p> <p><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> is set to launch in 2026 on Xbox, PS5, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has ceased development on Sigil. The tabletop publisher's dedicated, Unreal-powered 3D VTT is being shelved, leaving all material on the program inaccessible to users. The silver lining is that some compensation is being planned for dedicated players.</p>

<h2>The D&amp;D Beyond Sigil Cancellation</h2>

<p>In an official D&amp;D Beyond <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/2086-closing-the-chapter-on-sigil-and-thanking-the" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Wizards of the Coast explained the reasons behind the closure of the Sigil VTT. The long and short of it is, despite the service giving players the means to create fully 3D miniatures, maps, and environments for their games, the studio could not sustain the level of ongoing development to support the service.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sigil-vtt-zombie-graveyard-screenshot.jpg?itok=zK_NDXpa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sigil-vtt-zombie-graveyard-screenshot.jpg?itok=eIgwcWn0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For a vocal part of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> community, the cancellation of this service was inevitable. This announcement comes seven months after a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-lays-off-90-of-project-sigil-staff" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">series of reports</a> confirmed 90% of the Sigil VTT's development staff were laid off. This was done because the scale of the project at the time was deemed untenable.</p>

<p>If you used this VTT service, Wizards of the Coast has provided a roadmap and some compensation for its removal. If you have a D&amp;D Beyond Master Tier subscription and used Sigil at any point between March 1 and October 23, 2025, you will receive a six month Master Tier credit on your account. The credit will appear on your account on November 7.</p>

<p>If you are still running your games in the Sigil VTT, you have a few short days to migrate your game. By the end of October, the servers will shut down and all material will be inaccessible. This is a shame, but the online space is rife with other VTT platforms on which to play such as Roll20, Foundry, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/alchemy-rpg-vtts-and-focus-on-roleplaying" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Alchemy RPG</a>, and D&amp;DBeyond's 2D Maps system.</p>

<p>Lastly, certain digital pre-order bonuses tied to the platform will have alternatives. If you bought the 2024 Digital and Physical Core Rulebook Bundle, the exclusive Gold Dragon Sigil miniature will be swapped out for a new digital dice set on D&amp;D Beyond.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Set in Japan in the 1960s, <i>Silent Hill f</i> is notable for being the first full <i>Silent Hill</i> game set outside of America, far from the series’ titular troubled town. Hinako, the protagonist, is one of four teenagers whose lives get turned upside down by terrifying supernatural events that also double as an all too relatable metaphor for the rampant harms of misogyny and the way society devalues the lives of women. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/__cnp_/">Actress Konatsu Kato</a> provides the voice of the character in Japanese, and also did the motion capture for her. She recently took to YouTube to stream the game for a little over an hour and a half (reaching Hinako’s arrival at the Dark Shrine). And hopefully she’s planning to stream more, because her reactions to the various freaky nonsense packed in <i>Silent Hill f</i> are priceless.</p> <h2>‘How could someone come up with something like this?’</h2> <p>You can watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ek5c3sQygs&amp;t=1507s">whole stream here</a>, but there are some standout moments worth jumping to if you’re a bit impatient.</p> <p>Here’s Kato encountering one of the game’s first fightable monsters, to which she says (based on auto-translate), “How could someone come up with something like this?:</p>

  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/0Ek5c3sQygs?t=1492">Another great moment</a> comes early on when Kato has to run from the fog monster, which she does while screaming “Oh, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.” If you don’t have time to watch the whole stream, it’s also worth jumping into about 55 minutes or so when she comes across the bloody mask with the key lodged inside. The monster chase that follows is good fun too, as Kato frantically tries to find out how to escape while saying “I can’t take it anymore! Eh, wait a minute. This way? Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, which way, which way? Ah, I’ve done something weird.” And yes, like many of us likely did during this part, she totally goes for the wrong door.</p> <p>The video is titled “<i>SILENT HILL f </i>#1” so here’s hoping we get to see more!</p>

Its first game under Netflix was <em>Dungeon Boss: Respawned</em>, followed by <em>Netflix Stories</em>, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/netflix-stories-mobile-games-shuts-down-1236350580/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which were visual novels based off Netflix shows</a>; <em>Money Heist: Ultimate Choice, </em>another visual novel based off a Netflix show; and <a href="https://aftermath.site/squid-game-unleashed-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em></a>, a battle royale game based the hit Netflix show that was released in December 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>Netflix did not provide a reply to a request for comment.&nbsp;</p><p>Boss Fight was the third independent game studio acquired by Netflix as it ramped up its ever-changing games strategy, following <em>Oxenfree</em> maker Night School Studio and mobile developer Next Games. Netflix bolstered its games strategy in 2022 by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23373053/netflix-video-game-studio-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opening two studios in Finland</a> <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/18/netflix-to-expand-into-cloud-gaming-opens-new-studio-in-southern-california/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and California</a>, respectively, <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/netflix-acquires-6th-gaming-studio-spry-fox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">then buying <em>Cozy Groze</em> maker Spry Fox</a>. Netflix closed the California studio in 2024; according to Game File, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-team-blue-socal-studio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was working on a triple A game</a>. Around that time, Netflix shook up its games program's leadership, shifting roles to land with former <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/netflix-games-president-alain-tascan-epic-1236081464/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic Games executive vice president Alain Tascan</a> taking the helm as President of Games.&nbsp;</p><p>Netflix has spent the past several years hyping up the sorts of games Boss Fight had been making—specifically, <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em>. In an <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Netflix-Inc-_Earnings-Call_2025-10-21_English.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earnings call</a> days before Boss Fight's closure, Netflix co-CEO Gregory Peters used <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em> as an example of its strategy for one of its several "verticals," which is centered on "immersive narrative games based on our own IP." The other verticals are games for kids, social games that play on the TV (like <em>Boggle Party</em> or <em>Pictionary</em>), and mainstream game ports like <em>Grand Theft Auto. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</em> is Netflix's most downloaded game, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/netflixs-ad-gaming-bets-focus-investors-seek-clarity-pay-off-2025-10-20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Sensor Tower data reported by Reuters</a>.</p><p>"We're just starting to scratch the surface today," Peters said in the Tuesday earnings call. "We think there's much more we can ultimately do in this space. Yet we already see how this approach not only extends the audience's engagement with the story but it creates a synergy that reinforces both mediums, the interactive and the noninteractive side. It drives engagement, drives retention, and therefore, supports the business. So looking ahead, we're going to ramp our investment in this area judiciously based on demonstrating that we're ramping returns to the business, but we're extremely excited about the progress we've got ahead of us."</p><p>The strategy espoused Tuesday is the same <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/633481/netflix-gaming-strategy-alain-tascan-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that Tascan told The Verge in March</a>. But Boss Fight's shuttering doesn't necessarily make sense within the scope of Netflix's plan: It seemed to be doing exactly what Netflix said—and says—it wants. The game is available on mobile to everyone, even people who aren’t Netflix subscribers, which could serve as a kind of promotion for the streamer’s exclusive content. It certainly “extends the audience's engagement with the story” of Netflix’s hit show, casting players as competitors in <em>Squid Game</em>’s fight to the death. By Netflix's count, <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em> reached number one in the <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/squid-game-by-the-numbers-how-player-456-took-over-the-world" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free action game category in more than 100 countries on the App Store</a> charts. AppMagic estimated in early 2025 that <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/netflixs-squid-game-unleashed-mobile-game-surpasses-10m-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em> was downloaded more than 10 million times</a>, making it the fifth most popular Netflix game. <em>GTA: San Andreas</em>, <em>Storyteller</em>, <em>SpongeBob: Get Cooking</em>, and <em>Bloons TD</em> fill out the top four, but <em>Squid Game: Unleashed </em>is the only one of these five games developed in-house by Netflix.</p><p>Peters spoke about Netflix's gaming business at the Bloomberg Screentime event in Los Angeles in October, likening the slow growth of that part of the business to Netflix's expansion into the Japanese market where, by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/netflixs-ad-gaming-bets-focus-investors-seek-clarity-pay-off-2025-10-20/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a>' reporting, "only 2% of consumers knew the brand."</p><p>"We just did the 10th Anniversary in Japan ... but it took us a long time," Peters said at the event, as reported by Reuters. "The gaming situation is not dissimilar to that."&nbsp;</p><p>But people don't come to Netflix for games. It’s likely many people don't even know the company offers them—the disconnect between Netflix on your TV and its games on your phone doesn't necessarily work in favor of the company. Research company Omdia reported in June that Netflix’s games lineup increased user time spent by less than .5%, according to Reuters, which certainly doesn’t seem like a win for the extending audience engagement Peters spoke of in the earnings call. Netflix's strategy, as described on Tuesday in the financial earnings call, remains impossibly broad, even as Peters said the company was focusing its efforts on “a few identified verticals.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Right now, it sounds like the social games played within the Netflix app, on TV screens, is what's stepping forward; Peters said that this holiday season Netflix is releasing a bunch of party games that play on the TV—<a href="https://www.theverge.com/streaming/797589/netflix-tv-party-games-boggle-tetris-lego-party" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Boggle Party, Pictionary Game Night, LEGO Party, Tetris</em></a>—but are controlled by phones. That does make more sense than other games; people are already in the Netflix app, and games that are easy to get into and play are ultimately what users will see. But it doesn't solve the problem that most people, when opening Netflix, are looking for something to watch rather than play.&nbsp;</p><p>Netflix's failure to become a meaningful platform for games isn’t the fault of anyone at the studio level. And whether or not <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em> succeeded by whatever metric the <a href="https://aftermath.site/kaos-cancelled-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">notoriously fickle company</a> set for it, there’s no denying it fits within Netflix’s strategy around the show, which has seen multiple spinoffs and tie-ins. But Netflix clearly doesn’t know precisely what it wants games to do on its platform, a problem well above the remit of the developers at Boss Fight who’ve lost their jobs. As usual, when executives flounder, it’s workers who pay the price.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-microsoft-xbox-30-percent-profit-margin-twitchcon"><h3>What The Hell Is Microsoft Doing?</h3></a><p>"They added a new Clippy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another week, another baffling headline out of Microsoft. The latest is at least illustrative: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Bloomberg</a>, the company has set an across-the-board goal of 30 percent “accountability margins” – Microsoft’s weird, somehow-worse-sounding term for profit margins – which explains why its gaming division has been rampantly laying off employees, canceling games, and closing studios. So now we know the directive that informed numerous questionable decisions, but why keep doing it? On the latest Aftermath Hours, we wonder if Microsoft will ever find a way to right the ship.</p><p>This time around, we discuss the aforementioned recent revelation that Microsoft has been seeking a 30 percent profit margin from its gaming division since 2023. This borders on ludicrous compared to what the rest of the industry typically achieves and fully clears that bar in the case of Xbox, which managed a 12 percent profit margin in 2022. Now here we are in 2025, following <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-1900-people-at-activision-blizzard-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple rounds</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mass layoffs</a> and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/were-still-feeling-aftershocks-from-microsofts-destructive-july-layoffs-and-cancellations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">project cancellations</a>, because while Xbox was profitable, it wasn’t profitable <em>enough</em>. We once again repeat what has become a common refrain: What is Microsoft thinking, especially as both the industry and the global economy enter increasingly uncertain times? And if Microsoft continues to pump out pricey hardware while laying off developers and shutting down studios, where will the money come from?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we talk about TwitchCon and the security woes that became <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-twitchcon-2025-security-emiru-assault-irl-streamers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the story of this year’s event</a>. While the claim that TwitchCon had no security is definitively untrue, misogyny and sociopathic clip farming intrinsic to the modern platform ecosystem still managed to spill over into real life. How does Twitch handle that? At what point does TwitchCon become so much of a reputational risk that Twitch would be better off pulling the plug?&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, we talk about both Mario (the video game character) and Luigi (Mangione).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts.

This is Microsoft right now in 2025: What the fuck are you doing? Constantly! With <a href="https://aftermath.site/windows-11-nope" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Windows 10</a>! With everything!</p><p>They added a new Clippy. He looks like shit. He’s a little blob. Fuck you! I don’t want that!</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/804106/microsoft-mico-copilot-ai-assistant-clippy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Warren at The Verge said</a> [its name, Mico] is pronounced “Mee-co,” but you can’t do that, because it’s Microsoft. It’s a shortened version of your company name, but it’s not pronounced the same.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> So wait, this new Clippy has a name and everything? I need to look this up.</p><p>OK so, he’s an AI assistant. Of course. My first impression: He looks like shit – kinda like one of those little guys from <em>Mario Galaxy</em>, but sans any sort of personality. They sanded off every edge both literally and figuratively to make it as inoffensive as possible.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> This is what gets me. I still haven’t upgraded to Windows 11, but every time I’m like “I’ve gotta deal with this; I care about my device security,” it’s like “We’ve added all this AI shit.” What if I just don’t want it? You can sign up to back up your stuff, but you’ve gotta use OneDrive, and it’s only five gigs or something.</p><p>When we stopped using Windows 8 or whatever, few people were still using it. But this is crazy: 42 percent of users are still using Windows 10.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Sorry, I’m still over here reading about Mico. From The Verge article: “You can see it, it reacts as you speak to it, and if you talk about something sad you’ll see its facial expressions react almost immediately.”&nbsp;</p><p>Why would I want my little Clippy-adjacent fucking assistant guy to emotionally react to me saying something sad? Why would I want to say something sad when I’m like “Hey, can you open Excel for me?”</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Imagine if it got sad about the wrong thing. You’re like “Hey, I got a new haircut,” and it just [makes an unhappy face at you].&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It’s like “I don’t know about that one, man.” But that would actually be useful!</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> “You can make this thing sad,” as a selling point, feels very weird.<br><strong>Nathan:</strong> Right! It’s so bizarre! What a strange selling point, to say “This is why you should want this: because you can upset it.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/brainrot-roblox-court"><h3>Brainrot Goes To Court [Correction]</h3></a><p>Someone is trying to explain brainrot to a judge</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-twitchcon-2025-security-emiru-assault-irl-streamers"><h3>Beefed Up TwitchCon Security Couldn’t Stop The Internet’s Issues From Spilling Over Into Real Life</h3></a><p>A high-profile assault and toxic IRL streamers have forced the Twitch community to reckon with deeper-seated problems</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-microsoft-xbox-30-percent-profit-margin-twitchcon]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/holy-crap-it-looks-like-disney-is-finally-restoring-and-releasing-the-original-version-of-star-wars.1334407/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The theatrical version of <em>Star Wars: A New Hope,</em> released as just <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-and-worst-parts-of-every-star-wars-movie-1850406311"><em>Star Wars</em></a> back in 1977, is seemingly being restored in 4k by Disney for a future release, according to new leaks. This version of George Lucas’ sci-fi blockbuster hasn’t been officially released by Lucasfilm since 2006, and that was a crappy transfer from a Laserdisc.</p> <p>Over the last few months, rumors and leaks have been circulating online about Disney working on a remastered and fully restored version of<em> Star Wars</em>. Then, recently, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ysOeFio">video clips surfaced</a> of this not-yet-officially-announced 4K restoration of the theatrical version of <em>Star Wars</em>. Those clips were promptly deleted, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/1o52vaa/star_wars_theatrical_ot_leaked_restoration/">but leaked screenshots are still floating around</a> and show new, highly detailed scans of <em>A New Hope</em>, and also <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> and<em> Return of the Jedi,</em> implying the entire OG trilogy is being restored. And the best part? The leaked information claims that these restorations are being done properly, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ctHBnCF">using original film negatives</a> and with an effort to preserve grain and color grading. This doesn’t appear to be a quick 4K AI upscale like we’ve seen in recent years.</p>

 <p>This is a big deal because the last time Lucasfilm officially released the original theatrical version of the films, without all of Lucas’ special edition tweaks and changes, <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Original_unaltered_trilogy">was way back in 2006</a>. The DVD versions of<em> Star Wars</em> released back then included the original theatrical cuts as a bonus feature. Sadly, these were poorly transferred copies from the Laserdisc versions of the S<em>tar Wars</em> movies. And the transfers on Laserdisc weren’t great either.</p>

 <p>And while fans have done incredible work restoring the original cuts of<em> Star Wars</em> via projects like <a href="https://www.thestarwarstrilogy.com/project-4k77/"><em>4K77</em>,</a> these efforts have always been limited by having to work with old film stock and not having access to the original negatives or higher-quality prints. So it’s very exciting that Lucasfilm and Disney are properly restoring the OG cuts of the original trilogy, as they alone have access to the best source material around and the resources to pull this off.</p>

 <p>We already know that Disney plans to bring back <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-50th-anniversary-theatrical-release"><em>A New Hope</em> to theaters in 2027, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the franchise</a>. In the announcement of those plans, Disney didn’t specify which version would be shown. But it looks like it might actually be the long-awaited theatrical cut. If that’s the case, I’ll be there for sure. I also hope these versions get proper 4K UHD releases and are made available on Disney+.</p> <p><em>Star Wars</em> is one of the most influential films in history, and it deserves to be seen in its original form in the best quality possible. I’m happy that Disney, possibly looking to win back old fans, is finally doing this after decades of Lucas not caring. Now, let’s just hope this is all real and the company doesn’t fuck this up between now and release.</p>

One of the most exciting recent examples of this collaboration is Monolith Board Game’s upcoming <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/monolith-board-games-sarl/berserk-the-board-game#/section/project-story/the-world-of-berserk" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Berserk: The Board Game</u></a>, which has taken off on Gamefound this month.</p><div catalogid="8af5b904-5b67-4bf6-9aeb-546b99842755" id="229882"><div id="229882" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Berserk: The Board Game</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Here's where to back the project.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With nearly 5,900 backers and pulling in just over €2 million at time of writing, this tabletop adaptation of Kentaro Miura’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/berserk-1997"><u>Berserk manga/anime</u></a> has cut through its funding goal like Guts cleaving through a demon with his signature Dragon Slayer. Berserk: The Board Game lets 1-5 players take up the weapons of characters, including Serpico, Farnese, Isidro, Shierke, and of course, Guts to dispatch and destroy demonic foes. All of Guts' crew come in detailed miniatures just begging to be painted. These plastic avatars of the Grunbeld and its Grunbeld Apostle, Slan, and Makara are sights to behold, and more than 120 miniatures is a treasure trove for fans that enjoy painting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of the Berserk manga will be treated to a ton of artwork pulled from the original story to enjoy. All of the action cards that compose each character’s deck feature iconic moments from the series, along with the imposing enemy cards and more. The core game box gives you an 11 Act campaign that takes place during the <a href="https://berserk.fandom.com/wiki/Millennium_Falcon_Arc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Millennium Falcon arc</u></a>, but the additional Black Swordsman expansion that is also available during the campaign allows you to build your own adventures with tons of possible combinations and options to pick from – including the characters in your party and the enemies you are going to face.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While board game adaptations, especially these grandiose boxes, aren’t uncommon these days, most of the time it seems as though <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-based-on-video-games">video games are the source material</a>, and seeing an anime with such legacy and personality as Berserk is exciting. Monolith Board Games has a pedigree for adapting properties for the tabletop that let players team up and bash some heads in, having previously designed games based on Conan the Barbarian and Batman. Berserk, with its mix of dice rolling, card draw, and grid-based movement, looks like it is going to be another gruesome good time.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Backing the project</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Berserk: The Board Game looks to have set itself up as a box that will appeal to fans of Berserk who may not have much exposure to the board game scene, thanks to all of the miniatures, as well as fans of co-operative board games thanks to <a href="https://monolithedition.com/en/?srsltid=AfmBOorQlFhIOVq47gt-eRt-hFrVc3EpqJe88mEICIDa8qMmOtjkeh9m" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monolith’s expertise</a>.
