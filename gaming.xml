Founded as a spinoff of charity bundle site Humble Bundle, Humble Games currently answers to Ziff Davis directly and has published over 50 games since it's launch including hits like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/slay-spire" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Slay the Spire"><em>Slay the Spire</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/void-bastards-review-comic-genius" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Void Bastards Review"><em>Void Bastards</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/unpacking" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Unpacking"><em>Unpacking</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/temtem" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Temtem"><em>Temtem</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/signalis" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Signalis"><em>Signalis</em></a>.</p>
<p>Reports began emerging this afternoon on Linked In as people posted they had been laid off, with eventually a clearer picture emerging that the publisher was under going major changes, and that 36 people had been laid off. According to Nicola Kwan who was part of Business Development at Humble Games, the team was informed at 9 AM this morning that they were being let go and the company was shutting down.</p>
<p>While early reports had placed it that Humble Games was being shut down, an official statement from Humble Games shared the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;"In these challenging economic times for indie game publishing, Humble Games has made the difficult but necessary decision to restructure our operations. This decision was not made lightly; it involved much deliberation and careful thought, with the goal of ensuring the stability and support of our developers and ongoing projects. Additionally, the restructuring of operations at Humble Games will have no impact on operations at Humble Bundle.</p>
<p>We are acutely aware of the profound impact this decision has on our team members at Humble Games and deeply empathize with everyone affected. Our team's contributions have been world-class and invaluable, supporting the launch of our games since we started publishing in 2017. We are committed to navigating this transition with as much empathy and understanding as possible.</p>
<p>Supporting our development partners and assisting former team members remains our top priority. We are committed to making this transition as smooth as possible for everyone involved. Thank you for your support and compassion during this challenging period. It is deeply appreciated."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nicola was far from the only Humble Games employee posting on LinkedIn or other social media about their job loss, or the closure of the publisher. One of the first that was spotted was by <a href="https://x.com/Emilee3D/status/1815803781629505985" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Emilee Kieffer on Twitter">Senior QA worker Emilee Kieffer</a>, sharing that this was the best team she had ever worked with, and hoping to work together with some of her former coworkers in the future.</p>

The <a href="https://x.com/ProdeusGame/status/1815823993829482906" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Prodeus on Twitter">developers of Prodeus posted </a>on the social media outlet formerly known as Twitter saying, "We just heard the news about our publisher Humble Games. We loved working with all of the talented people there, and are sad that things ended up this way. We hope everyone can land on their feet" They then pledged to keep their community up to date on what is changing and if it will impact the game.</p>
<p>Especially when it was believed the company was entirely shutting down many remorseful comments emerged about Humble Games as they have published an eclectic but often award winning and commercially successful set of&nbsp; games. <a href="https://x.com/ProdeusGame/status/1815823993829482906" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Robert Bowling Twitter">Robert Bowling</a>, who launched the publishing arm of Humble games, said that he, "loved this little publisher that could", and that he was fortunate to start it off.

<p>Ava Kris Tyson has announced she will be leaving the Mr Beast team following a recent slew of allegations pertaining to grooming an inappropriate behavior.</p>



<p>Taking to Twitter, of which Ava has recently deleted of her past posts, she said, “I would like to apologize for any of my past behavior or comments if it hurt or offended anyone. It was not my intent. Seeing recent events we’ve mutually decided it’s best I permanently step away from all things MrBeast and social media to focus on my family and mental health.”</p>



<p>In the past couple of days, Aca Kris Tyson has faced numerous allegations of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ava-kris-tyson-predator-allegations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grooming and sending inappropriate sexual messages to a minor</a>.</p>



<p>Mr Beast, or anyone from his team, has yet to officially comment on the allegations and Ava Kris Tyson’s departure from the team.</p>



<p>Countless streamers, content creators, and other personalities have since voiced their opinions on the situation. Popular streamer <a href="https://x.com/pokimanelol/status/1815787489778655664" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokimane said</a>, “I don’t know all the details regarding the ava situation but i wanna make it clear: any inappropriate behavior towards minors is unacceptable, regardless of who you are.”</p>



<p>As the days continue, more and more accusations and allegations continue to be released about Ava Kris Tyson. However, one of the original accusations was that Ava Kris Tyson was sending inappropriate messages to a 13-year-old. Since then, though, that person has said that these accusations are “massive lies and twisting the truth.”</p>

While it used to be revenue from sales of boxed copies at GameStop and Walmart, it’s now overwhelmingly from sales of digital downloads on console storefronts. Publishers like Electronic Arts don’t even make most of their money from game sales at all, but rather from “recurring revenue,” AKA microtransactions in online multiplayer and free-to-play games like <em>Madden</em> and <em>Apex Legends</em>.</p><p>“Back then before the PlayStation 4 was released, you’d be lucky to get five to 10 percent of digital sales for a AAA game,” Daniel Ahmad, director of research and insights at Niko Partners, told <em>Kotaku</em> in an interview. “Today, depending on the title, you know, it can be as high as 80 percent but it could also be as low as 40 percent.” He noted that while the average breakdowns overwhelmingly favor digital downloads (with platforms like PlayStation reporting annual digital revenue splits over 70 percent), it can still vary a lot on a case-by-case basis.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/annual/2023/annual_2023_01.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/annual/2023/annual_2023_01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In its annual report this year</a></span>, Capcom revealed that roughly 89 percent of the games it sells are digital copies. It expects that number to reach close to 94 percent in 2024. The report also emphasized how much more profitable these sales are. <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em>, a new $50 Capcom game with no physical version, exemplifies that move.

Do I think physical sales might get lower over time? Sure, but will it ever completely go away? I don’t think so.”<br></p><p>Aggregate data can sometimes obscure small but substantial wrinkles in popular trends. While it’s true that physical games have become a niche market in the broader gaming landscape, a shift accelerated by the pandemic, Early also pointed out that even a small slice of a big pie can mean a lot of money. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gamesindustrybiz-presents-the-year-in-number-2023&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gamesindustrybiz-presents-the-year-in-number-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to a<em> GamesIndustry.biz</em> infographic</a></span> using Newzoo data, only 17 percent of console gaming revenue in 2023 was from boxed games, but that still came out to $9.5 billion.

Nintendo still reports that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.shacknews.com/article/139787/nintendo-ntdoy-fy-2024-digital-sales&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/139787/nintendo-ntdoy-fy-2024-digital-sales" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">roughly half of its software revenue</a></span> comes from physical releases vs. digital spending, which includes digital-only games and add-on content. But the difference is even more stark when you compare breakdowns of physical sales to digital sales for games that have retail copies. Based on his estimates, Switch owners bought physical copies over digital 60 percent of the time in the first quarter of 2024.</p><p>“When it comes to digital sales as a whole it’s absolutely massive,” Ahmad said more generally. “But if we look at just the physical versus digital split for games that are released physically, then yes, it’s lower than that 70 percent number and two, it definitely skews higher for AAA and first-party games, especially during the holiday season, where gifting is a notable part of it.”</p><p>And even as some big games like<em> Baldur’s Gate 3</em> and <em>Alan Wake II</em> have initially skipped physical copies at launch, smaller games and indie releases that were previously digital-only are partnering with companies like Limited Run Games to get physical editions printed and into the hands of their hardcore fans. “I think there’s always going to be a demand for physical media,” Limited Run CEO Josh Fairhurst told<em> Kotaku</em> in a recent interview. “We see that with music, things were starting to feel like it was going to go all digital, and then vinyl kind of exploded, because people were starting to see kind of the downsides of digital purchasing not actually owning the music.”</p><p>He said the audience for that is definitely the biggest on Switch and smallest on Xbox, estimating that for every Xbox version of a physical game Limited Run sells, two are purchased on PlayStation and 10 are bought on Nintendo’s platform. In addition to the physical connection fans feel to the products going back to the NES and PS1 days, he thinks fears about the lack of digital preservation also drive physical collecting.</p><p>“I think that’s kind of going to happen more and more as time marches on and more services end up shutting down for whatever reason, because there’s always going to be something newer, bigger, better coming out that will eventually out mode, whatever the current popular model of distribution is,” Fairhurst said. “I think people are going to get frustrated when they see their digital purchases evaporate.”</p><p>That’s not necessarily the case as much for Xbox, where a majority of console sales this generation have already been for the disc-less Series S and millions are subscribed to the Netflix-style rental service Game Pass. Fans now routinely share photos online of almost all-digital Xbox sections at stores like Target and Best Buy where cards with download codes have replaced plastic game cases. Big first-party releases like <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em> have skipped physical editions, and earlier this year a number of physical editions of small games by third-party publishers appeared to be canceled. Meanwhile, leaked plans pointed to Microsoft at one point working on a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-all-digital-disc-drive-leak-game-pass-1850857060&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-all-digital-disc-drive-leak-game-pass-1850857060">discless mid-gen refresh for the Series X</a></span>.</p><p>Earlier this year, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer told <em>Game File</em> the company wasn’t planning to abandon physical media. “I will say our strategy does not hinge on people moving all-digital,” he said. “And getting rid of physical, that’s not a strategic thing for us.” But analysts all think Xbox will be the first console to ditch discs entirely. Circana analyst Mat Piscatella <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1804933759537700886&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1804933759537700886" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted earlier this year</a></span> that he expected Microsoft to go all-digital soon, with Sony following the one after that, and Nintendo having at least two more hardware generations with physical media.</p><p>“Physical, as long as there’s disk drives on the console, is never going to go fully away, there’ll always be demand for it, as long as it’s part of the console package,” Ahmad said. “But if, for example, Xbox decides to exclude a disc drive next generation, like we saw with the all digital Series X, they’re unlikely to see a negative material impact on earnings given how niche physical sales are on the platform today.”</p><p>And even when companies continue to support physical formats, the advantages of them are continuing to erode. Where discs and cartridges used to be plug-and-play, they now need to install on the console and often require massive day-one updates. It might be weeks or months before important bugs are fixed or highly requested gameplay features get added in post-launch patches. “With that in mind, a lot of people will say ‘I’ll just get the digital version’,” Ahmad said. “It’s just the same thing, but more convenient.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Rocket Racing is reintroducing Inferno Island, with players being able to participate in Casual Racing, a new game mode. This allows players to take part in the Rocket Racing event without high stakes and have a relaxing time. Along with this update comes five brand-new Epic-made tracks, with two additional tracks created by 404 Creative.</p>
<p>The Casual Racing around Inferno Island has a hand-crafted playlist where players of all skill levels can mingle and participate in races together without worrying about trying to come first or with the pressure of it affecting your rank. These races are also a great way to ease yourself into the game before you start participating in ranked games.</p>
<p>Rank resets are coming, with the new ranks being based on your final ranking during the season. At the time of writing, players can now begin to participate in quests and challenges across <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-cursed-sails-event-now-live/">Fortnite</a> and Rocket League in the Summer Road Trip to work their way up to unlocking the Tesla Cybertruck.</p>
<p>For those playing Fortnite and planning on taking the Tesla Cybertruck for a spin, you'll have to complete quests to get the Tesla Cybertruck bundle and the Summer Road Trip <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/unlock-the-cybertruck-in-fortnite-by-goin-on-a-summer-road-trip-with-the-squad" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exclusive Baja Off-Road Decal for the Tesla Cybertruck</a>.</p>
<p>From July 23 through to July 31, there will be unique quests and challenges to complete daily. Nine quests must be completed, but you will have until August 3 to complete them all to unlock the rewards. By completing the quests for the Summer Road Trip event in Fortnite, you'll gain access to rewards such as the Underworld Camo Wrap, Sun Sign Back Bling, and Beast Mode Cybertruck Boost.</p>
<p>For those getting stuck into <a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/en/news/unlock-the-cybertruck-on-a-rocket-league-summer-road-trip">Rocket League</a>, there are three challenges players need to participate in to unlock the Tesla Cybertruck bundle for themselves. Challenge one begins on July 23 and finishes on August 6. Challenge two starts on July 26 and finishes on August 6. Finally, the third challenge begins on July 31 and finishes on August 6.</p>
<p>If you decide to participate in the Rocket League Summer Road Trip, you can unlock a multitude of decals for your brand-new Tesla Cybertruck. In addition, if you miss out on the event, you can purchase the decals from the item shop for a limited time between August 7 and August 21, except for the Baja Off-Road Decal. The challenges for both games are relatively simple, with most of them asking you to participate in a certain number of games or earn a specific amount of XP.</p>
<p>The Baja Off-Road Decal is exclusively earned by completing the Summer Road Trip event in Fortnite or Rocket League.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/23/helldivers-2s-biggest-content-update-yet-escalation-of-freedom-arrives-in-august<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Helldivers 2 has been one of 2024’s biggest successes, and developer Arrow Head Games is prepping to launch its most substantial update yet. Escalation of Freedom is an upcoming update that adds new missions, new hazards, and, of course, new bugs.</p>

<p>Arriving on August 6, Escalation of Freedom challenges players with a new level 10 difficulty and introduces new mission objectives, such as locating and extracting a crying larva that attracts Terminids. The game also receives new, larger fortress-like outposts for players to capture. The swamp biome gets a spookier facelift, and acid storms can now reduce the armor for players and enemies so both sides take greater damage. New Terminids and Automatons will clash with players, and Arrow Head Games teases that Escalation of Freedom features more surprises players will have to discover on their own. Check out the trailer for a look at what's to come.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pQl2BmhSCsA" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Escalation of Freedom also brings quality-of-life improvements including an update to address grief kicking. Per the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/23/helldivers-2s-biggest-update-yet-escalation-of-freedom-drops-august-6/">PlayStation Blog</a>, the game is getting "a system where if a player is kicked, they will spawn into a new session as the host with all of the team’s loot from their previous session. All items can now be picked up by the player before extraction. The squad doing the kicking will see a message in the chat widget that a player has been kicked, yet their loot remains unchanged."</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2s-first-mythic-weapon-skin-revealed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/overwatch-2%E2%80%99s-first-mythic-weapon-skin-revealed.934968/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2s-first-mythic-weapon-skin-revealed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Overwatch 2's first Mythic weapon skin has been revealed and is officially coming to Overwatch 2 today. The first Mythic weapon skin goes to Reinhardt, titled the Bound Demon Reinhardt Mythic Weapon Skin. This cosmetic is now available for purchase in the Mythic Shop. To give the weapon some flair, it reacts to every movement and swing of the weapon you make, coming alive in the hands of Reinhardt.</p>
<p>When you get a kill, the smoldering weapon will erupt into flames, giving the idea that the player is constantly satiating the demon lurking within every single time they attack successfully or kill an enemy. For those who want to appear more dangerous on the battlefield, picking up this cosmetic is a great way to go about it, especially if you want to see your foes burst into flames when you eliminate them with your weapon.</p>
<p>The Mythic Skin has multiple purchase options, with the ability to purchase the base Mythic skin for 50 Mythic Shards, equivalent to $39.99, which is pretty pricey for just a single weapon skin, primarily since Mythic Shards can only be obtained through the Premium Battle Pass. You can then unlock three varying levels of effects on the weapon. For example, you can get a special weapon flourish or elimination effects and reactive effects if you want to show off your skill with the weapon and intimidate your foes.</p>
<p>For a limited time, the Reinhardt Mythic Weapon Skin Bundle can unlock the base Mythic skin for Reinhardt's weapon, along with 2,000 Overwatch Coins and 20 Battle Pass Tier Skips.</p>
<p>"Our initial thought was to have the theme be magma, but once I started concepting, I decided to add a creature to make the weapon fiery and alive. Eventually, we landed on Bound Demon, a cursed axed that glows with hellfire," explains <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/overwatch/24104604/unleash-your-inner-demon-with-reinhardt-s-mythic-weapon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Angela Song</a>, the concept artist for the Mythic Weapon. For the flourish of the weapon, a lot of thought went into how to make it threatening. "We wanted a smooth animation that the player can constantly spam. Reinhardt jovially tossing and flipping his weapon felt like a natural fit. It suits his personality and encourages the player to spam it," says Angela Song.</p>
<p>While this is the first Mythic Weapon skin to be released, plenty is on the horizon. New Mythic Weapon skins will be available in each <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-season-11-launches-on-thursday-june-20/">new season of Overwatch 2</a>, allowing more players to show off their flair on the battlefield with each new Mythic Weapon added to the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/how-crow-country-captured-the-survival-horror-energy-of-1996/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>The year is 1996. I’m home from middle school, and my friends and I have walked to the closest house—mine—before dinner. The daily ritual is to grab one bag of chips (usually Doritos) and one soda (often Mountain Dew) from the garage. My friend Matt could not be trusted, which is why my mom eventually put a sign in the garage reminding everyone to grab one of each. I am pretty sure he was still grabbing at least a second bag of chips and hoping no one noticed.</p><p>Snacks and beverages in hand, we’d head upstairs and sit down in front of the television to play video games. Sometimes, we’d play <em>GoldenEye </em>and scream at one another for clearly looking at another person’s screen to gain an advantage. Other times, we’d beat the crap out of one another in rounds of <em>Tekken</em>. This time, everyone was waiting with baited breath because I had a copy of <em>Resident Evil</em>, billed as a very scary new video game for the original PlayStation.</p><p>We were, I should note, all 11 years old. A perfect situation.</p><p>I distinctly remember turning the infamous L-shaped corner in the early hours of Resident Evil, the one where <em>you-know-what </em>jumps through the window when you least expect it. I did not expect it. My friends did not expect it. And my mom, running to the room to see why everyone was screaming, also did not expect it. As I frantically emptied my clip into the zombie dog that had rudely burst onto the scene, our terror turned to laughter. What was behind the next door?</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8OaXfg8tMK0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Resident Evil 1 (Playstation 1) Original Trailer/Commercial"></iframe><figcaption><p dir="ltr"><span>www.biohazard1.com is an incredibly funny name for a website. It no longer exists.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>That, in a nutshell, is the magic of early survival horror games.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Crow Country </em>is a game from 2024 trying to capture the energy of 1996, about the story of a creepy theme park that, of course, has suddenly closed. Who could say why? More specifically, it’s after the energy of survival horror games from that era, an energy the genre has been chasing since. It’s the era of the original <em>Resident Evil</em>, <em>Silent Hill</em>, and other defining games.</p><p>The difference between then and now is that <em>Resident Evil</em>’s developers didn’t know they were outlining a genre. Its designers, like its eventual players, were fumbling in the dark. <em>Crow Country</em>’s designer and writer, Adam Vian, has hindsight. What does it mean to make a game inspired by works from 30 years ago that clicks for those burdened by nostalgia <em>and</em> people under the age of 30? What elements of survival horror are crusty mechanics that need to be updated for the modern age, versus intrinsic crustiness that makes survival horror work at all?</p><p>To learn more, I asked Adam to answer a few questions about what defines a genre, what it means to play with genre conventions and expectations, and why <em>Crow Country </em>became a hit.</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Got some real LONGLEGS on ya, pal? Ha ha ha. This reference will still make sense in a few years, right?</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Remap: <em>Crow Country </em>has proved very popular, but is it surprisingly popular? Has its success taken you by surprise at all?</strong></p><p>Adam Vian: I was cautiously optimistic before release, but the response has been beyond anything we could have reasonably hoped for. Numbers-wise, it's the most successful game release we've ever had. But it was seeing all the amazing fanart (and cosplay) in the first couple of weeks really drove home the reality of the game's popularity. Looking on Twitch and seeing a whole screen full of streamers all streaming the game at the same time—that was a very surreal moment for me. I saved a screenshot of it, in case I ever start to doubt it really happened.</p><p><strong>Naturally, you’d guess it’s old school survival horror fans, but is that too simplistic?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Adam: Yeah, it's had a wider reach. Old school survival horror fans really like<em> Crow Country</em>, but before we added the hard mode, they mostly found it pretty easy. Perhaps too easy. Despite that issue however, they still seemed to have a great time with it, and it often got labelled as a great entry-point for players looking to discover the genre. 'My first survival horror game'. And I'm fine with that! It definitely seems to have worked out for us—a lot of players who are younger or less experienced with the genre have discovered the game and loved it.</p><p><strong>What is your definition of survival horror, and how does that apply to what <em>Crow Country’</em>s definition of survival horror is?</strong></p><p>Adam: My personal definition of survival horror probably starts and ends with the format laid out by <em>Resident Evil 1.</em> It's about navigating an unfolding (Metroidvania-like) space, unlocking new areas by solving puzzles and finding inventory items - all while enemies are trying to attack you. And, of course, you have limited resources with which to deal with the enemies.</p><p>When making the <em>Crow Country </em>pitch deck, I had a slide about the inspiration I was taking from PS1-era survival horror games—and it included a list of characteristics I wanted to aim for:</p><ol><li>A rich atmosphere.</li><li>A strong, tangible sense of place.</li><li>A small (but memorable) cast of characters.</li><li>Meaningful exploration.</li><li>Engaging puzzle design.</li><li>A mixture of tension and tranquility.</li></ol><p>So, I suppose these are the things I value most in these kinds of games. Or, perhaps, this is a list of things I'm often disappointed to not find in many modern horror games—and thus, things I wanted to make sure my game had. (Perhaps that's why this list doesn't mention combat?)</p><figure><figcaption><span>They don't make weirdly evocative and highly confusing box art like this these days.</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>I heard someone describe <em>Crow Country</em> as a game that tries to match your memory of what it was like to play a survival horror game, rather than what it was actually like. Does that feel philosophically accurate?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Adam: Yeah, I'd agree with that. It wasn't a mantra I spoke aloud at any point, but because I made the game entirely by feeling my way through the process, it makes sense. Like when you draw something from memory, your drawing might look more like how that thing feels to you, compared to how it actually looks.</p><p>The graphics are one aspect where this is definitely the case. I don't actually think <em>Crow Country </em>looks like any kind of PlayStation 1 game—not if you compared them directly. But it feels like it does, and that's all that matters.</p><p><strong>I love that the game lets you toggle between tank controls and “modern” controls. But even offering modern controls is a choice, a concession to modern sensibilities. There’s a lot of that throughout <em>Crow Country.</em> How did you balance trying to meet people where they are, versus maintaining, I don’t know, some sense of “purity” about what a “survival horror” game is—or isn’t?</strong></p><p>Adam: Originally, the game only had tank controls. It didn't occur to me to include modern controls. But even back then, I noticed something interesting - tank controls feel good on a d-pad, but they feel bad on an analog stick. And, vice versa for modern controls. And since most people just use the analog stick by default, it meant they'd be using the bad-feeling tank controls.</p><p>Eventually, I got some negative feedback about the tank controls, and I decided to add modern controls. And so I was able to solve my problem by mapping modern controls onto the stick, and tank controls on the d-pad. This means you have both at the same time! I was proud of myself for 'inventing' such a clever solution, until I realised that the HD Remaster of <em>Resident Evil 1</em> <em>Remake </em>did the same thing.</p><p>It's so funny to me that people often compliment <em>Crow Country</em> for allowing you to rotate the camera. Like it's some interesting, unique feature. It's standard in pretty much all 3rd person games!! But because the game resembles <em>Resident Evil 1 </em>or whatever, being able to rotate the camera apparently comes as a pleasant surprise.</p><p>The one thing I was really worried about was not having any checkpoints or auto-saves. It's rare these days to have to manually save your game or otherwise risk losing progress. I was worried people would complain this was archaic, unacceptable in the modern landscape. But it ended up working out just fine, people seem happy to use the save rooms. (Although, I suspect this was helped by the fact that the game isn't that difficult—people weren't dying very much.)</p><p>In terms of old-school mechanics I avoided...the game doesn't use limited saves or limited inventory space. Both of these are fairly specific to <em>Resident Evil</em>, as<em> Silent Hill</em> doesn't use them either. That said—I want to explore both, next time.</p><p><strong>The game offers a story mode, a way to walk through the environment without the fear of death. Were you actively crafting the game knowing “hey, this room needs to still be interesting if someone isn’t popping zombies”?</strong></p><p>Adam: Years ago I'd seen a tweet from someone asking if there was a mod that removed the monsters from <em>Silent Hill</em>. In their words: “I just love being there.”</p><p>I was about halfway through <em>Crow Country</em>'s development, and I just thought... why not? There are a lot of people who have decided they can't/won't play horror games - because they're too stressful, or whatever. But they'd probably love a spooky puzzle adventure game.</p><p>And this goes back to my previous answer about my personal definition for survival horror. It so happens that all my favourite aspects of these games are things that would still be fully present in a non-combat mode—the atmosphere, the exploration, the puzzles, the characters. So (even if I hadn't realised it at first) from the beginning I'd been crafting a game that would be engaging even with the enemies turned off.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ySQJrV2girk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Code Veronica for Sega Dreamcast Preview trailer"></iframe><figcaption><p dir="ltr"><span>There are soooooo many weird things Capcom will have to update for Code Veronica X.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Do you have a favorite survival horror game, and why isn’t it <em>Resident Evil: Code Veronica X</em>? I know that game has, in many ways, aged poorly. But that transition to proper 3D remains such a defining moment of my own relationship with survival horror.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>You know, I recently replayed <em>Code Veronica X</em>. I'd only played it once before, when I was a teenager. On my revisit, I found myself liking the game a lot. Over the course of my playthrough, I went from “Capcom shouldn't remake this one” to “I'd be totally fine if Capcom remade this one.” I think it's got some really cool stuff in it.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it's a really cruel game. I lost out on the magnum due to no fault of my own. And then I lost all my best weapons and ammo in a character-switching story beat that I didn't know was about to happen. So, the end result was that I didn't have enough ammo to defeat the final boss. I literally just had to give up! You can bet they'll sand off those rough edges if it does end up getting a remake.</p><p>(For the record, the game Capcom should remake next is <em>Dino Crisis</em>.)</p><p>My favourite survival horror game is <em>Silent Hill 3</em>. I think it's the scariest, with the heaviest atmosphere. The rest of my top 5 would be <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, <em>Resident Evil 2</em> (classic), <em>Resident Evil 1</em> (remake) and <em>Parasite Eve 2</em>. And... an honourable mention to <em>Haunting Ground</em>.</p>

Both games dole out a story through journal entries and environmental storytelling but the majority of your time in <em>Riven </em>is spent in silence undisturbed by dialogue. What <em>Riven </em>uses to fill that constant silence is an expansive soundscape that paints a sonic portrait of the world you explore.</p><p>The <em>Riven </em>remake begins with aggressive metallic sounds. After a short intro you find yourself trapped behind a set of bars that shut on you with a grating reverberation that almost hurts. That industrial hardness becomes a familiar assault on the ears as you play through <em>Riven</em>—levers being pulled, doors turning, mechanical gondolas whirring to life and zipping across metal tracks. Sometimes activation mechanisms can take a handful of seconds to reach completion, all the while the sounds clues you into some complex inner workings at play behind the scenes, giving every action more weight</p><figure id="" data-id="019f1f6ce8096488664ac103906a73a2" data-recommend-id="image://019f1f6ce8096488664ac103906a73a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A wooden walkway leads through a lake towards a village on a cliffside" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A wooden walkway leads through a lake towards a village on a cliffside" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Cyan Worlds Inc</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="019f1f6ce8096488664ac103906a73a2" data-recommend-id="image://019f1f6ce8096488664ac103906a73a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A wooden walkway leads through a lake towards a village on a cliffside" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In contrast to the metallic whir of so many of the game’s puzzles, the islands themselves have a constant natural, soothing hum. Depending on the island, you can stop and listen to the particular chorus of life. One one, a horde of butterflies and unseen insects emit a locust-like humming. On another, the wind rushing through the trees rustles leaves while you explore. But one sound feels particularly omnipresent no matter where you are: the crashing of waves against the islands’ beaches.<br></p><p>This clashing soundscape of nature versus machine isn’t just a treat for the ears but it works as storytelling. <em>Riven </em>is very much a game concerned with the harm of forced industrialization in the context of colonizing a place. The detailed sounds that <em>Riven </em>uses help put the player in a space to recognize this conflict. Even the act of walking feels more meaningful due to how noticeable the change in footfall is between a dirt path and a metal walkway. On a mechanical level, sounds can even be necessary to pay attention to for certain puzzle solutions. </p><p>While the bulk of the game makes the islands seem almost devoid of people, certain areas tip you off that you might not be alone. A village with wooden walkways will often creak above or behind you as you walk through, as if someone is hiding just out of sight, while a sudden mechanical whirring in an area where there appears to be no machine makes you aware of the cameras placed around the map that follow your movement.</p><p><em>Riven</em>’s ambient sounds also make its measured use of an actual soundtrack more impactful. Some tracks play as you explore the island, interweaving seamlessly with the mechanical and natural sounds of the world to the point of almost forgetting that this is a soundtrack. But when the track shifts in response to a story beat or a major puzzle being solved it feels momentous and makes you sit up in attention. All of this detail is a wonderful iteration on the 1997 original. As a point-and-click adventure with less graphical fidelity as the 2024 remake’s pristine visuals, the original <em>Riven </em>leverages its world through its sounds. If you give the old game a look you’ll find that, just as in the remake, sound is ever-present. The soundscape of the remake successfully recreates the audio profile of the original and imparts on the player the importance of listening to their surroundings. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Humble Games, the publisher under the Humble Bundle umbrella that is owned by IGN, has reportedly laid off its entire team. The news of the Humble Games layoffs first came via a <a href="https://x.com/Emilee3D/status/1815803781629505985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media post</a> by Senior QA Emilee Kieffer.</p>



<p>“Another year, another lay off!” she said. “Today is mine and my entire team’s last day at Humble Games.”</p>



<p>Polygon <a href="https://x.com/sweetpotatoes/status/1815817188286009617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">senior reporter Nicole Carpenter</a> added that 36 people have been let go in what appears to be a “total closure of the company”.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to IGN Entertainment, which purchased Humble Bundle in 2017, and Ziff Davis for comment on the layoffs at Humble Games. As of publishing, no response has been received. It’s also unclear what the closure means for the future of Humble Bundle as a whole.</p>

<p>Obbe Vermeij is a legend in the Grand Theft Auto world. Last year, he kicked off a blog detailing some of his exploits from his time at Rockstar, which saw him work on the likes of GTA 3, San Andreas, and GTA IV. The relatively revealing set of posts led to Vermeij receiving an email from Rockstar warning him to stop what he was doing – causing him to give away no more secrets.</p>



<p>Now, the developer has sat down for an hour-long interview with SanInPlay, during which he spoke at length about Grand Theft Auto 6 – but his predictions aren’t what some fans are looking for.</p>

<p>Rockstar Games revealed Grand Theft Auto 6 in December after months of the title being hyped up by millions of fans worldwide. The trailer broke viewership records and skyrocketed to the tops of newsfeeds the world over – it was a beautiful thing, and the trailer set the bar for what’s coming in 2025 (we hope).</p>



<p>Obbe Vermeij is still plugged into the world of Grand Theft Auto, and while he has stressed he knows nothing about the inner workings of GTA 6, he is an experienced voice. With 14 years of GTA-focused development under his belt, Vermeij knows more than most.</p>



<p>In the interview with SanInPlay (which was <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/grand-theft-auto/gta-6-wont-be-wildly-different-from-gta-5-former-rockstar-dev-predicts-i-think-maybe-people-might-be-a-little-disappointed-on-the-first-day/">dug up by GamesRadar</a>), Vermeij made a bold prediction:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I don’t think it’s going to be wildly different from GTA 5, I think maybe people might be a little disappointed on the first day. But it’s still gonna be the best game out there.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The trailer that we saw showcased a living, breathing world, up-to-date tech and pop culture references, and a larger map (based on estimations) than we’ve ever seen from Grand Theft Auto. It looks like we’ll get a dual-protagonist system that’s built around a story that’s as coming of age as it is romantic and potentially tragic. The trailer was also pitted with the humorous, tongue-in-cheek references and content that we’ve come to expect from the GTA series.</p>



<p>With that being said, how much can it really differ from Grand Theft Auto 5 in how it plays?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nba-street-the-run-got-next-unreal-engine-5-ps5-xbox-pc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Several former EA developers, including former Visceral Games GM Scott Probst, have formed a new studio to make a spiritual successor to NBA Street — the beloved 3v3 street basketball series released back in the early 2000s. </p><p>Titled The Run: Got Next, the new project developed by Play by Play Studios is a "character-driven, full court 3v3 hoops game that celebrates the attitude, style, and skills of streetball culture" developed in Unreal Engine 5, with players stringing together an extended winning streak against opponents either solo or with friends online (discussions are "ongoing" about whether it will include a complete offline mode). Similar to roguelites like <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>, players will be able to visit a shop between games to acquire "items, sponsors, abilities, kicks, and more." </p><p>The gameplay on the court will focus on unique characters with various strengths, weaknesses, and playstyles. The trailer introduces some of the initial characters including Spin Cycle, High Wire, and the powerful Zamboni, each of whom can perform powerful dunks and other moves.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Speaking with IGN, co-founder and former Madden creative director Mike Young says that the team's goal is to make "defense as fun as offense" — a feat that can be difficult to achieve in sports games.</p><p>"Stars feel like stars. I think if you go back to the old school games like Nintendo Ice Hockey with small, medium, and large, you could clearly see the abilities of the characters. They had towering strengths and they had glaring weaknesses, and it made construction of a lineup for a 3v3 game very interesting," Young says.</p><p>"Do I want a fast lineup, but we're going to be weak and get checked? Or do I want a powerful lineup that's slow, but we can shoot and check?...We had a Hall of Famer like Shaquille O'Neal, who in real life had great handles. But in our game, he couldn't do say Tier 2 or Tier 3 trick moves. He would fall down and lose possession...So we want to bring that to life. The way the characters move. They're all unique. They have special moves."</p><p>Asked if The Run: Got Next will feature microtransactions, Probst told IGN that there may be cosmetics items at a later date, but The Run is not free-to-play and that there are currently no plans for microtransactions that directly impact the gameplay. As for the online play, a Play by Play Studios representative confirmed that there will be crossplay and cross-progression, but that it will not feature couch co-op at launch. </p><p>"Right now we're focusing on making sure we get the online working right for our launch," the representative told IGN. "Like everything else to do with the game, we'll listen for feedback and interest and go from there."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As the years have gone by the gaming industry has grown exponentially, and in many cases the business has taken precedence over the fun of a particular experience — that sucks</p></div><p>The Run: Got Next will seek to fill the void left by arcade sports games like NBA Street, NFL Street, and FIFA Street, which have either been relegated to basic modes in larger licensed titles (like EA Sports FC's Volta) or eliminated entirely. Notably, The Run: Got Next has a direct connection to the original NBA Street, with Young having served as an associate texture artist on NBA Street Vol. 2.</p><p>"There was a lot of us that worked on NBA Street that always wanted to bring it back. I think it is difficult for a company that has a game like a Madden or an NBA Live that is so big. If you're putting all your resources to that, I think it was challenging to think about a secondary game," Young says. </p><p>"I was there when the Tiburon Studio brought back [NFL Blitz]. Some of the things I've seen in the past, they're just nostalgia plays and they kind of haven't evolved to a modern game. I think they don't have staying power, so they have to come out at a smaller price point. You may only attract the people who liked them, and then they play it for a weekend or a couple of weeks or bring it out every once in a while..." </p><p>"What we think the opportunity is us to bring this type of game, which doesn't necessarily exist anymore, to Gen Z, which is social. Play with friends, play against friends. We're trying to fit in with what the sim games aren't offering us. Modes like Superstar KO that were sort of one and done. We want to make the best version that would make that the game."</p><h2>A different kind of sports game</h2><p>In a letter introducing Play by Play Studios, Probst similarly took aim at the current sports gaming landscape, which is dominated by sims like NBA 2K and the recently-released College Football 25.</p><p>"As the years have gone by the gaming industry has grown exponentially, and in many cases the business has taken precedence over the fun of a particular experience — that sucks," he wrote. "I've found this myself in many sports games today where I feel like I have to grind hundreds of hours to be good, I have to pay hundreds of dollars (on top of the $70 I already spent for the game itself) to have an ok time, and I have to go out on random quests to do things that don't really have anything to do with the fun of the game or the sport."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p>To that end, he says, The Run will "double down on fun" while not worrying about "overly complex menus, GM modes, micromanagement of rosters, opening packs or playing a game that feels like I'm watching a broadcast."</p><p>"We look at a game like Rocket League, which is, like, you can jump in and five seconds you're into a game. They do fantastic," Probst says. "They focus on the action and the game itself. So the longer answer is that's what we want to do, is we want to get you into the game. We want you to enjoy the sport of basketball, and we absolutely want to bring tone and personality and character back and do it in a really meaningful and memorable way that feels distinct." </p><p>Ultimately, The Run's biggest challenge may be its lack of real-life players. Unlicensed sports games have had a dismal track record over the past decade. Probst acknowledges that there have definitely been "conversations" about how important licenses can be, but that ultimately they're  focused on building a "really, really fun basketball game."</p><p>"I think we want to create a fabric and a framework where we could bring in real world personalities, be it athletes, celebrities, influencers, et cetera," Probst says. "But I think first and foremost, our focus has been on the game that we're creating and bringing our characters to life."</p><p>We'll be able to see for ourselves whether The Run: Got Next is able to inaugurate a new era for arcade sports games when it launches in 2025. It's currently under development for PC, Xbox Series X|S and PS5.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat. Have a tip?
