<figure data-uuid="a035113dba7af"><a title="Third-Party Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a035113dba7af/third-party-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 has gotten off to a bit of a weird start.</p>
<p>Although there’s no denying that the console has been a massive commercial success since its launch on 5th June 2025 — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">officially selling over 10 million units</a> — there’s a niggling, underlying sense of dissatisfaction amongst some fans regarding Nintendo’s first-party lineup (and let's just save Game-Key Cards for another time, hm?).</p>
<p>It’s not that difficult to see why. Disregarding ‘Switch 2 Editions’, we’ve had a total of five first-party exclusives for the system so far: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>, and now <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>. Certainly not a bad start, but I'd argue that out of these, only Bananza has received (almost) universal acclaim. Even Mario Kart World, widely regarded as Switch 2's 'killer app' before launch, has been criticised for its structure and open world.</p>
<p>And although Bananza has been praised far and wide for its satisfying, chaotic gameplay, there’s nevertheless a feeling that this isn’t <em>quite</em> what fans want in the system's first year. Donkey Kong, as beloved as he is, isn’t Mario.</p>
<figure data-uuid="c7d7b0ae6e6c7"><a title="DK Bananza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c7d7b0ae6e6c7/dk-bananza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>And that’s the issue, right? Although on the surface, a brand-new Mario Kart game and a 3D Donkey Kong platformer <em>should</em> be slam dunks for Nintendo, they both kind of fall short for some. Compare this to 2017 when the original Switch saw the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_2">Splatoon 2</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_2">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a> all in the first year, and I can understand the frustration. <em>[<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/arms">ARMS</a>, too!... - Ed.]</em></p>
<p>I, however, have not felt any of this, and it’s down to one simple reason: third-party games. I can distinctly remember those first few months after the Switch’s launch; outside of Breath of the Wild and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a>, I spent the majority of my time playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/thumper">Thumper</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fast_rmx">Fast RMX</a>. These were great games and I don’t for one moment regret my time with them, but goodness, they were pretty much my only options for a while.</p>
<p>With the Switch 2, it's the polar opposite. Third-party support has been absolutely <em>phenomenal</em> right out of the gate, and I’ve already sunk hours into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">Bravely Default</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yooka-replaylee">Yooka-Replaylee</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a>, and more. I frankly can’t keep up.</p>
<figure data-uuid="47dc14a77a03e"><a title="Persona 3 Reload" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/47dc14a77a03e/persona-3-reload.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Atlus / Sega</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Switch got good third-party support too, of course, particularly as its sales exploded. But hardware limitations proved to be a significant barrier over time, and for years I’ve been gazing longingly at games on other platforms and thinking, <em>'Cool, but I wish this was on Switch.'</em></p>
<p>We've been dreaming of a time when third-party publishers would go above and beyond to support a Nintendo system — the dark days of the Wii U still loom in my mind — and the Switch 2 already feels like a realisation of that dream. No longer does it feel like we’ve been left behind, and we already have publishers planning launches for flagship games day-and-date with other platforms.</p>
<p>Take <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>. For years, Capcom has leaned almost exclusively on PlayStation for its marketing, but the company appears to have shifted that focus over to Switch 2 for its upcoming release. The original Switch, as capable as it was, couldn’t handle Capcom’s more recent RE games natively, and so they were relegated to ‘Cloud Version’ status. They felt like an afterthought, with Capcom razor-focused on advertising its flagship titles on Sony's consoles - no real surprise when you consider RE started on PS1.</p>

<p>Not anymore. Now that Switch 2 can fight the other platforms' fire with fire, Capcom clearly sees enormous potential. Cue the announcement of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/resident-evil-requiem-pre-orders-live-switch-2-pro-controller-and-amiibo-confirmed">special edition themed Pro Controller and a Requiem amiibo</a>, and it’s looking more and more obvious that the Switch 2 is a high priority to accelerate Capcom's growth.</p>
<p>And let’s be fair, the PlayStation audience know Resident Evil very well at this point; it seems unlikely that this shift will greatly affect Requiem’s performance on Sony's console.</p>
<p>Has every third-party effort been perfect? No. A few games, like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">Hitman: World of Assassination</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/two-point-museum">Two Point Museum</a>, prove — at least at launch — that performance can still hit a few snags on Switch 2, while we've still yet to receive a firm release date for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> after a last-minute delay.</p>
<p>There are some teething issues, then, but by and large, I think we can expect great things from third parties. Even when the PS6 and whatever the heck Microsoft is cooking up launch, it's likely that games will remain scalable enough to run on Switch 2 without looking and performing like crap.</p>
<p>We're very much in an era of diminishing returns regarding raw power, so I feel like pretty much any game launching on Switch 2 will at least look good, if not great. And publishers who perhaps weren't as invested in the Switch certainly won't want to make the same mistake twice with the Switch 2. So if they can scale a high-end game down just enough so that it impresses visually yet still performs well, you can bet they'll be doing it.</p>
<figure data-uuid="60d1aca42bb2f"><a title="Resident Evil Requiem" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/60d1aca42bb2f/resident-evil-requiem.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So if you're someone who generally sticks with first-party software, I'd urge you to branch out and see what else is out there. I understand the frustration if you feel these first months have been a bit lacking. As for me? If this level of third-party support holds for the years ahead, I can honestly see Switch 2 becoming my primary console for almost <em>everything</em> bar PS5 exclusives.</p>
<p>It's just that good.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/relic-entertainment-announces-ambitious-plans-for-the-future/">Relic Entertainment</a> has announced that a new DLC for Company of Heroes 3 is set to arrive later this month on November 27, 2025. The Company of Heroes 3: Endure and Defy Battlegroup DLC expansion will add four new battlegroups, each with its own play styles, new powerful units, and more when it arrives on PC later this month.</p>



<p>Each of the new battlegroups has been designed for both multiplayer and co-op/skirmish AI modes, with US Forces getting the Italian Partisan Battlegroup, the Wehrmacht getting the Last Stand Battlegroup, the British Forces getting the Polish Cavalry Battlegroup, and the Deutsches Afrikakorps getting the Kriegsmarine Battlegroup.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Company of Heroes 3 - Endure &amp; Defy Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Ryr8UF4SX4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The teaser trailer shows a bit of the new battle groups in action, though Relic Entertainment said in a press release that it will be putting out more information about the coming expansion as we get closer to its release.</p>



<p>The Italian Partisan battlegroup is a class of resistance fighters and saboteurs to help enhance your ground forces in battle. They can sabotage your enemy with tunnel networks to plant underground explosives, steal resources, and wreak havoc behind enemy lines. The Last Stand Battlegroup is all about defending the line with new vehicles to bolster your defences, while the Polish Calvary battlegroup add strong lancer sections to the front line. They especially thrive against veteran enemies.</p>



<p>When the DLC arrives, it'll be available at a 10% launch discount for its first two weeks. For those who've not yet even jumped into the base game for Company of Heroes 3, it'll be 60% off for a limited time as part of a Black Friday sale.</p>

                <p>Epic Games has acknowledged a mistake with its new Simpsons update in Fortnite pertaining to the character Apu Nahasapeemapetilon.</p><p>After the new season began, people quickly noticed that an image of Apu shows the character with the <a href="https://x.com/MemeManTweets/status/1985126383396274588" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">same yellow skin tone</a> as his fellow <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/The_Be_Sharps" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Be Sharps</a> quartet members Homer, Barney, and Principal Skinner.</p><p>This was a mistake and Epic will fix it. "This wasn't intentional. It's being adjusted in our next release," <a href="https://x.com/fortnitestatus/status/1986245741820743979" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Epic said</a>.</p><p>The picture can be found in Moe's Tavern, and the venue also hosts a picture of Homer, Moe, Otto, and Apu, and in that photo, Apu has the <a href="https://x.com/nescartridges/status/1985572143141126357" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">screen-accurate skin tone from the TV show</a>. Given that, many assumed this was an oversight on Epic's part, and that does indeed seem to be true.</p><p>Apu has been sidelined in some ways on The Simpsons TV series, as the character has not spoken a word on the show for years after actor Hank Azaria announced that he would stop voicing him. This came after the documentary The Problem with Apu brought up a discussion about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-simpsons-responds-to-apu-controversy-and-some-/1100-6458105/" data-ref-id="1100-6458105">negative racial stereotypes.</a></p><p>The Fortnite x Simpsons season has been a big hit, propelling Fortnite to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-simpsons-update-led-to-a-huge-surge-in-players-the-most-in-a-long-time/1100-6535919/" data-ref-id="1100-6535919">biggest player numbers since 2024.</a></p><p>The new Fortnite season, which runs through November 29, brings a new Springfield map to Fortnite featuring locations like Moe's Tavern, the Kwik-E-Mart, and the Springfield nuclear plant. There is also a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-battle-pass-for-simpsons-season-all-skins-and-other-rewards/2900-7205/" data-ref-id="2900-7205">new Simpsons battle pass</a>, which includes skins for characters like Homer and Marge, along with variants like Stupid Sexy Flanders. Epic is also offering up a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/free-fortnite-glider-how-to-unlock-the-simpsons-dlc-right-now-before-it-costs-money/1100-6535889/" data-ref-id="1100-6535889">free Kang and Kodos glider for people who link their Epic and MyDisney accounts.</a></p><p dir="ltr">Looking ahead, Fortnite dataminers believe they've found evidence pointing to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-dataminers-suggest-harry-potter-and-spongebob-collabs-could-be-next/1100-6535870/">future collaborations with SpongeBob SquarePants and Harry Potter</a>.</p>

Even Scrappy, everyone's favorite rooster, is getting in on the fun.</p><p>Alongside a new patch, Arc Raiders has some new looks for the fashion-forward players by way of the new Wilderness Scout and Leviathan sets. The former is the more affordable of the two and will cost players 1,150 raider tokens, which translates to $10. The latter, which is a bit more extravagant, will run folks 1,600 tokens, or roughly $15.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1986478734539452567" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">📡Store update<br>Whether you're cutting new paths topside or wading through the muck for buried treasure, gear up like a true survivor.<br>The Leviathan Set and Wilderness Scout Set are out now; built for those who know the world still has wonders left to find. <a href="https://t.co/ZsCIe8H3A2" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/ZsCIe8H3A2</a></p>  — ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1986478734539452567?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The Wilderness Scout set is more toned-down than its companion and most resembles common hiking gear. The player is outfitted in a long coat (whose colorways can be changed), tights and ice cleats, as well as a sort of aviation helmet. The helmet's visor can be kept up or down, and the whole headpiece can be toggled off, revealing the set's soot-covered skin, recalling the defining look of Furiosa from George Miller's recent Mad Max movies.</p><p>The Leviathan set, as the name might suggest, is far more nautical. The whole thing resembles a kind of old-fashioned diving suit, complete with a lavish fishbowl helmet that'll definitely raise an eyebrow or two in the heat of battle. I'm burning up just thinking of wearing that thing in the desert.</p><p>The Leviathan skin comes with an oxygen tank, and a backpack covered in netting, as well as what appears to be some barnacles. I wouldn't loot that thing with a 10-foot (and deeply sterilized) pole.</p><p>Additionally, Scrappy, the rooster who frequents players' home base and scavenges for materials, can be equipped with a miniaturized version of the Leviathan diving helmet as part of the Deep Sea Bird set, which is going for another $10.</p><p>That isn't all players should expect though. A new update that just released will be rolling out new map conditions for folks to experience, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-roadmap-reveals-new-map-in-november-quests-and-more-in-the-months-ahead/1100-6535859/" data-ref-id="1100-6535859">pair of exciting updates</a> are coming to Arc Raiders over the next few months, introducing new quests, gear, maps, and more.</p>

<p>That newbie is, of course, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a>, which has managed to snap up all three spots on the podium this week with its release on Switch, PS5 and Switch 2. Combining the top three pulls in an impressive 413,518 sales for Square Enix's latest remake in its first week, which isn't bad going at all!</p>
<p>All this means that both <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> have been pushed down into fourth, fifth, and sixth.

<p>Elsewhere, the week also saw new releases for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tales_of_xillia_remastered">Tales of Xillia Remastered</a> and the physical launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/earthion">Earthion</a>, all of which landed a spot in the top 10.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's not often that a developer comes out to publicly criticize another's work, and yet that is precisely what Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 Game Director Daniel Vávra did yesterday <a href="https://x.com/DanielVavra/status/1985848222707765440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via his X account</a>. The game he targeted was Obsidian's latest roleplaying game, The Outer Worlds 2, which he scored 7 out of 10. Arguably, the most scathing bit was that, even with 'Microsoft's money' (<a href="https://wccftech.com/inxile-entertainment-acquired-microsoft/">Obsidian was acquired in November 2018 by Microsoft</a>, alongside inXile), they haven't managed to innovate in the last fifteen years following the release of Fallout: New Vegas, which Vávra ranks among his favorite games.</p>



<p>Here's the full quote:</p>



<p><em>Finished. 7/10. But what I find sad is that the company and the people who gave us one of my favorite games ever (Fallout: New Vegas) have been unable, even after 15 years and with all of Microsoft's money and latest technological advances, to come up with a single new game mechanic that could take this proven but ancient formula somewhere new. Can any of you think of a single new game mechanic in The Outer Worlds that wasn't already in Deus Ex or the original Fallout games more than 25 years ago? Unfortunately, I can't. Give me a living, simulated world! True non-linearity! Give me something more than loot boxes, maintenance shafts, loading screens, and level grinding in a static, scripted world.</em></p>



<p>When a follower pointed out that even Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 doesn't really add any new mechanics, Vávra protested that it does feature the simulation of thousands of NPCs and their daily routines. </p>



<p>It is indeed true that KCD2 is a much more detailed simulation than The Outer Worlds 2. The latter does inflict bounties when you're caught stealing stuff, but the NPCs do not have true routines, and they do not really object much to your character being inside their homes, just as an example.</p>



<p>While I do generally prefer a simulated world, it's not really an innovative feature, either. Bethesda has had it in their games since The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (2006), at the very least. All that is to say that this is hardly an innovative badge Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 can grab for itself.</p>



<p>As for The Outer Worlds 2, I've also recently completed the game. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/">I had my fair share of criticism to levy at the first one</a>, but I much agree <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-2-flawed-but-more-refined-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with our reviewer David Carcasole</a> that the sequel exhibits many improvements. Although there may not be brand-new RPG mechanics, the developers certainly pushed for a lot more player choice in various ways, thus subtly boosting its roleplaying potential (and even the replayability factor). </p>



<p>Besides, it's not exactly easy to innovate at this point in videogames. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 managed it with its turn-based combat mixed with real-time elements, but did Baldur's Gate 3 truly bring new mechanics, or was it just an incredible execution and never-before-seen presentation for a gargantuan cRPG? I rather lean toward the latter. </p>



<p>There's also the fact that badmouthing a fellow developer like that isn't likely to win a lot of fans. Regardless, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a great roleplaying game</a>, and it's getting its final DLC, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-final-story-dlc-out-november-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mysteria Ecclesiae</a>, next Tuesday. The game is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-free-on-steam-xbox-for-next-four-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playable for free this weekend</a> on PC and Xbox, for those who are still on the fence about it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Game Freak released an onslaught of new information about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-raichu-2000641644"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span> this morning, and between new </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-evolutions-2000641670"><span>Mega Evolutions</span></a><span>, returning characters, and a new storyline, one major change has fans scared. No, not in the “Game Freak is changing something we love and we don’t like it” way, but in the “oh, shit, this DLC might be one of the hardest challenges </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s ever had” way.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>will take players to a “Hyperspace” version of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-ending-zohran-mamdani-2000641431"><span>Lumiose City</span></a><span> with new Pokémon and Mega Evolutions not typically found in the main game. The wild Pokémon in this bizarre place will have “Hyperspace Levels” that exceed the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>series’ typical level-100 cap. And not by just a few levels, either. Some of the Pokémon shown in the trailers are dozens of levels higher than 100. There’s a level 164 Galarian Marowak, and I don’t think my level 100 Starmie’s Surf is going to cut it. So what is a trainer to do against these superpowered monsters? It seems like Ansha, a new character who debuts in the DLC, is your secret weapon. She and Hoopa create donuts that give your team temporary level boosts so they can venture into Hyperspace and go toe-to-toe with these “hyper strong” Pokémon, but it looks like you’ll have to gather berries and other ingredients for them to bake with. It sounds like a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>roguelike of sorts, with you making multiple runs into Hyperspace with different donut loadouts.</span></p>

  <p><span>While there will be a system enabling players to overcome these fights, it’s still kind of terrifying to see wild Pokémon with levels that are astronomically higher than the series typically allows. For decades, level 100 has been the peak of the mountain, and even that was often reserved for online battles against real players. Now, we can just stumble across random Pokémon who are nearly twice that, and fans are reeling.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">My reaction when I witnessed a number beyond 100 in Pokemon <a href="https://t.co/tlQxPMAgsj">pic.twitter.com/tlQxPMAgsj</a></p> <p>— KGP (@KGPrestige) <a href="https://twitter.com/KGPrestige/status/1986446541356474438?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">You’re telling me we got level 200 pokemon before Mega Flygon</p> <p>— Agency Seven Star General blunder (@Thunderblunder7) <a href="https://twitter.com/Thunderblunder7/status/1986439900921553397?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">In order to encounter Pokémon above level 100 first you have to fast travel to the Pokémon center closest to the train station and talk to the old man.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Most Magical Place on Earth has seen an increase in death. Four people have died at <a href="https://kotaku.com/disneyland-world-cheapest-price-time-ticket-prices-fast-1849733205">Disney World in Orlando, Florida</a>, in the last 20 days.</p> <p>On November 2, <a href="https://ew.com/fourth-disney-world-guest-dies-in-1-month-11844355">as reported by <em>Entertainment Weekly</em></a>, a woman in her 40s visiting Disney World was taken to a local hospital, where she died. The news was confirmed by a representative from the Orange County Sheriff’s Office via a statement shared with the outlet. No cause of death was shared, but authorities denied “foul play.” Disney World didn’t provide a comment when asked by <em>EW</em>.</p> <p>This is the fourth parkgoer to die in the last few weeks. On October 16,&nbsp; Summer Equitz reportedly committed suicide while staying at Disney World’s Contemporary Resort hotel located near Magic Kingdom. Five days later, a man in his 60s was found unresponsive in his bed located at Disney’s Fort Wilderness Resort and Campground. His wife called 911, and medical personnel arrived and took him to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival. Two days later, on October 23, another guest at the Contemporary Resort died after a reported “medical emergency.” And then the previously mentioned death on November 2 occurred, less than two weeks later. <a href="https://ew.com/disneyland-guest-dies-haunted-mansion-11826288">Also, on October 7</a>, a woman in her 60s died after riding the Haunted Mansion attraction at Disneyland in California. She was taken to a hospital and later pronounced dead.</p> <p id="mntl-sc-block_16-0">While none of these deaths occurred inside the actual theme parks or on a ride, they did happen in and around Disney property, which includes many hotels, restaurants, highways, and more. At the moment, these deaths have not been directly connected to Disney World or Disneyland personnel, food, or infrastructure.</p> <p>Still, for a place that markets itself as the happiest and most magical place on Earth, the body count is getting shockingly high. Of course, <a href="https://www.damfirm.com/disney-deaths/">deaths have happened at Disney World before</a>, but the frequency of these recent events has put the park in the spotlight in a way I imagine Disney execs aren’t excited about.</p>

<p>And you can upgrade from Switch 1, too</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>At last, <a href="https://x.com/sonic_hedgehog/status/1986478837384028422">Sega has confirmed</a> that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> launches on <strong>4th December 2025</strong> for <strong>$69.99</strong>, right in time for the holidays (via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition-launches-december-4">Gematsu</a>).</p>
<p>Note that a physical release, where the game is fully on the cart, will be following in early 2026.</p>
<p>Those of you who have already bought the game on Switch 1, you'll be able to purchase an upgrade pack for <strong>$10</strong> (or your regional equivalent) — <em>plus</em> if you grab that pack before 10th December, you'll get a 50% discount. $5 it is, then.</p>
<p>Those of you who'll be grabbing the game on Switch 2 before 17th December will also get the Werehog Pack DLC as a free bonus.</p>
<p>Originally launching on the Switch back in September, Sonic Racing CrossWorld has already sold over 1 million units and has been receiving frequent guest character updates. Just today, Like A Dragon's own <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/reminder-sonic-racing-crossworlds-gets-another-free-guest-character-today">Ichiban Kasuga has joined the roster</a>.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/sonic-racing-crossworlds">review of the Switch 1 version</a>, penned by our very own Mitch Vogel, was full of praise for the karting and racing, but said the performance on the older console was "disappointing". The Switch 2 version <em>should</em> fix those issues, then...</p>
<p>And hey, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-sonic-racing-crossworlds-mario-kart-world-and-its-not-even-close-for-me">someone here at Nintendo Life</a> think it's better than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby</a>, watch out, the hedgehog is back.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Research and analysis firm <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/arc-raiders-has-sold-25m-copies">Alinea Analytics reports</a> that ARC Raiders, the new third-person extraction shooter from Embark Studios, has reached 2.5 million copies sold across all platforms in its debut week, with the vast majority of those sales coming from PC players.</p>



<p>According to Alinea Analytics, across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, 69% of ARC Raiders sales came from PC players on Steam, with 17.3% coming from PlayStation players and the remaining 13% coming from Xbox players.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Image credit: Alinea Analytics</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It was already clear that ARC Raiders was having a strong commercial start <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-surpasses-200k-concurrent-players-on-steam-at-launch/">when it surpassed 200K concurrent players on Steam on its launch day</a> (and eventually hit over 260K). As its debut week came to a close, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sales-estimates-range-1-6-1-9-million-units-on-steam/">analysts predicted it had sold somewhere between 1.6 and 1.9 million copies</a>.</p>



<p>The real number is, thankfully for Embark Studios, even higher than those predictions, as the studio also collects well over $100 million in revenue from the game being on the market for one week. It's handily a bigger launch than Embark Studio's other major multiplayer game, The Finals, and could very well outlast it partly because of its different approach as a premium release and not a free-to-play title.</p>



<p>Of course, the new extraction shooter still has a long way to go. It passed the first hurdle for a multiplayer game by having a great launch, and now the real test becomes its capacity for longevity. Right now, ARC Raiders has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/#1w">yet to fall below 90K concurrent players on Steam</a>, and even its dip below 100K was only for a very short period of time.</p>



<p>If we're still seeing numbers like that from ARC Raiders in a year, then we'll have a much better sample size for how successful this game can really be. Speaking of what's to come for ARC Raiders, Embark Studios has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-arc-raiders-2025-roadmap/">put out a roadmap for the game's updates for the rest of the year, which you can check out here</a>.</p>

                <p>In 2023, Relic Entertainment's real-time strategy game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/company-of-heroes-3/" data-ref-id="5000-534671">Company of Heroes 3</a>, dived into rarely explored corners of World War 2 by letting players control Allied Forces during the invasion of Italy as well as Axis soldiers during their attempt to conquer North Africa. Later this month, Relic is adding a new Battlegroup DLC, Endure &amp; Defy, which may shake up the war during multiplayer and co-op/skirmish vs, A.I. fights.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Ryr8UF4SX4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1Ryr8UF4SX4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Each of the four factions is getting their own battlegroup. The U.S. forces will have access to the Italian Partisans, a resistance group that aids their efforts behind enemy lines through sabotage, hidden tunnels, and fighters who will go into battle alongside your troops.</p><p>Germany's Wehrmacht will receive a Last Stand battlegroup that exists to slow down the Allied advance with imposing new vehicles including the Borgward Wanze and Pantherturm. The Last Stand group can also demoralize their enemy through propaganda towers, Panzerfaust rollouts, and improvised barrages.</p><p>British forces will be given backup from the Polish cavalry battlegroup, which thrives against veteran soldiers with a deep desire for revenge against the Nazis. The cavalry is equipped with heavy weaponry, Polish-crewed Sherman Fireflies, and Land Mattresses.</p><p>Deutsches Afrikakorps--aka Germany's Africa expedition force--is getting support from the German navy, the Kriegsmarine. This battlegroup can fortify positions with "catastrophic fire support" while opening up supply chains for troops. The Kriegsmarine can provide supply drops, engineering know-how, and "combat flexibility."</p><p>Company of Heroes 3 Battlegroup DLC - Endure &amp; Defy will drop November 27 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1677280/Company_of_Heroes_3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. It's regular price is $25, but it will be offered at 10% off that price for the first two weeks. During that time, new players can also purchase the core Company of Heroes 3 game for 60% off its normal $60 price.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As Nintendo fights <em>Palworld</em> creator Pocketpair in Japanese court over patent infringement, the United States Patent and Trademark Office is taking the unprecedented step of reexamining one of Nintendo's already approved American patents. The patent being reexamined by the USPTO is entirely separate from the ones being scrutinized in Japanese courts. But that case—and the controversial nature of its broad patent—has thrust Nintendo's patent strategy into the spotlight.</p><p>The USPTO will reexamine <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-does-nintendo-s-new-pok-mon-patent-actually-mean-for-game-developers-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Pokémon patent</a> covering a summoning and autobattling system that was approved by the government body in September. <a href="https://gamesfray.com/huge-blow-for-nintendo-head-of-u-s-patent-office-takes-rare-step-to-order-reexamination-of-summon-subcharacter-and-let-it-fight-in-1-of-2-modes-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">USPTO director John Squires filed</a> for an <a href="https://www.mbhb.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Reexam_Order.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ex parte<em> </em>reexamination</a> himself, and, naturally, it was granted, putting the patentability of the mechanics into question. Specifically, Squires ordered the reexamination because the office was made aware of <em>other</em> patents that would be considered prior art—any previously created inventions or materials crucial to examining patent validity—that weren't brought up during the original process of its patent examination. (Nintendo provided a link only to its website as prior art references in its original application.)</p><p>Nintendo's September patent covers a battling system that sounds like the ones in <em>Pokémon Scarlet </em>and <em>Pokémon Violent</em>, in which a player releases a Pokémon from its Poké Ball and it fights another Pokémon if there's one within a certain range. If not, the player can point the Pokémon in a different direction, and the Pokémon can head that way. If there's an enemy Pokémon around, they'll fight. The approval of the patent made headlines, with game developers, lawyers, and players questioning whether Nintendo and The Pokémon Company should be able to patent the process behind a relatively simple sequence of events. The companies' ongoing legal trademark battle with <em>Palworld</em> only added fuel to that fire.</p><p>The reevaluation of a patent doesn't happen very often. When a patent is approved, it's approved, and it often takes a third-party complaint or a lawsuit to make a challenge there. Roughly 15,000 requests for ex parte examinations have been made since the process was implemented in 1981, McDonnell Boehnen Hulbert &amp; Berghoff partner and patent attorney <a href="https://www.mbhb.com/intelligence/snippets/uspto-director-scrutinizes-potentially-susceptible-pokemon-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrew Velzen</a> told Aftermath. Of those requests, just 175 of the reexaminations filed were made by the USPTO director. Typically, it's patent owners themselves or third-parties who file these sorts of requests.</p><p>"It wouldn't be shocking if [<em>Palworld</em> developer] Pocketpair had filed a request on Nintendo's patent, but that's not what happened here," Velzen said. "It was the patent office itself doing it, and that has only happened, based on the statistics I dug up, 175 times ever between 1981 and 2024."</p><p>The USPTO will take a second look at the Nintendo patent against two other patents (one from Nintendo, another from Konami) to determine what happens to the patent. Squires said the two patents are "important in deciding whether the claims are patentable, and [...] each raises a substantial new question of patentability."</p><p>Haley MacLean, a Canadian lawyer with Voyer Law who specializes in intellectual property law, told Aftermath that it's a good thing that this patent is getting reexamined. She said she'd been feeling "hopeless" about the state of patent law in the video game industry; broad software patents often muddy the lines between what's actually a patentable idea and what's just an idea. Nintendo's September, for many, sounded a lot like an idea that was dressed up by technical language and not necessarily something entirely new. The prior art referenced on patent applications becomes especially important in these applications, because it's something for the patent examiner to reference while making a decision.</p><p>MacLean said the patent examiner will be looking at Nintendo's battling patent—against the Nintendo and Konami patents—in two ways: novelty and obviousness. Is Nintendo's September patent different enough from the two prior art references? The Nintendo patent being used as prior art in this reexamination was <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20200254335A1/en?oq=2020%2f0254335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published in 2020 and outlines a method of controlling both a player character</a> and a sub-character, in which the sub-character is automatically controlled, except when the player hits the ZL button to attack. Images attached to the patent show two characters connected by a chain, suggesting this patent is related to PlatinumGames' 2019 game <em>Astral Chain</em>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/astrogamer.bsky.social/post/3m4y6bs2bjk22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as pointed out to Aftermath by a reader</a>. <em>Astral Chain</em> director Takahisa Taura is listed as an inventor. The Konami patent, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US6743099B2/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published in 2002 and now expired</a>, also details a system wherein a player and a sub-character battle automatically or manually.&nbsp;</p><p>The second piece the examiner will look at, MacLean said, is obviousness. "Something can't be obvious to somebody called the <em>posita</em>, or person of ordinary skill in the art," she said. "You take the prior art and what it's protecting and compare it to what Nintendo's trying to protect."&nbsp; They're looking to decide if, say, a game developer would see the Nintendo September patent as an obvious extension of the prior art. In other words, would it be easy for a game developer to make the leap from Nintendo's 2020 system, in which sub-characters both move automatically and manually in battles, and with a specific button to lock onto enemies, to the most recent system from its September patent in which the player can point a sub-character in a different direction to <em>find</em> an enemy.</p><p>"This is the first time [the USPTO direction initiating a reexamination] has happened in quite some time, and certainly the first I'm aware of in the video game space," Velzen said.</p><p>Both MacLean and Velzen said that the original application didn't have as thorough of an examination as what's typical; the patent just went straight through without any hiccups, which is uncommon. Velzen said that it's common for a patent to get rejected at least once first, then for the patent applicant to revise it.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, there's <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/japanese-patent-officials-reject-one-of-nintendos-pokemon-patent-applications-for-being-too-similar-to-ark-monster-hunter-and-embarrasingly-pokemon-go/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the news that the Japanese patent office recently rejected a Nintendo patent</a>. The Japanese body rejected a pending application covering aiming and throwing items (i.e., Poké Balls) to capture creatures. The patent is not part of the ongoing <em>Palworld</em> lawsuit, in which Nintendo and The Pokémon Company are suing Pocketpair for patent violations, but is an offshoot of one patent part of the suit.&nbsp;</p><p>That lawsuit itself—and the press around it—could also be part of the wider eyes on Nintendo's patents, even by the USPTO, despite Nintendo's September patent being unrelated. And public response to Nintendo's September patent may have played a part in getting the reexamination in front of the USPTO director.</p><p>"The public is interested," MacLean said. "I think all that probably accumulated to [the USPTO director] saying, <em>OK, we need to look at this again</em>."</p><p>It's ultimately a good thing for the video game industry, MacLean said. "This is a disruption of the normal status quo, and the current trend of video game mechanic patents getting auto approved—immediately approved, rapidly and excessively."</p><p><strong>Update, Nov. 6 at 1:48 p.m. EST: </strong>This story has been updated to add information about one of the two patents now being reviewed as prior art.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/manual-ear-and-nosehair-trimmer"><h3>Nothing But Respect For This Manual Ear And Nose Hair Trimmer</h3></a><p>The Golden Birdie by South Korean brand Royal is a simple piece of metal that is leagues better than its flimsy, electric counterparts.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dispatch-telltale-games-adhoc-studio"><h3>Dispatch Brings Back The Halcyon  Era Of Online Water Cooler Talk</h3></a><p>Adhoc Studio’s superhero choose-your-own-adventure feels like a fun hole-in-the-wall, word-of-mouth-recommended spot that the gaming communities haven’t had in a minute</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kodansha-studios-akira-anime-live-ation-chloe-zhao-nicolas-gonda"><h3>Somehow, The Threat Of A Live-Action Akira Refuses To Die</h3></a><p>If there is any anime that could be considered Hollywood’s Moby Dick, it is Akira</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/i-owe-my-workday-to-criterion-24-7"><h3>I Owe My Workday To Criterion 24/7</h3></a><p>If you’re going to have cotton candy, you have to eat your vegetables too.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/uspto-pokemon-patent-reexamination]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/hitman-absolution-shoots-onto-switch-1-next-week</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hitman-absolution-shoots-onto-switch-1-next-week.1345975/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>We last caught wind of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-absolution">Hitman: Absolution</a> back in July, when developer Feral Interactive announced that it was bringing its latest remake to Switch at some point in 2025, with a Switch 2 edition to follow. Things have remained quiet on the Switch 2 front, but today, we've had news of the Switch 1 version, and it's arriving <em>next week</em>.</p>
<p>Yep, you read that correctly. Hitman: Absolution will land on Switch 1 on <strong>13th November</strong> for <strong>£19.99 / $29.99 / €24,99</strong>. The new trailer (above) showcases the 2012 stealth game in action on Nintendo's hybrid, and it looks, well, much as we remember it. But hey, more Hitman is never a bad thing!</p>
<p>Like Feral's recent mobile release, Absolution on Switch will be getting a 'Contracts Mode' update next year, where you'll be able to set challenges against friends and compete for high scores.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screens from Feral Interactive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>MORE THAN A NUMBER<br></strong>The story of Absolution puts Agent 47’s character under the spotlight, where his loyalties and his conscience are both put to the test.<br>
<strong>TAILORED TO NINTENDO SWITCH<br></strong>Featuring gyro aiming for ultimate precision, Absolution is fully optimised for Nintendo Switch and tailored for play at home or on the go.<br>
<strong>KILLER INSTINCT<br></strong>Use Instinct Mode to identify targets, predict enemy movements, and highlight points of interest.<br>
<strong>CLEAR YOUR PATH<br></strong>Point Shooting lets you stop time, mark multiple enemies, and eliminate them in a heartbeat.<br>
<strong>MASTER THE CRAFT<br></strong>Find new ways to take out your marks, complete Challenges, and perfect your technique.<br>
<strong>PLAY IT AGAIN AND AGAIN<br></strong>Choose from 5 different difficulty settings, from easy to the insanely hard Purist mode.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"But what about the Switch 2 version?" you may, rightfully, ask. Well, we still don't know yet. Feral stated on <a href="https://x.com/feralgames/status/1986459928525938858">Twitter</a> that it will "have more to say about the Switch 2 next year," and fans should "keep an eye out for further announcements". So, we guess we'll do exactly that!</p>
<p>As a reminder, IO Interactive brought Hitman World of Assassination to Switch 2 earlier this year, though a wealth of performance issues meant that it wasn't in the best state at launch. A subsequent patch helped things move in the right direction, but let's hope that Feral Interactive can make Absolution stronger out of the gate.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-gen-ai-square-enix-qa-bugs-2000641688</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-publisher-plans-to-offload-70-percent-of-qa-work-to-generative-ai.1345972/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Square Enix is currently in the middle of a reboot. Following a bunch of flops (<a href="https://kotaku.com/foamstars-review-splatoon-ps5-is-it-good-square-enix-1851239389">remember<em> Foamstars</em></a>?) and some great games held back by timed exclusivity (<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>, <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>), the RPG publisher has been pivoting to a <a href="https://kotaku.com/square-enix-business-plan-multiplatform-1851472456">multiplatform approach and retooling its slate of upcoming releases</a>. It’s also, apparently, making a big push into leveraging generative AI. The company announced a new goal of having 70 percent of quality assurance and game debugging work handled by generative AI by 2027.</p> <p>“Through the use of automation technology, [we] aim to improve the efficiency of QA operations and establish a competitive advantage in game development,” reads <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf">a new presentation</a> updating investors on Square Enix’s business strategy (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-says-it-wants-generative-ai-to-be-doing-70-of-its-qa-and-debugging-by-the-end-of-2027/"><em>VGC</em></a>). The project developed out of an AI-themed “idea contest” the company held, and will be part of a joint research initiative with Matsuo Laboratory at the University of Tokyo. Is this a real plan or just a way to impress investors with buzzwords?</p>

 <p>Square Enix isn’t the only company trying to apply generative AI tools to QA. While some companies <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-generative-ai-call-duty-gamescom-2025-slop-2000618833">get lampooned</a> for letting AI slop infest concept art or even finished loading screens that appear in the game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-matt-booty-qa-crunch-ai-mistreatment-1849496926">others have argued</a> that the job of discovering and documenting bugs is one where LLM technology will be most useful. An AI data firm <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-30-of-game-devs-believe-ai-will-play-an-extremely-important-role-in-qa-testing">claimed earlier this year</a> that 30 percent of respondents to a developer survey believed AI would play an “extremely important role” in QA testing.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'm convinced that statement from Square is to just get shareholders excited, because what is GenAi really gonna say when something like this pops up? Can it even critically understand what it's looking at to report the issue accurately? <a href="https://t.co/VJ5r67Fu27">pic.twitter.com/VJ5r67Fu27</a></p> <p>— Del (@TheCartelDel) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheCartelDel/status/1986413587561390345?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>But will it actually be any good or save studios time and money? Veteran game artist Del Walker pointed out a recent bug in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> by which a costume completely breaks a character’s model during certain animations. “What is GenAi really gonna say when something like this pops up?” he wrote <a href="https://x.com/TheCartelDel/status/1986413587561390345">on X</a>. “Can it even critically understand what it’s looking at to report the issue accurately?”</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/activision-blizzard-s-qa-department-seems-like-a-hellho-1847473158">Quality assurance</a> has long been at the bottom of the hierarchy when it comes to game development prestige and pay, despite bugs and glitches being the first things to go viral during a game launch, setting the tone of how big-budget games are perceived. They can also make or break its initial reception if things are particularly bad. <em>Fallout 76</em> was particularly bad when it first released and was infamous early on for important updates that found new ways to accidentally break the game.</p> <p>QA, in other words, is very important, but it can also be very labor intensive. If we know one thing about companies its that they love results and hate having to pay people to produce them. It’s easy to envision a way forward where developers on the studio floor are able to experiment with new tools and see whether they work before committing to ambitious goals that replace expertise with automation. That probably doesn’t sound as good in a PowerPoint presentation, though.</p>

<p>Sony San Diego has, as expected, officially announced MLB The Show 26. While no platforms or release date were confirmed, the studio did give players, what it calls, a “sneak peek” for what to expect from the latest installment in the franchise. </p>



<p>Specifically, Sony San Diego touched on gameplay, Franchise Mode, Road to the Show, Diamond Dynasty, and the season four of The Negro Leagues storylines.</p>



<h2 id="h-mlb-the-show-26-first-details">MLB The Show 26 First Details</h2>



<p>Regarding gameplay, <a href="https://theshow.com/news/mlb-the-show-26-first-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the studio says that</a> the goal remains “delivering the most authentic on-field baseball experience.” They say that this year will focus on “advanced logic and new data metrics” along with redefined player ratings, bat ball physics, and pitch effects. </p>



<p>For Franchise Mode, MLB The Show 26 will “continue evolving the front office experience by building deeper, more immersive, and challenging systems shaped by community feedback.” Road to the Show builds off the changes started in MLB The Show 25 with more colleges to choose from and a larger focus on a player’s mid-to-late career.</p>



<p>Within Diamond Dynasty, Sony wants to deliver “engaging content for players to live their MLB fantasy as well as new ways to play and use your squads.” </p>



<p>And, lastly, The Negro Leagues Storylines will include more moments that defined the careers of players that were “talented yet often overlooked”.</p>



<p>More specifics, Sony San Diego says, will start to come in early 2026. That will include details such as platforms, the release date, cover athletes, and more. </p>

                <p>Ubisoft's Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is getting a new expansion, From the Ashes, later this year to coincide with the release of James Cameron's Avatar: Fire and Ash in theaters. Ubisoft has now shared some more information about the expansion, including its length.</p><p>Ubisoft <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/avatar/frontiers-of-pandora/news-updates/12Y5efVFVWZwiblGQCIR1C" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says</a> From the Ashes is estimated to include "roughly" 20 hours of content. However, how long it may take you to spend completing the content will depend on your preferred playstyle. "The overall length will vary," Ubisoft said.</p><p>Players have to own Frontiers of Pandora to play From the Ashes, but the expansion's content is accessible right from the main menu. There are no completion requirements to get started.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXBW2alPp50" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JXBW2alPp50" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Since Frontiers of Pandora originally came out back in 2023, some people might want to be reminded of the story before playing From the Ashes. To that end, Ubisoft created a "short recap video" that people can watch to get up to speed.</p><p>The $25 expansion launches on December 19, which is the same day the movie Fire and Ash hits theaters. Players need a copy of the base game to play, or they can buy the $40 Frontiers of Pandora - From the Ashes Edition, which includes the base game and the DLC.</p><p>Ubisoft is also selling a Complete Edition of the game for $60, and it includes the main game, the From the Ashes expansion, and the Season Pass.</p><p>In From the Ashes, you play as So'lek, and the story is about grief and vengeance, Ubisoft said. A free update coming to Frontiers of Pandora on December 5 will add a third-person mode, but the From the Ashes content can be played in either first- or third-person.</p><p>Ubisoft will broadcast a deep dive for From the Ashes on November 20, so check back soon for more.</p>

"I felt disrespected as someone who has spoken with Emily in person," she said. "It makes everything feel disingenuous and it sounds and feels like they want us to go away quietly.

Fellow writer and cohort member Anna Webster concurred, saying she wished the organization was "up front" about the state of the program.

"I, among others, thought that the Future Class program was not just a platform for celebration, but a means to bridge the gap between industry workers and leaders and help shape the future of the game industry."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I'm disappointed, but not surprised," said JC Lau, another 2022 alumni.

<figure data-uuid="7751340a518eb"><a title="A Link to the Past" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7751340a518eb/a-link-to-the-past.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Analytics firm <a href="https://www.ampereanalysis.com/">Ampere Analysis</a> has posted a list of games it believes would greatly benefit from a remake or remaster (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ip-holders-are-sitting-on-a-wealth-of-content-analytics-firm-lists-18-games-ripe-for-remake-or-remaster-success/">VGC</a>). This is supposedly based on analysis of the market and consumer behaviours and attitudes – otherwise, we could just as easily pluck a bunch of games from thin air that we think need remakes!</p>
<p>What caught our eye straight away was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/legend_of_zelda_a_link_to_the_past">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>, both of which are, according to Ampere, prime candidates for full remakes. Now, we'd be happy to make a case for Chrono Trigger; especially if Square Enix wants to opt for the HD-2D style it's been evolving in recent years. A Link to the Past, though? Hmm, we're not sure about that.</p>
<p>The thing is with top-down Zelda games is that, in our opinion, they kind of need to <em>stay</em> top-down. And considering the game has already received a sequel in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/legend_of_zelda_a_link_between_worlds">A Link Between Worlds</a>, we're not entirely convinced it really needs a remake.</p>
<p>Ampere writer Katie Holt says that while long-time fans consider it a high point in the series, “its dungeon and world design can be considered outdated, and the narrative is relatively linear by today’s standards”. In addition, searching for “The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past remake” on Reddit returns an astonishing 48,200 results, and Nintendo would supposedly be wise to approach it in a similar way to the Switch remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening">Link's Awakening</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Ampere believes that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time_3d">Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D</a> would benefit from a remake or a remaster – they're supposedly not fussed which. And yeah, we could get on board with this. With the 40th anniversary looming, we wouldn't be surprised to see Nintendo revisit what is arguably one of the most influential 3D adventure games of all time.</p>
<p>Here's the list of games from Ampere Analysis:</p>
<h3>Remake</h3>
<ul>
<li>Assassin’s Creed</li>
<li>Chrono Trigger</li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</li>
<li>Fallout</li>
<li>Rayman Origins</li>
<li>Resident Evil 5</li>
<li>Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune</li>
</ul>

<li>Bloodborne</li>
<li>Bully</li>
<li>Dragon Age Origins</li>
<li>The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind</li>
<li>Fallout: New Vegas</li>
<li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>
</ul>
<h3>Remake or Remaster</h3>

</ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amd-fx-9590-cpu-is-pushed-to-its-limits-to-run-battlefield-6-managing-to-achieve-playable-framerates.1345924/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Despite lacking TPM 2.0 support, the old AMD FX-9590 CPU is capable of running Battlefield 6, and even at playable framerates.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@FullyBuffered">Fully Buffered</a> attempted to run the latest entry in the series by EA on two old CPUs, the Intel Core i7-2600K and the aforementioned AMD FX-9590. While the game wouldn't launch on the Intel CPU due to the lack of Secure Boot support, the AMD CPU could launch and run the game, having Secure Boot support. As such, it seems like not supporting TPM 2.0 doesn't prevent a CPU from running the game, as lacking SecureBoot support does.</p>



<p>Although the AMD FX-9590 is an old CPU released over 10 years ago, it runs Battlefield 6 surprisingly well, paired with an RX 5700 8 GB GPU. In Conquest mode with a total of 64 players, the game runs at a mid-30s FPS range, occasionally reaching the 40s range at 1080p resolution, which is very impressive for an older CPU. In other game modes, and by lowering the resolution, the game even hits the mid-40s range. Unsurprisingly, all of the CPU's core are pushed to their limit to run the game, hitting 98% utilization at 4,65 GHz.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>An old CPU, such as the AMD FX-9590, running Battlefield 6 as well as it does, confirms the greater attention the development team put into optimizing the game and ensuring it could run well even on low-spec systems. Before the game launched, technical director Christian Buhl confirmed that <span>among the millions of players who joined the Battlefield 6 open beta,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-effort-minimum-specs/" target="_blank">a substantial number were on minimum specs or below.</a>&nbsp;Therefore, it was essential</span> for the team to optimize for these low specs to ensure all players could enjoy the game. Overcoming the technical limitations of the Xbox Series S also made <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-limitations-battlefield-6-better-game/">Battlefield 6 a better game from a technical standpoint.</a></p>



<p>Battlefield 6 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game by checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/">David Carcasole's review.</a></p>
