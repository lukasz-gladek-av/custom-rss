That's why this update brings a number of new building parts, including the ability to change the color of building pieces and the "much-requested triangular pieces." The building menu UI has also been redesigned and reformatted into a list. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that's not all. Melee combat has been improved to make it "more viable and fun," and now, when summoning a raid boss at the Summoning Altar, players can choose to either fight at their base as before, or take on the raid boss in a special Raid Area.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"These Raid Areas allow you to fight with all your might, without risking any damage to your base," the team explained. "You can build temporary structures and take items into these special Raid Areas." Which is just as well, as a new raid boss will also pop up after the update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"2025 has been an incredible year for Palworld, and we’re excited to end the year with v0.7, Home Sweet Home!" Pocketpair exclaimed. "The purpose of this update is to begin improving existing features, and while this update may not be as content-rich as previous ones, we hope players understand that it’s necessary for us to begin laying the groundwork now as we work on the development of Palworld 1.0."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last but definitely not least, PvP! Though the studio admits PvP has been a topic of discussion in the Palworld community for a "long time," and it’s "hard to fully integrate PvP into the game," it is trying to make the dream a reality, albeit with some careful parameters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are releasing all the necessary tools for players to set up their own PvP rules on their own terms," Pocketpair said. "Show off your skills and compete with other Pal Tamers! Please note that PvP is experimental, and as such, there may be some balancing issues."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Palworld v0.7 patch notes:</h2><h3 data-cy="title3">ULTRAKILL Collab!</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added V1 and V2 armor sets!

            <guid>1385788</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Farming Simulator: Signature Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161176/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>My pigs are starving and I do not know how to feed them.</p>
<p>The pig feed is ready to pick up at the shop, but I don’t know where the shop is. Once I find the correct establishment, I need to figure out how to pick up the pallets of food and take them back to my emaciated swine.</p>
<p>Later, after I purchased a front loader and the appropriate bucket attachment, I take the feed back to my farm. Then comes another problem. How do I actually deposit it in the trough?</p>
<p>As a casual guest in the world of simulators, having only played <strong>Train</strong> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/euro_truck_simulator_2">Euro Truck Simulator</a> for short spells, I must admit I was a bit overwhelmed by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/farming-simulator-signature-edition">Farming Simulator: Signature Edition</a>.</p>
<p>Fans of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a> will recognise the setup straight away. Your grandfather is getting a bit long in the tooth and wants to leave you in charge of his agricultural empire. It is up to you to tend the land, reap, sow, and explore the surrounding community.</p>
<figure><a title="Farming Simulator: Signature Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161166/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike Stardew, this is not a cutesy, cosy life sim. Instead, it is a meticulously designed and realistic depiction of farming life. There is more painstaking attention to detail in a single combine harvester here than there is in most racing games.</p>
<p>After your grandfather takes you through a brief tutorial tour, you are free to tackle your life as a farmer in any way you desire. My immediate compulsion was towards animal husbandry, which, as mentioned, was far more complex than I imagined.</p>
<p>Luckily, one of the best things about these games is that there is no one way to play. The map, of which there are several to choose from, is a surprisingly biodiverse collection of land plots and population centres.</p>
<p>You are free to begin your career from scratch or as a mature farmer. Either way, the core loop of the game is in engaging with its many systems of commerce to earn a profit. Seasonal variation, layout, and topography vary between the maps, but everything else remains the same. You trade with the same collection of NPCs and the overwhelming contents of the in-game stores are the same regardless of career choice.</p>
<figure><a title="Farming Simulator: Signature Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161169/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As a newcomer, I chose to start a farm from scratch. There is a guided tutorial of sorts, but it only scratches the surface of the myriad systems at play. From there, I had to look up almost every aspect of farm life. While series veterans may not find the early hours as obtuse as I did, these kinds of games would still benefit from putting information more front and centre.</p>
<p>That said, there is a wealth of accessibility and quality-of-life options available throughout your farming adventures. Almost every task can be completed by an AI farmhand, who will cultivate fields, deliver yields, and handle all the repeatable work that you are too rich to bother with after reaching a certain level of maturity.</p>
<p>These simulators can be as simple or as complex as you make them, but there are still lots of plates to spin. On any given day cycle, you'll be keeping an eye on the calendar to grow crops at the optimal time, managing your animal produce, and steadily growing your empire to make grandfather proud. Then there is the farm equipment itself, each machine having a different purpose and slight variation on how to drive and control them. Every single task in Farming Simulator requires a specific tool to undertake. The late game almost becomes a collectathon as you populate your farm with a fleet of shiny tractors and attachments.</p>
<figure><a title="Farming Simulator: Signature Edition Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161163/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This kind of time sink is tailor-made for Switch. The just-one-more-hour compulsion and cyclical routine feel perfect for long trips in handheld mode, or for docked couch sessions. It is exactly the sort of game that fits the platform’s strengths.</p>
<p>It’s a shame, then, that the optimisation of this Switch 2 port is sorely lacking in places. General image fidelity is solid between modes, but performance is wildly unpredictable. The game struggles to hold a steady 30fps in both docked and undocked modes.</p>
<p>Some areas, particularly your hub farm, tank the frame rate considerably. Elsewhere, there are frequent graphical glitches and bugs. For me, this involved excessive clipping into terrain and loss of vehicle control. There aren't even any Switch 2 native additions to the experience, with mouse controls sadly missing. Touchscreen is present across all functionality, which, for a game where you spend most of your time in menus, is a mercy.</p>
<figure><a title="Farming Simulator: Signature Edition Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161172/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Audio is sharp, particularly in the sounds of the machinery, which are as distinct as their visual rendering. If you don't want to hear the endless chug of a tractor engine, there's a selection of original music on the in-game radio. Why not listen to chip tune anthems while cutting down deadwood?</p>
<p>The appeal of Farming Simulator is obvious, even from the perspective of a fledgling land tiller like myself. However, the uneven technical presentation will ultimately compromise anyone willing to sink a few hundred hours into the experience, especially if Giants Software does not find a way to patch in some much-needed stability.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Farming Simulator arrives on Switch 2 in a familiar state for returning fans. While newcomers will face an early spike of confusion before eventually settling into the addictive routine of virtual agriculture, veterans will immediately feel at home. Unfortunately, technical issues with the port will blight the careers of both camps.</p></section>

Adhoc Studios still aren't sure whether they'll make a second season of Dispatch, their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-is-superhero-comedy-dispatch-a-million-selling-success-story-it-could-be-that-weekly-release-schedule">startlingly popular</a> Telltale-style superhero comedy adventure, but they're thinking about it very "seriously". In brief, they're not confident they can bottle the lightning twice, especially if they want to release another season before 2032.
</p>

<p>
Dispatch's first season took seven years to develop, thanks partly to being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/xdefiant-was-apparently-born-from-the-ashes-of-a-splinter-cell-game-being-made-by-the-team-behind-dispatch">dropped by its publisher part-way through</a>. Discussing that tortured development in a just-published interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-dev-adhoc-set-on-season-2-but-has-difficult-second-album-problem">Eurogamer</a>'s Robert Purchese, game director Nick Herman says there were "zero expectations for Season 1 - external expectations. People just had to show up and enjoy it and not have a bunch of theories and stuff in their head." 
</p>
<p>
The same won't be true next time round, of course, and the developers are already finding the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/telltale-and-the-boys-make-mostly-beautiful-love-in-dispatch-a-slick-and-surprisingly-tactical-superhero-comedy">enthusiasm</a> for a follow-up a bit daunting. "People are mad that we haven't told them what we're doing," Herman told EG. "It's the new problem, right? It's like, are you doing it? Are you not doing it? We're days away from really sitting down and having the time - because we've had to support the game - where we're going to really sit down and lay those plans out." 
</p>
<p>
In the same retrospective natter, lead writer Pierre Shorette drew a parallel with music, commenting that "you have your whole life to write your first album and then eight months to write your second. And there's a little bit of that feeling." 
</p><p>
"We had so long with this - seven years is a lot of time," he went on. "If anything, it would have been embarrassing if it was bad. I mean, you took fucking long enough! We're taking GTA 6 amounts of time on this shit, you know - it better be good. I know we're not going to have that amount of time for Season 2 because we want to meet the demand." 
</p>
<p>
I would play another season of Dispatch, though I'd like a change of protagonist. That said, I also couldn't fault Adhoc for hanging up their capes, retiring their mystic amulets and trying something new. Seven years is a long time to spend thinking about the likes of Waterboy.

              <p>Yes, in 2025, we here at <em>Kotaku</em> played a lot of video games. But we don’t just play video games every day. No, we all enjoy other forms of entertainment beyond interactive digital video games. And this year, we’ve decided to sit down and put together a list, in no particular order, of some of our favorite movies, books, podcasts, shows, and other non-gaming things we enjoyed in 2025. And please, let us know what non-video-game art and entertainment you loved this year in the comments below!</p> <h2><b><i>Star Wars: Andor </i></b><b>Season 2 – TV show</b></h2>  <p><span>When Disney announced a</span><i><span> Star Wars</span></i><span> TV show all about Cassian Andor</span><i><span>&nbsp;</span></i><span>from</span><i><span> Rogue One,</span></i><span> I remember barely caring at all. “Cool, I guess that dude from </span><i><span>Rogue One</span></i><span> gets a show, too.” Then I watched Season 1 in 2022 and was completely enthralled by its depiction of rebellion and fascism.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/andor-season-2-ending-vgchat-star-wars-rogue-one-10-12-1851780720">This year’s season two was even better,</a> featuring more moments than I can count that made me sit up in my chair, hold my breath, and wait for the next scene or piece of dialogue to either break me or let me cheer. I say this as someone who loves the franchise dearly: </span><i><span>Star Wars </span></i><span>has never really been this good before, and it will likely never reach these heights again. And that’s fine. </span><i><span>Star Wars </span></i><span>can keep being a campy sci-fi series about space wizards that kids love, because we can always rewatch </span><i><span>Andor </span></i><span>whenever we want.&nbsp; </span><i><span>-Zack Zwiezen</span></i></p>

 <h2><b><i>My Perfect Console </i></b><b>– Podcast</b></h2>  <p><span>I listen to way too many podcasts. Especially video game podcasts. I read and write about video games all day. I play as many games as I can at night and on the weekends. And then I squeeze video game podcasts into all the other quiet moments: cooking, clean-up, driving in between errands. No gaming podcast this year has kept me as consistently entertained nor taught me as much as Simon Parkin’s </span><i><span>My Perfect Console</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The veteran game journalist interviews creators from all different backgrounds, including developers, about their favorite games; the ones that have meant the most to them throughout their lives or played pivotal roles in important moments. It’s an excellent premise for learning about some of the medium’s forgotten classics as well as the gaming luminaries who took meaning and inspiration away from them. It helps that Parkin is such a generous host who works so diligently to create space for members of a notoriously secretive industry to feel comfortable enough to divulge personal tastes and fascinating biographical details we would otherwise probably never get to learn about. – Ethan Gach</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>It Was Just an Accident </i></b><b>– Movie</b></h2>  <p><span>Jafar Panahi might be the bravest filmmaker in the world. He’s certainly an artist of unwavering moral conviction. The Iranian director has repeatedly made films that have been censored or banned in his home country, and he’s continued making movies in defiance of the government, even when he’s been ordered to stop. His latest film, </span><i><span>It Was Just an Accident</span></i><span>, is a work of astounding humanity, moral complexity, suspense, and even humor. Affable mechanic Vahid (Vahid Mobasseri) feels his traumatic past flooding back when a man he believes once tortured him in an Iranian prison visits his garage in need of auto repairs. Overcome with anger at what he suffered under his former tormentor, he kidnaps the man with plans to kill him, only to find that he’s not absolutely positive the man he’s captured is the man he thinks he is, and so he can’t bring himself to do it.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>What follows is a journey to track down some of his fellow former prisoners and see if any of them can positively identify his captive as the one who tortured them all, all those years ago. It becomes a kind of loose, rollicking road movie that’s at times suspenseful, at times funny, and that’s always grappling with the question of what its characters should do with the memories that haunt them and the anger they so justifiably feel. – Carolyn Petit</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>KPop Demon Hunters </i></b><b>– Movie</b></h2>  <p><span><em>KPop Demon Hunters</em> had a bigger chokehold on my life than most things in 2025. Its infectious banger of a soundtrack was at the top of my Spotify Wrapped, I saw it three times in theaters, and I even hijacked my friend’s wedding party to watch it with everyone while they were hungover. I’m also planning on holding my family hostage and making them watch it over the holidays. The anime-inspired visuals and fight choreography set to Ejae’s incredible songs would capture anybody’s heart, but I’m still a sad gay boy at heart who loves a self-acceptance story, so Rumi’s inner struggle with her literal demons struck me right in my core. Months later, I still get choked up listening to “What It Sounds Like,” long after it passed the 700 plays mark on my Spotify. -Kenneth Shepard</span></p> <h2><b>Dallas Taylor’s YouTube Channel – Online Video Series</b></h2>  <p><span>I’m not a podcast person. Never have been. Never will be. Just can’t do it. So I had no idea who Dallas Taylor was when my YouTube algorithm fed me one of his videos about all the effort and tech that goes into making </span><i><span>Jeopardy! </span></i><span>sound good on TV. He has a </span><a href="https://www.20k.org/"><span>really popular podcast about audio</span></a><span>, apparently!</span></p> <p><span>Anyway, this is the shit I </span><i><span>love</span></i><span>. I’m the guy who watches all the behind-the-scenes footage on DVDs. And if you, too, are someone who loves looking behind the curtain and meeting the people who make the stuff you love and seeing how it all happens, I highly recommend checking out Taylor’s channel. He’s gone behind the scenes of how </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAmaQBlDsVw"><span>everything is recorded during an MLB game</span></a><span>, how </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlmK-QCLthI"><i><span>SNL </span></i><span>mixes its shows live</span></a><span>, and he </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Onja4f9Qfw&amp;pp=2AbAAw%3D%3D"><span>even talked to the guy who handles all the music in </span><i><span>Bluey</span></i></a><span>. These videos are sooooo good, and whenever a new one appears in my feed, I watch it instantly. -Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2>Hayley Williams’&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party – </i>Album</h2>  <p><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@spotifypodcasts/video/7334031948316282117" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://www.tiktok.com/@spotifypodcasts/video/7334031948316282117" data-sk="tooltip_parent">There’s an interview with Paramore frontwoman Hayley Williams</a> in which she talks about how, when she’s asked to do features for other artists, she feels limited because people probably want the pop-punk version of her that sang “Misery Business” almost 20 years ago. Thankfully, Williams’ solo albums have been a pretty incredible outlet for the singer to play in whatever genre calls to her. She stays pretty firmly in the realm of pop on <i data-stringify-type="italic">Ego Death at a Bachelorette Party</i>, but the queen of pop punk croons, grooves, and wails over some of her most soulful work yet.</p> <p><i data-stringify-type="italic">Ego Death&nbsp;</i>is a 20-song confessional piece that has Williams exposing every wound she’s suffered and battle she’s faced in her nearly 37 years with the artistic abandon of someone who has gotten too big to care what any pop-punk purist might want from her. It’s her party, she’ll channel SZA’s soulful flow if she wants to. – Kenneth Shepard</p>

 <h2><b><i>Chainsaw Man – The Movie: Reze Arc </i></b><b>– Anime</b></h2>  <p><span>I hadn’t watched any <em>Chainsaw Man</em> before going to see the feature-length movie in theaters. There was initially not nearly enough actual <em>Chainsaw Man.</em> Then there was very quickly way too much of it. I loved every second. It’s jubilantly excessive at every moment, in every way, except for a handful of strikingly low-key scenes that are touchingly orchestrated. </span><i><span>Reze Arc</span></i><span> starts off with a wonderful montage of characters spending all day at the movies and winds down with Denji riding a demon shark sidekick around a city destroying a hurricane. No one has ever rendered an adolescent wet dream with such absurd detail and so many exuberant flourishes before.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I saw a surprising number of movies in theaters in 2025. Most of them were fun but forgettable schlock like </span><i><span>Tron: Ares</span></i><span> and <em>The </em></span><i><span>Running Man</span></i><span>. </span><i><span>Reze Arc</span></i><span> proved why commercial cinema is still worth preserving. Heartbreak, especially between anime demons, does indeed feel better in a place like that. -Ethan Gach</span></p> <h2><b><i>Severance – </i></b><b>TV Show</b></h2>  <p><span>Damn, </span><i><span>Severance</span></i><span>’s second season feels like it was a lifetime ago. I might as well have been severed myself for how distant I feel from when everyone was glued to Apple TV for a few weeks before promptly canceling their subscriptions. I’m glad I waited to watch the Adam Scott-led dystopian workplace drama, because if I had seen the end of season one and had to wait three years for the second, I would have grown bitter and full of resentment. But my god, what a show. </span></p>

 <p><span>I know season three is on its way, but I still think it would have been a bold move to end it on the tragic, bittersweet irony of season two’s finale. A group of abused workers taking their agency back by force and turning their backs on their “outies,” who view them as less than people, and choosing to run away into the darkness of a sterile office in hopes of just a few more seconds together? Goddamn, that shit still hits. I got misty-eyed writing that. Go watch </span><i><span>Severance</span></i><span> if you haven’t. – </span><span>Kenneth Shepard</span></p> <h2><b><i>Universes Beyond: Final Fantasy&nbsp; </i></b><b>– Trading Cards</b></h2>  <p><span>Everyone mocks the branded crossover until it comes for them. </span><i><span>The Simpsons</span></i><span> in </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Star Wars</span></i><span> in </span><i><span>Destiny</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Street Fighter</span></i><span> in </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>, all trash. <em>Final Fantasy</em> in <em>Magic: The Gathering,</em> on the other hand, 100 percent unfathomable magic, like the splitting of the atom. I’ve been an on-again-off-again </span><i><span>MTG</span></i><span> player dating back to 2000. Life and CCG burnout always prevent me from getting pulled too far out from shore.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>No set has brought me back like the<em> Final Fantasy Universes Beyond</em> collaboration, though. The card designs are superb and the art is, mostly, fantastic. It’s an excellent celebration of both my favorite RPG franchise and my favorite real-life card game, one that’s rewards both physical collecting and casual play and buildcrafting online. Few toys have managed to bring me as much joy as an adult as flipping Exdeath, Void Warlock over once my graveyard fills up. -Ethan Gach</span></p>  <h2><em>Game Changer</em> – TV Show</h2>  <p>One of the best things I watched in 2025 wasn’t on Netflix, ABC, HBO, or Amazon Prime. Instead, it was on an indie comedy streaming network built from the ruins of <em>College Humor.</em> I’m of course talking about Dropout’s fantastic and twisted “game show,”<em> Game Changer.</em></p>

 <p>Each episode this season tossed unexpected curveballs at its comedian contestants and then let us, the paying subscribers, watch them turn pain, confusion, and trickery into comedy gold. You should definitely pay for a few months of Dropout and watch <em>Game Changer</em>‘s most recent season, as well as all of its past seasons. Then, when you finish with that, you can hop over to the other great Dropout show, <em>Make Some Noise</em>, and watch some of the funniest people improvise tiny scenes and characters on the spot. It’s awesome stuff, and in a year filled to the brim with horrific bullshit and slop, friends making themselves laugh via outlandish situations is exactly what the doctor ordered. Also, I should get a new doctor. – Zack Zwiezen</p> <h2><b><i>Heat 2 </i></b><b>– Novel</b></h2>  <p><span>This book came out a few years ago, but I read it this year, so damn it, I’m putting it on this list! Michael Mann’s </span><i><span>Heat</span></i><span>, the acclaimed 1995 crime epic starring Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, wasn’t exactly crying out for a sequel. After all (spoilers), one of the leads dies at the end, so you’d think the film’s central dynamic—the tension between a dogged cop and the skilled criminal he’s pursuing—has nowhere else to go. But </span><i><span>Heat 2</span></i><span>, which is a novel, not a film, is no conventional sequel. Rather than just continuing the story of the movie, it expands outward in both directions, letting us see who characters like Neil McCauley and Vincent Hanna were </span><i><span>before </span></i><span>the events of the film, and letting us see what happens to the survivors afterward.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>If you’re a fellow admirer of Michael Mann, you know that he has a style, a visual sensibility that gives his movies a particular (and in my opinion, beautiful) aesthetic. What’s remarkable about </span><i><span>Heat 2</span></i><span>, which Mann co-wrote with crime novelist Meg Gardiner, is how it somehow seems to capture Mann’s sensibilities as a filmmaker, but in literary form. There’s a vividness to the imagery and a kind of shimmering but muscular poetry to the writing that gives the storytelling a distinctive identity. </span></p> <p><span>What’s more, you can really tell just how well Mann knows and understands these characters. There are so many moments here in which Hanna, or Chris Shiherlis (played by Val Kilmer in the movie), or some other character from the film says something that I could vividly see and hear the character saying because it rang so true to them as they were portrayed in the movie. Apparently </span><i><span>Heat 2 </span></i><span>is now in pre-production as a movie, but if you’re a </span><i><span>Heat </span></i><span>fan, don’t wait for this one to hit the cineplex to find out more about Neil’s tragic past and what wild shit Chris gets into after the first movie’s big heist goes sideways. You can watch the sequel on the amazing movie screen in your mind right now! – Carolyn Petit</span></p> <h2><b><i>The Day the Earth Blew Up </i></b><b>– Movie</b></h2>  <p><span>I’m so damn happy that someone stepped in and saved </span><i><span>The Day the Earth Blew Up.</span></i><span> This </span><i><span>Looney Tunes</span></i><span> animated movie was exactly what I needed in the dark year that was 2025. Porky and Daffy getting up to wild shenanigans in a glorious animated throwback to classic cartoons was such a splendid treat for me. </span><span>I still can’t believe that in 2025 I walked into a movie theater, sat down, and watched a brand new 2D animated</span><i><span> Looney Tunes </span></i><span>movie. And guess what? It’s really good and super funny. This might never happen again. I’m glad I got to experience it. </span><i><span>-Zack Zwiezen&nbsp;</span></i></p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Forza Motorsport Video Review In Progress</p>
      </div>
<p>First released in 2023, Forza Motorsport was designed to be a fresh start for Microsoft's sim-racing series, with ambitious plans to support it as a live-service game for years. Back in July, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-forza-studios-impacted-by-xbox-layoffs/1100-6532918/">Turn 10 Studios was hit with massive layoffs</a>, and players noticed that new content for the game had begun to slow down. In August, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-studio-turn-10-breaks-month-long-silence-on-its-future-following-recent-layoffs/1100-6533793/">Turn 10 said that it still planned to support Forza Motorsport with several events</a>, but these quickly dried up toward the end of 2025.</p><p>The studio is now focused on <span>supporting Playground's upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-6-release-date-trailer/1100-6535015/">Forza Horizon 6</a>, </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-forza-horizon-6-aims-to-get-its-japanese-details-right/1100-6535031/">set in Japan</a>. "Forza Motorsport is a triumphant return for the simulation racing series, and it has never been as approachable or rewarding," Alessandro Barbosa wrote in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/forza-motorsport-review/1900-6418125/">GameSpot's review</a>, giving the game a 9/10 score.</p>

<p>Microsoft is also rolling out a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/16/xbox-december-2025-update-mobile-app-updates-audio-support/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">firmware update</a> for the Xbox Wireless Headset that'll add support for Bluetooth LE Audio, a Windows 11 feature that not only improves battery life, but also boosts audio quality. The update boasts lower latency, longer battery life, and super wideband stereo audio for voice chat.</p><p>Microsoft is also previewing a new shared-audio feature on Windows 11, which will let you broadcast your game audio to multiple Bluetooth accessories.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/macbook-air-m4-price-played-yoyo-lately-but-now-goes-to-new-record-low-price-on-amazon-only-2000654145</link>
            <guid>1385752</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>MacBook Air pricing has bounced around considerably on Amazon over the past few weeks while Apple’s own store maintained full retail pricing. Right now, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/">2025 MacBook Air with the M4 chip and 256GB storage sits at a record low of $749 on Amazon, down from its standard $999 price tag</a>, which beats even last week’s previous record of $799. Shipping estimates show <strong>delivery arriving after Christmas</strong> but before New Year’s, so this works perfectly as a self-gift or for anyone who doesn’t need the laptop wrapped under the tree on December 25th.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>M4 Chip Performance</h2>
<p>The M4 chip is Apple’s fourth generation of custom silicon and makes things go faster than the M3 in both single-core tasks and long-term workloads. The built-in GPU runs graphically demanding games and 3D rendering tasks smoothly while using just the right amount of power to keep that famous MacBook Air battery life. Apple’s unified memory architecture lets the CPU and GPU share the 16GB of RAM without the problems that come with traditional memory systems that are separate.</p>
<p>You can use it for up to 18 hours on a single charge which means you can get through a full workday, an international flight, or a long study session without having to look for outlets. You won’t notice any performance changes when you’re plugged in or running on battery power alone because many Windows laptops slow down when they’re not plugged in. The M4 lasts a long time because it is efficient, not because it has huge batteries inside and keeps the laptop very thin and light at only 2.7 pounds.</p>



<p>The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display supports one billion colors and has amazing picture quality that makes videos and graphics stand out with deep contrast and accurate color reproduction. The high pixel density makes text very clear, which makes it easier on the eyes when you read or write for a long time. The screen can get as bright as 500 nits, so you can work comfortably in bright places or near windows without having to squint to see what’s on the screen. The edge-to-edge glass and thin bezels give you the most screen space possible while keeping the laptop’s small size, which makes it easy to fit into bags and backpacks.</p>
<p>Apple Intelligence integration throughout macOS adds AI-powered features that help you write and automate tasks that you do over and over again without sending your data to external servers. The M4’s neural engine runs the system locally, so your personal information stays on your device instead of being processed in the cloud, where it could be accessed or compromised. Privacy protections keep even Apple from seeing your data.</p>



<p>Connectivity has all the basics with two Thunderbolt 4 ports that can be used for charging, data transfer and display connections through one flexible interface. MagSafe charging is back, and it has a magnetic connection that safely comes apart if someone trips over the cable instead of pulling your laptop to the floor. The headphone jack works with wired headphones or external speakers without needing dongles. Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 make sure that networks and peripherals can connect quickly over wireless. The laptop can connect to up to two external displays and turns it into a powerful workstation when you’re at a desk but still being portable when you need to work somewhere else.</p>
<p>Right now, you can get Apple’s newest laptop generation for $749 instead of $999 and this is a savings of $250. This price makes the 2025 MacBook Air competitive with mid-range Windows laptops that look cheaper on paper but have worse build quality, shorter battery life, and less powerful processors.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-pushes-final-clearance-on-wireless-controllers-2025-even-lower-than-black-friday-as-stock-runs-low-2000653990</link>

              <p>If there’s an Xbox showing up under your tree and you’re going to have more than one very eager gamer dying to get at it, we’re about to save you from a potentially sticky situation. The Xbox consoles come with only one controller. Thankfully there’s still time to get a second controller to avert the epic sibling clashes that come from attempts at sharing, and it’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6462/">the 2025 model Xbox Wireless Gaming Controller in Carbon Black, on sale at Amazon for a sweet 42% off.</a></p>
<p>This is the model that comes with the Xbox console, so you’re also avoiding the “why can’t I use the cooler controller” fights — you would have two identical cool controllers that look good, play great, and come with a long list of great features and customizations. Even if your console is going to a solo gamer, buying a backup controller while it’s just $38 — down from $65 — is a super smart move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6462/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Console, PC, Smartphone…</h2>
<p>Surprisingly, one of the best features of the Xbox Wireless Gaming Controller is how much use you get out of it&nbsp;<em>apart</em> from the Xbox. It’s an Xbox controller that’s widely compatible away from the console, able to hook up via Bluetooth or with a USB-C cable to Android and iOS devices, Windows PCs, Fire TV Sticks, Smart TVs, and VR headsets. For compatible gaming headsets, there’s a 3.5mm audio jack built into the Xbox controller. While they’re just $38, you can make a solid case for picking up an Xbox Wireless Controller even if you don’t have an Xbox console.</p>
<p>Regardless of which platform you’re using the Xbox Wireless Controller for, you’re going to deeply appreciate its design for both performance and comfort. The curved design is intended to fit your hands with maximum comfort and control, and there’s a textured grip finish on the triggers, bumpers, and back case so you’re not missing those key moves or shots because your hand slipped off. The new hybrid D-pad is another new enhancement.</p>



<h2>Customize, Play, Share</h2>
<p>Customization is key if you want to make the Xbox Wireless Controller play the way you truly want it to, and that’s now easily done with the custom mapping feature that’s part of the Xbox Accessories app. Custom mapping lets you program the buttons the way you want, as many times as you want. One button you will not be wanting to alter, however, is the Share button that lets you capture screenshot, recordings, and more from your gaming adventures, and then share them with friends.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6462/">The number of reasons to go to Amazon and buy an Xbox Wireless Controller while it’s just $38 far outnumber the excuses not to</a>. Even if it doesn’t arrive until after Christmas, it’s going to be very well received, and used on a daily basis for years to come.</p>

<p>This Roblox Dig To Escape Kitchen Ending guide will help you earn 300 Toilet Paper fast, allowing you to blitz through the objectives and escape via the kitchen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The pre-Christmas <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-spin-a-brainrot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> Dig to Escape update featured the debut of the third ending. Dubbed as the Dig To Escape Kitchen Ending, players must purchase the Illegal Keycard and head into the kitchen to access this new escape route. This ending is seen as an easier option compared to the Janitor’s Ending since all you need to do is spend 300 Toilet Paper to reach the kitchen vent. That said, the final part of this ending will remind you of Subway Surfers and the iconic rooftop chase from the “The Chase” mission in GTA Vice City. This guide will help you earn those 300 Toilet Paper faster, walk you through the objectives, and complete the Dig To Escape Kitchen Ending.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-get-kitchen-ending-in-dig-to-escape-nbsp">How To Get Kitchen Ending In Dig To Escape&nbsp;</h2>



<h3 id="h-what-you-need-to-know-before-going-for-the-dig-to-escape-kitchen-ending">What You Need To Know Before Going For The Dig To Escape Kitchen Ending:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Your first goal towards the Dig To Escape Kitchen Ending is to earn 300 Toilet Paper.</li>



<li>You’ll need 200 Toilet Paper for the Illegal Keycard and 100 Toilet Paper for the Crowbar.</li>



<li>Once you spawn in your cell, roll up the carpet and start digging in a rectangular pattern.</li>



<li>Digging straight down limits the number of items you find. Clearing the ground in a rectangular shape helps you uncover more items in less time.</li>



<li>Since you need 300 Toilet Paper, consider buying the Toy Shovel. It increases your digging speed, allowing you to collect more items and clear more ground quickly.</li>



<li>Trade only for Food and the Shovel. Avoid spending Toilet Paper on Energy Surge or Storage.</li>



<li>It usually takes 9–10 in-game days to save 300 Toilet Paper. On Hard difficulty, it may take longer.</li>



<li>The kitchen door is located on the left side of the Chef. Use the Keycard to scan and open it.</li>



<li>Once you’ve saved 200 Toilet Paper, buy the Illegal Keycard and head straight to the kitchen.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h-what-to-do-after-buying-the-illegal-keycard-for-the-dig-to-escape-kitchen-ending">What To Do After Buying The Illegal Keycard For The Dig To Escape Kitchen Ending</h2>



<ol>
<li>Scan the door and enter the kitchen area. There’s plenty of Food all over the place, collect them, and head back to your cell.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Continue digging for items and leave your cell only to sell them.</li>



<li>The free Food should keep you going without needing to trade for more.</li>



<li>After earning 100 Toilet Paper, return to the kitchen and open the freezer room.</li>



<li>Inside, you’ll find the Frozen Chef. Interact with him to buy the Crowbar for 100 Toilet Paper.</li>



<li>Walk up to the vent, equip the Crowbar, and use the interact button to remove the plants.</li>



<li>Move through the vent to reach the Janitor’s office in a new building.</li>



<li>Climb the five sets of ramps to reach the rooftop, then open the door to begin the final phase of the Kitchen Ending.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-what-happens-at-the-end-of-the-dig-to-escape-kitchen-ending">What Happens At The End Of The Dig To Escape Kitchen Ending?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Once the rooftop door opens, a short cinematic plays. When it ends, the chase begins. Follow these steps to escape safely:</p>



<ol>
<li>Your avatar must outrun the prison guard to avoid getting caught. You’ll have a flashlight and a dark path ahead, with the guard chasing.</li>



<li>Keep running forward and get over obstacles like building gaps, planks, and slow-down zones.</li>



<li>After covering some distance, climb the ladder and continue moving forward.</li>



<li>Jump only when you reach the edge of a building. This is safer and helps you avoid falling.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Use your mouse to see the path before you.&nbsp;</li>



<li>You need to be fast and accurate at the same time, as untimely moves can end the run.</li>



<li>If there’s a plank connecting to the next building, use it instead of making risky jumps.</li>



<li>Once you lose the guard, walk into the white blip to unlock the Dig To Escape Kitchen Ending.</li>
</ol>



<p>The best Classes for the Dig To Escape Kitchen Ending, are the Bargainer, Heavy Lifter, and Speedster.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Emergency Hamburg monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Cash, XP and much more.</p>



<p>Emergency Hamburg transforms players into heroes of Hamburg, Germany’s virtual streets in this immersive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-merge-and-fight-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience. As first responders, you’ll tackle emergencies across a sprawling cityscape that developers have expanded by over 60% since launch. Choose your path – join the police force to maintain order, become a firefighter to battle blazes, work as a paramedic saving lives, or experience city life as a civilian. Each role offers unique vehicles, equipment, and responsibilities within the game’s dynamic emergency system.</p>







<p>Progression in Emergency Hamburg centres around earning and spending coins, the game’s primary currency. Players accumulate coins by responding to emergencies, completing missions, and performing their professional duties. This currency lets you purchase new vehicles, equipment upgrades, and specialised tools to enhance your emergency response capabilities. While dedicated gameplay naturally earns rewards, players can use promo codes shared by developers on social media and Discord to claim free coins, exclusive vehicles, and limited-time boosters, significantly reducing the grind required to reach higher ranks and acquire better equipment.</p>

<p>Emergency Hamburg codes can be found through several official channels, making it easier for players to boost their emergency response careers with free euros and special items. The most reliable sources include the official Emergency Hamburg Discord server, which you can join to participate in discussions, announcements, and exclusive giveaways where new codes are frequently shared. The developer regularly posts codes across their social media pages including their X and YouTube pages.</p>

<p>"When a young Lara Croft is shipwrecked on a forgotten island during her first archaeological expedition, her intense fight for survival soon becomes a perilous journey to unravel the island's mysteries," reads the official blurb. "Initially armed with nothing but her instincts, Lara must quickly learn how to overcome Yamatai's devious traps and murderous inhabitants to escape its relentless hold."</p><p>Tomb Raider has been "expertly optimised" for mobile devices, and also features a "fully customisable touchscreen interface", which developer Feral Interactive said will allow players to "mix puzzle-solving and intense combat with ease". The release will also include gamepad and mouse and keyboard support.</p>
<p>If this all sounds up your street, iOS players can <a href="https://feralinteractive.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=27ffb222c33986fdd91dd51b2&amp;id=ee63611621&amp;e=a916cecc0c">preorder now via the App Store</a>, while Android players can <a href="https://feralinteractive.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=27ffb222c33986fdd91dd51b2&amp;id=11ab396b23&amp;e=a916cecc0c">pre-register on the Google Play Store</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Japanese developer Monolith Soft is primarily known as the developer of the Xenoblade Chronicles series, but it also contributed to several The Legend of Zelda games, including 2011's Skyward Sword (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got an HD remaster on its tenth anniversary</a>) and, more recently, to 2017's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/breath-of-the-wild-greatest-legend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Breath of the Wild</a> and its sequel, 2023's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, both of which were highly acclaimed.</p>



<p>Yesterday, Nintendo <a href="https://www.monolithsoft.co.jp/interview/dev01/collab-talk.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted an interesting dual interview</a> featuring The Legend of Zelda General Manager Daiki Iwamoto and Monolith Soft Director Yasuhiro Fujita. In the conversation, the duo looked back on this special collaboration between Nintendo EPD and Monolith and, right at the end of the article, Iwamoto expressed the desire for the latter studio to play a 'central role' in 'creating the Zelda series from scratch'.</p>



<p><em>Monolith Soft now has a system in place that allows them to handle everything from coming up with ideas in the early stages of development to incorporating them into the actual game, so we expected them to be more involved in the creative aspects than ever before. [...]</em> <em>I would like Monolith Soft to play a central role as a strong partner in creating the Zelda series from scratch. I hope that the know-how we have cultivated through our work together will further enhance the overall team strength of Monolith Soft, and we will continue to create unique series titles together.</em></p>



<p>Fans took that to mean that Monolith might, in the future, become the lead developer of its own Zelda game, though Iwamoto's statement still refers to the team as a 'strong' partner, but a partner nonetheless. Whether that comes to pass remains to be seen. It may not be long before the studio headquartered in Meguro, Tokyo, unveils its next project. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/xenoblade-chronicles-3-aionios-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched in August 2022</a>, so it's been over three years; sure, there was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release of Chronicles X's Definitive Edition</a> in March 2025, but that was mostly a remaster that is unlikely to have taken up a lot of the studio's resources. </p>

            <p>Creative Assembly have taken us a little deeper into the biomechanical contours of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-40000">Total War: Warhammer 40,000</a>’s faction design, with a new development roundtable video featuring principal creative director Ian Roxburgh, lead designer Simon Mann and product owner for battles David Petry. </p>
<p>The short version: the starting faction balance is a question of both asymmetry and calculated familiarity. The Imperial Guard are for Total War traditionalists, with a straightforward emphasis on production and attrition. The Orks are comparably numerous, but they need to keep fighting or they’ll turn on each other, and have some unique capabilities based on repourposed tech. The Space Marines are all about precise usage of very small numbers of fanatical killing machines, with less capacity to build up an economy. And the Eldar are stealthy glass cannons operating out of remote Craftworld bases, who spend a lot of time trying to avert galactic calamities rather than just wrecking the other species.</p><!--more-->

<p>None of this will especially surprise a 40K enthusiast, I think, but it feels like a sturdy selection of playstyles, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-40000-devs-detail-future-factions-and-when-you-can-expect-official-modding-tools">other factions (including Chaos Space Marines) to follow</a> presumably via either DLC or in the form of a sequel. The devs also spoke about the game’s overall campaign view/battlemap interplay, which is split across planets and hinges on reinforcement mechanics.</p><p>Here’s the key line from Mann about dem Spesh Meringues. “There’s not lots of them, so when you’re playing as them, you’re not fielding tens of thousands of troops, you’re fielding maybe a hundred, two hundred troops, but each one of those is worth a hundred of the enemies.” He added later: “You’ve got to make sure you’re measuring your losses, because you’re not building infrastructure, right? You’re not able to build new constructions in the same way as the other factions.”</p>
<p>The Imperial Guard/Astra Militarum (delete as per your hatred of Games Workshop’s current naming conventions) are the Total Warriest of the quartet, according to Mann. “There are lots of them, they are massed forces, regiments, there is artillery, there is front lines. It’s something you’d see as a very military faction, even down to their industrial complex, where they’re building industry on planets and developing them in order to fuel the machine and fund the development of more tanks and infantry.”</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Sega</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Orks, meanwhile, are “a massed green tide of chaos and energy that’s charging across the battlefield, armed with metal sticks and axes and whatever they can jerry-rig together, rocket launchers on sticks! But also vehicles that they’ve repurposed from imperial scrap.” Petry interjected that “there are some parallels with the Astra Militarum, in that there are loads of them, they are building up resources, but they are are much more about building up momentum, and continuing to fight. It’s krumping with the lads, you know, it’s continuing to fight, and continuing to push forward a frontline, and making sure the boys don’t get bored and start fighting each other.” So yes, Ork waaagh mechanics are in.</p><p>Finally, there are the Aeldari/Eldar (delete as per etc etc etc). “They play totally differently to anything we’ve ever done in the past, I don’t think we’ve ever done anything quite like this,” Mann said. “They aren’t a faction that is built for massed combat. It’s not big armies fighting one another. Every loss for the Aeldari doesn’t get returned – their souls are getting taken away by the Chaos gods.”</p>
<p>Rather than forming frontlines, Eldar generals will use stealth, Webway gates and other exotic technologies to achieve objectives that go beyond conquest. “Your goals may actually be just, don’t allow this awful thing to happen,” Mann said. “Stop this calamity that could be occurring to the galaxy. Everyone else is still trying to kill you while you’re trying to do that, but you know what your mission is, and what you need to achieve, and you approach it with kind of grim determination.” </p>
<p>The Eldar have access to a Craftworld, which serves as “a kind of off-map setup piece, which is actually where you’re recruiting all your units,” Mann added. They’ll set up shrines to get access to more elite units. They’re a bit like the Space Marines, conceptually, but they are all “glass cannons”. So far, so Space Elf. “Every soul lost is a soul not returned, so you have to really pick your fights,” Mann cautioned.</p>

<p>The campaign is organised around galactic hotspots called “crusade theatres” in which you’ll vie for possession of several planets. Planets are broken into regions. You’ll have fleets that can ferry troops between worlds, drop reinforcements and bombard the surface. There are also space anomalies to reckon with, but Creative Assembly have yet to reveal much about the Battlefleet <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gothic">Gothic</a> aspect of TwartyK, assuming there’s any naval combat at all. Oh, and you can blow planets up, though Imperium players will need “multiple layers of authorisation” to do this. I imagine Orks are less picky.</p><p>Creative Assembly stress that reinforcements are a key mechanic in battles, partly because it strengthens the connection between these clashes and your wider strategy and fleet movements. Again, though, the feel varies by the faction. Space Marines are all about tactical insertions, able to call in drop pods that smash buildings on impact. </p>
<p>The Astra Militarum are more straightforward and attrition-based. “The Guard have less ways of interjecting directly into the battlefield,” Petry said. “They might have to throw wave after wave of their own men up the battlefield in order to arrive before the last unit that is probably now flagging, maybe running away - to replace them in time and hold that line.” The Ork are comparable, but also have teleporters, and the Aeldari can use their Webway gates for subtler battlefield choreography.</p>

<p>The devs appear comfortable with the relative prominence of shootybangs in the 40K universe, inasmuch as they still think there’s plenty of scope for old-fashioned Total War melee. “It is science fantasy,” said Petry. “So there is so much fantasy wrapped into it. And when you think about the conflicts that go on – yes, there is cover, yes, there is a lot of ranged combat going on, but there’s also loads of punching! So much punching! And loads and loads of krumping that goes on! </p><p>“You really have a lot of melee going on in these battles. Lots of forces will mass up and crash into one another. Practically every unit has some combination of a thing they can shoot you with and a thing that they can punch you with. In some cases literally – power fists, right?”</p>
<p>I think all this sounds promising enough, but again, unsurprising. I'm most sold on the Eldar, inasmuch as I've always wanted my own Craftworld, I'm keen on the prospect of having strategic objectives besides the obliteration of people with rounded ears, and I like factions that coax me away from my instinct to amass a shieldwall you can see from orbit. They also have such great hair.</p>
<p>There’s no way this would happen, given the popularity of Spice Maureens, but I’d have liked them to save the Imperium for a sequel or expansion, and taken a risk on an all-xeno line-up. This is partly because given <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-play-a-fascist-unpacking-the-hideousness-of-the-space-marine">Warhammer 40,000’s tricksy relationship with real-life fascism</a>, I think it would be constructive to decentralise the weird theocratic humans. But also, Warhammer 40,000 games <em>always</em> start with Space Marines. Perhaps if the Space Marines showed up late to the party it would alter our understanding of them in an entertaining way?</p>

<p>Use these Roblox SpongeBob Tower Defense monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Shells, Cash and much more.</p>



<p>SpongeBob Tower Defense is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-build-to-climb-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game where players strategically place and upgrade towers to defend against waves of enemies inspired by the SpongeBob universe. While it might seem like a simple tower defense game, players need to carefully select and position different towers, manage their resources, and upgrade their defenses to withstand increasingly challenging enemy waves. The main objective is to unlock powerful towers, enhance their abilities, and survive as many waves as possible.</p>







<p>Progression in SpongeBob Tower Defense revolves around the game’s primary currency, shells and cash, which players earn by defeating enemies and completing waves. They can be spent on purchasing new towers, upgrading existing ones, and unlocking special abilities. Players can also obtain temporary boosters that increase coin earnings or tower effectiveness for a limited time. Although all of these rewards can be earned through normal gameplay, redeeming promo codes is one of the quickest ways to get ahead, as codes often grant free currency or boosts that allow players to progress faster without excessive grinding.</p>

<p>Nothing mid(field) about this</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Just one month after launch, Level-5 has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inazuma_eleven_victory_road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a>'s <em>monster</em> 'Galaxy &amp; LBX DLC' free update will arrive next week on <strong>21st December</strong>.</p>
<p>The studio released a beefy four-minute trailer (above) showcasing all of the good stuff that you can expect to find in the new update, but we'll do our best to run through the highlights here too.</p>
<p>Kicking off with that titular 'Galaxy &amp; LBX' content, the update adds new characters from <strong>Inazuma Eleven Galaxy</strong> and Level-5's <strong>Danball Senki</strong> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/lbx_little_battlers_experience">Little Battlers Experience</a>) series. There's a galactic new storyline that will see you playing across various planetary stadiums, each with its own unique effects, to become the best team in the universe — hey, the series has never been afraid of going OTT.</p>
<p>Speaking of OTT, new transform abilities will let your players grow into huge beasts and unleash their skills on the pitch, which sure is... something.</p>
<p>Gameplay-wise, you can expect new Chronicle routes, a 'Re-Story' mode to continue levelling up your players after wrapping up the main adventure, bonus BB Stadium teams, a two-player 'Tag Mode', tweaks to the Commander Mode, a new 'Fabled' character rarity and more.</p>
<p>In short, it's a lot, and it adds to what was already an impressively deep base game, which we called "the franchise’s most premium experience yet" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a>. Whether adding <em>even more</em> will actually benefit the core experience remains to be seen, but at least we don't have long to wait until we can find out.</p>

<p>The countdown to the release of the Ascended Heroes Pokémon TCG set is ramping up, and more the the secret rares likely to be included in the set have been revealed in Japan.</p>



<p>Pokémon TCG’s Ascended Heroes set will be made up from two Japanese releases: the already available Mega Dream ex, and the Start Deck 100 Battle Collection, due to release on Friday, and more reveals from the latter have surfaced.</p>







<h2 id="h-japan-start-deck-100-battle-collection-secret-rares-revealed">Japan Start Deck 100 Battle Collection Secret Rares Revealed</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hunting. Image via Pokemon</figcaption></figure>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/12/secret-rares-from-start-deck-100-battle-collection-revealed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokebeach</a>, the secret rares available in the Japanese Start Deck 100 Battle Collection have been revealed ahead of Friday’s release, showcasing a bunch of hits that are expected to be included in the Pokémon TCG Ascended Heroes set.</p>



<p>Several of the Art Rares have already been showcased in high definition, but the reveal stream showed off a bunch of SARs to chase down, including some for Mega Meganium, Mega Feraligatr, and Mega Emboar.</p>



<p>A new Lillie’s Clefairy is also set to be introduced, following on from the SIR introduced in Journey Together earlier this year, and the chase cards could actually be easier to pull in the English set.</p>



<p>The Japanese Start Deck 100 Battle Collection contains a whopping 742 cards in the main set, the majority of which are reprints, and each deck contains one of 100 60-card theme decks, but you won’t know which deck you’ve pulled until the box is ripped open.</p>



<p>Hits of Art Rares or SARs are not guaranteed, however, so hunting down the chase cards will be tricky, although the decks do have an affordable price of around $6.</p>



<p>As is often the case with the transfer to English sets, some cards may be saved to feature as promos in specific products, and some may be held back for future releases, too.</p>

            <p>Key members of The Elder Scrolls 6 team have shared an update on the highly-anticipated game's status, and the good news is development is "progressing really well".</p>
<p>According to Bethesda's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a>, the "majority" of the studio is now working on The Elder Scrolls 6, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-announces-the-elder-scrolls-6">first announced all the way back in 2018</a>, though he noted the team "always overlap" when it comes to game development (as well as Elder Scrolls 6, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard-but-development-is-his-everyday-thing">the studio is also working on its Fallout series</a>).</p>

<p>"We're very used to overlapping development," Howard told <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/12/16/bethesda-gives-us-an-update-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development">Game Informer</a>, saying the studio has "long pre-productions on things so that we feel good about them". Howard added "it's a process", and one that everyone involved wishes went faster than it does. "But it's a process that we want to get right," the Bethesda exec said.</p>
<p>Bethesda's studio director Angela Browder added thanks to the "leaps and bounds" made in the industry and hardware since Skyrim, the "possibilities" for The Elder Scrolls 6 "are crazy".</p>
<p>"I will be honest, for me, sometimes I see things that are happening, and I go, 'Angela from Skyrim days could never have envisioned seeing this like this now', and that is a cool thing to be a part of," Browder said. "And it's a thing that I hope that when the day comes that our fans play it, that they - especially those of them who've been lifers with our brands - can really see how far it's all come."</p><p>Browder noted if you <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-reveals-the-elder-scrolls-4-obivion-remake-gameplay">compare the original Oblivion with this year's remaster</a>, "you can see how far" technology has really come. "So, to me, The Elder Scrolls 6 is this endless set of possibilities that is really, really exciting as a developer, but really, really exciting as someone who really likes to think about how far everything has come in our industry," the studio director said, before adding:</p>
<p>"It's gonna be dope. It's dope!"</p>
<p>During the same interview, design director Emil Pagliarulo said the "pressure" that the Elder Scrolls players put on Bethesda "we don't put on ourselves", though the developer understands why some get frustrated waiting for a game to come out.</p>
<p>"Games take a long time, and games get pushed all the time; GTA just got pushed again, which was the smartest thing they could do, because a game the size of these games, they take not just a long time to make, but a long time to spit and polish and iron out the bugs," Pagliarulo said. "And so, what do fans really want? Do they want a game that comes out before it should and doesn't meet their expectations? Or do they want the turkey that is in the oven for long enough to be delicious when it finally comes out of the oven, you know?"</p><p>So, to make sure The Elder Scrolls 6 comes out of the oven as a delicious turkey, Bethesda is going to take its time. How much time? Well, "as long as it needs to be to be great," Pagliarulo closed.</p>

<p>Back in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-wishes-hed-been-a-bit-more-casual-with-his-elder-scrolls-6-announcement">Howard admitted he wished he had been a little more casual with the game's announcement</a>. Additionally, in October 2023, Skyrim's lead designer Bruce Nesmith said Bethesda announced Elder Scrolls 6 when it did in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-6-revealed-so-early-due-to-pitchforks-and-torches">bid to appease any angry mobs which had their "pitchforks and torches" out</a>, desperate to know more.</p>
<p>More recently, though, many Elder Scrolls 6 fans thought they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/did-bethesda-just-drop-an-elder-scrolls-6-2027-release-date-tease-fans-think-so">found a clue pointing to a 2027 release date in a recent trailer for the Switch 2 edition of Skyrim</a>.</p>

            <p>The Last of Us co-director Bruce Straley has described generative AI as "a snake eating its own tail", discussing how easily use of the tech can be misinterpreted.</p>
<p>Straley left <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> back in 2017 and has now formed his own independent studio, Wildflower Interactive. In an interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/bruce-straley-generative-ai-interview/">Polygon</a> about the studio's debut, Coven of the Chicken Foot, Straley revealed his staunch dislike of generative AI.</p>
<p>"It's a snake eating its own tail," he said. "It can't grow and think for itself, it just consumes, and it tries to mimic what it's consumed. That's the best it can do right now."</p>

<p>Generative AI has not been used in development of Coven of the Chicken Foot, Straley confirmed. However, he noted how the term AI has been used in gaming for decades, but has since become confused and conflated with the current use of generative AI.</p><p>"It's difficult to even pitch the concept of this creature, because in my world, NPCs are AI," Straley said. "AI programmers are a type of personnel you have on staff in the programming department. Now you can't say that because if somebody does have an opinion about AI, I can't now call this creature the most advanced AI companion. People are going to think we did machine learning, and LLMs, and all that. No, we did none of that. This is hard work, and a lot of problem solving, and a lot of creative thinking. Which I think makes it more charming.</p>
<p>"I like art that has chips and flaws. It's like pottery. It has imperfections because it didn't come out of the kiln right. That's the cool stuff about art."</p>
<p>Straley did admit generative AI could potentially be useful in certain instances, but he's not interested in using it.</p>
<p>"I feel like without a human being the creation, I personally have zero investment in wanting to watch a TV show made by a robot," he said. "I have zero interest in looking at art that is generated by a computer. I don't think prompting is art."</p><p>Straley's comments are timely, following those of Larian CEO Swen Vincke. In an interview with Bloomberg, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-is-using-generative-ai-confirms-ceo-but-divinity-wont-contain-anything-ai-generated">Vincke admitted to Larian using generative AI</a> as part of development. When this received backlash online, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/holy-fck-guys-were-not-pushing-hard-for-or-replacing-concept-artists-with-ai-larian-ceo-responds-to-genai-backlash">Vincke clarified that concept artists would not be replaced by AI</a>. Instead the studio uses "AI tools to explore references" and developers can "experiment with these tools to make their lives easier" if they wish to.</p>
<p>The backlash Larian received to Vincke's initial comment is testament to the strong immediate opinions the use of AI can generate.</p>
<p>Coven of the Chicken Foot was revealed at this year's The Game Awards showcase - we've got a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025">rundown of everything announced</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Larian and Bloomberg clarify statements on AI usage in Divinity development]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/17/larian-and-bloomberg-clarify-statements-on-ai-usage-in-divinity-development/</link>
            <guid>1385668</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Following the release of an interview between Larian CEO Swen Vincke and Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, there’s been a hefty stink caused by the mention of Larian <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/16/larian-confirms-divinity-will-be-turn-based-use-early-access-and-how-theyre-using-ai/">using generative AI as a tool for the development of Divinity</a>. This has led to Vincke and Schreier to both issue statements and provide greater context, downplaying even further the extent to which generative AI is being used.</p>
<p>The main sticking point was the use of gen-AI to produce concept art, but Vincke has now stressed that Larian has a significant pool of concept artists, job openings for more, and that gen-AI isn’t producing concept art itself, but could create reference material that artists would previously have looked for photographic reference material for inspiration. Aside from that, from the broader Bloomberg interview transcript, it’s placeholder text and white box assets, internal powerpoint presentations, Vincke himself using it to brush up his own emails (given that English is a second language).</p>


<p>The problem really stemmed from the brevity and some framing of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NTg5MzY2NSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NDk4NDY1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0Q4ODFLSVAzSTkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.D26Cs7X_5kH5HuJT2frcX_AMIXyuXWefzz5NK2VlXEI&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg’s original section about generative AI</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-component="paragraph">Under Vincke, Larian has been pushing hard on generative AI, although the CEO says the technology hasn’t led to big gains in efficiency. He says there won’t be any AI-generated content in<em>Divinity</em> — “everything is human actors; we’re writing everything ourselves” — but the creators often use AI tools to explore ideas, flesh out PowerPoint presentations, develop concept art and write placeholder text.</p>
<p data-component="paragraph">The use of generative AI has led to some pushback at Larian, “but I think at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we’re using it,” Vincke said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note the use of “pushing hard” and that there has been pushback in the studio.</p>
<p>On<a href="https://xcancel.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001011042642505833"> social media</a>, Vincke has now responded to the concerns that artists were being replaced:</p>

<blockquote><p>Holy fuck guys we’re not “pushing hard” for or replacing concept artists with AI.</p>
<p>We have a team of 72 artists of which 23 are concept artists and we are hiring more. The art they create is original and I’m very proud of what they do.</p>
<p>I was asked explicitly about concept art and our use of Gen AI. I answered that we use it to explore things. I didn’t say we use it to develop concept art. The artists do that. And they are indeed world class artists.</p>
<p>We use AI tools to explore references, just like we use google and art books. At the very early ideation stages we use it as a rough outline for composition which we replace with original concept art. There is no comparison.</p>
<p>I talked about how we use ML here if you would like to know more: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-embraces-machine-learning-for-tasks-that-nobody-wants-to-do/1100-6531123/">Gamespot</a></p>
<p>We’ve hired creatives for their talent, not for their ability to do what a machine suggests, but they can experiment with these tools to make their lives easier.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the Gamespot article, he describes the AI use as often being for work and jobs that “nobody wants to do”.</p>
<p>And to circle back to Bloomberg, on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3ma5dqbmgm22o">social media, Schreier</a> (who somehow didn’t expect that AI use would be controversial) said, “If I had known the two paragraphs about genAI in my article today would be so controversial, I would have expanded them a bit! Here’s a rough transcript of the relevant portion of my interview with Swen Vincke, so everyone has all the context.</p>
<p>“I am not sharing this transcript because I think it will make anyone view Larian’s stance on genAI any differently; I’m sharing it so people can see all the context and judge for themselves if they feel that Larian’s position was misrepresented by my story.”</p>
<p>Here’s the rough transcript:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>JS:</strong> Speaking of efficiency, you’ve spoken a little bit about generative AI. And I know that that’s been a point of discussion on the team, too. Do you feel like it can speed up production?</p>
<p><strong>SV:</strong> In terms of generation, like white boxing, yes, there’s things, but I’m not 100% sure if you’re actually seeing speed-ups that much. You’re trying more stuff. Having tried stuff out, I don’t actually think it accelerates things. Because there’s a lot of hype out there. I haven’t really seen: oh this is really gonna replace things. I haven’t seen that yet. I’ve seen a lot of where you initially get excited, oh, this could be cool. And then you say, ah, you know, in the end it doesn’t really do the thing. Everything is human actors; we are writing everything ourselves. There’s no generated assets that you’re gonna see in the game. We are trying to use generated assets to accelerate white-boxing. But I mean to be fair, we’re talking about basic things to help the level designers.</p>
<p><strong>JS:</strong> What about concept art?</p>
<p><strong>SV:</strong> So that’s being used by concept artists. They use it the same like they would use photos. We have like 30 concept artists at this point or something like that. So we bought a boutique concept art firm at the moment that everybody was using reducing them because they were going to AI, in our case it just went up. If there’s one thing that artists keep on asking for it’s more concept artists. But what they do is they use it for exploration.</p>
<p><strong>JS:</strong> The other thing that I’ve seen that being used for more and more is placeholders, stub dialogue.</p>
<p><strong>SV:</strong> Well, yes. So it depends on the scripter. In our case what we do is whiteboxing means that the scripts put stub text in there. Some scripters will probably use a chatGPT, some will write it themselves. It’s really up to them–</p>
<p><strong>JS:</strong> But you found that it’s not actually speeding things up. It’s just kind of allowing more experimentation.</p>
<p><strong>SV:</strong> Well, in the sense that speeds it up because your experimentation is broader. But I mean, it’s not as if their dialogues are suddenly being written faster. And on the contrary, and it’s not as if you’re seeing the scripting going faster. What’s happening is there’s just more stuff being done, but I mean if you’ve used chatGPT, it helps you organize things, gets you a faster-</p>
<p><strong>JS:</strong> Until it screws up and–</p>
<p><strong>SV:</strong> Right. You still will always have to alter it yourself. And I mean like I’m non-native English, so it’s easier for me to make my phrases without mistakes. So it helps with that.</p>
<p><strong>JS:</strong> To write your company emails.</p>
<p><strong>SV:</strong> No, no, no, no. I mean I like putting it in there to see okay, this is a clean version of my text. So what’s happening is I write with worse grammar now and then I use it to clean up my text and then I have to go over it again to clean it up again.</p>
<p><strong>JS:</strong> That seems like it would take more time.</p>
<p><strong>SV:</strong> Yes, I know. But I have the feeling like my phrases are better.</p>
<p><strong>JS:</strong> Your English is pretty good. You don’t have to worry that much.</p>
<p><strong>SV:</strong> I think experimentation, white boxing, some broader white boxing, lots and lots of applications and retargeting and cleaning and editing. These are things that just really take a lot of time. So that allows you to do more. So there’s a lot of value there in terms of the creative process itself. It helps in doing things. But I haven’t seen the acceleration. So I’m really curious to see because there’s all studios that said, of this is gonna accelerate… If you look at the state of the art of video games today, these are still in their infancy. Will they eventually manage to do that at large scale? I don’t know how much data centers they’re gonna need to be able to do it.</p>
<p><strong>JS:</strong> It doesn’t seem like it’s causing more efficiency, so why use it?</p>
<p><strong>SV:</strong> This is a tech driven industry, so you try stuff. You can’t afford not to try things because if somebody finds the golden egg and you’re not using it, you’re dead this industry.</p>
<p><strong>JS:</strong> OK, but the downside though is that it’s so poisonous, controversial to players, to artists, to creative people in a way that other tech isn’t. Maybe Photoshop used to be back in the day?</p>
<p><strong>SV:</strong> I think you would find the same argument back in the days for a lot of things, right? Anything that was has been automated has always considered – I think the part of this job is to make sure that you are competitive and state of the art. So if you don’t look at the state of the art, you will eventually regret it. That’s gonna be even worse for developers.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what do you think? Is Vincke too casual about the impact of generative AI? Is that offset by the way that it’s being used internally and that it’s supporting a company that continues to grow? There’s definitely a lot of nuance here.</p>

            <p>A second season of Dispatch is being discussed "as seriously as anything" at AdHoc Studio, and the team will sit down any day now and make a decision about it.</p>
<p>"People are mad that we haven't told them what we're doing," studio co-founder and Dispatch game director Nick Herman told me in an interview. "It's the new problem, right? It's like, are you doing it? Are you not doing it? We're days away from really sitting down and having the time - because we've had to support the game - where we're going to really sit down and lay those plans out."</p>
<p>I spoke to Herman and Pierre Shorette, the lead writer and another studio co-founder, as part of a longer interview live on Eurogamer now. But though Herman said the studio is yet to make a decision on Season 2, the ways they referenced a follow-up made it sound like a much surer thing.</p>
<p>When they talked about a cut Kpop idol-inspired character called Winter, for instance, and a love triangle he was involved in, Shorette joked that he could reinstate this for Season 2. "We should do that for Season 2," he said, before quickly adding: "<em>If </em>there is a Season 2!"</p><p>It was when I questioned them directly about a second series and how seriously the studio is talking about it, that Shorette said, "As seriously as anything." But though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-proves-episodic-gaming-is-back-with-a-capital-b-following-latest-player-milestone#:~:text=The%20episodic%20superhero%20workplace%20comedy,number%20also%20equates%20to%20sales.">Dispatch has been an obvious success, racing to 2m sales</a> and capturing a large and passionate fanbase, there are concerns internally about following it up.</p>
<blockquote><em>"You have your whole life to write your first album and then eight months to write your second"</em></blockquote>
<p>As Shorette explained: "The thing is, the tough thing is, it's like in music: you have your whole life to write your first album and then eight months to write your second. And there's a little bit of that feeling. We had <em>so</em> long with this - seven years is a lot of time. If anything, it would have been embarrassing if it was bad. I mean, you took fucking long enough! We're taking <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> amounts of time on this shit, you know - it better be good. I know we're not going to have that amount of time for Season 2 because we want to meet the demand."</p>
<p>Then Herman added: "There were <em>zero </em>expectations for Season 1 - external expectations. People just had to show up and enjoy it and not have a bunch of theories and stuff in their head. Season 2, if we do it, we know that's going to be an extra challenge."</p>
<p>"A lot of pressure," Shorette said. "It'll be about what it's not as much as what it is."</p>
<p>It might be a surprise to hear Dispatch was in development for several years but its journey was a twisting, turning one. From being a live-action television series to being dropped by a publisher half-way through, the game has had to survive some bumps. You can read all about it - and about that cut Kpop character and more - in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-of-dispatch-how-adhoc-rode-rejection-to-huge-success">a Making Of-style Dispatch interview</a> live on Eurogamer now.</p>

            <p>"As the internet likes to tell us, it’s been a while." Please keep waiting, there are some magazines over there if you need them. "It’s a process." Shouting won't increase the speed at which it happens. Do you "want the turkey that is in the oven for long enough to be delicious when it finally comes out of the oven"? Some of these are things I often have to say to my cat when the clock ticks to within an hour of feeding time. Some of them are things Todd Howard and co have said about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-6">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> in another little update that's seen them declare yet again that it is coming and add that development's going good thus far.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"It’s progressing really well," the Todd himself told <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/12/16/bethesda-gives-us-an-update-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development">Game Informer</a>, about a month on from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-but-thats-not-stopping-todd-howard-teasing-an-oblivion-remastered-style-shadow-drop">gently teasing that he might fancy shadow-dropping</a> this next mainline Elder Scroll. "The majority of the studio’s on VI, but I’ll say this: We always overlap. So, we’re very used to overlapping development. And we have long pre-productions on things so that we feel good about them. And it’s a process. We all wish it went a little bit faster – or a lot faster – but it’s a process that we want to get right."</p>
<p>I assume that part of the interview happened in the lounge/living room of house Bethesda. Then, studio design director Emil Pagliarulo burst in, wearing a chef's hat and one of those kiss the cook aprons. "It’s funny, because the time pressure that players put on us, we don’t put on ourselves," he said, grasping a tray in his oven mitts. "What do fans really want? Do they want a game that comes out before it should and doesn’t meet their expectations? Or do they want the turkey that is in the oven for long enough to be delicious when it finally comes out of the oven, you know?"</p>
<p>As the smell of basting bird filled the room, Pagliarulo also suggested that taking "as long as it needs to be to be great" is just Bethesda following the tried and tested recipe for big meal success. "Games take a long time, and games get pushed all the time," he reasoned, pointing to a page headed 'Massive open-world game drizzled in weighty expectations' in a Delia Smith cookbook. "GTA <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-everyone-gta-6-has-been-hit-with-delay-number-two">just got pushed again</a>, which was the smartest thing they could do, because a game the size of these games, they take not just a long time to make, but a long time to spit and polish and iron out the bugs."</p><p>Meanwhile, studio director Angela Browder aimed to reassure the dinner guests that the grub, whenever it arrives, will knock their socks off. "The Elder Scrolls VI is this endless set of possibilities that is really, really exciting as a developer, but really, really exciting as someone who really likes to think about how far everything has come in our industry. It’s gonna be dope. It’s dope! [laughs]."</p>
<p>So, I assume Todd then said, just keep chowing down on your slightly stale <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>-shaped appetisers for the moment, if you get a bit peckish for old scrollage. Maybe go for a walk. Download some mods. Give the folks slaving away over a hot stove some space, lest you get slapped with a kitchen towel.</p>
