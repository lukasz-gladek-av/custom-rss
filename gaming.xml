            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dell keeps its official website at full price while quietly clearing inventory through Amazon ahead of Black Friday, and the deals are impossible to ignore. This 15.6-inch business laptop with an <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5461/">Intel Core i7 processor, 1TB SSD storage and 32GB RAM just dropped to an all-time low of $909, slashed from its typical $3,399 price tag</a>. The <strong>73% discount puts enterprise-level computing power within reach of anyone</strong> who needs serious performance without the four-figure price tag.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5461/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Professional Power at Consumer Pricing</h2>
<p>The Intel Core i7-1355U processor brings 10 cores to the table and splits the workload between performance and efficiency cores. This implies that while the efficiency cores handle background applications to save battery, this laptop churns out demanding tasks like compiling code or rendering videos with the performance cores. You can run multiple virtual machines for development work, edit RAW photo files in Lightroom or keep 30 browser tabs open while video conferencing without the system choking.</p>



<p>The 32GB of RAM changes the way you interact with memory-intensive applications: You can load entire databases into memory for faster queries, run multiple Docker containers side by side, or edit 4K video timelines without pre-rendering proxies. This much memory means Chrome won’t slow down when you have research tabs from last week still open and switching between applications happens instantaneously rather than waiting for things to load from disk.</p>



<p>Storage capacity reaches 1TB through NVMe SSD and gives you <strong>read speeds of about 3,500 MB/s and write speeds of about 3,000 MB/s</strong>. These are speeds whereby Windows boots in a number of seconds, applications launch in an instant, and even big file transfers complete before you’ve finished your coffee.</p>
<p>This <strong>15.6-inch FHD runs at a 120Hz refresh rate</strong> which makes scrolling through documents and websites noticeably smoother compared to most 60Hz screens. Text is sharper during rapid scrolling, while the anti-glare coating cuts down on eye strain during long sessions under fluorescent office lights or near windows. The higher refresh rate also serves well in casual gaming during breaks and lends even older games a more responsive feel.</p>
<p><strong>Windows 11 Pro includes several features</strong> that people with Home versions don’t get including BitLocker encryption to protect sensitive files, Remote Desktop for accessing your machine from anywhere, and Hyper-V for running virtual machines. The fingerprint reader is integrated with Windows Hello which means you only need a touch to log in instead of having to type passwords.</p>
<p>Last but not least, <strong>battery life supports a full workday away from outlets</strong>&nbsp;and the rapid charging brings you back to 50 percent capacity in 30 minutes.</p>
<p>At $909 for specs that would normally cost upwards of $3,000, this Dell laptop provides professional computing power at a fraction of the price.</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>In case you missed it, Square Enix is releasing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined</a> on the Switch and Switch 2 next February.</p>
<p>During Sony's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/features/round-up-what-was-announced-in-sonys-state-of-play-livestream-for-november-2025">State of Play broadcast</a> earlier on, the team behind this reimagined release shared a new "follow-up trailer", briefly highlighting the journey ahead for the party of heroes. Fans also got a glimpse of - <strong>spoiler alert</strong> - Kiefer as an adult, who you'll be reunited with on your adventures.</p>
<p>Here's an official description about Kiefer's return as an adult:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the core elements from the original remain, #DragonQuest VII Reimagined offers streamlined progression, fuller character development, and new storylines...</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>You'll run into an older looking Kiefer during your adventure to the Rucker region of the past. Your party will sneak into Rucker Castle at night to help him. Don't let the guards spot you! If they do, don't worry — Kiefer has honed his skills and will support you in battle.</p>
<p>Perhaps you'll get to fight alongside Kiefer again elsewhere...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following the release of this trailer, Square Enix has also <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/1988389037942640860">gone into a bit more detail</a> about the additional content and new locations in the game. To unlock these areas, you'll need to collect "fragments of broken stone tablets, fit them together, and place them on a pedestal of the same color".</p>
<p>You'll do this at The Shrine of Mysteries, which is located on the island your party calls home. Each stone tablet will lead to a different location with its own problems to solve. As you help out locals, you'll transform the world, with new islands appearing out of nowhere.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-is-clearing-out-2025-laptops-hps-14-inch-ai-model-drops-to-pennies-65-off-2000643061</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-is-clearing-out-2025-laptops-hp%E2%80%99s-14-inch-ai-model-drops-to-pennies-65-off.1350637/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Most people don’t have $2,000 sitting around for a MacBook and frankly, you might not even need that kind of firepower for everyday computing. HP’s 14-inch AI <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5460/">2025 laptop just hit an all-time low of $379 on Amazon, slashed from its usual $1,099 price tag</a>. The kicker is that <strong>Windows 11 Pro and a year of Office 365 come pre-installed</strong>, and those two software packages alone would normally cost you close to what you’re paying for the entire laptop at this discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5460/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Budget Pricing Meets Modern Computing Power</h2>
<p>The Intel N150 processor keeps things running smoothly whether you’re browsing the web, editing documents or streaming videos without the lag that’s so common in cheaper laptops. This chip isn’t going to render 4K video projects in seconds but it launches apps quickly and handles multiple browser tabs without grinding to a halt. You get responsive performance during video calls and enough processing muscle to run Office applications alongside your email and a dozen Chrome tabs.</p>
<p>This laptop features 16GB of DDR4 RAM which makes a big difference when you’re jumping between applications: you can have email open and edit a presentation while streaming music in the background, running antivirus scans, without everything slowing to a crawl. It really means that <strong>Windows 11 runs the way Microsoft intended it to</strong> with smooth transitions and instant app switching.</p>



<p>The <strong>storage setup combines 128GB of universal flash storage with a 256GB microSD card</strong> for a total of 386GB. The UFS storage handles your operating system and most used programs quickly thanks to its high read and write speeds, while the microSD card is there for documents, photos, and media files. In this way, this two-storage solution will keep your system running fast and gives you space for thousands of documents.</p>
<p>Unlike the Home edition, <strong>Windows 11 Pro includes enterprise-level security features</strong> and offers remote desktop capabilities. The Pro version lets you encrypt your hard drive with BitLocker, join corporate domains, and access your computer remotely when you’re traveling. You’ll also get Office 365, which gives you the full Microsoft productivity suite, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneDrive cloud storage, right out of the box. That <strong>subscription generally costs $99 per year alone, while Windows 11 Pro typically adds $199 to a laptop’s sticker price so you’re basically getting the hardware for $80</strong> after accounting for the software value.</p>



<p>A dedicated <strong>AI key for Copilot puts Microsoft’s AI Assistant</strong> just a button-press away. You can ask it to draft emails for you, summarize long documents, generate creative content, and even give tips for troubleshooting without opening a browser or digging through menus. This integration speeds up the workflow when you need fast answers or want to automate repetitive tasks.</p>
<p>The Sky Blue finish adds some nice personality to what’s otherwise a sea of gray and black finishes in the market. It also saves you from having to buy peripherals separately because it includes a Redragon mouse, and it is remarkably lightweight, easy to carry from home to office or coffee shop. You get a full computing package with the $379 asking price, capable of handling daily productivity tasks, coming loaded with premium software and even putting in modern features like AI integration and Wi-Fi 6.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-november-12-885/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-885-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-wednesday-november-12.1350634/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We’re at the midway point of the week and raring to go with another NYT Connections puzzle. Below, I’ve provided the top NYT Connections hints and solutions you’ll need to smash today’s challenge. How’s your week going? Let me know in the comments if you’ve been playing any other puzzling games and what you might like to see more hints for!</p>



<p>Read on to get the NYT Connections answers you’re looking for. Today’s puzzle is a little bizarre as it features <strong>exclusively </strong>four-letter words. You’ll see what I mean below.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-november-12">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (November 12)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #885:</p>



<ul>
<li>YOLO</li>



<li>POLO</li>



<li>LOCO</li>



<li>DODO</li>



<li>COMO</li>



<li>FOMO</li>



<li>JUDO</li>



<li>BOGO</li>



<li>BOZO</li>



<li>ROJO</li>



<li>YO-YO</li>



<li>SUMO</li>



<li>POCO</li>



<li>DOPE</li>



<li>GOLF</li>



<li>GOAT</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em><em>These all involve physical competition, but not your everyday gym workout.</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em><em>Terms for someone who’s not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed.</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em><em>Internet-born abbreviations that pack a punch.</em></em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em><em>You might hear these in Madrid or Mexico City.</em></em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, November 12.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-november-12-885">NYT Connections Answers for Today, November 12 (#885)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– GOLF, JUDO, POLO, SUMO</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – BOZO, DODO, DOPE, YO-YO</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BOGO, FOMO, GOAT, YOLO</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – COMO, LOCO, POCO, ROJO</li>
</ul>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Is Launching a Cheaper, Japanese-Language Only Digital PS5 in Japan]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/sony-launching-cheaper-japanese-language-only-digital-ps5-in-japan/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-is-launching-a-cheaper-japanese-language-only-digital-ps5-in-japan.1350610/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Sony is taking a page out of Nintendo's book with its console variations. Just like how <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-selling-a-cheaper-region-locked-nintendo-switch-2-in-japan/">Nintendo released a Japanese-language-only variation of the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, a version of the console that is only sold in Japan and only has Japanese as an available language on the device, Sony is doing the same with a new Japanese-language-only digital PS5 console. Also, just like the Japan-only variant of the Switch 2, it's slightly cheaper than getting the standard version.</p>



<p>You could argue that it was an odd choice by Sony to end its <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-japan-premieres-tomorrow-playstation/">State of Play Japan event</a> with not a new game reveal or announcement, but the reveal of a Japan-only PS5 console, but you can't really act surprised since the whole event was meant for the Japanese consumer. From that angle, it makes perfect sense to try persuading anyone who hasn't bought in on the PS5 yet in Japan with a new, cheaper version they can run out and buy.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Currently, a standard digital PS5 in Japan costs ¥72,980 ($475), though this new regional variant will drop the price to ¥55,000 ($355), which is more than a solid discount. But that's still more expensive than what the price of the console when it launched in 2020, which was ¥39,980 ($260). This new price is actually a bit of a middle ground compared to where the price of the console was at launch, and where it is now after two price increases.</p>



<p>Compared to the rest of the world, players in Japan who have not yet bought a PS5 are going to get the best deal currently available, since $355 USD is significantly cheaper than the price of the console elsewhere in the world.</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see if Sony brings this same tactic to the PS5 Pro, to extend the reach of its higher-end model. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-quietly-offloads-obi-wan-kenobis-starfighter-now-selling-for-pocket-change-on-amazon-2000643056</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-quietly-offloads-obi-wan-kenobi%E2%80%99s-starfighter-now-selling-for-pocket-change-on-amazon.1350607/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO’s Star Wars line is the brick giant’s most popualr franchise but the company rarely discounts these sets on its own website. Amazon just changed the game by dropping <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5459/">Obi-Wan Kenobi’s Jedi Starfighter to an all-time low of $25, down from its regular $29 price tag</a>. This <strong>282-piece set</strong> from <em>Attack of the Clones</em> gives you the iconic blue starfighter, three minifigures including a debut character and enough playability to keep young Jedi entertained for hours.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5459/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>A Starfighter That Delivers on All Fronts</h2>
<p>The build itself captures the <strong>sleek design of Obi-Wan’s Delta-7 Aethersprite-class interceptor</strong> impressively well considering the compact size. You get retractable landing gear that actually works, and gives kids the satisfaction of transforming the ship from flight mode to landed position via a simple mechanism. The cockpit opens smoothly to fit the <strong>Obi-Wan minifigure</strong>, complete with <strong>his blue lightsaber</strong> that stores in dedicated clips on the exterior when he’s flying. Two stud shooters mounted on the wings let you recreate those intense space battles from the Geonosis sequence, and fires with enough force to knock over other LEGO creations without being dangerous.</p>



<p><strong>R4-P17, Obi-Wan’s faithful astromech droid</strong>, gets a special attachment point on the wing where you can place the head of the droid. This detail mirrors how the droid integrates directly into the starfighter in the movies and provides navigation and repair capabilities during missions. The Taun We minifigure marks her first appearance in any LEGO set, which matters to collectors who track these releases. She’s the <strong>Kaminoan</strong> who greets Obi-Wan at the cloning facility and her inclusion adds a narrative element beyond just the starfighter itself.</p>



<p>The finished model <strong>measures 10 inches long, 5 inches wide, and just over 2.5 inches tall</strong>, which makes it substantial enough to display on a shelf without taking up half your bookcase. The proportions work well for swooshing around during play sessions, and construction feels solid enough to survive typical handling from seven-year-olds. LEGO designed this set with a balance between structural integrity and the ability to actually play with it rather than creating a fragile display piece that falls apart if you look at it wrong.</p>
<p>At 282 pieces, you’re looking at<strong> roughly an hour or two of building time</strong> depending on experience level. The instruction booklet breaks everything down into clear steps with color-coded sections so younger builders won’t get frustrated trying to figure out which tiny piece goes where. This piece count hits the sweet spot where it’s engaging enough to feel like an accomplishment but not so overwhelming that kids lose interest halfway through.</p>
<p>The $25 price works out to less than nine cents per piece so this is a pretty comfortable margin below the average LEGO price. Star Wars sets are typically a bit more expensive than average because of the licensing fees, so it’s not common to find one below the usual retail price.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>During Tuesday’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-state-of-play-japan-marvel-dragon-quest-2000643049">Japan-focused State of Play</a>, Sony announced a new, cheaper Japanese-language-only PlayStation 5 Digital Edition console that will be available exclusively in Japan. It’s likely a reaction to tariffs in the United States, inflation in Japan, and Nintendo’s own cheaper Japan-only Switch 2.</p>

 <p>On November 11, at the very end of PlayStation’s latest State of Play broadcast, Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Hideaki Nishino announced “something very special” for gamers in Japan: A Japanese-language-only PS5 console that will cost ¥55,000 yen, which is roughly $350 USD. That same console, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873">following a price increase earlier this year</a>, now costs $500 in the United States. Currently, the digital-only PS5 in Japan costs roughly ¥73,000. So if you live in Japan and know the language, you can save quite a bit of money buying this<a href="https://blog.ja.playstation.com/2025/11/12/20251112-ps5/"> cheaper, Japanese-only version of the PS5, which goes on sale on November 21</a>.</p>   <p>As to why Sony is releasing a cheaper, Japan-only PS5, there are a few factors. One of the big ones, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/f6edb22a-0b19-4073-9e28-ec29b096dde3">as reported by the <em>Financial Times,</em></a> is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/07/japanese-real-wages-takaichi-abenomics-inflation-boj-policy.html">rising inflation and the yen losing value</a> in Sony’s home country. And since, as Dr. Serkan Toto, CEO of Tokyo-based game industry consultancy Kantan Games <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-will-sell-a-cheaper-330-switch-2-in-japan-thats-region-locked/">told <em>VGC</em></a>, many gamers in Japan don’t care about their consoles being region-locked or restricted to Japanese only, this is a way for Sony to offer a cheaper console to one of its key markets.</p>

 <p>It also makes it harder for resellers and people outside of Japan to snatch up PS5 consoles at a cheaper price, a factor that led to Nintendo offering its very own <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-made-a-much-cheaper-japanese-language-only-nintendo-switch-2-and-even-duolingo-is-poking-fun">Japan-only Switch 2 console earlier this year</a>.</p> <p>And yeah, that’s another likely reason for a Japan-only PS5: <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/article/466071/ps5-outsells-switch-2-ps5-tops-80m-worldwide-hardware-estimates-for-september-2025/#:~:text=by%20over%2051%2C000.-,2025%20year%2Dto%2Ddate%2C%20the%20Nintendo%20Switch%202%20has%20sold%209.24%20million%20units%2C%20the%20PlayStation%205%20has%20sold%20an%20estimated%208.21%20million%20units%2C%20the%20Nintendo%20Switch%201%20has%20sold%203.31%20million%20units%2C%20and%20the%20Xbox%20Series%20X%7CS%20has%20sold%201.69%20million%20units.,-Monthly%20Sales%3A">The Switch 2 is doing very well in the country</a>, and the OG Switch is holding its own, too. Sony’s pricey PS5 is likely too much for consumers in Japan who are struggling with inflation. A cheaper, <a href="https://blog.ja.playstation.com/2025/11/12/20251112-ps5/">region-locked PS5</a> that can’t be easily resold on the grey market could be a big hit in Japan and help Sony regain some ground. It also marks Sony’s first region-locked console since the PlayStation 2.</p> <p>Of course, one more factor in all of this is the ongoing tariffs enacted by President Donald Trump. These tariffs led to Sony raising the price of all PS5 consoles in the United States earlier this year, and a Japan-only PS5 can help the company focus on its local market without having to pay high tariffs or deal with outside buyers. Who had “Region-Locked Consoles Return In 2025” on their horrible bingo card?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring: Nightreign is getting its first meaty, proper, named DLC next month, including new bosses, new shifting earth, and new playable Nightfarers. The DLC is called The Forsaken Hollows, and it's out on December 4, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from a trailer shown during today's State of Play, which showed off a lot of clips from what's to come, albeit without a lot of context. There's a clip showing what seems to be a new Shifting Earth known as The Great Hollow, which opens up a huge hole in the middle of Limveld with temples, towers, and crystals sticking out. We see two new Nightfarers: the first is the Undertaker, which uses strength and faith as her primary stats, and the Scholar, which seems to be an arcane-focused magic-user.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also two new bosses that should be familiar to FromSoft veterans. Most notable is a glimpse of Artorias, subject of the original Dark Souls DLC Artorias of the Abyss.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A voiceover that sounds a lot like Duchess also refers to "the aftermath of the Long Night," perhaps implying that this DLC takes place after the "end" of Nightreign when the Nightfarers have defeated all the Nightlords. There's also something at the beginning about the "Dreglord". As usual, Souls fans will probably have to wait for the post-release lore videos to make sense of this one. It's unclear how much story content this is really going to add, or if it's just the bosses, the characters, and the shifting earth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring: Nightreign is Bandai Namco's multiplayer riff on Elden Ring, where 1-3 players can fight their way through three nights of exploration, loot hunting, and bosses as they try to take down powerful Night Lords. The game launched back in May, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-review">we gave it a 7/10</a>, saying "When Elden Ring Nightreign is played exactly as it was designed to be played, it’s one of the finest examples of a three-player co-op game around – but that's harder to do than it should be, and playing solo is poorly balanced."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Elden Ring Nightreign Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Since its release, FromSoftware has made a number of balance tweaks, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-finally-gets-duos-mode-with-patch-102-game-balance-adjusts-to-the-current-number-of-players">added a duos mode</a>, and updated with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftware-has-an-update-and-one-last-tease-for-us-before-elden-ring-nightreigns-challenging-deep-of-night-mode-arrives-check-out-the-patch-notes">an ultra-hard difficulty mode called Deep of Night</a> for those who for some reason didn't think the game was hard enough as-is. However, the last few months have been quiet, and fans have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fromsoftware-parent-company-confirms-elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-by-end-of-march-2026-as-frustrated-players-leave-negative-steam-reviews">grown agitated at the lack of news or updates</a>, with FromSoftware leaving them to just fight the same bosses over and over. FromSoftware moved to reassure everyone just yesterday in a financial report, and today's DLC announcement should help matters as well. It looks like the DLC will cost $15.00 if you don't already own either the Collectors or Deluxe edition of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything announced at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/state-of-play-japan-everything-announced-updating-live">today's State of Play right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

        <blockquote><p><em>FATAL FRAME II: Crimson Butterfly REMAKE</em> is a full remake of the second installment in the <em>FATAL FRAME</em> (<em>PROJECT ZERO</em>) series, originally released in 2003. The title has undergone a complete overhaul to offer a haunting experience, which has been beautifully reborn thanks to enhanced graphics, sound and controls elements.</p><p>The graphical enhancements offer a higher level of detail with refined textures, striking lighting and shadow contrast, generating a more haunting and realistic atmosphere than ever before. The sound has been revamped to offer spatial audio that will immerse players deep into the <a title="Genres > Action [3,188 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>, allowing them to enjoy a more authentic experience. Not only will they hear and feel the presence of spirits more intensely, but wraiths will appear when least expected, such as trying to grab the protagonist’s hands when reaching for an item or waiting in the shadows. Players will have to react quickly to escape these attacks. Failure to do so will inflict Willpower Damage, leading directly to intense combat.</p><p>The gameplay mechanics of the Camera Obscura, a signature feature of the <em>FATAL FRAME</em> franchise, have also been reworked to offer a more intense and rich experience during combat and exploration. Players will still be able to attack wraiths by taking photos, but managing to align the focus point with their target will inflict more damage. If the damage dealt exceeds a certain threshold, players will be able to activate Shutter Chance state, where they will then be able to deal significant damage with one single picture within a brief period—making it crucial for fans to be precise and to perfectly time their shot.</p><p>Players will be able to trigger a Fatal Frame by taking a shot at the perfect moment, which will interrupt and stun their opponent. If fans manage to trigger a Fatal Frame during a Shutter Chance state, they will activate a Fatal Time, a limited window that will allow them to take several shots in quick succession to inflict significant damage.</p><p>To confront the spirits lurking in the shadows of Minakami Village, players will be able to rely on new Camera Obscura features such as focus, zoom and filters. By lighting up the focus points on the screen, players will focus on their target and deal more damage to the spirits if they manage to light more focus points. By using the zoom feature, players will be able to attack a spirit from a distance while taking cover and being undetected and will also be able to attack multiple targets at once by zooming out. The zoom of the Camera Obscura will also help players during exploration as they will be able to photograph specific objects.</p><p>Lastly, the filters will help players to unravel the mysteries around them by changing filters depending on the situation or wraith they encounter. Among the different filters they can use, the Paraceptual Filter will allow them to increase their shooting distance in combat and, when exploring, to reproduce past actions using the residual memories.</p><p>In addition to these new mechanics, <em>FATAL FRAME II: Crimson Butterfly REMAKE</em> will introduce new gameplay features, such as being able to hold Mayu’s hand, which will recover players’ Health and Willpower. However, if Mayu is in danger, she may stumble and fall, requiring Mio’s help to get back up. Players will also be able to collect Charms they can equip, allowing them to benefit from various effects. By expanding the Charm Bag, the number of charms they can equip will increase.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.

Sawtooth, for example, is 7 x 4.5 x 3 inches. Both Machines have numerous points of articulation to create different poses or to play with them like action figures. You can turn Sawtooth's neck, head, legs, and hips as well as open his jaws on both sides. Meanwhile, the Shell-Walker Machine has adjustable legs and claws. Shell-Walker also has detachable cargo pod and shield accessories.</p><p>Aloy wields her signature bow, while Varl has his spear. Each weapon can be modded with accessories representing elemental attacks--fire, chill, and shock--from the game. The playset also includes two small baseplates with miniature builds of tall reeds, a treasure chest, and a campfire.</p></div>                      </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4600796-legohorizonadventures.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4600796" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4600796-legohorizonadventures.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4600796"></a><figcaption>Lego Horizon Adventures (77037)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4600796-legohorizonadventures.jpg"></figure><p>Aloy &amp; Varl vs. Shell-Walker &amp; Sawtooth isn't the first Lego set based on PlayStation's Horizon franchise.

It was still possible to find the Tallneck at Amazon last year, but the retailer sold out over the holidays due to a Black Friday discount. Reseller prices have risen throughout 2025; sellers on Amazon's marketplace are currently asking $160 for the Tallneck. At face value, this price may sound too outlandish for a large Lego model designed for adults, but the Tallneck originally retailed for $90. Despite the inflated cost, Amazon's store page notes 100-plus units sold over the last 30 days.</p><hr><p>If you haven't played the Lego Horizon Adventures video game, physical editions for PS5 and Nintendo Switch are available for low prices at multiple retailers.</p><ul><li><strong>Lego Horizon Adventures for PS5</strong><ul><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+A+Rare+Discount+On+Lego%27s+768-Piece+Horizon+Adventures+Battle+Set&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-11-11+16%3A01%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-11-11+16%3A02%3A11&amp;fnarticle_id=6536132&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-13142092%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Flego-horizon-adventures-2&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fplaystation-lego-horizon-adventures-aloy-and-varl-shell-walker-and-sawtooth-building-set%2F1100-6536132%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Woot</a> -- $22 (<del>$40</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Horizon-Adventures-PS5-PlayStation-5/dp/B09Z7JZW4P?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> -- $31.49 (<del>$40</del>)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Lego Horizon Adventures for Switch</strong><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Horizon-Adventures-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DJDLS8Q1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a> -- $26.86 (<del>$40</del>)</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+A+Rare+Discount+On+Lego%27s+768-Piece+Horizon+Adventures+Battle+Set&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-11-11+16%3A01%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-11-11+16%3A02%3A11&amp;fnarticle_id=6536132&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLEGO-Horizon-Adventures-Nintendo-Switch%2F12805502400%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fplaystation-lego-horizon-adventures-aloy-and-varl-shell-walker-and-sawtooth-building-set%2F1100-6536132%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart</a> -- $26.87 (<del>$40</del>)</li></ul></li></ul><div title="6536132 - Horizon Aloy and Varl Action Figures" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4951" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6536132 - Horizon Aloy and Varl Action Figures" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Horizon-Forbidden-Collector-Plushies/dp/B0CTHX2THL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/PlayStation-Horizon-Forbidden-Collector-Plushies\/dp\/B0CTHX2THL?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Horizon-Forbidden-Collector-Plushies/dp/B0CTHX2THL?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Horizon Forbidden West: 10-Inch Aloy Plush</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Horizon-Forbidden-Collector-Plushies/dp/B0CTHX2THL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/PlayStation-Horizon-Forbidden-Collector-Plushies\/dp\/B0CTHX2THL?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation-Horizon-Forbidden-Collector-Plushies/dp/B0CTHX2THL?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$6 (was $20)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The PlayStation Shapes Collection also includes a 10-inch Aloy plush.

God of War fans can get the Kratos plush for $16.</p></div>                      </div><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lunar-remastered-collection-amazon-exclusive-physical-edition-deal-switch-playstation-xbox/1100-6528818/">Amazon-Exclusive Lunar Remastered Collection Gets First Price Cut</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-set-deals-restock-preorder-buying-guide/2900-6271/">Final Fantasy Magic: The Gathering Booster Box Restocked With Huge Discount At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-hunger-games-sunrising-on-the-reaping-gift-edition-book-box-set-deals/1100-6535218/">Sunrise On The Reaping New Collector's Gift Edition Is Already Discounted At Amazon</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (3)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-dc-batman-construction-figure-and-bat-pod-bike-the-dark-knight-amazon-deal/1100-6535073/">Lego DC Batman Figure &amp; Bat-Pod Is Over 50% Off At Amazon, Sold Out Everywhere Else</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/honkai-star-rail-8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-controller-collector-bundle-amazon-deal/1100-6534680/">Honkai: Star Rail 8BitDo Ultimate 2 Collector's Bundle Gets First Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-elite-series-2-wireless-controller-deal-holiday-2025/1100-6535861/">Xbox Elite Series 2 Deal: Save $60 On Microsoft's Premium Wireless Controller</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <p>
Sony revealed its latest piece of hardware at tonight's State of Play event: a 27" Gaming Monitor that's coming only to the US and Japan.
</p>
<p>
The company is expanding its hardware offering even further, following its PlayStation Portal remote player with a desktop gaming monitor, complete with charging hook for your PS5 controller. It'll also pair with the Pulse Elevate wireless speakers.
</p>
<p>
The monitor will be released next year, though there's no date or price just yet. It's also unclear why it's only coming to the US and Japan.

<p>
The specifications for the monitor, as shared on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/11/first-look-at-playstations-27-gaming-monitor/">PlayStation Blog</a>, are as follows:
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>A Quad High Definition (QHD) IPS display up to 2560 x 1440 resolution,* so players can game at a comfortable viewing distance from their desk.</li>
<li>High Dynamic Range support with Auto HDR Tone Mapping that automatically adjusts HDR settings during setup on PS5 and PS5 Pro consoles, ensuring rich and vivid picture quality.* </li>
<li>VRR support and refresh rates of up to 120 Hz for smooth and seamless gameplay on PS5 and PS5 Pro consoles, and 240 Hz on compatible PC and Mac devices. </li>
<li>A built-in Charging Hook for a DualSense or DualSense Edge wireless controller (sold separately) that makes it easy for players to get right into gaming.</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p>
It also has the following ports:
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Two HDMI IN port (ver 2.1) and one DisplayPort IN port (ver 1.4)** for compatibility with PS5, PC, Mac, or other devices</li>
<li>HDMI IN port (ver 2.1) supports up to 2560×1440, 240Hz, FRL, VRR; DisplayPort IN port (ver 1.4) supports up to 2560×1440, 240Hz, DSC</li>
<li>Two USB Type-A and one USB Type-C port that can be used with PlayStation Link Adapters or other devices</li>
<li>Built-in stereo speaker and 3.5mm audio output</li>
<li>Compatibility with select VESA mounting systems for a more flexible display setup</li>
</ul></blockquote>

<p>
The reveal of the monitor means the PS5 console will be playable in multiple ways, be it on your TV, via handheld, or at your desk.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, while some may have been sceptical of the Portal, it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-playstation-bosses-celebrate-ps-portal-usage-figures-i-can-finally-say-the-weird-little-ps5-peripheral-justifies-its-existence">proven surprisingly popular</a> and can now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/you-no-longer-need-a-ps5-to-play-astro-bot-and-other-ps5-exclusives">stream PS5 games directly</a>.

Normal patch stuff. The final one, though, is:</p><blockquote>Stopped babies born in fort from worshipping extra deities.</blockquote><p>I have so many questions. Why are they <em>born </em>worshipping any deities at all, let alone <em>extra </em>ones? How have they become aware of them, intravenously? If that's normal, why is worshipping <em>one </em>OK, but not others? </p><p>I need answers. Or...do I? Maybe I should just stop asking questions. Maybe I should just accept that this is the universe the game has made for itself and marvel at the beauty of it:</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image: </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/reki.gay?ref=aftermath.site"><span>@reki.gay on bsky</span></a></figcaption></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Arc System Works was one of the studios we predicted would appear <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-japan-premieres-tomorrow-playstation/">at the State of Play Japan</a>, specifically with a release date for Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls. Well, we were right that we'd get to see Arc System Works and with more Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls, but we did not get a release date revealed, and are still saddled with an expected release window of '2026.' That said, there is a new closed beta lined up before the end of the year.</p>



<p>Arc System Works also showed off more gameplay for Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls, and two of the game's developers also made an appearance during the live stream to talk more about the game, and how the studio wanted to blend Japanese art styles with the style of the comic books.</p>



<p>The new closed beta will run from December 5-7, and adds Spider-Man and Ghost Rider to the roster of playable characters to try out in the beta. It'll also include two new stages, and a bevy of fixes and tweaks based on feedback from the game's first closed beta earlier this year.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>If you registered for the first closed beta and participated, then you'll be automatically registered for this one. If you registered for the first one and didn't participate, then you should keep an eye on your email inbox for an invitation. If you didn't register for the first closed beta but want to try your luck this time, then <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls/#closed-beta/">you can register at this link</a>.</p>



<p>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls is due to launch on PC and PS5 sometime in 2026.</p>

This unlocked smartphone is normally $799, but you <strong>can currently get it for 32% off</strong> which places Google’s flagship in the same price bracket as mid-tier Android devices. The irony isn’t lost here: Amazon is making Google’s premium phone more affordable than Google ever has.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5365/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Google’s Flagship Gets the Budget Phone Treatment</h2>
<p>The Pixel 9 is equipped with a <strong>large 6.3-inch Actua display</strong> for sharp visuals-be it when scrolling through social media or watching videos on a commute. This screen size comes as a sweet spot: big enough for comfortable viewing and compact enough to be managed by one hand when you juggle coffee and groceries. Display technology ensures colors pop without the oversaturated look that some phones push just a bit too hard and gives you an accurate representation whether editing photos or simply browsing.</p>
<p>Under the hood, you get 128GB of storage (which works out to about 30,000 photos) or several dozen apps, before you have to start thinking about cloud backup. In many ways, the<strong> 24-hour battery life</strong> lets you leave your charger at home without anxiety for a full workday and into an evening out. Google achieved this by combining power management on its processors with display optimization that adapts to whatever you’re doing, whether that’s reading email or streaming content.</p>



<p>Where the <strong>Pixel 9 really earns its keep is in the camera system</strong>: The heavy lifting is done through Google’s computational photography which means the phone is processing multiple exposures in milliseconds to create shots that look professionally edited straight out of the camera app. Night photography becomes actually useable rather than a grainy mess, thanks to algorithms that brighten shadows while keeping highlights in check.</p>
<p><strong>Integration with Gemini</strong> places Google’s AI assistant right into the core of your workflow: You can ask it to summarize long email threads, draft responses with a specific tone, or pull information from your photos and documents without having to jump between apps. This is not just a repackaged voice assistant; it understands context from your screen and can help with tasks like planning trips by scanning flight confirmations and suggesting activities based on your destination.</p>



<p>What’s great is that <strong>unlocked means you are not tied to any carrier’s payment plan</strong> or restrictions. You can switch providers without dealing with unlock requests or compatibility issues, and international travel is easier, as you can just pop in a local SIM card. This flexibility alone can save you hundreds over a two-year period compared to locked alternatives that charge premium rates for roaming.</p>
<p>Right now, you’re paying just $565 for flagship specs and Google’s best camera tech; that’s less than what many mid-range phones sell for.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/everything-we-saw-at-playstation%E2%80%99s-japan-centric-state-of-play.1350547/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Today, Sony held a State of Play showcase to talk about upcoming PlayStation 5 games, but this one was a little different. This one was specifically focused on Japan-developed games, as well as projects from other Asian studios. The State of Play Japan showcase was hosted by <em>Ys&nbsp;</em>actor Yuki Kaji, and was only streamed in Japanese, even in other territories. It did have English subtitles, though, so if you want to watch the 40-minute presentation, you can do so below. If you just want the highlights, though, we’ve got you covered.</p>

  <h2><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagining</em></h2>  <p>Kicking off the show was&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest VII Remastered</em>. I don’t know why I was surprised that the trailer was in English. I guess I just assumed the “Japanese audio with English subtitles” extended to the trailers as well. But anyway, we saw a pretty story-heavy trailer of this from-the-ground-up reimagining of <em>Dragon Quest VII</em>. The game is coming out on February 5.</p>

 <h2><em>inKONBINI: One Store, Many Stories</em></h2>  <p>Next up is a management sim&nbsp;called&nbsp;<em>inKONBINI: One Store, Many Stories</em>, in which the player runs a corner store. You’ll manage your merchandise, chat with customers, and collect stuff from the vending machines in April 2026.</p>

 <h2><em>Coffee Talk Tokyo</em></h2> <p>The next entry in the coffee shop social simulator series&nbsp;<em>Coffee Talk&nbsp;</em>is&nbsp;<em>Coffee Talk Tokyo</em>, which is exactly what it sounds like. You’ll make coffee for patrons in a cyberpunk Tokyo on March 5.</p> <h2><em>BrokenLore</em></h2>  <p>Two new games in the&nbsp;<em>BrokenLore </em>horror series are coming. The first is <em>Unfollow</em>, which is all about the dark side of social media. It’s coming on January 16. The next entry will be called <em>BrokenLore: Ascend</em>, and will have a focus on vertical climbing movement. It will launch next summer.</p>

  <h2><em>Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly</em></h2>  <p>Sony decided to get a bunch of spooky stuff out of the way at once, as next up is a remake of <em>Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly </em>helmed by <em>Dead or Alive </em>and <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>developer Team Ninja.&nbsp;Yeah, that shit looks as creepy as it did on the PS2. The remake will launch on March 12.</p>

 <h2><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em></h2>  <p>Koei Tecmo also showed off a new DLC for&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins </em>called <em>Visions of Four Heroes</em>. It launches on January 22.</p> <h2><em>Gran Turismo 7</em></h2>  <p>Oh hey, at least one of the teams under PlayStation Studios is here for the show. Polyphony Digital showed up with the <em>Gran Turismo 7 Power Pack</em>, which will add new racing modes to the game later this year.</p>

 <h2>Rapid-fire announcements</h2>  <p>Next up we saw a few smaller games like <em>MotionRec</em>, a sci-fi puzzle platformer,&nbsp;<em>Wandering Sword</em>, an HD-2D RPG set in ancient China, the PS4 and PS5 release of <em>No Sleep For Kadame Date –&nbsp;AI The Somnium Files</em>, and <em>Tokyo Xtreme Racer.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <h2>Bandai Namco’s DLC minute</h2>  <p>Bandai Namco had a few DLCs to announce for some of its games. First up was&nbsp;<em>Once Upon a Katamari</em>, which is getting two DLC packs with new levels, cosmetics, and music. <em>Pac-Man World 2: Re-Pac&nbsp;</em>is getting&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>levels, which are available today.&nbsp;<em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em>‘s first DLC includes a new story chapter that adds five new Digimon to the roster, and is coming this winter. <em>Super Robot Wars Y</em> is getting its first collab DLC, which adds characters from&nbsp;<em>Kamen Rider</em>.</p> <h2><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></h2> <p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>is also getting some DLC. The Free Title Update 4 will launch on December 16, and adds more monsters to hunt and additions to the RPG’s endgame.</p> <h2><em>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</em></h2> <p>Because the crossover slop never ends,&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds&nbsp;</em>is getting more crossover characters as DLC from&nbsp;<em>Nights</em> and <em>Super Monkey Ball</em>. It’ll also get Tangle and Whisper, some lesser-known <em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>characters. Oh yeah, and the Spongebob pack is coming on November 19. Blah.</p>

 <h2><em>Never Grave: The Witch and the Curse</em></h2>  <p>Next up is&nbsp;<em>Never Grave: The Witch and the Curse</em>, an action platformer that looks like the kind of thing you’d play if&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>just wasn’t enough torment for you. The game will launch on March 5.</p> <h2><em>Blazblue: Entropy Effect X</em></h2>  <p>I see Arc System Works’ logo and I perk up. The studio is making a new entry in the <em>Blazblue: Entropy Effect </em>subseries with <em>Entropy Effect X</em>. The action platformer has the team’s incredible visual flare and looks super challenging. It will launch on February 12.</p>

 <h2>More rapid fire game updates</h2>  <p>Nextt we got another series of bite-sized looks at some smaller games. First up is twin-stick shooter/platformer <em>Damon and Baby</em>, followed by a new Prinny-infested action RPG from the <em>Disgaea </em>team called <em>Kyouran Makaism</em>.&nbsp;<em>Fate Trigger</em>, a fast-paced hero shooter featuring ten distinct playable characters, wrapped up the segment.</p> <h2><em>Octopath Traveler 0</em></h2>  <p>Damn. The host mentioned a beloved Square Enix series and my&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>copium started up. But no, instead we got a new look at <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em>. It sure looks like one of those! Square Enix has released a demo that will allow you to carry over your saved data to the main game when it launches on December 4.</p> <h2><em>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</em></h2>  <p>Now that’s the Arc System Works game I wanted to see. The studio’s upcoming&nbsp;<em>Marvel&nbsp;</em>game is putting an anime fighter spin on the comic book icons.&nbsp;<em>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls&nbsp;</em>is getting a new beta test that will include new stages and add Spider-Man and Ghost Rider as playable characters. The test will take place from December 5 to 7.</p>

 <h2><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></h2>  <p>Bandai Namco wasn’t done with DLC, actually.&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>got its own special little segment for its&nbsp;<em>The Forsaken Hollows&nbsp;</em>expansion. If you and your friends are ready to head back into The Lands Between, you can do so December 4.</p> <p>Oh, that was the end? Alrighty then. RIP to the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>fans who were holding their breath. We’ll do this whole song and dance again at The Game Awards.</p>

The first ran from September 5 to 7, and featured online play, limited offline functionality, and six playable fighters. This new closed beta, which runs from December 5 to 7, adds Spider-Man and Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes) into the mix as playable characters and adds various other features to give players a better chance to test out the upcoming fighter.</p><p>This second closed beta adds Savage Land, which was revealed at Tokyo Game Show, and the X-Mansion, which was revealed today. These two iconic locales come primarily from the X-Men side of the Marvel Universe, and the X-Mansion features Colossus, Beast, Professor X, and other mutants lingering the background. The new beta will also include more consistent online play with no breaks in the gameplay schedule, rollback netcode, expanded offline features, and spectator mode.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CHHTVR47-8k"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CHHTVR47-8k" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>With the inclusion of these two new characters into this next closed beta, that brings the full roster for December's closed beta to eight characters: Captain America, Doctor Doom, Ghost Rider, Iron Man, Ms. Marvel, Spider-Man, Star-Lord, and Storm. We do not know how many playable characters will be available in the final game, but if we look at Dragon Ball FighterZ, it included 23 playable characters at launch (including unlockables), plus another 22 post-launch, bringing the total to 45. Marvel has no shortage of well-known characters, so it stands to reason we have quite a few more to learn about in the lead up to launch and after.</p><p>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls arrives on PlayStation 5 and PC at some point in 2026.

            <p>Never Grave: The Witch and The Curse has finally got a release date. Announced during tonight's State of Play event, the side scrolling action game will be coming out on the 5th March, 2026 on the PS5 and PS4.</p>
<p>Developed by Frontside 180 and published as part of Pocketpair's relatively new video game publishing arm, the game received a new gameplay trailer as part of the announcement.</p>
<p>This trailer not only shows off a few new boss fights, but also an equipment screen, what appears to be a skill tree, and some fancy magically-charged combat. You can watch it yourself below.</p>

<p>Frontside 180, a fully-owned subsidiary of Pocketpair, dropped a Steam demo for Never Grave in January 2024. Since then, it's been cooking away in the background. It's the second game to come from Pocketpair's publishing arm, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-studio-pocketpair-wont-publish-games-with-ai-we-dont-believe-in-it">which Pocketpair staff have said will not work with games using AI, NFTs, or Web 3</a>.</p><p>

The first game to come from Pocketpair Publishing was Dead Take, which is a fantastic indie project <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surgent-studios-reveals-full-cast-for-dead-take-including-sam-lake-jane-perry-and-laura-bailey">starring popular voice actors Ben Starr, Neil Newbon, and others.</a></p><p>Never Grave: The Witch and The Curse certainly looks charming. Here's hoping Frontside 180 can magic away the months so March comes all the quicker.</p>

            <p>
Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is set to receive three new free Sega characters over the next few months.
</p>
<p>
The first, coming next month, is NiGHTS from the iconic Sega Saturn game. Though not officially announced by Sega previously, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-leak-reveals-more-iconic-characters-coming-to-its-roster-which-retro-fans-will-love">character is present on the back of the physical version of the game</a>, so their inclusion has been known since before the game's release. Still, at least we know they're coming in December.
</p>
<p>
NiGHTS will be followed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-monkey-ball">Super Monkey Ball</a>'s AiAi, the cute little banana-grabbing monkey who's been let out of their ball. AiAi will join in January 2026.

<p>
Last up is Tangle and Whisper, dual characters from the Sonic the Hedgehog spin-off comic series that debuted in 2019. Tangle is a lemur and Whisper is a wolf.
</p>
<p>
These three will join Persona 5's Joker and Like A Dragon's Ichiban, who were both recently added to the game as free additions.
</p>
<p>
Shortly after the game's release, the paid Minecraft DLC was released, featuring new characters and a new track. Capcom's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-adds-mega-man-next-year-with-post-launch-roadmap-now-revealed">Mega Man will also join next year</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A second closed beta for Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls has been announced and it launches December 5, 2025 at midnight Pacific Time. It will run until December 7 at 11:59 PM. On the 5th and 6th of December you will be able to battle both online and with CPU opponents, with this being reduced to online only on the 7th of&nbsp; December.</p>
<p>You should be able to<a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls/#closed-beta/"> sign up for the closed beta here.</a></p>
<p><iframe title="Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls - New Closed Beta Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CHHTVR47-8k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The six playable characters from the first beta, Iron Man, Doctor Doom, Ms Marvel, Storm, Captain America and Star-Lord, will be joined by Spider-Man and Ghost Rider. Two new stages, Savage Land and the X-Mansion have been added to the beta. You will also be able to use the communal space and spectate games.</p>
<p>“Based on feedback received from the previous closed beta, we’ve implemented numerous improvements, including balance adjustments, performance optimizations, visual enhancements, and user experience upgrades. More details will be shared as we get closer to the beta test,” explains Kazuto Sekine, Game Director and Lead Battle Designer.</p>

<p>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Soulsis a tag fighter but it is pushing the boundary to be a 4v4 system. There are different ways to approach it. You can use one fighter with the other three in the team being assists, or swap through each character to work out the different styles that they have.</p>
<p>The game is a big collaboration between Sony, Marvel and Arc System Works, who have developed some of the most celebrated fighting games of the past decade including Dragon Ball FighterZ and Guilty Gear Strive.</p>
<p>Looking back at Dragon Ball FighterZ, in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/01/29/dragon-ball-fighterz-review/">our glowing review</a>, Dave wrote,&nbsp;“By shattering some boundaries, Dragon Ball FighterZ has combat that’s more than worth getting into, but also a diverse roster and some phenomenal presentation. The Story Mode could have been improved if it were more streamlined, but it’s a mere blemish on an otherwise spectacular game.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware have revealed a DLC expansion for Elden Ring: Nightreign,and it’s coming out soon. Really soon. Elden Ring: Nightreign: The Forsaken Hollows will launch on 4th December 2025. That’s less than a month away!</p>
<p><iframe title="Elden Ring Nightreign The Forsaken Hollows - Gameplay Reveal Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d7GO1FjenwI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Forsaken Hollows will bring additional Nightfarers, Bosses and more into the multiplayer spin-off to one of FromSoftware’s most beloved games.</p>
<p>The update will introduce the Scholar and the Undertaker as two new playable Nightfarers. They’re described as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scholar</strong> –&nbsp;An academic who walks the Lands Between. Boasting impressive arcane levels, he gains incredible advantages through battlefield observation.</li>
<li><strong>Undertaker –</strong>&nbsp;An abbess who was mandated to slay the Nightlord. Boasting impressive strength and faith, she sends enemies to the afterlife with ruthless efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two new bosses will also feature in this DLC expansion, and there will be the new area of The Great Hollow, which adds a cavity to explore under Limveld. This includes exotic ruins and temples, sacred towers from forgotten peoples, and crystals and have a life-draining miasma that you’ll probably want to avoid.</p>

<p>Those that pre-order the DLC will receive a digital artbook and mini soundtrack as downloadable apps, though these were previously available as part of the Deluxe Edition and Deluxe Upgrade Pack. In fact, The Forsaken Hollows DLC is included for those who bought the Collectors Edition or Deluxe Edition of Nightreign.</p>
<p>While good, Elden Ring Nightreign didn’t gather quite the same level of acclaim of its predecessor and currently sits on a score of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/elden-ring-nightreign/">77 on Metacritic</a>, though that didn’t stop millions of eager FromSoftware fans diving in as soon as possible. We gave the game a solid<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/elden-ring-nightreign-review/"> 7/10 in our review,</a> with Jason saying, “Elden Ring Nightreign is a fun multiplayer offshoot, but it also doesn’t come close to the dizzying heights we’re used to seeing from FromSoftware. It’s an interesting experiment, and I am glad it exists despite my mixed feelings, but it’s a shallow happiness when I expect far more profound experiences from this company.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Just as the community <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-in-the-works-fromsoftware-kadokawa/">was bemoaning the lack of post-launch support</a>, Elden Ring Nightreign developer FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-japan-premieres-tomorrow-playstation/">at the State of Play Japan</a> that new DLC is coming to Elden Ring Nightreign, and it'll arrive before the end of the year. The new expansion, The Forsaken Hollows, will arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this coming December 4, 2025.</p>



<p>This paid DLC expansion adds a few new features to the game, with two new playable Nightfarers to players to try out, two new bosses that FromSoftware is currently being quite tight-lipped about, and what sounds like a new area to explore within Limveld.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Elden Ring Nightreign The Forsaken Hollows - Gameplay Reveal Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d7GO1FjenwI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The two new Nightfarers are called the Scholar and the Undertaker. The Scholar is described as "<em>boasting impressive arcane levels,</em>" and gains "<em>incredible advantages through battlefield observation</em>," while the Undertaker features "<em>impressive strength and faith</em>."</p>



<p>It's not exactly an in-depth description of either character's kit, but it's seemingly all we get for now. We'll definitely learn more the closer we get to the DLC's launch.</p>



<p>As far as the new bosses, all FromSoftware marketing representative Miku Watanabe has to say in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/11/elden-ring-nightreign-the-forsaken-hollows-dlc-launches-dec-4-on-ps5-ps4/">PlayStation Blog post</a> is: "<em>Players will confront two new bosses tormenting Limveld</em>." So, it seems like the new bosses also go in the category of, 'things we'll learn about later.'</p>



<p>Lastly, the DLC also adds The Great Hollow, a hole that has opened up in Limveld that players will get to explore in the new DLC, described as a place that is "<em>strewn with exotic ruins and temples; sacred towers denoting the remains of an ancient people; and crystals that exude a cursed, life-draining miasma</em>."</p>



<p>The DLC will be available for $15 USD, though if you purchased the Deluxe Edition of Nightreign, then you'll just get the DLC added to your library when it arrives on December 4, 2025. Hopefully, we won't have to wait too long to learn more about the DLC.</p>

<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is getting a new expansion, titled The Forsaken Hollows, and it’s coming in less than a month. The reveal, as well as a new trailer, premiered at the State of Play Japan.</p>







<p>In 2022, Elden Ring seemingly took over the world, becoming one of the most popular games that year. It’s intense Soulsborne combat and great graphics made it many outlets’ Game of the Year winner. Even it’s DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree, was up for some year-end awards. Fortunately, a new multiplayer entry, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-everdark-sovereign-roadmap-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>, came out earlier in 2025 and crafted a more focused yet fun experience. Now, we have a look at some new content coming to the game.</p>
