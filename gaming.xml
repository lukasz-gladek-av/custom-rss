<p>But producer Kensuke Tanabe decided against it</p>

<figure data-uuid="359443003808c"><a title="Metroid Prime Remastered" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/359443003808c/metroid-prime-remastered.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo is shortly launched <strong>Metroid Prime 1-3: A Visual Retrospective</strong>, a new art book looking at concept art for the original trilogy on GameCube and Wii (with a small section dedicated to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a>).</p>
<p>Speaking of the more recent Switch remaster, the book reveals that Retro Studios had originally proposed completely new cutscenes for the game. However, in a producer's note, Kensuke Tanabe confirmed that he opted against this approach.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"When the project first started, Retro proposed an idea regarding cutscenes – that we create entirely new ones. The prototype cutscene they presented was undeniably impressive, with a high level of quality.</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="FsuAt4uVyTk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FsuAt4uVyTk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FsuAt4uVyTk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FsuAt4uVyTk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4022bdxqojnr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div><blockquote>
<p>"However, I came to the decision to closely observe the cutscenes from the GameCube version and replicate them essentially as they were. The reason for this choice was that the cutscenes were not created solely for dramatic effect; they also played a role in conveying gameplay-relevant information to the player. Each scene was carefully crafted with this purpose in mind. Retro demonstrated exceptional professionalism and fully adhered to this direction."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting, huh? It's hard to imagine what this cutscene prototype might have looked like, but our assumption is that it might have been something akin to Halo 2: Anniversary. That game, remastered by Halo Studios (then 343 Industries) took the original Bungie-created cutscenes and revamped them from the ground up.</p>
<p>Still, we fully understand Tanabe's reasoning here. The cutscenes do provide a lot of information to the player regarding gameplay mechanics, so we can't be too mad. The final product looks pretty amazing as it is, after all!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As 2025 approaches its final months, AI becomes more and more a subject of discussion across all industries, including game development. The games industry has long utilized artificial intelligence to populate its virtual worlds. Still, with the veritable explosion of generative AI in the last few years and the concurrent ballooning of game budgets and development timelines, some developers have been exploring whether it could be used to reduce costs and production time.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/starfinder-afterlight-qa-even-after-bg3-not-many-are-jumping-into-crpgs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In our most recent interview with independent developer Epictellers Entertainment</a> about their upcoming cRPG Starfinder: Afterlight, we asked the Spanish team their opinion on the thorny matter. CEO and co-founder Richard Pillosu was crystal-clear: he'd like AI to help him with daily tasks around the house, but he doesn't really want it to touch any creative areas.</p>



<p><em>The problem with AI is that AI should be doing the things that we don't want to do, and it seems that it wants to do the things that we want to do. We want to do games. We want to invent characters. We want to invent worlds. We want to draw them. We want to invent them for that. Why? We don't want AI for that. I mean, this is the fun part of video game development. I would like an AI that does my dishes and cleans my apartment. Then I can stay creative. But we don't have the AI for that. It seems that the AI that we are being pushed into is the AI that removes this kind of creativity. So, no, no. We could be doing other stuff, but we jumped into making games because we truly love inventing those things and seeing how we connect those things. There is no point in using AI for any creative endeavor. So, no, we don't like it.</em></p>



<p>Famous video game designer and director Hideo Kojima <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-sees-creating-together-with-ai-way-stay-one-step-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently shared his own take on AI</a>, calling it 'a friend' that will help him stay ahead. However, he also noted that he wants AI to do the menial tasks while he focuses on the creative part, so in that regard, he is aligned with Pillosu.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/discussing-ghost-of-yoteis-lord-saito-with-actor-feodor-chin-he-and-atsu-are-really-two-sides-of-the-same-coin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we interviewed actor Feodor Chin</a>, too, who provided a similar take from his point of view:</p>



<p><em>I think, like with any technology, there is a place for AI as a tool, but I don't think it should ever be a replacement for human beings.</em></p>



<p>Will the games industry be able to use the latest advancements in artificial intelligence to allow humans to give their best creatively without replacing jobs? That remains to be seen, but we'll continue to gauge the opinions within the industry and the various implementations of the development studios.</p>

            <p>
Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair used its newfound success to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworlds-creators-are-paying-the-kenzera-devs-to-make-a-horror-game-about-the-entertainment-industry">start a publishing arm</a>. This, I think, is generally a net good, even if I have some feelings about the studio as a whole, which we'll dig into shortly. Nobody has money in this industry except for the few who do, so when a few of the few who do decide to put some of that money into much smaller games, that is somewhat of a win. But heed this warning from Pocketpair's communications director and publishing manager John Buckley: they won't publish your game if you use generative AI.
</p>
<p>
Buckley recently spoke with <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-we-don-t-believe-in-it-palworld-maker-pocketpair-wont-be-publishing-games-that-use-generative-ai">Game Developer</a>, saying that he just "doesn't believe" in AI as a technology. Worth noting is that many often accuse Pocketpair of using the stuff in Palworld, a point Buckley does acknowledge: "People are going to say I'm lying, but these are just the hard facts. We don't believe in it. We're very upfront about it. If you're big on AI stuff or your game is Web3 or uses NFTs, there are lots of publishers out there [who'll talk to you], but we're not the right partner for that."
</p>
<p>
Buckley does also know we're seeing more and more games releasing on Steam that he describes as "low quality, AI-made," but to counteract that he thinks "think we're going to enter this kind of authenticity market where people are going to slowly say 'no, these guys are really trying to make something special' to fight back."
</p>
<p>
I do think it's worth highlighting the slight bit of irony here. The quality of Palworld notwithstanding, it is incredibly hard to argue that it doesn't harbour similar issues that AI has. Many of the Pal designs are a regurgitation of various Pokemon designs, but worse, or even more crude, removing them from their original contexts, or assigning them new ones that don't make much sense.
</p><p>
I'm not exactly thrilled that one of the poster creatures, that big yellow guy you can see up in the featured image, is essentially My Neighbour Totoro's titular beastie but with a gatling gun, personally. Everyone knows how anti-war Hayao Miyazaki is! It genuinely is great to hear a studio like Pocketpair, which has the financial capability to back other, smaller independent games, take a stance against AI. I just also hope that they look at the tech steadily encroaching on the games industry, and think about the ways they might perpetuate its aesthetic sensibilities.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-steam-record-login-queue-multiplayer-download-issue-2000634042">Battlefield 6</a>‘</em>s first season launches soon across consoles and PC, and it promises new maps, modes, vehicles, and weapons. I was recently invited to check out some of this new content ahead of next week’s release. If you’ve been wanting a new, giant map, this season will give you that. Eventually.</p> <p>Season one of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> launches on October 28 and brings with it a lot of new and completely free content. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-two-new-maps-modes-roadmap-free-updates-dlc-2025-ea-2000630301">As outlined in EA’s previously released roadmap</a>, <em>BF6</em>‘s first season (and all future seasons) will be split into multiple phases with different themes and battle passes. Season one’s first phase is titled “Rogue Ops” and will add three new weapons, a new armored APC, a new mode, and, perhaps most excitingly for fans, a new map.</p>

 <p>Earlier this week, EA and Battlefield Studios held an hour-long preview session for <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/22/battlefield-6-season-1-first-details-and-hands-on-report/"><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s upcoming first season</a>. In this preview, we were able to go hands-on with the content being added in Rogue Ops, as well as some of the content coming in phase two of season one. I played a few matches of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reverts-conquest-ticket-change-48-hours-angry-backlash-2000636658">Conquest</a> on the first new map coming this season, Blackwell Fields, and came away unsure of it, but then played Eastwood, which will be added later, and had a fantastic time.</p>

  <h2><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s first new map is just fine</h2> <p>The new map, which is located in an oil field in California, doesn’t feel very big. It’s also a very empty and sparse map, with rolling hills often being the only cover you can hope for when crossing the map to reach a new area. Snipers and aircraft were extremely deadly on this map, and I often found myself frustrated by how much the infantry was at a disadvantage. The map just feels too barren and small to support a mode like Conquest. Perhaps with more time, I’ll learn to love Blackwell Fields, but for now, I’m lukewarm on the map. At the very least, it’s a very pretty map as the sun is setting during your fight, leading to some gorgeous colors and shadows.</p>

 <p>While checking out the new map, I played around with the new armored APC, the Traverser Mk. 2. This vehicle came in handy on Blackwell Fields as it provides a safe way for soldiers to get around the battlefield quickly, is packed with mounted weapons, and can even support an integrated med bay to heal allies who hop in. The new APC is such a perfect fit for <em>BF6</em>, offering something more powerful than a jeep, but less bulky than a tank, that I’m a bit shocked it didn’t ship with the game earlier this month.</p>

 <p>I also checked out the new weapons. The new Glock pistol is fine, but who really cares about a pistol in <em>Battlefield 6</em>? That’s just the gun you pull out when you are desperate or need to complete a daily challenge. The other two new weapons are the SOR-300C carbine and the Mini Fix sniper rifle.</p>

 <p>I played a lot of the preview with the carbine, and I’m still not sure if it will dethrone the M4, but I did enjoy it. Its slower rate of fire and heavier-hitting bullets make it feel more like an assault rifle than a carbine, and it can hold its own in midrange fights. However, in close-quarters combat, I felt like SMGs and faster-firing carbines often beat me in one-on-one fights. Meanwhile, the Mini Fix sniper rifle seems like it might become the rifle of choice for recon players as it hits hard, fires fast, and is extremely accurate. In the hands of a skilled sniper, this might be too powerful. I could see EA nerfing it a tad in a future update. We’ll have to wait and see how things shake out.</p>

 <p>The other bit of Rogue Ops I played during the preview was Strikepoint, a 4v4 mode king-of-the-hill-like mode with limited respawning. It’s…certainly a new game mode. I just don’t understand why<a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190"> EA and Battlefield Studios</a> continue to spend so much time and energy on these tiny, tactical modes. <em>Battlefield</em> is all about big moments, chaotic warfare, and silly moments involving tanks, choppers, bombs, and more.</p> <h2>Eastwood is a new map that people are going to love</h2> <p>The best part of the preview was when I got to play the other new map, Eastwood. This map is set in a rich Southern California suburb, complete with McMansions, pools, and even a golf course nearby with drivable golf carts. This map felt very big, is filled with vehicles, and has plenty of houses and buildings for infantry to duck into during more explosive or dangerous moments. After playing it for just an hour or so, I quickly fell in love with it and can’t wait to play more. Sadly, this map won’t be added to the game until phase two of the first season, which launches on November 18.</p> <p>I personally would have led with Eastwood as the first new map added to <em>BF6</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bigger-maps-leak-datamine-eastwood-mirak-ea-bf-labs-2000618202">as it seems to offer the giant, vehicle-filled chaos that some fans believe the new entry lacks.</a> It’s also just a visually distinct, super memorable, and fantastic map with lots of places to fight and wild moments to get involved in. At one point during the preview, some folks from both teams orchestrated a golf cart race. Well, they tried. A helicopter pilot flew by and wiped out some of the racers. Another great moment involved a tank crashing through the large mansion I was hiding in and then getting trapped in the backyard pool, letting me destroy it with some rockets. No idea why EA isn’t shipping this map first, but at least we all have something to look forward to next month.</p> <p>After playing a lot of season one’s new content, I came away excited for<em> Battlefield 6</em>‘s future, even if some of the new content<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->like the new tiny modes and boring pistol<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->don’t do much for me. I’m just happy to see that so soon after launch, EA has big plans and new stuff for its popular online shooter. And if future maps can be as great as Eastwood, I think the next year for <em>Battlefield 6</em> will be a good one. And who knows, maybe I’ll end up liking Blackwell Fields eventually.<em>&nbsp;Battlefield 6</em> is out now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Season one launches on October 28 on all platforms.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s free update time for <i>No Man’s Sky</i> again. Keep your wallet in your back pocket or purse, because Hello Games just shipped “Breach” which, among other things, allows you to harvest materials from stranded shipwrecks out there in the infinity of simulated space.</p> <p>Announced via a <a href="https://youtu.be/eNaY10DQkJw">brisk 51-second trailer on YouTube</a>, “<a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2025/10/expedition-twenty-breach/">Breach</a>” is the latest free <i>NMS</i> update from developer Hello Games. The update boasts a new expedition as well as the introduction of drifting space wrecks from which you can salvage new ship parts. It feels like a subtle update in some ways, but one that builds well on the foundations laid in <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-6-0-star-trek-mass-effect-2000620674">the previous update, Voyagers,</a> which included epic <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-corvette-ship-build-voyagers-update-star-wars-2000630689">custom ship build options</a> and the ability to spacewalk.</p>

  <p>As always, the new update’s release followed a trail of cryptic tweets from managing director Sean Murray, this time with a series of closed-door emoji. It naturally sent the community into a frenzy of speculation.</p>

   <p>Unfortunately for those on the r/LightNoFireHelloGames subreddit, which is dedicated to the studio’s upcoming <a href="https://youtu.be/jKQem4Z6ioQ">full-scale planet sim</a>, the doors had nothing to with <i>Light No Fire</i>. Some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LightNoFireHelloGames/comments/1o9grvf/guys_guys_this_is_it/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">folks had speculated that the door</a> was a reference to the band The Doors who have a song called “Light My Fire.” Things are desperate over there, ya’ll.</p>

   <p>Sorry, guys. That wasn’t it.</p> <h2>Also, check out these awesome user-made ships</h2> <p>Look, I’m probably not gonna get away with writing a “15 Awesome Ship Builds” showcase every week, much as I would like to. But I see so much cool shit coming out of the <i>NMS</i> community that I just have to share this stuff with you.</p>

 <p>Here’s the complete Death Star build I <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-death-star-star-wars-2000635367">told ya’ll about last week</a>. Too sick:</p>   <p>This “Venator Class Star Destroyer” looks clean and awesome:</p>   <p>This mod-free build is a whole damn natural wildlife habitat just cruising through space like it’s no big deal.</p>

   <p>Fancy a solid X-Wing build?</p>   <p>Or how about an original build inspired by <i>Star Wars</i>’ weathered space junk aesthetic?</p>   <p>A’right, that’s enough outta me. If you spot something cool in this game, please don’t hesitate to shoot me an email at cjackson [at] kotaku [dot] com. Safe travels out there!</p>

This big expansion, due out in December, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/walton-goggins-is-set-to-play-the-ghoul-from-the-fallout-tv-show-in-fallout-76-but-how-does-the-character-fit-in-the-fallout-76-timeline">sees Walton Goggins reprise his fan-favorite role as The Ghoul from the Fallout TV show</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fallout Shelter is also mentioned, as is Fallout 4 and Creations, which suggests the decade old role-playing game will get some new content soon. Creations are community created mods released officially for Bethesda’s video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, there are new merch drops, community in-person events, and a post-show celebrating the community. There is no specific mention of the Fallout TV show, either. Season 2 is due out in December.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is no mention of any Fallout remaster, either. There are all sorts of rumors floating around about potential Fallout remakes now that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is out the door (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-fallout-3-remaster-and-more-leaked-from-microsoft-document"><u>Fallout 3 Remastered was leaked back in 2023</u></a>, but those plans may have changed). And we know Bethesda plans to eventually get to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-5"><u>Fallout 5</u></a>, albeit after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">October 23, 2077 is of course the day in the Fallout timeline the bombs fell, sparking The Great War that caused the irradiated wasteland fans of the franchise have been playing in over the last few decades.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fallout Season 2: Who's Confirmed to Return and Who's New?</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The last we heard on Fallout 5, by the way, was back in June 2024, when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-doesnt-feel-the-need-to-rush-fallout-5-in-the-wake-of-tv-shows-success"><u>Bethesda Softworks head Todd Howard said he wasn’t interested in rushing it out the door</u></a>. Howard opened up about the future of the hit post-apocalyptic RPG series during <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?si=Ua6SywsuPtdIr0yv" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an interview with YouTube content creator MrMattyPlays</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For other Fallout games in the future, you know, obviously I can’t talk about those right now, but I would say, sort of rushing through them, or we kind of need to get stuff out that is different than the work we’re doing in 76… we don’t feel like we need to rush any of that," he said. "The Fallout TV show fills a certain niche in terms of the franchise and storytelling."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last mainline Fallout game was Fallout 4, which was released in 2015. DLC content for the entry was steadily released for PC and consoles over the next year, and in 2018, Bethesda launched its multiplayer-centered offshoot, Fallout 76. While fans slowly flocked to the West Virginia-set open-world RPG, it wasn’t until the premiere of Prime Video’s Fallout TV show that the Bethesda series leveled up in terms of attention.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Howard wouldn't budge when it came to desires for a substantial video game release. For him, it comes down to wanting to treat Bethesda's franchises with care.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Totally get the desire for a new kind of mainline single-player game," he said. "And look, those things take time. I don’t think it’s bad for people to miss things. We just want to get it right and make sure that everything we’re doing in a franchise, whether it’s Elder Scrolls, Fallout, or now Starfield, that those become meaningful moments for everybody who loved these franchises as much as we do."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

<p>Fans have been speculating about the prospect of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime_2_echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a> remaster/remake for quite some time now, and interestingly, the book actually somehow teases and debunks such a concept in one go.</p>
<p>The following quote from Tanabe regarding Echoes' multiplayer mode seemingly confirms that a remake isn't in development, and nor is it currently being planned.

<p>"Retro completed the multiplayer mode without compromising on quality even under such challenging conditions.

<p>Gosh, who knows... Either way, it's seems likely at this point that we won't be seeing anything of the sort until well after the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, which drops on <strong>4th December 2025</strong>.</p>

			<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion, the latest beat-em-up game from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tmnt-shredders-revenge-the-reason-online-netcode-is-important/">TMNT: Shredder's Revenge</a> developer, Tribute Games, and publisher Dotemu, finally has a release date after its reveal at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/">Summer Game Fest </a>earlier this year. It'll arrive on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2, on December 1, 2025.</p>



<p>The news came with a new release date trailer showing off more of Tribute Games' pixel art and the classic gameplay beat-em-up fans love, while also showcasing some of the 15 playable heroes that'll be in the game when it arrives.</p>



<p>Specifically, the trailer revealed Phoenix and Iron Man as playable characters joining the roster. The rest of the playable characters include Wolverine, Spider-Man, Storm, Captain America, Phyla-Vell, Venom, Nova, She-Hulk, Rocket Raccoon, Silver Surfer, Beta Ray Bill, Black Panther, and Cosmic Ghost Rider.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="MARVEL Cosmic Invasion | Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/itVLfmX3Ts8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Marvel Cosmic Invasion is a classic beat-em-up style game with a few unique twists, including Tribute Games' Cosmic Swap system, where you'll switch between two characters while playing to address whatever the situation in front of you calls for, making use of one character's abilities over another when they're better suited for the fight.</p>



<p>There's also plenty of upgrades to use, and with the roster of 15 characters, plenty of ways to mix-and-match characters to suit your own playstyle. </p>



<p>Tribute Games has made a name for itself as the studio to follow if you like good beat-em-up games, and there's no sign that this will be anything less than the quality the studio has already delivered with previous titles, specifically TMNT: Shredder's Revenge.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Dotemu and developer Tribute Games have announced the release date for their upcoming star-studded superhero brawler&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>, and it won't be long before you get to check it out.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release,&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em>, which was first announced as part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-march-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Direct show earlier this year</a>, will be launching across PC and consoles on December 1st.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the two studios have also announced the two final characters to round out the game's 15-fighter-strong roster: Phoenix and Invincible Iron Man. They join a lineup that also includes iconic characters like Venom, Spider-Man, Storm, and Wolverine.</p>

<p>Published by&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/absolum-200k-sales" rel="nofollow"><em>Absolum&nbsp;</em>outfit Dotemu</a>,&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion&nbsp;</em>sees Marvel heroes banding together to fight the villainous Annihilus (the clue's in the name, I suppose), who's "launched an unprecedented attack across the galaxy".</p>

<p>You'll choose a team of two Marvel heroes, swapping between them as necessary and creating "unique team-ups" to deal "devastating damage" to your foes.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion&nbsp;</em>supports co-op play for up to four players, and you can play either locally or online. Drop-in-drop-out co-op is supported as well, so if you can't enjoy the entire adventure alongside the same people, it's no big deal.</p>




<p>Each player chooses their own team of two heroes, too, so you may well have up to eight heroes battling through the streets of New York towards the sinister-sounding Negative Zone to defeat Annihilus.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion&nbsp;</em>launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2753970/MARVEL_Cosmic_Invasion/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012545" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marvel-cosmic-invasion/9n79tqtztqq4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch (although not for Switch 2, it seems) on December 1st. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-2-roadmap</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/powerwash-simulator-2-roadmap-promises-new-crossover-dlc-and-more.1331857/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>FuturLab has revealed the first&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>roadmap, and if you're a fan of the franchise's crossover DLC, then you'll be pleased by what's in store for the next year or so.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2968420/view/517476466977407328" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on Steam,&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>has three packs of "paid IP DLC" on the way, with one due to launch in each of the first three quarters of 2026.</p>

<p>It's not clear which IPs these DLCs will revolve around, but&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator&nbsp;</em>has teamed up with some pretty big names in the past, including&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-final-fantasy-vii-crossover-dlc-arrives-in-march" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-warhammer-40k-dlc" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-back-to-future-dlc" rel="nofollow"><em>Back to the Future</em></a>, plus more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-roadmap-40k-dlc-powerwash-1.jpg?itok=15E-Pn14 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-roadmap-40k-dlc-powerwash-1.jpg?itok=GhDEZQ8N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Will&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>'s "IP DLC" be as big as its&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>collaboration?</figcaption></figure><p>The paid DLC packs will be arriving in conjunction with a host of free content, including three jobs forming part of the game's "Caldera Chronicles" series, as well as plenty of new features, bug fixes, and quality-of-life improvements.</p>

<p>FuturLab says that for the rest of the year, it's focusing on these fixes and QOL improvements, and that its top priority at the moment is to "get key bindings back into the game", so hopefully, your&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>experience should improve soon.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>, it's the sequel to the original&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator</em>, offering much the same gameplay experience as its predecessor (albeit with some extra bells and whistles to make things more exciting).</p>

<p>You'll once again be let loose on a variety of filthy environments and asked to clean them with your power washer, but you've also got access to new tools like an abseiling rig, a powerful new surface cleaner, and a cherry picker.</p>




<p><em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2968420/PowerWash_Simulator_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10011314" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/powerwash-simulator-2/9p45ggdtfnsm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/powerwash-simulator-2-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A recent Steam port of 2006 action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>Scarface: The World Is Yours&nbsp;</em>has been taken down by publisher EC Digital owing to what the studio describes as "unexpected complications and concerns".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/4113570/discussions/0/594037660640685944/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, EC Digital says that "certain builds" of the game were released on "other platforms", and that this release was "unintended", so the studio feels it's "necessary to pause and reevaluate" with regards to&nbsp;<em>Scarface: The World Is Yours</em>' re-release.</p>

<p>Apparently, the Steam page for the game was "initially intended as a placeholder" while EC Digital worked through what it calls "ongoing licensing and technical matters". The company also points to something it mysteriously calls "urgent discussions with multiple parties concerning the project's status".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/scarface-the-world-is-yours-steam-boat.jpg?itok=DsZhJVwa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/scarface-the-world-is-yours-steam-boat.jpg?itok=c7TamcIB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The recent Steam re-release of&nbsp;<em>Scarface: The World Is Yours&nbsp;</em>was an error, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>Rather confusingly, the game remains available via the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/scarface-the-world-is-yours-7c3e6f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a>, which is presumably one of the "other platforms" on which its release caused this trouble in the first place. It's not clear why the game has been removed from Steam, but not from Epic.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/19-years-later-scarface-game-mysteriously-resurfaces-on-steam-and-epic-but-not-for-long-weve-recently-entered-urgent-discussions-with-multiple-parties-concerning-the-projects-status/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GamesRadar</a>, however, the re-release of&nbsp;<em>Scarface: The World Is Yours&nbsp;</em>contains two mods created by community members, both of which are intended to enhance the original Windows version and make it playable on modern systems.</p>

<p>One of the modders, Silent, who created the eponymous SilentPatch, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:x6zaxkp46jrfqieaczwuc4il/post/3m3rcwjmhps2b" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a> they weren't contacted about&nbsp;<em>Scarface: The World Is Yours</em>' re-release on PC.</p>

<p>The author of FusionFix, the other mod included in this re-release, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cookieplmonster.bsky.social/post/3m3rv3y5bqs2r" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">was contacted</a>, but&nbsp;Silent says it's unlikely the original&nbsp;<em>Scarface&nbsp;</em>IP holders are aware of this new version. In short, this seems like a pretty big mess, and I'd be amazed if the game re-appears on PC storefronts following this debacle.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/scarface-the-world-is-yours-steam-car.jpg?itok=LlSVbCTa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/scarface-the-world-is-yours-steam-car.jpg?itok=QttEYXfq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new PC port of&nbsp;<em>Scarface: The World Is Yours&nbsp;</em>is suspicious, to say the least.</figcaption></figure><p>EC Digital doesn't appear to have any other games published under its name on Steam, so I think it's fair to say this re-release is suspect, to say the least. It sounds as though the publisher may not have acquired the appropriate licenses or talked to the right people before going ahead with this.</p>

<p>In any case, if you do want to check out this PC port of&nbsp;<em>Scarface: The World Is Yours</em>...well, it's technically available via the Epic Games Store, but I'd save my money and wait for more concrete confirmation of the port's legitimacy if I were you.</p>

            <p>If the interstellar equivalent of scrabbling around under the sofa for loose change or dragging a slightly rusty bumper out of a scrapyard is something you yearn for, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a>'s latest update sounds right up your slightly grimy alley. It's dubbed Breach and adds in a bunch of mysterious shipwrecks to strip for new parts you can then glue to your own vessel. High stakes recycling, basically.</p>

<p>"In Breach, players will traverse a desolate and abandoned universe and on their travels encounter the abandoned remains of ill-fated corvette ships, all ripe for scavenging ship modules to add to your corvette-building arsenal, read the <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2025/10/expedition-twenty-breach/">update's notes</a>. "Excavating these wrecks will yield an array of corvette pieces including rare vertical parts which unlock a whole new range of build configurations for the more creative designers." Some Atlas-themed bits are also out there for you to ping off with your laser and pocket.</p>
<p>As usual with these free updates to the space sim, there's a limited-time expedition to head out on. it looks to revolve around a the wreck of the Fireship Arcadia, with a trip to the edge of space and some general mysteriousness teased. "Many such wrecks have begun to appear throughout the far reaches of space, and there are rewards for the bravest of Travellers prepared to scavenge from them, including new vertical and structural parts which allow players to build colossal ships and rare, glowing Atlas-themed wings, engines and features," the notes say.</p><p>For those keen to know exactly what sorts of extra ship bits have been added in as par of this broadening of ship building horizons, Hello Games list landing gear, shields, weapons, and connectors, plus some "highly-requested wedge-shaped modules" so people can get a bit artsy with their builds. I assume by making ships shaped like wedges of cheese. They'd better add in moons made of cheese next, so I can do the dairy double and make Wallace of 'and Gromit' fame proud.</p>
<p>No Man's Sky's Breach update is out now. We've got you covered if you're thinking of hopping in for the first time in a while and so need quick refreshers as to what the long-running space explorer's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-mans-skys-voyagers-update-adds-in-big-custom-ships-crewed-by-you-and-your-mates">last</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-mans-skys-latest-big-update-that-is-somehow-also-free-will-let-you-become-a-mayor-of-all-things">couple</a> of updates have included.</p>

              <p><span>Netflix is still playing catch-up after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-streaming-box-office-numbers-netflix-2000622381"><span>the runaway success</span></a><span> of its animated musical </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>, and that means a lot of the merchandising and collaboration deals that should probably have been in the works a long time ago are still trickling in. We’ve gotten </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-fortnite-rei-ami-stream-zoey-rumi-2000632536"><span>a </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>crossover</span></a><span>, cast </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-tonight-show-golden-performance-ejae-2000633180"><span>appearances on late-night</span></a><span>, and a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-singalong-box-office-showtimes-songs-2000620026"><span>limited theatrical run</span></a><span> for people to sing along to all the movie’s bangers. But now, some of the bigger toy manufacturers want in on that Huntr/x hysteria, including Hasbro.

The announcement goes on to say that Hasbro is working on “dolls, action figures, accessories, collectibles, playsets, [and] collaborations with co-brands.” That last one is interesting, considering Hasbro also notes a few of its brands, and says it will be “leveraging the strength of its iconic portfolio” for more </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>products. That portfolio includes Hasbro Games (which is making a </span><i><span>Monopoly</span></i><span> board game featuring the characters and iconography from the film), Wizards of the Coast, Nerf, and…Furby. Pushing the image of a Rumi-themed Furby from my mind with the strength of the Honmoon, the brand that is the most interesting in that line-up is Wizards of the Coast, the company behind </span><i><span>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Magic: The Gathering</span></i><span>. The trading card game has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313"><span>essentially become </span><i><span>Fortnite: The Card Game</span></i></a> <span>with its myriad crossovers and collaborations bringing characters and artwork from properties like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-magic-gathering-secret-lair-card-pre-order-drop-1851786245"><i><span>Sonic</span></i></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-playstation-last-of-us-god-of-war-ellie-2000629350"><span>PlayStation Studios’ portfolio</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-mtg-magic-gathering-vivi-stock-1851786817"><i><span>Final Fantasy</span></i></a><span> to its booster packs.</span></p> <p><span>While the actual </span><i><span>Magic: The Gathering </span></i><span>community is pretty split on WOTC’s focus on crossovers, people who don’t play the game, like myself, are more likely to get in a digital queue for a Secret Lair drop if it has characters we know. I have the Shadow the Hedgehog card sitting on my shelf right now. Would I throw down some cash for cards of my demon-slaying queens? Yeah, fucking probably. I played </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>for the first time so I could skydive to “How It’s Done” and headshot some fools. You think I won’t pay money for a high-quality card? I’m a mark. I can complain about the crossover slop all day, but I’m just as bad as anyone. I’ll clap and cheer for cards with bespoke holographic patterns made to look like the Honmoon. You think you’re better than me?

<h2 id="h-what-is-wordle">What Is Wordle?</h2>



<p>Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game tasks players with guessing a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

Set in a mysterious egg-shaped world that’s slowly falling apart, players customize their own duck and set out to escape the planet by crafting a rocket ship. Combined with base-building, weapon customization, and in-depth progression systems, it offers high replayability that will keep players coming back for more.﻿</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/escape-from-duckov-sales-top-one-million]]></content:encoded>

<figure data-uuid="b99caebd7a8e5"><a title="maiden of black water 10th anniversary" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b99caebd7a8e5/maiden-of-black-water-10th-anniversary.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Koei Tecmo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Of all the horror franchises I've subjected myself to over the years, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fatal-frame-2-crimson-butterfly-remake">Fatal Frame</a> is the one that sticks in my mind most as properly, actually, scary. It's the answer I'll give every single time to the question of what game series has scared me the most, and it's all down to one very simple reason.</p>
<p>As today is the 10th anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu-eshop/fatal_frame_maiden_of_black_water">Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water</a>'s release in the US, I've been pondering over the series, and in particular its signature camera obscura mechanic. You know, the part that asks you to face your fears, to walk towards the cold spot in the haunted mansion, to enter room 237 of the hotel, and then stay there to take pictures. It's the exact opposite of what my body and brain are telling me to do, messing with my fight or flight response (my doctor says I've got a flight or flight response, to be honest). It gets me every time.</p><div><figure data-videoid="0-dtwj-vs8Q" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0-dtwj-vs8Q?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0-dtwj-vs8Q?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0-dtwj-vs8Q?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4023a9tqlxyk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>I was a latecomer to this particular franchise; I first tried it in the form of a downloaded fan translation of the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/fatal_frame_iv">Fatal Frame 4: Mask of the Lunar Eclipse</a>, but I'd developed an opinion before playing (never a good idea!) based off other people's complaints. And, settling into it on Wii with its motion control awkwardness, I found myself taken aback. "The clunkiness is part of the charm!" I may have exclaimed to myself. Just like the original <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/resident_evil">Resident Evil's</a> clunkfest of a setup, the slow to the point of frustration way in which your character moves and controls makes everything even more terrifying. The one complaint I'd heard was something that made it all the more special to me.</p>

<p>So, naturally, I was pretty psyched for Maiden of Black Water; it was my first fully translated experience of this series when it released back in 2015. And it absolutely lived up to everything I wanted and expected from it, whilst once again being...well...being itself. How about we put it that way?</p>
<p>It's still clunky, it's still slow - heck, even the snazzy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fatal_frame_maiden_of_black_water">2021 revamp</a> (which is the version you should 100% play today) remains a stodgy sort of deal, a fact that's cemented it as purposeful in my mind. It's a design decision and they'll never fix it. So all of your complaints about it are null and void to me. Sorry!</p>
<p>In Maiden of Black Water, you're on an absolutely grim trip that splits the action across three interesting protagonists. Each of these leads has a different angle and reasoning for taking their trip to the godawful and miserable Hikami Mountain, which has all the suicide tales, lost souls and dank fog you could ever want. Honestly, fog fanatics will come away satisfied here.</p>

<p>I won't spoil any of the story, but Black Water, as with the rest of the series, has its whole <strong>Ringu</strong> vibe nailed down, and it proceeds to barrel headlong into the most harrowing of back-stories and reasonings for protagonist motivations. You've really gotta beware of that with all these games though, they never hold back, especially when it comes to stuff like suicide. Black Water then adds a new nastiness via a water mechanic that sees you need to stay dry, lest you become afflicted with a curse.</p>
<p>The inherent clunkiness, combined with the utterly relentless bleakness of the mountain setting, make for the perfect place to start scaring the pants off people by having them take out their camera and go looking for trouble in rigidly structured areas of exploration. You know how this part works; use your camera obscura, which is unwieldy and slow to reload as it pops you into first person (it also requires different types of films for different ghouls), and snap a variety of perfectly horrific Japanese ghosts.</p>
<p>The designs of the spirits here are, and always have been, a high point, they're exactly the sort of real-world traditional Japanese style of nightmare fuel that you never, ever want to see, the sort of thing that turns you into a human portaloo in an instant. And instead of having a toilet, you need to stand your ground, get your proper film loaded and snap, or shoot, in such a way that the spirit disperses. It is intense. It gets me every time.</p>
<p>Today, I find myself as eager as ever for more Fatal Frame. I need more of its specific style of clunkiness, more of its terrible haunted locations, and more of those absolutely horrifying ghoul designs.</p>

<p>The 2021 version, which translates its Wii U controller aspects neatly to the console, does a nice job in giving the whole thing a bit of a lift, and the episodic nature of the campaign's brisk 13 hour campaign means that this is one of those lovely things that you can dip into for a bit, make some progress, best a ranking, or whatever suits your fancy.</p>
<p>Honestly, with Halloween coming up, Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water, if you can swerve the spoilers and embrace the clunk, is well worth your time. Just bring a spare pair of pants.</p>
<p>Oh, and before you go, if you've played them, why not let us know which of the Fatal Frame games is your favourite in this quick and handy poll!</p>

			<p>Major news is brewing for Bandai Namco's JRPG series, Tales, confirming several new projects and providing updates on its next mainline entry.</p>



<h2 id="h-more-tales-series-remasters-are-on-the-way">More Tales Series Remasters Are On The Way</h2>



<p>As reported by <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" href="https://ryokutya2089.com/archives/92001">Ryokutya2089</a>, ahead of the launch of Tales of Xillia Remastered, which will launch on October 30 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch, series producer Yusuke Tomizawa spoke with Famitsu about the series' future, starting with the future of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tales-of-series-remasters-consistently/">Remaster Project.</a></p>



<p>According to the producer, two titles are in development as part of the project, ranging from verification to the final stages of development. Thankfully, we won't have to wait much longer to know which entry in the series will get remastered next, as it will be revealed fairly soon.</p>



<p>In addition, Tomizawa-san confirmed to Famitsu that the Tales of Xillia 2 remaster is still in development. More information on the project will be revealed as soon as possible.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-new-entry-in-the-tales-series-is-still-away-from-reveal">The New Entry in the Tales series Is Still Away From Reveal</h2>



<p>Besides commenting on future series remasters, Tomizawa-san also briefly touched upon the next main entry in the series. This new game is still under development, but it will be a while before it's announced. </p>



<p>Compared to past console generations, where multiple entries in the series were announced and then released in Japan close to one another, this is a radically different approach. Hopefully, the long wait since <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/tales-of-arise-keeping-the-flame-alive/">Tales of Arise</a>, which launched back in 2021, will be worth it.</p>



<h2 id="h-most-of-the-series-audience-is-in-the-west">Most of the Series' Audience is in the West</h2>



<p>One interesting tidbit of information shared with Famitsu by Tomizawa-san is that most of the Tales series audience is in the West, over 70%. This is rather surprising, considering how the series was long neglected in North America and Europe with late releases and games that never made the jump.</p>



<p>Among these Japan-exclusive games are the 2D games Tales of Destiny remake and Tales of Rebirth, which are among the best entries in the series. Could either of these games be one of the remasters currently in the works?</p>



<p>Thankfully, those willing to go <span>the extra mile to play any of the Tales games that weren't released in the West via emulation have the chance to experience them in English. L</span>ast year, Life Bottle Productions released a <a href="https://wccftech.com/tales-of-rebirth-english-patch-download/">Tales of Rebirth English translation patch</a>&nbsp;that also adds new features such as subtitles for animated movies, battle subtitles, and more.</p>

            <p>
It's been more than a year since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria">The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria</a> first launched, and now it seems like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> crafting game's first proper expansion is right around the corner. Developer Free Range Games shared a new trailer yesterday, which was roughly Durin's Day, a rare Dwarven event in the world of Middle-earth, appropriately revealing the release date for said expansion, Durin's Folk.
</p>
<p>
It's less than a month out in fact, due to be released this coming November 18th, and while there are some details already available for the DLC, there's one slightly odd thing about it: there's no gameplay. There have been a <a href="https://www.returntomoria.com/news-updates/df-expeditions-economy">couple</a> of <a href="https://www.returntomoria.com/news-updates/durins-folk-whats-next">blog posts</a>, and even a <a href="https://youtu.be/bpO6AuqqmTw?si=Qgwy5d5bSR24cRc4">podcasty</a> thing all about it, the posts complete with screenshots, but there doesn't appear to be a lick of footage of the thing in motion. Perhaps a point to be concerned about when there's so little time until it arrives; I wouldn't be surprised if it's just not quite ready to be properly shown and the folks at the top of the food chain want a date out to meet some kind of internal target, but that's just conjecture.
</p>

<p>
Still, those details! On the story side of things, you'll be learning about Dwarves from the Fourth Age, and a new end-game story chapter will be there for you to play through. There'll also be NPCs you can rescue and recruit down in the mines, of whom will help you out in your settlement, becoming typically dwarvey things like blacksmiths and brewmasters.
</p><p>
There's some new procedurally generated dungeons to presumably mine and plunder, which can be done alone or in multiplayer. The expansion also lets you explore outside the mountain too, including Durin's Tower, and an area to build some big bases. Lastly, the end-game economy is getting an update, offering up new materials, items, and recipes to unlock lore and other bits.
</p>
<p>
Presumably at some point in the next few weeks a proper trailer will be shown off, but off not, I suppose you'll find out when The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria's Durin's Folk expansion launches on November 18th.

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-preview-beat-em-up-tribute-games-1851784757"><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em></a> has revealed its final two characters and its long-awaited release date. The comic book brawler arrives December 1 with Iron Man (Tony Stark) and Phoenix (Jean Grey) rounding out its roster of gorgeously pixel-art-animated superheroes.</p> <p>Dotemu released one last trailer to celebrate the impending launch which includes brief looks at the newly revealed additions and the gang fighting in front of a giant Master Mold Sentinel like the ’90s <em>X-Men</em> cartoon was turned into a <em>Mega Man X</em> spin-off.</p>

  <p>The full roster, for anyone who hasn’t been keeping track at home, includes the 15 following fighters:</p> <ul> <li>Beta Ray Bill</li> <li>Black Panther</li> <li>Captain America</li> <li>Cosmic Ghost Rider</li> <li>Nova</li> <li>Phyla-Vell</li> <li>Rocket Raccoon</li> <li>She-Hulk</li> <li>Spider-Man</li> <li>Storm</li> <li>Silver Surfer</li> <li>Venom</li> <li>Wolverine</li> <li>Iron Man</li> <li>Phoenix</li> </ul> <p>There’s a nice range of household names and Marvel back-benchers sporting a variety of different attack styles and abilities. That’s the one thing that the demo, <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-steam-demo-pc-console-2025-coolest-looking-game-2000630663">still free to try on Steam</a>, really drives home. Each of these characters plays surprisingly distinctly for a beat ’em up, especially when you account <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-hands-on-preview-mvc-impressions-2000614681">for mid-battle character switching and team-up attacks</a>.</p> <p><em>Marvel Cosmic</em> <em>Invasion</em> is coming to PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch 2, Switch 1, and PC. Is December 1 enough time for me to go back and Platinum the excellent<em> Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</em>? We’ll see.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Massive Entertainment, the Ubisoft subsidiary studio responsible for games such as The Division and Star Wars Outlaws, has announced that it is laying off a number of employees.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, the studio called it a “voluntary career transition program”.</p>



<p><strong>“As part of our ongoing evolution and long-term planning, we have recently realigned our teams and resources to strengthen our roadmap, ensuring our continued focus on The Division franchise and the technologies, including Snowdrop and Ubisoft Connect, that power our games,”</strong> <a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/1981020343587258732" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">they said.</a></p>



<p><strong>“To support this transition responsibly, we introduced a voluntary career transition program, giving eligible team members the opportunity to take their next career step on their own terms, supported by a comprehensive package that includes financial and career assistance.”</strong></p>



<p>Massive Entertainment says that it “remains fully committed to our roadmap and to creating great experiences for players around the world, including The Division 2, The Division 2: Survivors, The Division Resurgence, and The Division 3. These projects continue with strength, focus, and ambition, and we look forward to sharing more in the future.”</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.lefigaro.fr/medias/les-reductions-d-effectifs-chez-ubisoft-touchent-le-studio-derriere-le-jeu-video-star-wars-outlaws-20251022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">French newspaper Le Figaro</a> (paywalled), the “departure plan” will run until December 15. As far as who’s targeted for the reduction, it will be “inter-project” employees.</p>



<p><strong>“This term refers to employees on permanent contracts waiting to be reassigned to a new project, after, for example, their previous video game has been released in stores,”</strong> the report adds per translation.</p>



<p>The decision to “realign” comes just after the launch of the Ubisoft-Tencent subsidiary Vantage Studios. That studio, which will oversee the Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six Siege franchises, is the first of the company’s planned <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-yves-guillemots-internal-memo-to-staff-on-new-creative-houses-ubisoft-structure/">“creative houses.”</a> As of publishing, it’s unclear what the next steps for the creative houses plan will be, and what games will be grouped.</p>



<p>There was no mention of the number of employees impacted by the decision. Insider Gaming has reached out to both Ubisoft and Massive Entertainment for clarification on this “transition program” and how many people will be let go. Should a response be received, it will </p>
