It’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK37CSHP?tag=theverge02-20">available for preorder now for $49.99</a> and is expected to be released on November 29th, 2024.</p><p>The Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller can be attached to smartphones or smaller tablet devices measuring between 100mm and 170mm in length. For expanded compatibility, instead of plugging in with USB-C, 8BitDo’s new controller connects wirelessly over Bluetooth but only supports Android devices.</p><p>The use of Bluetooth necessitates a 350mAh rechargeable battery in the controller, which 8BitDo says is enough for 15 hours of play on a 1.5-hour charge. That added battery also means the Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller weighs 236 grams, making it heavier than competitors’ offerings like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22753567/backbone-one-plus-iphone-gaming-controller-android-phones">Backbone One</a>, which connects through a device’s charging port and weighs 138 grams.</p><div><figcaption><em>The controller features Hall effect joysticks and triggers.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: 8BitDo</cite></p></div><p>Like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24187539/gamesir-g8-bluetooth-mobile-controller-ios-android-nintendo-switch-pc">GameSir’s G8 Plus smartphone controller</a>, 8BitDo is using <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained">drift-resistant</a> magnetic Hall effect sensors in its joysticks and triggers so players will potentially avoid experiencing unwanted movements or button presses while gaming. The controller also features a pair of shoulder buttons, a four-way directional pad with a “clicky” feel, turbo, macro, and profile buttons, and two additional programmable paddle buttons on the back.</p><div><figcaption><em>The controller is compatible with 8BitDo’s Ultimate Software allowing it to be customized and reconfigured.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: 8BitDo</cite></p></div><p>Unlike some of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185806/gaming-8bitdo-controller-ultimate-2c-hall-effect">8BitDo’s more budget-friendly offerings</a>, the Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller fully supports customization through the company’s Ultimate Software, which is available as a desktop and mobile app. In addition to remapping controls, creating macros, and even setting up multiple profiles, if you’re an FPS player, you can use it to adjust the sensitivity of the controller’s triggers so they’re more immediately responsive.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24278489/ring-battery-doorbell-plus-deal-sale<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re a gamer looking to save but can’t wait until another a month until Black Friday, it might be worth checking out <a href="https://howl.me/cnnelayGOJc"><strong>Best Buy’s three-day gaming sale</strong></a>. Now through October 27th, the retailer’s offering discounts on gaming gear, but some of the best deals are on hardware specifically. </p><p>For example, Best Buy has some notable deals on Windows handheld consoles, like the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719210/asus-rog-ally-review"><strong>Asus ROG Ally</strong></a>, which is on sale&nbsp;with a Z1 Extreme chip for <a href="https://howl.me/cnnexVKi7NU">$549.99 ($100 off)</a> (and even cheaper at $499.99 for My Best Buy Plus and Total members). That’s $50 shy of its best price to date, and nearly half the price of its successor, the ROG Ally X. Admittedly, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">ROG Ally X</a>, offers more impressive performance and battery life, but the ROG Ally is still more powerful than Valve’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513517/steam-deck-long-term-test-valve">Steam Deck</a> with a larger 1080p and 120Hz display. Alternatively, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review"><strong>Lenovo Legion Go</strong></a> is also on sale for <a href="https://howl.me/cnnd4I8l55Z">$599.99 ($150 off)</a> with 1TB of storage, which is one of its better prices to date. The handheld isn’t as fast or as lightweight as the ROG Ally, but it does offers a larger 8.8-inch 144Hz display so it can double as a decent Windows tablet. It also has detachable controllers and even a kickstand.</p><p>It’s not all pricey handhelds, either. Gaming accessories like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/30/24168172/scuf-nomad-iphone-mobile-controller-hall-effect-specs-price"><strong>Scuf’s Nomad&nbsp;controller</strong></a><strong> </strong>have dropped to their best prices to date, selling for <a href="https://howl.me/cnnd84vVxJJ">$79.99 ($20 off)</a>, with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SCUF-Wireless-iPhone-Mobile-Controller/dp/B0D49HBW9D/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> matching that deal too. A mobile controller for your iPhone, Scuf’s device is similar to&nbsp;rivals from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525741/backbone-one-iphone-ios-controller-gaming-portable-review">Backbone</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23191199/razer-kishi-v2-mobile-game-controller-android-review">Razer Kishi</a> but offers full-size, drift-free Hall effect sticks. And while the video game deals aren’t as impressive, there are a few noteworthy ones to consider, like the  open-world&nbsp;title <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em>, which is down to one of its better prices to date of <a href="https://howl.me/cnneJt0bAvO">$29.99</a> <a href="https://howl.me/cnneJt0bAvO">($20 off)</a> for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.</p><div><p>The ROG Ally is Asus’ first crack at a Steam Deck rival. It’s a Windows-based PC gaming handheld with a seven-inch 1080p, 120Hz touchscreen and integrated gamepad controls.</p></div><div><p>The clamp-style mobile controller works with the iPhone and offers a few pro-level features at a relatively low price, including full-size, drift-free Hall effect sticks (with swappable stick toppers) and a pair of customizable rear paddle.</p></div><div><div><h2>Verge Deals on X<!-- --> <!-- --> / </h2><p>Join more than 50,000 followers and keep up with the best daily tech deals with @vergedeals</p></div><p><a href="http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud">Follow us!</a></p></div><p><h3>A few more ways to save</h3></p><div><ul><li>The <strong>Ring Battery Doorbell Plus</strong>, our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22954554/best-video-doorbell-camera">top battery-powered video doorbell pick</a>, is down to an all-time low of $99.99 ($40 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Ring-Battery-Doorbell-detection/dp/B09WZBPX7K?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://howl.me/cnnc0e9JlIQ">Best Buy</a>, and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fring-battery-doorbell-plus-8211-smart-wi-fi-video-doorbell-with-head-to-toe-hd-video-satin-nickel%2F-%2FA-88293229">Target</a>. The doorbell boasts an impressive 1536p HD video resolution as well as a head-to-toe view, allowing you to get a better view of packages and visitors. Compared to other battery doorbells we’ve tested, the Plus is also more responsive. Other handy features include color night vision, live view, and two-way audio, though you’ll need to pay $4.99 subscription fee for other perks like recorded video and alerts for packages.</li><li>You can purchase a refurbished <strong>iRobot Roomba i4 Evo </strong>on sale from <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F384464991557">eBay</a> for $129.99 when you apply the code <strong>HOLIDAYCHEER </strong>at checkout, which costs $320 less than buying it new. The Roomba i4 Evo is the upgraded version of our <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23846479/best-budget-robot-vacuum-robot-mop">favorite budget-friendly robot vacuum</a>, the Roomba i3. Aside from offering a bigger battery, it’s otherwise identical and capable of mapping and cleaning your house just as well as the pricier, more capable Roomba j7. Bear in mind it lacks AI-powered obstacle avoidance and you can’t set virtual keep-out zones, but those are fair trade-offs at this price. </li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/5/23902100/samsung-smarttag2-item-tracker-announce"><strong>Samsung’s Galaxy SmartTag2</strong></a> starts at&nbsp;$21.22 ($9 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-SmartTag2-Bluetooth-Tracker-Tracking/dp/B0CCC69HN3/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>, which is a little over $1 shy of its best price to date, while <a href="https://howl.me/cnmMTtAN8eI">Best Buy</a> has the device for $22.49. The ultra wideband tracker&nbsp;works with Samsung’s Galaxy Find network, making it a particularly great option for Samsung device owners looking to keeps tabs of their belongings. Unlike its predecessor, it also offers a more robust IP67 water and dust resistance rating and a user-replaceable battery capable of lasting up to 700 days.</li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The streamer has a habit of just gruesomely canceling shows, even when they have great ratings and are adored by their audience. (<em>Kaos</em>, I’m still mourning you.)

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/axis-allies-40th-anniversary-edition-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games">War board games</a> are one of, if not the, oldest genres of board games, with some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-classic-board-games">earliest examples</a> dating back to the days of the ancient Greeks. Fast forward a few thousand years, and you will find Axis &amp; Allies, one of the modern era's most prolific and well-regarded war games. Now, under the care of Renegade Studios, comes a re-release of the much sought-after Anniversary Edition of Axis &amp; Allies with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/axis-allies">Axis &amp; Allies 40th Anniversary Edition</a>, and at long last, fans and new players alike can once again find this elusive prize.</p><div catalogid="fce4d4e7-132d-4124-a571-858c1fd8c10c" id="209655"><div id="209655" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Axis &amp; Allies: 40th Anniversary Edition</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For those unfamiliar with the Axis &amp; Allies franchise, the game places anywhere from two to six players in the roles of either the Axis Powers (Germany, Italy, Japan) or the Allies (United States, United Kingdom, and Soviet Union) during various conflicts of World War II in the 1940s (with a few exceptions, such as A&amp;A 1914, set in World War I, and G.I. Joe: Battle in the Arctic Circle). </p><p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Axis &amp; Allies 40th Anniversary Edition</h3></div></output></p><p data-cy="paragraph">While many modern games of its type may rely on intricate tech trees, special abilities, and other systems, Axis &amp; Allies is one of the purest forms of war board games out there. It’s a game where you move your pieces around a large board, roll dice to win fights, and conquer cities to achieve victory—a game where solid strategy and planning matter most. This experience has helped the series survive for so long. Among the plethora of versions and multiple editions, this Anniversary Edition release is widely regarded by fans as the de facto version. It’s even featured as the game played in Renegade’s Axis &amp; Allies World Championship Tournament at this year's GenCon, thanks in part to a few unique aspects that make it stand out from its fellow A&amp;A siblings, like A&amp;A 1942, A&amp;A Pacific 1940, or A&amp;A Europe 1940.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Spread across three large boards, Axis &amp; Allies includes both 1941 and 1942 scenarios to choose from, which dictate where players will place their starting units and the order in which each country takes its turn. From there, play alternates between countries placing new units, moving units, rolling dice to resolve attacks, and buying new units, with the end goal being to hold a certain number of special victory cities. Mix in some special rules for land, air, and sea units, and you have everything you need to enjoy one of the longest-running board game franchises of modern times – simple in concept, rich in depth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those fortunate enough to have snagged a copy of the 2009 Anniversary Edition release, aside from a few visual adjustments for historical accuracy on the map (Honolulu now points to the correct island, for example), a bigger board, and a new FAQ section in the rulebook, Renegade’s new version is the same. All 672 miniatures retain the same detailed designs and can be easily stored in the returning nation-specific storage boxes, which are adorned with artwork that creates a collage when stored securely in the game’s box. All of the cardboard tokens are thick and sturdy, and the IPCs (the currency used to purchase new units) are still that same Monopoly-style paper. Though I’m not much of a fan of that myself, I opt for just a trusty notepad to keep track.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The components all feel sturdy and honor the previous releases, but there are slight stumbles, and I wish Renegade had gone a bit further with their tweaks beyond just fixing grammatical hiccups. Of particular note, it is far too difficult to distinguish the various naval ships, especially the Destroyers, Transports, and Battleships. A subtle tweak to the sculpts or something similar would have been welcome (as a quick Google search shows, this complaint isn’t new). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some issues, such as units feeling cramped on their respective spaces on the map, can be alleviated somewhat by the <a href="https://renegadegamestudios.com/axis-allies-anniversary-edition-deluxe-map/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deluxe neoprene map</a> that is 20% larger, though it comes at an additional cost. All in all, though, for its $100+ price tag, the base Anniversary Edition is still a wonderfully produced board game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Playing through a game of the Anniversary Edition is an event unto itself that will easily take a day or more to complete, especially if you are a newcomer to the series. To put it into perspective, the games during the world tournament, featuring teams of some of the best players out there, were limited to six hours. While this may sound daunting, there is something truly magical about having a game that turns into a weekend-long event with your friends. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of length, the 40th Anniversary Edition finds itself in the middle range of the pack, with options like 1941 offering much of the same mechanics in a game that will only last a couple of hours. Alternatively, you can combine Europe and Pacific to create the utterly epic Axis &amp; Allies Global, which will take even the most experienced players months of weekends to complete (a dream of mine to do one day). Thanks to Renegade’s efforts in reprinting the series, it’s fairly easy to snag a copy of whichever version you prefer.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QODoAj?object_uuid=6a6ec016-5ea8-467c-9c4d-f8cf0cc82e18&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/a5bl5j?object_uuid=6a6ec016-5ea8-467c-9c4d-f8cf0cc82e18&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Renegade</a></li></ul></div></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Oct 25, 2024 4:00 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Axis &amp; Allies 40th Anniversary remains one of the best war-gaming experiences available in the board game space, and with Renegade’s reprinting, it is once again easy for fans and newcomers to obtain. Playing this game is an event unto itself, and its impressive table presence still makes me pause when it’s all set up. It may not be the best option for those who are just curious about the series, given the length of the games and its price point, but once you know that you enjoy the systems in Axis &amp; Allies, it’s an incredibly easy game to recommend.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We discussed how it came to be, what other iconic franchises did and didn't influence its creation, and much more.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/25/cronos-the-new-dawn-key-art-logo-1729868817568.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Chronos: The New Dawn is the next big game from Bloober Team.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Congratulations on the reveal! That must be very exciting and probably nerve-wracking. How long has Cronos been in development?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Jacek Zieba:</strong> We started pre-production somewhere during the end of [2021 release] The Medium, the ideas and everything. When we finished The Medium parts of the team were designated to start doing Cronos, so now it's in an advanced state of production.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Wojciech Piejko:</strong> Before The Medium was finished, we sat with leads and other guys and came up with the new idea for the game and that was how Cronos was born.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> How does it feel now to finally have it out in the wild and show off what you've been working on for so long?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> It's surreal. Surreal and a big relief. It's always like a nerve-wracking thing. I think there are two big moments in development. Of course, the release, which is the most nerve-wracking one. But the second one is this, the moment we are sharing right now, showing the first trailer of the game, seeing the feedback</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So it was a big relief of course and a big moment for the company, that we are doing this two hit combo after releasing Silent Hill with all the great reception, and we are really thankful for all the players. And now this also seems to resonate with people. So we are super excited and super relieved. And of course it'll give us a second wind. 'Okay, now it's real. Now we need to finish it and fulfill the dream.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Is it difficult to actually just settle down now back into work today without constantly checking out the comments and the conversations around the trailer?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> Exactly. It is what is happening in the studio since this morning. [Sharing] reaction videos and comments. We are really, really happy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Was it a very planned and intentional move to reveal Cronos so soon after Silent Hill?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> In a way, yes, because we have two big teams, two big projects started some time ago. So yeah, we knew that this day would come that we can reveal it, but it's not like we made this decision two years ago or something. Those kind of decisions are very tricky and sometimes you just seize the moment like, 'Okay, this is the time now, we should do it here.' So it's like, you're sometimes just waiting and you are just prepared for this kind of stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> Yeah, it's also like the stars are aligned. The reception of Silent Hill is great; now Microsoft wants us on their show. So okay, maybe that's good moment because we've got this trailer prepared and we were looking for a perfect moment. We saw a lot of comments like, 'How? Do you guys sleep?'</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> I think it's fair to say the Silent Hill 2 remake is the biggest and most significant release for Bloober that has put you on the map more than any previous release. It had positive critical reception and you just announced one million sales too. Has that energized you? Has it influenced Bloober Team in other ways?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> I think that energized us, yeah. We proved we could do it as a team, as a company, because the team poured all their hearts into it. I think it was very tough for them, seeing what happened on the internet for years and to now say to everyone, 'Okay, you were wrong. We can do it and people really like it.' That's the most important stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">People really like it so we can be in this together with players, because all of the people in Bloober are also big fans of Silent Hill and put a lot of love into their remake. So that's a big reward for everybody here. But yeah, it's a great success, the biggest as you said, but it only gave us energy to keep going further. That's our new strategy. It's not like, 'Let's just be bigger and bigger. Let's just create better and more interesting games than before.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> To be honest, I can't express enough how happy we are with the release of Silent Hill 2. The team did great, a really tremendous job against all the odds, against all the comments saying we don't deserve to touch this legendary game and everything. We are all fans of Silent Hill. So for us it was a dream come true. So of course it was hard for the team, but they overcome everything and made the impossible possible. We love the new version of Silent Hill, which is still true to the original and added some more content which people like. So yeah, we are thrilled. We are thrilled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Let's talk about Cronos. Can you give me the synopsis, the elevator pitch on what this game is?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> Alright, so you are a traveler, a mysterious person hidden beneath this environmental suit and you've been sent to the ruins of human civilization with the goal of looking for time rifts. During your exploration you'll need to survive encounters, solve some puzzles, and overcome anomalies that you saw [in the trailer] like floating buildings and other elements. This is our own take on puzzles in this game and you need to look for the time rifts that I mentioned, jump back in time, and extract key people who didn't survive the apocalypse.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> What can you tell me about the apocalypse itself and what's clearly gone very wrong in this world?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> I think only the name of it! It's The Change. The Change happened and the rest is mystery at this point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> The Change happened in the eighties, in Poland. We love to share our culture and the environment and architecture in Poland. It's an alternative version of history. The Change, this apocalyptic event happened in the eighties, and that's where we are.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> This is also why our sci-fi is more retro, something like Alien or the old Star Wars. So it's more analog than flashy. No new tech.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Cronos: The New Dawn Bloober Team Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> What are your other inspirations? Fans are comparing it to Dead Space and also seeing lots of classic survival horror like Silent Hill in it too</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> Definitely Dead Space is there because of the protagonist and stuff, We can share a little about a special approach to combat. Just like Dead Space has the cut off the limbs mechanic, we also have something we will share later. Also like Alan Wake with the flashlight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> It's something that brings up the tension. It's not only run and gun but you need to think. We put a little more strategy in the combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> Besides those, Japanese survival horror, like the Resident Evil series, the old ones, the remakes. Those were a very, very big inspiration for us</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> In terms of movies, films like 12 Monkeys. Our biggest film or TV series inspiration is Dark, the TV series by Netflix. It tells a story about time travel and a fictional German town, so a very European thing. We thought the same, 'Okay, we can set the game in Poland. We can also use time travel.' This showed us we can do it and people are interested in it. We don't need to make the game about somewhere else. Let's show culture, let's show Poland. Oh and The Thing [is another inspiration].</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> Also Annihilation with Natalie Portman was a very, very big influence.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Having mentioned these other game franchises, do you want Cronos to be a competitor to Resident Evil, to Silent Hill?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> Our goal was to create our first IP in the survival horror genre because, of course, Silent Hill is a property of Konami and, we are really grateful and honored to be able to work on this game, but with Cronos we wanted to make something ours, with our vision of the survival horror game and mixing the elements that we have mastered through the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We were always a storyteller, so we still want to tell a good story, but this time we would like to also incorporate more gameplay into it. So expect a survival horror game like the games you mentioned, Resident Evil, Dead Space, Silent Hill. Those are the type of games we... We would like to be among them. But yeah, I think it's our own take. That was a goal of this journey of the new Bloober, to expand and have more gameplay oriented games but still telling good stories.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 25 Best Horror Video Games Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> What lessons did you learn from The Medium that influenced the creation of Cronos?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ: </strong>I think <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-dev-bloober-team-knew-it-had-to-evolve-after-releasing-the-medium">after The Medium it was very clear to us that we needed to evolve</a>. It was like, 'let's end the chapter of the adventure games.' Layers of Fear, Observer, and The Medium, [games that were] strange, experimental, with fixed camera tools. 'Okay, let's finish with that.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We also want to evolve, so let's go into survival horror, let's create something of our own, something different than other games in the genre in terms of world, story, and also gameplay. Let's create another game of our dreams.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> It's a privilege to make the games that you would like to play yourself for horror fans. We are in the studio making Silent Hill, Cronos. it's like a dream combination.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> The general strategy of Bloomberg Team 3.0 is to redefine the genre, so how is this game doing that? What are your plans to make this the new benchmark for survival horror games?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> I don't know if we can say.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> We've got these features, the one mentioned before, our take on combat. We are trying to expand the idea, not only of survival horror [mechanics] like a limited inventory and stuff, but also add some new ideas to it. I think it's all about the mixture, making different pizzas with different ingredients, and I hope this one will be really tasty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Which themes, of sci-fi or horror or time travel, did you lean into most when making Cronos?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> We of course knew that we were doing the Silent Hill game, so <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloober-team-made-cronos-the-new-dawn-sci-fi-to-not-step-on-the-toes-of-silent-hill-2-remake">we didn't want to overlap with, let's say a more grounded story</a>. We said, 'Okay, we will be doing this, so we need to go somewhere else to have a different world, to not repeat ourselves.' So yeah, that's how we came up with Cronos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Cronos was in development when both the Dead Space remake and the Dead Space inspired Calisto Protocol came out. Was this a worry at all?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> We were concerned at some moment. Nobody knew about Dead Space remake when we started our production. And on Callisto, we were very curious on various levels as a developer, also as gamers, like how it'll play If this is a spiritual successor of Dead Space. And it wasn't good in the case of gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So we could cool off, like, 'Okay, it's not new groundbreaking, survival horror, we can still have a shot.' And in case of Dead Space remake, it was just awesome to play it again and see how it's done and see how this can help us in our production. So definitely two interesting moments, but mostly we just learned something from it, more than be discouraged on our journey.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We don't think in categories like, 'Okay, people don't like Callisto or people don't like Dead Space Remake, so now we have a problem.' No, we are also doing something different than these two games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> As big fans of the genre, what excites you most about Cronos?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> I think there are two things. One I can say, the second one... So the main character, the Traveler, who they are, what's happening, why they're doing this, the suit... We put a lot of effort into building it, to make it something special, make it something different. And the second part is this combat part. But it's a secret.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> I would say the same. I'm really happy how the Traveler looks, how we designed the suit. That was something that we really wanted from the very beginning, to not have a typical soldier type, but more a diver, a diver in time, and that's great. I saw a lot of comments like, 'Whoa, I love this suit, love this.' I know! Yes, yes, it's great. I'm so happy about it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: </strong>Horror games often make their protagonists rather faceless, but it sounds like you have big plans for yours and your story. Is that right?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> Yes, of course. Yeah. I know that we are making a third person game with the character in the helmet, but you still learn a lot about yourself and your place in the world. I know we are starting very big because like, oh, the word is destroyed and stuff, but yeah, please remember we are Bloober. We like to tell an intimate story about people and characters and this will not be different.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> So with lots to it, do you think there is potential for more Cronos beyond The New Dawn?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> Definitely, definitely, definitely. Yeah, we've got plans for Cronos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> Now going down this independent route then, making your own franchise, is Bloober still open to making, for example, another Silent Hill remake or even a brand new Silent Hill game?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> I think that's a very tough and open question. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-dev-bloober-team-open-to-making-more-silent-hill-games">I think we are always open</a>. If we like the opportunity, we'll take it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> There are opportunities that you have to seize. Like Silent Hill 2, you can remake the legend. So yeah, I do believe that everything's possible. We are also fans of the genre. If the IP is interesting we probably will also be interested.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN:</strong> You mentioned earlier that the Silent Hill 2 remake has been criticizedfor all sorts since its announcement, but now it's released everyone loves it. Has that reception increased Bloober's confidence?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>JZ:</strong> I think definitely, yes. It just gives all of us more confidence, I think definitely for the Silent Hill team, but also for us. Yeah, like 'We can do it. We can do that kind of crazy stuff.' We also love our previous games and some of them have better or worse reception, but still, we all put all our hearts into them and we also learn with each of them. So I think I'm only hyped to see how Cronos can land. And also what's further than Cronos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>WP:</strong> Long story short, I think we all feel that we leveled up as developers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Editor's Note: This interview was lightly edited for clarity.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

                <p>8BitDo has officially revealed its <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK37CSHP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">first dedicated mobile controller</a> in the vein of the <a href="https://lvnta.com/lv_4bmmeF9LIyEnKYcTPb?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CCT2LWT8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0B16NGTCT?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Razer Kishi V2</a>. The cradle design coupled with the signature features of the manufacturer's stellar <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BZ3HVM26?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ultimate controllers for PC and Nintendo Switch</a> makes the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK37CSHP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller</a> an eye-catching option, especially since it's priced at only $50. Available to preorder now at Amazon, the 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller will be available in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK37CSHP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">white</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK36N98Q?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">black</a> variants starting November 29.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4390460-8bitdo-uc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390460" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4390460-8bitdo-uc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390460"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4390460-8bitdo-uc.jpg"></figure><p>Like its high-end controllers, the 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller features triggers and joysticks with Hall Effect sensors, which prevents stick drift and generally offers a smoother feel. It also has two customizable rear triggers, a dedicated turbo button, and it'll fit any phone between 3.93 inches (100mm) to 6.69 inches (170mm) in length. That covers the vast majority of modern phones. For reference, the iPhone 16 Pro Max, Apple's largest phone, is 6.42 inches in length. The controller's design of this looks quite comfortable as well, as it adds a more traditional gaming profile to a phone.</p><p>It also supports 8BitDo's Ultimate Software, an easy-to-use customization suite that lets you remap inputs, adjust stick and trigger sensitivity, and more.</p><p>The main, and fairly substantial, caveat here: It's only confirmed to support Android, but other 8BitDo controllers listed with Android-only mobile support have worked on iOS just fine. GameSpot has reached out to 8BitDo to see if official support for iOS is planned and whether it will work in some capacity with iPhones at launch.</p><p>Since the controller syncs via Bluetooth, not via USB-C like the Backbone, we would be surprised if it didn't support iOS. 8BitDo's other controllers do work with Apple devices via Bluetooth, and its Ultimate Software app is available through the iOS Store.</p><p>If it works at all--and again, we are speculating here--the Ultimate Software app is the key feature that could be missing on iOS. If 8BitDo doesn't or isn't able to add the controller to the list of devices that sync with the app on iOS, iPhone users wouldn't be able to remap inputs or make other adjustments--unless they also have an Android device or the controller is capable of syncing with the PC app to make changes. Remapped inputs and other adjustments are typically saved to the controller, so if you own an Android tablet or an old Android phone with 9.0 firmware or higher, you could theoretically make those changes on that device before using it on iPhone.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4390589-8bitdoultimate.png" data-ref-id="1300-4390589" data-ratio="0.6041095890411" data-width="1460" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4390589-8bitdoultimate.png" data-ref-id="1300-4390589"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller has two ergonomically designed rear triggers</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4390589-8bitdoultimate.png"></figure><p>We'll update this article if and when we hear from 8BitDo about iPhone compatibility. Considering Apple has made a push into AAA gaming on iOS with titles such as Resident Evil 4 remake, Resident Evil 7, Death Stranding, Assassin's Creed Mirage, and more, the 8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Gaming Controller and its myriad customization features would be a boon for iPhone users.</p><p>Nevertheless, Android users have an exciting new controller option to look forward to. 8BitDo's controllers almost always punch above their price, so the 8BitDo Mobile Gaming Controller should be on your radar.

Backbone One costs $100 and doesn't have rear triggers or Hall Effect sticks/triggers. It does offer dedicated support for iPhone and Android via USB-C (or Lightning), including a handy app that collects your games in one console-style launcher. The USB-C connection also mitigates latency concerns, whereas Bluetooth can add a bit of latency. 8BitDo's Bluetooth controllers typically work great via Bluetooth, but it's worth mentioning here.</p><p><strong>8BitDo:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK37CSHP?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Mobile Gaming Controller (White)</a> -- $50</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK36N98Q?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Mobile Gaming Controller (Black)</a> -- $50</li></ul><p><strong>Backbone One:</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://lvnta.com/lv_WCopub4HusdMMWHmtP?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CCT2TJW4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd-Gen, White)</a> -- $100</li><li><a href="https://lvnta.com/lv_4bmmeF9LIyEnKYcTPb?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CCT2LWT8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd-Gen, Black)</a> -- $100</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CT17GPNT?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd-Gen Lightning, White)</a> -- $100</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CT1BRLZ9?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd-Gen Lighting, Black)</a> -- $100</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CT17GPNT?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Backbone One (2nd-Gen Lightning, White)</a> -- $100</li></ul><p>In related news, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK6VCGBC?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo 64 Bluetooth Controller is also available to preorder</a><span> now for $40 at Amazon.

As <em>Semafor</em> points out, the <em>Zorse</em> name “identifies the offspring of a zebra and another equine,” so it seems like the game will focus on wordplay like that.</p><p>Cohen says <em>Zorse</em> is currently only available in Canada, meaning I can’t play it myself.

            <p>The precision-platformer is a torturous genre at the best of times, and now developers Brlka and publishers Ysbryd Games have seen fit to combine it with Silent Hill. Their forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/love-eternal">Love Eternal</a> is the story of Maya, a girl whisked off to a "castle built of bitter memories" by a weird, lonely god, and obliged to make her way "through over 100 screens filled with spikes, lasers, switches, and traps".</p>
<p>When not getting spiked or lasered, Maya appears to spend her days in a kind of metaphorical suburban household. Here, she will contend with things like people crawling on the ceiling and coming over all Babadook. Maya does have one major advantage: the ability to reverse gravity. Watch her put that ability to use in the new trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>Commendably harrowing, yes? Celeste meets Silent Hill is one framing - Gris but grimdark is another. I already know I'm going to struggle with the platforming, but I'm very curious about the setting, which reminds me a little of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/void-stranger">Void Stranger</a>'s bottomless sokoban-scape. I also like the treacherousness of the presentation, with larger animated sprites suddenly louring into view during the hop-and-bop sequences. I like it up to a point, anyway. If the game does the fourth-wall peekaboo routine every time I have to carry out six mid-air gravity flips in a row, I am going to get Cross.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of features from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3010610/LOVE_ETERNAL/">the Steam page</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Gorgeous hand-drawn pixel art graphics bring the god's realm to life alongside meticulously handcrafted animations boasting many thousands of frames</p>
<p>A lush, atmospheric score, equal parts unsettling and beautiful</p>
<p>Responsive, snappy controls provide challenges with a sense of mastery and acrobatic accomplishment</p>
<p>A psychological horror narrative contorts and unfolds to reveal choices beyond comprehension</p></blockquote>
<p>Love Eternal is out in 2025. For pretty much the exact tonal opposite of this, may I recommend Ed's recent favourite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stardust-demon-is-an-intergalactic-metroidvania-that-looks-very-snazzy-indeed-and-its-out-now">Stardust Demon</a>? Fans of bizarro 2D games are eating well this October.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p><em>The shift to streaming means a shift to on-demand entertainment, an opportunity to watch, listen, or play what you want, when you want. We've spent all sorts of time at Remap talking about the luxury of entertainment and how we choose to spend our time, but one thing Rob and Patrick have in common, as any Remap reader knows, is sports. </em></p><p><em>The reason companies continue to pay so much for sports packages, and will continue to do so, is because it's event viewing. The moment a sporting event is over, it loses value. But appointment viewing is powerful, because it's a guarantee of putting butts in (virtual) seats. These days, that's rare.</em></p><p><em>If you were lucky enough to buy an early TiVo box, technology companies were using their power for good and completely eliminating ads from the viewing experience. Now, technology has been leveraged to ensure you're getting the most targeted, specific ads, none at all, or seemingly the same ad over and over.</em></p><p><em>Rob and Patrick watch a lot of ads. And they have thoughts.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Rob:</strong> Okay Patrick, we’re a few weeks into the football season, we’ve had some great playoff baseball, the WNBA is wrapped and the NBA is getting rolling. Which means we have probably seen more TV commercials than we have in months and I have to ask… are there any you absolutely hate yet?</p><p>It’s not quite as bad right now as during the football playoffs or the NBA playoffs, where companies just go wild with their ad budgets and you start getting smothered by new campaigns. But I always find myself morbidly fascinated by the ads you see during major sports events, because they both tell you which companies are making so much money they can afford to just saturate the airwaves, and they tell you what those companies want to portray about themselves and your relationship to their product.</p><p>I think one of the darkest ads I see is the Eric Andre FanDuel ad?</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YA6gw3Lxjjg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="More Hunches | FanDuel Sportsbook"></iframe></figure><p>This is basically just encouraging compulsive gambling, right? This dude is sitting down to enjoy the games except he’s not really watching the games, he’s getting constant intrusive thoughts about side-bets and parlays he could play the instant he gets the impulse because the FanDuel app is <em>right there </em>on his phone. Except it’s not scary or sinister because it’s just Eric Andre doing goofy little bits about each of the wagers he proposes. Wormtongue, but make it Millennial Comedy.</p><p>It also feels like it marks a bit of a shift since the gambling apps were first blanketing commercial breaks. We’re not showing Jamie Foxx leading you into the exclusive club that is the MGM sports book, telling you how much better the things you love can make you feel if you just lay a little wager on them. The “new user acquisition” phase of the online betting rollout appears to be ending, at least for FanDuel, so now you’re getting ads that are about increasing engagement. Which feels like a bad thing when we’re talking about betting! The ad isn’t even for anyone who is not already gambling pretty regularly: the guy is alone in his apartment, apparently friendless, sitting down to track all the games via Sunday Ticket while being haunted by ideas for other wagers he could place. I feel like if you’re thinking this way, you might already be in some trouble.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet there he is, multiple times a game, thinking about how good it’d be to bet the fucking Broncos. Just in case it wasn’t already clear that they’re trying to micro-target people who love gambling and completely suck at it.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@neonbrand?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Kenny Eliason</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> C’mon, Rob. You’re telling me these exploitative ads are worse than No Flex Zone x Wingstop?</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tj1FKGsLR9o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Wingstop - No Flex Commercial ( Rae Sremmurd )"></iframe></figure><p>This ad literally started playing <em>while I was fucking writing this, </em>watching the opening of the NBA season.</p><p>I’ve been low stakes gambling on sports for the better part of 10 years. Before it was “legal” in my state, all you had to do was sign up for a website that could tap into a Las Vegas sportsbook—in my case, Bovada—and dump some money in. The UI wasn’t sexy, but it worked. For me, betting was a way to create more friction and investment while watching sports in the same vein as fantasy football, which I’ve been doing for more than 10 years. One of my leagues goes further back, with a group of friends from college. At one point, I was probably doing four fantasy football leagues at once? It’s helpful to have more than one going, in case you’re slammed with a bunch of injuries and your entire roster basically falls apart.</p><p>Those fantasy leagues? There’s an entry fee every year, one that’s gone up as we’ve gotten older.&nbsp;</p><p>Which is all to say there’s a running theme of wanting to stack additional tension while watching sports.&nbsp;</p><p>Gambling, like fantasy football, is a mixture of luck and skill. It’s mostly luck, but you can improve your odds by being smart. I find it fun, I don’t overspend, and my bets are usually a couple of bucks. A little money goes in, a little money comes out. I’ve never even exported my winnings to a bank account, because I just roll it over to the next season, or event. Winning a bunch of money isn’t even the point.</p><p>In the old days, though, betting itself had friction. You’re signing up for a weird website. It feels a little sketchy. Gambling itself had a stink on it—it was for degenerates and that one guy you know. Now, it’s branded as <em>cool</em>. FanDuel, man, is slick. I highly recommend downloading it and poking at the UI, because what you’re going to find is something pretty fucking gross. I cannot fathom how much they’ve spent on psychological studies to understand the different ways they tickle your brain to make you bet more, with all the fancy colors and splashy visuals tricks drawing your attention to different ways to spend your money.</p><p>I have rules. I have a process. I don’t have a problem. But if I didn’t? These apps are cruel boxes.&nbsp;</p>

Well, for starters, it’s because the game’s made entirely of pixel art, which doesn’t allow for much experimentation or sexualization…Or does it? Of <em>course</em> it does.<br></p><p>As it turns out, the modding community caters to everyone, including those who want a little more on-screen nudity or depravity in their indie farming sims. It wasn’t difficult to find the six thirstiest mods for <em>Stardew Valley</em>. It was more challenging to narrow the list down to just those we could show you.</p><p><strong>Be warned: This article contains sexually explicit and suggestive content.</strong></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0c9635d36ab50701001f81a762f431eb" data-recommend-id="image://0c9635d36ab50701001f81a762f431eb" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" A scene from Xtardew Valley in Stardew Valley" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt=" A scene from Xtardew Valley in Stardew Valley" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Pseudodiego / ConcernedApe</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0c9635d36ab50701001f81a762f431eb" data-recommend-id="image://0c9635d36ab50701001f81a762f431eb" data-format="webp" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt=" A scene from Xtardew Valley in Stardew Valley" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There’s lewd, and then there’s downright nude. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4399&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/4399" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xtardew Valley</a></span> opts for the latter by introducing adult-themed content into the pixel art farming sim.

            <p>
We've seen some unique approaches to arachnophobia modes in video games as they've started to become more common in recent years, but nothing quite like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>'s new approach. Activision's solution somehow makes everything even more horrifying, by robbing its zombie spiders of legs and turning them into something arguably worse.
</p>
<p>
"For the first time in Black Ops 6 Zombies, a new arachnophobia toggle feature will be available," Activision writes in a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-accessibility-updates-features">post outlining Black Ops 6's new accessibility features</a> over on its blog. "This setting will allow players to change the appearance of spider-like enemies in Zombies without affecting their game play."
</p>
<p>
All of which sounds perfectly reasonable and good. After all, arachnophobia modes are far from unusual these days, even if their approaches are rarely the same. Developer Coffee Stain opted to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/finally-a-video-game-with-an-arachnophobia-mode">replace spiders with adorable pictures of cats</a> in Satisfactory, for instance, while Obsidian's Grounded - a game positively bursting with the things - let players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lethal-company-is-taking-a-novel-approach-with-its-new-arachnophobia-mode">dial the spider details all the way back</a> to 'innocuous circle'. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>'s solution, meanwhile, is a little more scorched-earth, simply <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-wont-have-an-arachnophobia-mode-because-it-doesnt-have-a-single-spider">eradicating the game's spider population</a> entirely.

<p>
Black Ops 6 developer Treyarch's approach to the spider problem, however, is something else entirely, with the studio having seemingly taken Obsdian's 'floating blob' solution as a starting point by removing its zombie arachnids' legs and then, well, stopping there. Which would be fine if the end result - a sort of giant mutated shrimp? <em>Sperm?!</em> - wasn't somehow more upsetting. Still, at least the nightmares won't be spider nightmares, I guess?

<p>
Elsewhere in its post, Activision spotlights a couple of other interesting new accessibility features for the Call of Duty series, including asymmetrical hearing compensation settings - enabling players to create custom audio profiles and adjust separate settings for each ear. Which, speaking as someone who's had lop-sided hearing since a childhood run-in with a lake, is something I'd definitely love to see more games adopt!
</p><p>
Black Ops 6 also includes an expanded High Contrast mode designed to assist players with vision impairment or colour blindness by letting them toggle a 'dark background' setting or customise outline colours for allies and enemies. This, of course, proved to be a surprise for some players at launch after they switched on the game only to discover <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/are-your-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-characters-blue-make-sure-youve-disabled-high-contrast-mode">everyone was blue</a>.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, Black Ops 6 features what Activision is calling Intelligent Movement, intended to help players with mobility issues reduce inputs by minimising and customising button and stick processes. That's alongside new HUD customisation features, used to switch between layout pre-sets and adjust minimap colours, plus support for the Xbox Adaptive Controller and Sony Access Controller. It's also now possible to pause and save during solo Zombies matches.
</p>
<p>
Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is available now on PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Game Pass - and there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/analysts-reckon-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-could-bring-up-to-4m-new-game-pass-subscribers">already plenty of chatter from analysts</a> about what its day one launch Game Pass launch will mean for the future of Microsoft's subscription service.

The game is now available to pre-order on both platforms, and comes with a 10% pre-order discount which will be available right up until release day.</p>

<p>Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun Aiko´s Choice features Aiko as the main character as she tackles the spymaster Lady Chiyo and puts to rest her own past. Aiko is not the only playable character, as she is joined by Hayato, Mugen, Yuki, and Takuma. The game itself features three main missions and three shorter interlude missions. People will have the choice of three versions to order, and those are detailed as follows:</p>
<ul>

</ul>

<p>In our Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun review, Miguel said, “<em>There aren’t many games like Shadow Tactics, and thankfully, it sets the bar high for any would-be challengers. The blend of RTS controls with stealth-oriented gameplay and level design create incredibly satisfying, almost puzzle-like encounters. It takes a lot of time and patience to be able to discover the solutions to these puzzles, however, and the hours long missions often left me feeling fatigued before I was even halfway through with them. Shadow Tactics is a unique exploration of the stealth genre with a great amount of polish, but if you’re going to dive in, be prepared for just how deep the water is.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-million<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has announced that&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>sales have topped a big milestone on the very day of its launch.</p>

<p>According to a Sega press release (via <a href="https://www.sonicstadium.org/news/games/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sells-over-one-million-units-on-launch-day-r2660/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sonic Stadium</a>),&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>has reached a million sales already, which is pretty impressive given the fact that the game was only released today.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that players who pre-ordered the Digital Deluxe Edition of the game were granted three-day early access, so technically,&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>has been available for a few days, but it was released to the general public today.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-wings.jpg?itok=eXTZORSY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-wings.jpg?itok=4yWT4R7a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>is already doing pretty brisk numbers for Sega.</figcaption></figure><p>In the press release, Sega attributes&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations</em>' success to a worldwide marketing blitz, as well as the fact that the game supports 12 different languages and was released simultaneously around the world.</p>

<p>Additionally, Sega says it's themed this fiscal year around Shadow, dubbing this initiative "Fearless: Year of Shadow". That makes sense, given that he'll be turning up as a pivotal character in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-sonic-hedgehog-3-movie-trailer-keanu-shadow">upcoming third&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>movie</a> later this year.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>is, it's the latest 3D platformer in the long-running and iconic&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>series, and as you've probably guessed, it's themed around everyone's favorite edgy hedgehog Shadow.</p>

<p>The game consists of two parts: a full remaster of 2011's&nbsp;<em>Sonic Generations</em>, complete with "updated visuals and reworked cinematics", and a new game that sees Shadow speeding through some of the levels from games in which he's appeared.</p>




<p>Shadow's campaign is technically a standalone game, so you don't need to play&nbsp;<em>Sonic Generations&nbsp;</em>to enjoy it, but unfortunately, it's not possible to buy Shadow's campaign separately.</p>

<p><em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2513280/SONIC_X_SHADOW_GENERATIONS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/sonic-x-shadow-generations/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sonic-x-shadow-generations/9MVLZDH2FH05" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sonic-x-shadow-generations-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-impressions-xbox-1851681562<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this week, I felt a feeling I hadn’t felt in a long while: I was looking forward to the release of a <em>Call of Duty </em>game. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-direct-everything-we-know-1851531121&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-direct-everything-we-know-1851531121"><em>Black Ops 6</em></a></span>, the latest installment in the long-running <em>Call of Duty </em>sub-series, has spent the last several months hyping up audiences about all of its changes and innovations, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-beta-weekend-1851638800&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-beta-weekend-1851638800">its quickened pace and omnimovement</a></span>. Meanwhile, the promotional tour has <em>also </em>been deliberately trying to harken back to some kind of golden age for the franchise, which seems as embattled as ever despite still regularly posting huge numbers and breaking records year after year. In recent weeks, players have been excited over the return of systems like prestige, which I didn’t even realize had been stripped from the games, but my personal favorite bit of messaging has been around Zombies, a fan-favorite cooperative mode that has become a staple of <em>CoD </em>since it was first introduced in 2008.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195371" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Long-Lost Halo Demo Comes To Life" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="109" data-playlist="195371,196909,195840" data-current="195371"><div><p>Long-Lost Halo Demo Comes To Life</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20829.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Over the years, Zombies has grown from a throwaway game mode tossed into 2008’s <em>World at War </em>at the last minute<em> </em>into a full-fledged prong of <em>CoD</em>. It has featured unique maps, weaponry, mechanics, characters, and stories! It’s home to the weirder side of the otherwise milquetoast, standard-bearing franchise, making it a beloved fixture of the series. As the games ramped up in scale, though, Zombies did too, and eventually the mode became unwieldy and unfamiliar even to people who’d played it for a long while, but especially to folks like me who looked to it as a casual kind of third space to just drop in and out of with friends.<br></p><p><em>Black Ops 6</em>, however, has continuously made promises that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cod-black-ops-6-blops-zombies-solo-features-leak-rounds-1851616861&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cod-black-ops-6-blops-zombies-solo-features-leak-rounds-1851616861">its iteration of Zombies would be a kind of reset </a></span>for the mode. It would be a return to the most basic formula for the experience: kill zombies, rack up points, buy and upgrade cool perks and weapons, rinse and repeat. The mode would return to round-based progression, the maps wouldn’t be these labyrinthine sprawls—at least at first—and the developers promised that it would even simplify the storytelling of Zombies, which now includes numerous different crews of survivors scattered across several storylines. Though I can’t speak to every one of those promises, I did manage to load up Zombies on <em>Black Ops 6</em>’s launch night and play with the very friends I last fought alongside years ago, and if I may say, I loved just about every bit of it.<br></p><p>The key to my positive experience is that, for the first time in a long time, this <em>Call of Duty </em>mode didn’t feel so burdened. Make no mistake, there’s tons to know going into it, like the fact that you can make custom loadouts to start with, pick out Gobblegum perks that you can earn mid-match, and so on. But that did little to get in the way of my dropping into Liberty Falls—one of <em>Black Ops 6</em>’s two Zombies maps at launch—with my friends, buying wall guns, and kiting swarms of zombies in circular routes before picking them off.<br></p><p>The lengthy game that I played gave me a chance to familiarize myself with both the map, a small Americana-style town, and the cadence of the rounds. <em>Black Ops 6</em>’s Zombies still features the occasional special round composed of a different enemy type—this time spiders, to the chagrin of arachnophobes the world over. A part of me really missed the Zombies announcer’s “Fetch me their souls!” from the good old days of hellhound rounds, but I can make peace with the fact that some things must change.<br></p><p>To that end, this new Zombies experience isn’t without <em>some</em> innovation. Armor plates are now in Zombies, carrying over from <em>Warzone</em>, <em>Call of Duty</em>’s battle royale title, and drop from enemies. Salvage does as well, and can be put to use at crafting tables around the map to make armor, equipment like grenades, or upgrades to your weapon’s rarity and base damage. There are pickups that allow you to even mutate into special zombie enemy types, and maps have their own wonder weapons, rather than a univeral pool. Points are no longer distributed by hit but by kill—a change I <em>don’t </em>love, especially as enemies become more spongey in later rounds and points risk becoming a scarcity—and there is no longer reinforcement of barriers and windows, which could stagger the release of enemies and stop rounds from devolving into open mayhem right away.<br></p><p>The biggest change, at least for me as someone who last played these games around <em>Black Ops 3</em>, was in the composition of the zombie ranks. New maps and iterations of Zombies have long featured some kind of central gimmick or even boss character, like George Romero in Call of the Dead, the prison warden in Mob of the Dead, and even Avogadro in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-dutys-most-hated-zombies-map-should-make-a-come-1847066627&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-dutys-most-hated-zombies-map-should-make-a-come-1847066627">Tranzit</a></span>, but in <em>Black Ops 6</em>, waves of enemies look vastly different than I’m used to. There’s a mixture of armored and standard zombies, which will push players to higher-damage builds more quickly, but alongside spiders (which can also spawn from dying zombies), there are also mini-bosses that will periodically appear and then outright overwhelm you in the late-game rounds. Manglers are heavily armored brutes who fire homing concussive blasts, while these three-headed beasts called Abominations shoot electricity from any of their maws, and command the field the second they appear.<br></p><p>Many of these changes are welcome additions, and ones I reckon have been around for a while, but most importantly, none of it ever got in the way of the classic high of pursuing a lengthy run and shooting the shit with friends. There’s a lot of optional depth and profundity to Zombies in <em>Black Ops 6</em>, but it is, in its purest form, a blast, and that hasn’t felt true in a long while. I’m looking forward not only to sampling the other Zombies experience available in the base game—a much moodier map called Terminus—but to growing comfortable with old and new strategies alike and settling into familiar grooves. While I can’t speak for the whole package just yet, as far as Zombies goes, we are so fucking back.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The original text has been restored in full, along with select visuals. To see the article in full, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://ubm-twvideo01.s3.amazonaws.com/o1/vault/GD_Mag_Archives/GDM_March_2013.pdf">visit the .PDF at the GDC Vault archives</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>.]</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Telltale is a bit different from your typical game company. We bring some of the best stories from TV and film and make episodic “story” games from them. We do our own licensing, design, development, publishing, and marketing, all under the same roof. We also tend to make product decisions together as a studio. We are independent, but bigger than “indie.” All of this brings a very unique set of challenges with it, which makes this postmortem a bit different as well. At Telltale, working with external partners and figuring out what “playing a story” means is just as important as slinging DMA packets around and writing code that controls what each CPU core is doing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We want to make games that let people immerse themselves within an actual role in stories like they never have before. We’ve had a fair bit of success in attracting some well-known licenses, but our roots are in graphic novels, reaching all the way back to Sam &amp; Max and Bone. We were thrilled at the opportunity to tackle something as rich as The Walking Dead and work with Robert Kirkman. By now, our series has won more than 80 Game of the Year awards and has been widely recognized as a groundbreaking achievement in the industry, but it certainly wasn’t an overnight success!</span></p><p>Image via Game Developer Magazine, March 2013.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What went right">What went right</h2><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Partnering with Skybound">Partnering with Skybound</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In early 2011 we reached out to The Walking Dead creator Robert Kirkman and his production company Skybound to discuss adapting his award-winning comics into a Telltale series. We were not going to pitch a game that was about killing zombies. Instead, we were going to pitch an episodic “story game” that focused on the thing we felt made his books so compelling: normal people adapting to impossible situations. The game we pitched was focused on dialogue and character development, and was to be incredibly cinematic and seriously emotional. We wanted people to connect with the characters and role-play like they never had before. There were certainly much more obvious takes on a zombie genre game, which made us a little nervous. Our pitch was probably not what they were expecting. Luckily, they were familiar with some of our previous work, so they took the meeting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When we met with Robert and the other folks at Skybound, they were very impressed by our vision of what a Walking Dead game could be. They understood how such an approach, if successful, would capture a much deeper sense of what made the comics so successful. Most importantly, they saw a special opportunity and were willing to take this risk with us.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the end, Robert Kirkman and everyone else at Skybound were (and are!) amazing partners. Even as the television show was becoming a runaway hit, they always made time to ensure we had the feedback and support we needed. One of the best things Robert did early on was introduce us to his friend Gary Whitta (screenwriter of Book of Eli and After Earth). Robert trusts Gary, and Gary really understands what makes The Walking Dead unique and special. Consequentially, Gary joined the team relatively early as our story consultant. As a gamer himself (he was editor-in-chief of PC Gamer for many years), his integration was easy and his impact immediate, making valuable contributions to the season story and design. Gary helped push us further toward the darker and more dramatically difficult aspects of The Walking Dead. When considering some of the trickier or more heart-wrenching parts of the story, such as letting the player choose to kill Duck or not, Gary would often be the one evangelizing the “you have to let the player go there” angle. Eventually, he dove in even deeper and wrote the script for the fourth episode.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Learning from past projects">Learning from past projects</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many game companies “reset” at the end of a project. They choose to start a new engine, or pursue a new game mechanic or control system, and choose to tackle completely new problems. At Telltale, we intentionally evolve our processes and technology without resetting them. We carefully take what has worked in the past and add layers to it instead of reinventing it. The same tools used to create </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> can still load and play the entire Telltale catalog.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Telltale has always aspired to make our unique experiences truly compete with more traditional genres such as FPSs and RPGs. Over the years, with each series, we’ve challenged ourselves to make “playing stories” more compelling and push the envelope as to what it means to “play a story.” In addition to the fundamental writing and design tasks, each series has tried to tackle specific aspects of this larger agenda. We’ve had some great successes and a lot of lessons learned along the way.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Very early on with Sam &amp; Max, we were simply figuring out the formidable challenges involved in designing, producing, and publishing digital adventure games on an episodic schedule. Later, with a series like Wallace &amp; Gromit, we challenged ourselves to move past traditional “point and click” and embrace the console controller. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Strong Bad’s Cool Game For Attractive People</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was the first regularly scheduled episodic game ever simultaneously released on consoles and PCs. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Poker Night At The Inventory</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had characters dynamically telling jokes and stories while reacting to the player and the cards. It also introduced our first online features with its unlockable </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Team Fortress 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> items. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Back to the Future</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> enabled us to examine how to make our games less obtuse and more accessible, reaching wider audiences and more platforms. With </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Jurassic Park</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we experimented with alternate control schemes and playable characters, and tried making fast-paced action sequences. Most importantly, we learned ways to keep the pacing of the story moving along while staying interactive and keeping the player engaged. Along the way, each series allowed us to refine our episodic production pipeline and tools, and become a much more significant (and successful!) self-publisher.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’ve never been content to be a boutique game developer/publisher. In innumerable ways, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the result of eight years of continuous exploration and evolution. This process not only informed us while creating </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it also gave us the confidence to take the even more ambitious risks you see in the finished game, such as…</span></p><p>Image via Game Developer Magazine, March 2013.</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="The “No Good Choice” game mechanic">The “No Good Choice” game mechanic</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Going in, we knew that in The Walking Dead you’d be confronted with awful choices, not much time to consider those choices, and then have to deal with the fallout of those choices. We did spend some time exploring integrating choice into more traditional game mechanics, but things didn’t start to really gel until we decided to go “all in” on choice. As a studio, we wholly embraced the idea that the game would allow narrative opportunities if they were plausible to the player. However, it wasn’t a simulation: We would still be handcrafting the “spine” of the story, and if a narrative option seemed plausible within that context, we committed ourselves to letting the player explore it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A great example of this is a critical moment in the third episode. One member of your party, a woman named Lilly, suddenly and deliberately shoots another member of your party, ostensibly to ensure the ultimate safety of everyone. The initial idea for this section of the game was that zombies would then immediately drive the group back into their RV, which would force the player to deal with Lilly’s actions in those close, inescapable quarters. As the details of that interaction came into focus, it became clear how strongly we felt about the idea of abandoning her at that moment. This was a moment we simply had to allow the story to play out both ways (she stays or she goes). We felt that empowering the player in critical moments like this was far more satisfying than giving a blanket good or evil ranking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also discovered that smaller, more intimate details often worked much better for us than giant, sweeping, branching opportunities. For instance, it’s often more interesting to let the player slight or insult NPCs than it is to let the player outright steal all their belongings or completely betray them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sometimes there were great initial story ideas, but they included some plausible choices that didn’t lead to interesting places. For example, in episode two, we really wanted different characters (not just Mark) to end up as the St. Johns’ victim depending on how you played, but when we explored allowing him to play a more significant role, and even perhaps survive, he just wasn’t adding anything good to the story. He became a sort of vestigial story problem in an otherwise really good part of the game. In these cases, we had to punt. Often though, we would keep working until we had moments where all possibilities were compelling and producible. It was most exciting when we created moments where all possibilities felt equally compelling and intriguing. These made the choice taken and the choice not taken just as important to the player.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Other games have certainly explored choice and branching narrative before, though most of those games have used player choice as a subset of a larger gameplay mechanic. They typically had rather binary player choices such as good or evil, light side or dark side, etc. which in turn drove various AI and NPC systems. We felt strongly that a statistics-driven AI and NPC system would not be able to deliver the kind of experience we envisioned. Instead, our system tracks every choice a player makes at a very detailed level and then makes that information available to designers. They use that information to create narrative-driven logic that controls the content and subsequent choices that are offered to the player. Our version of choice isn’t emergent from a system, but a carefully crafted bespoke experience driven by narrative possibility. This is what we mean by “tailored narrative.”</span></p><p>Image via Game Developer Magazine, March 2013.</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Episode directors make everyone a storyteller">Episode directors make everyone a storyteller</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beginning with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Jurassic Park</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> we introduced the idea of individual episode directors. An episode director is akin to the film director of a movie. They work very closely with the writers, designers, and production departments to craft a vision of how the episode will unfold for the player. The director chooses the combination of narrative tools that are used to create each moment in the finished game. Their job is to leverage lighting, color, music, sound effects, composition, pacing, and contrast to make the best interactive experience they can, and then they have to communicate and drive that vision through to the completion of the episode. Having someone dedicated to interpreting the script and design of each episode in this way encourages everyone to approach their work from a narrative context first. It transforms everyone in the studio into a storyteller.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this model, sound designers aren’t simply creating a room ambience anymore; they are contributing to a beat in a story in conjunction with their director. A modeler is creating environments for specific moments instead of generic simulations. Lighting setups change over the course of the episode based on narrative structure instead of the simple ticking of a clock. The artistic process isn’t driven by a simulation anymore, and instead serves the narrative context the player will experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The episode director isn’t a position at Telltale; it’s a role that is filled based on each episode’s unique circumstance, and a director needs to have passion for the license, the characters, the script, and the interactivity. We have opened this role to anyone in the studio, from any discipline, so long as they have a clear vision for what their episode will be, and the support and confidence of the team to execute it. So far, we’ve had directors come from writing, design, art, programming, and cinematics. (We haven’t yet had any directors from marketing or finance, but the door is open!)</span></p><p>Image via Game Developer Magazine, March 2013.</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Bringing players together">Bringing players together</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are deliberately no right or wrong choices in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. We didn’t set out to make a game you could win or lose. We wanted to expose difficult and interesting possibilities to players and reward them whatever they chose, while still leaving the choices not taken as a lingering possibility. The path not chosen should feel as important as the one they did choose. For instance, there is an opportunity to steal food from a stranger’s car in the second episode. Some might choose to steal the food in order to survive; others might view that as a loss of one’s humanity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We wanted to enable the player to see where they stood compared to the rest of the world. So, at the end of each episode of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we presented a statistics screen that shows five critical decisions the player made, and how their choices compared to other players. Exposing this to players transformed a single-player experience into a platform for social commentary, and encouraged players to discuss their motivations and experiences with each other. It also encouraged players to reconsider their choices and try replaying the episode from a different perspective. Although </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> isn’t a multiplayer game in the traditional sense, it certainly inspires a lot of conversations between friends and communities.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition to the five stats displayed at the end of each episode, the game also tracked dozens of other decisions players made. We were able to use this to help us understand what types of decisions were most interesting to players and reinforce those moments in subsequent episodes. In fact, at the end of episode four, we added an additional statistics screen showing what combination of survivors were joining you for episode five, and how your group compared to everyone else playing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Creating a compelling narrative “possibility space” for a player is significantly more rewarding when players are able to see the bounds of that space and compare their place in that space with their family and friends.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What went wrong">What went wrong</h2><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Casting is hard">Casting is hard</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Casting has always been tricky for us, and as we keep ratcheting up the drama in our games, the bar for our actors keeps rising as well. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> had particularly tricky casting challenges. Our leading characters were a southern black professor and an eight-year-old girl, in addition to a large and diverse supporting cast. They certainly were not your typical video game fodder.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We had so many auditions that were more caricature than character. Of the actors who were able walk the line between too generic and overly stereotyped, there were few voices that matched the way we imagined our characters. Of the few actors left that we did like, many of them were unavailable, too far away, or over our budget.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We initially cast the voice of the main character, Lee, from this compromised field, and proceeded to record the first episode. When we got the first group of lines back, we knew we were in trouble. Lee just didn’t have the range and personality that the game demanded, and now we had a large production team waiting instead of implementing. We needed a new Lee, and fast.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Luckily, one of our cinematic artists suggested an actor he was a fan of: the eminently talented Dave Fennoy. We tracked him down, and he was able to quickly get us an audition. Once we heard him, we knew he was what we needed. Dave is not only a fantastic voice talent, but an amazing actor who created a Lee that was much more nuanced and dynamic than we had hoped. Dave gave us confidence and allowed us to push the character of Lee even further.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Clementine, the eight-year-old girl who is with you throughout the game, was also a casting challenge. She is not a precocious stereotyped kid, but a smart young lady who is desperately trying to make sense of a world turned upside down. Finding any adult actress to voice a young girl is challenging, but finding one that could portray a complex character like Clementine was especially difficult. We went through another arduous casting process before finding the amazing Melissa Hutchinson.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Stranger, the ultimate villain at the end of the game, was also particularly difficult to cast. We needed the character to have a kind of quiet insanity. Once again, we cast and fully recorded what turned out to be the wrong actor. Literally the night before the schedule required we start recording, we found Anthony Lam—the creepy, quiet insane voice we were looking for. Fortunately, he was able to record immediately the following day. Those lines were being fed into the game as fast as they were recorded.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We need to get better at casting. As our games are becoming increasingly more sophisticated and dramatic, they are requiring more diverse and skilled actors. Fortunately, for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> we were mostly able to find the great actors we required in time, but just barely.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The challenge of defining and communicating the essence of our characters in ways that provide talented actors the tools they need in a game context has proven to be a daunting and difficult task. Our actors rarely get to perform with one another—we usually record their parts individually—which makes it hard to offer them context or insights into their character’s motivation. Also, we’re finding that directing the performances during the actual recording sessions is itself a specialized skill set that we need to improve.</span></p><p>Image via Game Developer Magazine, March 2013.</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Remaking episode two">Remaking episode two</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While we were focusing intently on episode one, episode two was quietly coming to life in the background on its own.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When we went “all in” on choice, it changed how episode one became fun and engaging. As these things were changing, we were iterating at what seemed like light speed, tweaking interfaces and adding features like “choice notifications,” onscreen inventory, panic meters, and more. We were intensely critical of everything, and we were finding fantastic new ways to make choice compelling.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When we finally got episode one to a good place, episode two had already been written, recorded, and was partially into production. When we were able to compare episode one and two, they felt radically different. Episode one had all this really cool new stuff that wasn’t being exploited in episode two, and episode two felt kind of “old Telltale” by comparison. So we decided we just couldn’t move forward with the version of episode two we had.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We gathered a large group of writers, designers, producers, and directors offsite at a local hotel conference room and spent two days hammering out a new direction for the episode that exploited and even advanced everything that was feeling so great about episode one. Though some large elements such as locations, principal characters, and story beats remained, nearly all of the dialogue needed to be rewritten and then rerecorded. We were super enthused by the new design, but we were already behind schedule, leading to…</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Massive schedule compression">Massive schedule compression</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With a monthly episodic game company, the schedule is king and constantly looms over everything we do. Just imagine if you tuned in for the last episode of The Sopranos and there was a screen saying “Sorry, we didn’t get it done. Come back later!” All the recasting and retooling that happened early in the series took a lot more time than we had anticipated. By the time episode one really came together, our series launch date was upon us, and as they say, the show must go on! Episode one launched with a much better reception than we could have dreamed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unfortunately, now we were further behind schedule than we had ever been before. To make matters worse, we had a huge rewrite of episode two to complete before we could restart production on it. While the new episode two script was completed at breakneck speed and recorded as quickly as possible, we considered what could be done to get back on track. We ended up basically putting nearly everyone in the studio onto the project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We have always been a multi-project studio, so we’ve never really had everyone working on the same game at the same time, and figuring out how to best divide production responsibilities among such a large group was tricky. We broke the action sections of the game (such as the zombie attacks) out into their own strike teams, while a different group owned the dialogue-driven parts. All in all, the studio quickly turned out some amazing content, but we were still weeks behind on episode two, and our schedule was still getting stretched out as far as it possibly could.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the end, episode two ended up in customer’s hands nine weeks after episode one was released. Though this was an amazingly short time given the circumstances, customers were understandably anxious, and didn’t hesitate to let us know it. Our forums and Facebook pages were swarmed with people demanding their episode, and we didn’t do an adequate job of communicating what was happening.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By keeping the whole studio focused on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we were able to make up most of the time. We wrapped the series just a few weeks short of its originally planned completion date.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Backend servers and DLC">Backend servers and DLC</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was our first game in which each episode was delivered as DLC instead of individual executables. This required a new “in-app” store, new content licensing code, and new download managers. That’s a lot of “new,” and furthermore, each platform had its own unique DLC quirks and complexities. iOS even required us to implement our own content delivery network! DLC also presented an entirely new QA process from simply staging content on partner networks, installing and uninstalling individual episodes, and controlling the licensing status of content on all our test accounts. We had a lot to learn about DLC.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition to DLC, the game was also the first to send telemetry back to the Telltale servers so we could present the choice statistics at the end of the episode. We created a new REST API specifically to handle this data, which required new code both on the web servers and in the game engine itself. Both of these changes were substantial, and they ended up being a lot of work to bite off with an important title like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Walking Dead</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but we felt that the game would suffer significantly without these features.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When we launched, the game was incredibly well received, and our servers were quickly overwhelmed with the volume of hits they were receiving. When the servers stopped responding to the game, it would cause noticeable delays at the Press Start screen and at some save points during the episode. For the first few days, we actually ended up throwing incoming data away and serving a stock reply while we frantically brought more servers online.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On Xbox and PlayStation, the system handled the download of new episodes for us, but on iOS, the application also had to download the content for the user. This required a download manager, which turned out to have many more problems in the real world than we anticipated. Mobile devices tend to have significantly more network connection problems than PCs or consoles, and we just weren’t able to simulate the wide array of real-world circumstances we would encounter. Unfortunately this meant that too many iOS players had to suffer with us as we pored through our server logs, download code, and test cases to finally get the download manager as robust as it needed to be.</span></p><p>Image via Game Developer Magazine, March 2013.</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Bugs, bugs, bugs">Bugs, bugs, bugs</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Between the compressed schedule, the new DLC model, and the work required to launch on many platforms, we ended up with a lot of bugs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The worst of these was related to our save game “rewind” system, which allowed the user to rewind the story an earlier point in the game. Since most of the episodes didn’t exist when the system was implemented, we didn’t have the test cases required to ferret out the edge cases that occurred in the real world. Unfortunately, that meant that some players lost their save data and had to replay the game from the beginning, which is about the worst thing that can happen to a player in a choicebased episodic game. Another bug caused the “generate random choices” dialogue to appear when in fact no random choices needed to be generated, which just made the players who were anxious about losing their save data even more worried.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition, each platform had its individual list of bugs, as well as the usual permutations of hardware-specific PC bugs, which made it very difficult for us to communicate solutions to the player. We found that many angry customers had to navigate a complex maze of information to find their solution. Even the best-intentioned users often ended up advising other users with solutions that worked in their context, but might be disastrous in another context. For example, some users would “tweak” their data to recover a save game, and other users might try a similar strategy, but end up destroying their save data. Obviously the root of the problem is the buggy system itself, as users should never have needed to attempt any of these things in the first place.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though we’ve aggressively patched these issues and resolved most of them, you can’t really unring a bell.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> developer Bungie has acknowledged it is "investigating a potential issue within [its] code for how RNG perks are generated" despite previously assuring players there was "no perk weighting active for any legendary weapon perks in Destiny 2".</p>
<p>For the last week or so, Destiny 2 fans have been debating if the "god roll" for its latest grenade launcher, VS Chill Inhibitor - "Envious Arsenal" and "Bait and Switch" - was being throttled. Despite both perks falling on other weapons with relative frequency, the chance of getting VS Chill Inhibitor with both perks was vanishingly slim, making some think Bungie was intentionally tipping the RNG scale to ensure this roll dropped very, <em>very</em> infrequently.</p>
<p>Cue "Weightgate".</p>

<p>At first, Bungie was clear: "Hey all, we had a conversation with our Sandbox folks this morning about this. There is no perk weighting active for any legendary weapon perks in Destiny 2," the Destiny support team <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1848473860905308232">insisted</a> on X/Twitter.</p>
<p>"We have added perk attunement for Exotic Class Items in a recent update, but that's a different system."</p>
<p>The issue, however, becomes impossible to ignore when you look at the stats on sites like <a href="https://www.light.gg/db/items/1762785662/vs-chill-inhibitor/?p=,,,,,0,0">light.gg</a>, a database that scrapes weapon perks from player inventories (cheers, <a href="http://v/">PC Gamer</a>).</p> <div>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, a few days later Bungie posted to X/Twitter "regarding further reports of perk weighting", saying that whilst it has "confirmed that there is no intentional perk weighting on weapons within our content setup", it acknowledged that something was up, and was "now investigating a potential issue within our code for how RNG perks are generated".</p>
<p>"Many thanks to all players who have been contributing to data collection across the community. This data has been monumentally helpful with our investigation, and we are currently working on internal simulations to confirm your findings," the team said.</p> <div>

<p>At the time of writing, Bungie is still investigating, but says it will provide more information "as soon as it is available".</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Bungie unveiled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-and-neteast-unveil-free-to-play-mobile-shooter-destiny-rising-with-closed-alpha-coming-soon">Destiny: Rising, a free-to-play mobile version of its sci-fi shooter series</a> developed in collaboration with Chinese publisher NetEase, that's set to receive a "limited access closed alpha test" on iOS and Android this November.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered PC system requirements were <a href="https://x.com/NixxesSoftware/status/1849828271372026120" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> today, detailing the type of system configuration required to play the game at different resolutions, 30 and 60 frames per second, and with different graphics presets.</p>
<p>To run the game at 720p resolution at 30 frames per second at the Very Low preset, players require an Intel Core i3-8100 or AMD Ryzen 1300x CPU, GTX 1650 4 GB or AMD Radeaon RX 5500 XT4 4GB an 16 GB of RAM. On the other hand, to enjoy the game at its best at the Very High preset, 4K resolution, and 60 frames per second, players will need an Intel i7-11700 or AMD Ryzen 7 5700X CPU, RTX 4080 or Radeon RX 7900 XT GPU and 16 GB of RAM.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Horizon-Zero-Dawn-Remastered-PC-system-requirements-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Judging from the infographic above, the Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered PC system requirements are essentially the same as those of Forbidden West, so those who had no trouble running the second entry in the series released earlier this year on PC shouldn't have much trouble running the remaster of the first, which comes with some impressive enhancements as detailed <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-greatly-enhanced-visuals-performance/">earlier this week.</a></p>
<p>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered launches on October 31st on PC and PlayStation 5. The remaster will be available for only $10 to owners of the original release.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/river-of-gold-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/river-of-gold-review-gold-for-gameplay-bronze-for-theme.1019478/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/river-of-gold-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Running centrally through almost the entirety of Rokugan, the <em>River of Gold</em> connects all but the Northernmost clans with the central trade. Influence there means power across the continent. Welcome to <em>River of Gold</em>, a board game set in the <em>Legend of the Five Rings</em> setting. I was just sent a review copy of <em>River of Gold</em>, so let's&nbsp;have a look at the core board game, and see how deep the theme runs throughout.</p>

<p>I've been playing <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/legend-of-five-rings-rpg-review-l5r-rpg-core-rulebook-and-games-masters-kit"><em>Legend of the Five Rings</em> (<em>L5R</em>)</a> since the first edition roleplaying and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/legend-of-five-rings-lcg-review-new-dynasty">collectible card game (CCG)</a> when it was first published in 1995, and I've played all editions through its life, to the last living card game incarnation of the card game, and the current edition of the roleplaying game by Edge Studios.</p>

<p>When I heard they were making a board game set focused on merchants, over the standard samurai, courtiers, and shugenja (magic users in the world of Rokugan), my only hope was that they still kept the wonderful and incredibly detailed theme of the setting. With nearly 30 years worth of lore, this could be an incredible way to introduce a whole new market of gamers to this rich world of <em>Legend of the Five Rings</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/river-of-gold-2.jpg?itok=pd5GUvsN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/river-of-gold-2.jpg?itok=6dOmBMQE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>River of Gold</em> components look incredible laid out on the tabletop [Photo: Office Dog Games].</figcaption></figure><h2>How Do You Play <em>River Of Gold</em>?</h2>

<p>The aim of <em>River of Gold</em> is to score victory points, and these can be achieved by delivering orders or trade goods, gaining influence along the river by building buildings, and claiming masteries, which are competitive goals.</p>

<p>The turn phase for each player is simple, streamlined, and adds a real pace to the game. Players roll a dice at the end of their turn, which gives them time to plan their next turn while other players are taking theirs. At the start of their turn, they can use divine favor points to modify their dice, and then they get a choice of 3 actions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/river-of-gold-7.jpg?itok=tBIIINBC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/river-of-gold-7.jpg?itok=0a9u95Iz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Players get a choice of buildings to place in <em>River of Gold</em>, and these also determine the pace of the game, moving the game into the next era when enough have been built.</figcaption></figure><p>Players can either build a building along the river, which gives some immediate rewards, and also rewards you when other players visit your shore space. Buildings also gain you influence in the area, moving you along an influence track, which gains you further rewards and victory points during the end game.</p>

<p>Or players can also choose to sail one of their ships along the river (players get 2 ships, which start the game at different points on the river) which gains you visitor rewards for the areas you visit, and also owner rewards for those who own buildings in those areas. The final action choice is to deliver to a customer.</p>

<p>At the start of the game, players draw 2 customer cards that detail the customer's request. By fulfilling the customer's request, players gain an ongoing ability, and also an end-game effect to help with scoring.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/river-of-gold-4.jpg?itok=7r0FG6jc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/river-of-gold-4.jpg?itok=KODPWJH4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>River of Gold</em> includes custom dice with a number and a symbol that tie into each available action.</figcaption></figure><p>Each of the above action choices is influenced by the dice roll, which all have matching numbers and symbols. Players can move spaces equal to the dice, build in one of the 6 shore areas that match their dice, or deliver to a customer who also has a matching die number at the top of their card (there are 5 customer types, each with 6 cards to match each dice number/symbol). So there is some element of randomness, but as mentioned above, you can change your dice roll with your limited divine favor points.</p>

<p>The pace of the game is kept going by the 2 eras that are controlled by the building track. Once enough buildings have been built, 2nd-era building tiles start to appear, triggering the start of the 2nd-era, with the final phase for each player starting when the last 2nd-era building tile hits the board. The simplicity of the turn keeps games moving, even with 4 players, and there's a lot to think about when choosing your actions.</p>

<p>You want buildings so that you're getting visit rewards as players sail, but you also want to deliver to customers to get the ongoing benefits from that, and you also want to sail yourself in order to get money to build buildings, but you also want to stop your opponent's from getting the things that they want in certain areas.</p>

<p>It all comes together for a very light, but strategic non-confrontational game, very much like the courts of Rokugan, where you can never outright challenge, but you can make passive-aggressive remarks, and make moves to stop your opponents, rather than aggressively attacking them.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/river-of-gold-3.jpg?itok=3rJ92XPj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/river-of-gold-3.jpg?itok=7QidSr28 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>River of Gold</em> lets you play with 4 of the <em>L5R</em> Great Clans.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Clans Can You Play In River Of Gold?</h2>

<p><em>River of Gold</em> has 4 clans that you can play, the Crab, Crane, Mantis, and Scorpion. But your clan choice has no in-game effect other than changing the color of your pieces, and the flavor text on the reverse of your player board (which you never see because you use the other side of it in the game.</p>

<p>There is an included Clan Patrons expansion to the game, where you can pick or randomly determine which of the 2 patrons you use for each clan (each clan has 2 unique patrons), and this gives you a benefit throughout the game. This adds an element of theme that ties into the clans themselves.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/river-of-gold-6.jpg?itok=ITRGBQ40 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/river-of-gold-6.jpg?itok=1E6PHGkn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>River of Gold</em> has an included mini-expansion, Clan Patrons, that adds some <em>L5R</em> theme to the game.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Deep Is the <em>Legend Of The Five Rings</em> Theme In <em>River Of Gold</em>?</h2>

<p><em>River of Gold</em> has got some beautiful components, and it looks very <em>L5R</em>. There's a great map in the back of the rulebook that will help new players immerse themselves in the Rokugan setting, and there's incredible artwork used throughout. But other than the Clan Patrons mini-expansion, the theme is skin only, and this could be any setting and wouldn't change the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <em>L5R</em> clans are all vastly different, with their own unique flavor, strengths, and weaknesses, and it feels like a missed opportunity not to have capitalized on this. No one trusts the Scorpions, the Mantis are considered lower than the other clans, because while a major clan, they are made up of several smaller clans, and the Crane and Crab hate each other. The Crab are very warlike, defending the continent against the horrors that live in the Shadowlands, and because of this, they favor anything that lets them win, over what the other clans would consider honorable. But none of this comes through in <em>River of Gold</em>.</p>

<p>The mini-expansion goes some way, but for the effort it took to include cards, they could have easily just included some optional rules for each clan on their clan board. Given each clan an ability, a restriction, or a goal that they have to achieve to gain extra rewards, or penalties for not achieving at the end.</p>

<p>This would have kept the balance of the core game, but given <em>L5R</em> fans and those new to the setting, a deeper feel for the theme, and not have made it feel so soulless when such a deep setting has been used to promote the mechanics.</p>

<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On <em>River Of Gold</em>?</h2>

<p><i>River of Gold </i>is a great game. It looks beautiful, play is fluid, fun, and challenging, but it feels like a copout to use such a deep setting, and then not include anything beyond a couple of cards on the theme. Hopefully, new players will be drawn in to explore more of the setting because <em>L5R</em> is incredible, but for an <em>L5R</em> fan, this feels like a missed opportunity to make an incredible <em>L5R</em> board game, about an element not usually covered in the roleplaying or card games.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy <em>River Of Gold</em>?</h2>

<p>If you want a solid board game that's easy to play, doesn't have direct confrontation, and also looks beautiful on your tabletop, then <em>River of Gold</em> will hit the spot. If you're looking for a board game that looks into the rich theme and narrative of the <em>Legend of the Five Rings</em> setting, then beyond the Clan Patrons mini-expansion (which does add a little depth to each clan), you won't find much here beyond the <em>L5R</em> art and capturing of the setting in the components.</p>

                <p>In 1997, one of the most-remembered moments from Final Fantasy 7 was the murder of a beloved companion character, which resonated throughout the rest of the game and all of its subsequent follow-up media. Final Fantasy 7's narrative hinges on that moment, and there didn't seem to be any way around it without cheats until now.</p><p><strong>Spoiler warning: If you don't know who dies in this 27-year-old game or don't want to know, stop reading now.</strong></p><p>Aerith Gainsborough meets her end at the hands of Sephiroth, but as related by a Final Fantasy 7 speedrunner who goes by Luzbel, a way to skip past Aerith's death was found by two other players: AceZephyr and Kuma.</p><p>The way to pull it off is more of a glitch than a cheat. When the player is riding a chocobo on the world map, there's nothing that prevents them from walking to the Forgotten Capital, the site of Aeirth's murder. If Aeirth is in the player's party, she'll see her own death and fight alongside the player against Jenova. The downside to this approach is that players won't have a high level during the fight, and according to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/newly-discovered-final-fantasy-7-glitch-finally-lets-you-save-beloved-character" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, the game will "softlock" during cutscenes if Aerith is in the party after the timeframe of her death.</p><p>Aerith's fate was also one of the primary plot points in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-destinys-child/1900-6418187/" data-ref-id="1900-6418187">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> earlier this year, which demonstrates her enduring popularity among fans of the new series. The newly discovered glitch in the original game may spare Aeirth from death, but it's not a perfect solution, and she wasn't really meant to survive.</p>
