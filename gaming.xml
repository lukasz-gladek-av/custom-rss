Nintendo's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> won't be hit by the same component shortages that blighted the launch of other recent consoles and led to months of product scarcity and scalping. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking to investors this week, Nintendo <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/qa2406e.pdf">said</a> it had now "resolved" the issue which had seen it unable to manufacture enough Switch 1 hardware to meet demand in previous years. Both Sony, with PlayStation, and Microsoft, with Xbox, faced similar shortages for their own parts. 
</p>
<p>
"That situation has now been resolved," Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said of Switch 1 stock. "As for the
successor to Nintendo Switch, at present we do not think shortages of components will significantly affect production."

<p>
Indeed, Nintendo said it felt positive about its ability to launch and supply Switch 2 consoles overall, as it was taking steps to ensure its expected release next year went as smoothly as possible.
</p>
<p>
"We believe that the most important countermeasure against reselling is to produce enough units to meet demand," Furukawa continued. "This thinking has not changed since last year. In addition, we are taking into account circumstances in each region and considering what measures can be taken within
the limits permitted by law."
</p>
<p>
Nintendo is yet to formally announce Switch 2 or detail when it will likely arrive, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-now-q1-2025-report">Eurogamer understands the console is now due in 2025</a>, following earlier plans to launch it in time for Christmas 2024.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, don't expect Switch 1 to get any cheaper, either.
</p>
<p>
"Currently, we cannot provide any information about the launch timing or pricing strategy for the successor system," Furukawa concluded. "In addition, we are not currently considering a price change for Nintendo Switch." 
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">Nintendo has said it will make the announcement of Switch 2</a> before the end of "this fiscal year" - so before 31st March 2025.

            <p>It looks like we won’t get a remake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space-2">Dead Space 2</a> in the style of last year’s excellent do-over of the original limb-shooting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror game</a>, but it turns out that Dead Space isn’t completely, uh, dead just yet. Though to what degree you could consider it alive and well - reanimated in a twisted form of its previous glory, perhaps - is another question entirely.</p>

<p>EA’s space-horror series is finding its way into the next season of Battlefield 2042, inspiring a new horde-extraction mode called Outbreak that will run from July 9th to 16th as part of the shooter’s seventh - and final - season Turning Point. (The game is also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1517290/Battlefield_2042/">90% off over on Steam</a> at the moment ahead of its swan song season.)</p>
<p>The time-limited event doesn’t quite star the The Thing-like necromorphs found aboard Dead Space’s Ishimura space station, opting instead for decidedly more human-like zombies-slash-infected-slash-whatever (presumably to make it easier to shoot them in the head, instead of wondering where their head even is) that will try and overwhelm the players’ squad as they attempt to defeat waves of enemies, buy new gear as they advance and extract from each level without losing their single life.</p>

<p>Don’t expect to find the limb-slicing plasma cutter in your armoury, either, although the teaser trailer for the crossover does show a character decked out in Isaac’s glowing engineer suit and helmet. That’ll join the usual selection of weapon skins, charms, player cards and other cosmetics able to be unlocked through the event itself and bought from the in-game store.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space-remake">Dead Space remake</a> developers Motive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-space-remake-devs-ea-motive-are-building-a-team-to-work-on-future-battlefield-projects">now split between working on Battlefield and developing their Iron Man game</a>, it seems like - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-space-2-remake-reportedly-shelved-due-to-poor-sales-of-the-first-game">for whatever reason</a> - we won’t be getting a remake of Dead Space 2 anytime soon. Whether a one-week crossover event with Battlefield is really the brightest sign for the series’ future, I’m not convinced - but I suppose it’s at least acknowledgement that someone, somewhere in EA is thinking about Dead Space, if nothing else.</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 5 has been out for over a decade, but players never got any sort of single-player DLC during its life span. And while we know there <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-leak-dlcs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were reportedly plans</a> for up to eight DLCs, one specifically that was centered around Trevor was canceled because of the powerhouse that is GTA Online.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uikfph7oQoE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTuber SanInPlay</a>, former Rockstar developer Joseph Rubino talked about the canceled Trevor DLC for GTA 5 and why it never saw the light of day.</p>



<p>“We split our teams into two, so I stayed on GTA Online and then this DLC — which Steven Ogg was a very important part of — and then some of the team overlapped and went to [Red Dead Redemption 2] early on,” Rubino said.</p>



<p>As far as the content of the DLC, Rubino says he believes that a lot of the stuff planned and developed ultimately found its way into GTA Online. He couldn’t recall any specifics of what made it, but believed they did. The DLC itself was supposed to feature Trevor as some sort of undercover agent.</p>

<p>As to why the DLC never happened, Rubino says it had to do with the money that GTA Online was making right off the bat.</p>



<p>“When GTA Online came out, it was so much of a cash cow and people were loving it so much that it was hard to make an argument that a standalone DLC would out-compete that,” he said. “I think looking back now I would say that you could probably do both, but that was a business decision that they made and I was a little upset about that.”</p>



<p>He added that the development of the content was roughly halfway done before it was shelved.</p>

"Born of red-maned Radagon, and Rennala of the Full Moon. A lion bred for battle."

The game upgraded to Unreal Engine 5 this year. Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>“Enterprising Pioneers are tasked with charting and exploiting a vast and diverse alien planet to construct and automate intricate multi-story factories. Players must also defend themselves against hostile alien lifeforms, automate vehicles, and research new technologies to keep improving their constructs.”</blockquote><p>1.0 brings with it “premium plumbing”, which means the HUB’s “once trivial toilet has been updated with an advanced flushing mechanism, providing an extra luxurious worker experience for fans.” Check that out in the trailer below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Satisfactory entered early access in March 2019 and has received eight major updates and hundreds of smaller updates in the years since. The 5.5 million sales figure is the result of a sizeable community that continues to play now, and the 1.0 launch will surely see another jolt of interest.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/satisfactory-1-0-release-date-and-uh-flushable-toilets-revealed.919785/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/satisfactory-10-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Coffee Stain has announced the&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory&nbsp;</em>1.0 release date, and the factory sim is leaving Early Access in just a couple of months, bringing lots of new features as part of its full release.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/526870/view/4270057097478183701" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam announcement</a>,&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory&nbsp;</em>launches in full on September 10th, and perhaps most importantly, you'll finally be able to flush the toilet in the HUB when 1.0 arrives. Your living conditions are about to improve!</p>
<p>If you really need to know about the other features (which, of course, you don't, because flushing toilets are pretty much all any game needs), then you'll be pleased to know there is other stuff coming to&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory&nbsp;</em>for its 1.0 release as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/satisfactory-1.0-release-date-planet.jpg?itok=SuSTCZhs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/satisfactory-1.0-release-date-planet.jpg?itok=APS9SydW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Satisfactory&nbsp;</em>1.0 is launching in just a couple of months.</figcaption></figure><p>Resource nodes have received a major overhaul in&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory&nbsp;</em>1.0; a number have been either added, altered, or removed, with the bulk of reductions occurring in the game's Northern Forest zone to encourage players to spread their wings.</p>
<p>Changes have also been made to recipe costs in order to "promote smoother transitions" between recipe tiers, with particular attention being paid to late-game recipes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also look forward to changes to research trees, power generators, and more, as well as technical optimizations across the board. Of course, none of this actually matters, because I've already mentioned the flushing toilets.</p>
<p>Coffee Stain has released a rather tongue-in-cheek trailer to mark the impending arrival of&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory&nbsp;</em>1.0, and you'll never guess what feature it focuses on. Here's the trailer in all its glory.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory</em>, it's a factory sim that allows you to build a complex network of machines and "enter conveyor belt heaven", as Coffee Stain puts it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Satisfactory&nbsp;</em>also offers a touch of combat and exploration alongside its building gameplay, so if you prefer your factory sims with a dash of danger, this is definitely the one to look at.</p>
<p>The game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/goat-simulator-devs-coffee-stain-tease-new-project-satisfactory">revealed in March 2018</a>&nbsp;and was initially <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/satisfactory-early-access-release-date-set-for-march-2019">set for an Early Access release in 2019</a>, although it wouldn't actually see the light of day until the following year. Since launch, it's received a number of updates, adding features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/satisfactory-update-7-brings-blueprints-and-more">blueprints</a>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/satisfactory-update-7-brings-blueprints-and-more">biome overhaul</a>, and more.</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory&nbsp;</em>1.0 when it launches on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/526870/Satisfactory/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/satisfactory" rel="sponsored" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a>&nbsp;on September 10th, and if you can't wait that long, the Early Access version is available right now.</p>

            <p>Epic Games has referred Apple to the European Commission for rejecting its notarisation submission, alleging Apple's refusal is "arbitrary, obstructive, and in violation of the Digital Markets Act (DMA)".</p>
<p>In a statement posted to X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, Epic said Apple had taken issue with its call-to-action buttons, claiming both its "Get" and "In-app purchases" buttons are too similar in design to Apple's own buttons.</p>
<p>Epic says it is using the words "install" and "in-app purchases" as this follows naming conventions that app users are already familiar with.</p>

<p>"Apple has rejected our Epic Games Store notarisation submission twice now, claiming the design and position of Epic's 'Install' button is too similar to Apple's 'Get' button and that our 'In-app purchases' label is too similar to the App Store's 'In-App Purchases' label," Epic Games said.</p>

<p>"Apple's rejection is arbitrary, obstructive, and in violation of the DMA, and we've shared our concerns with the European Commission," Epic concluded. "Barring further roadblocks from Apple, we remain ready to launch in the Epic Games Store and Fortnite on iOS in the EU in the next couple of months."</p>
<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eu-opens-fresh-investigation-into-apple-following-further-non-compliance-claims">EU regulators recently opened a new investigation</a> following claims <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eu-takes-aim-at-apple-google-meta-non-compliance">Apple is not complying with EU rules</a>.</p>
<p>The European Commission – which started <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eu-takes-aim-at-apple-google-meta-non-compliance">investigating Apple's alleged non-compliance</a> back in March – has accused Apple of breaching its Digital Markets Act, meaning Apple could face a fine of up to 10 percent of the firm's global annual revenue. That may not sound like much, but when you consider that Apple generates £301bn ($383bn) a year, that's a sizeable punishment.</p>
<p>As Tom explained for us at the time, Apple's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-returning-to-ios-says-epic-as-apple-agrees-to-alternative-app-marketplaces-in-eu">previously-announced solution to satisfy DMA rules has drawn fire</a> over its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-returning-to-ios-says-epic-as-apple-agrees-to-alternative-app-marketplaces-in-eu">fees and limits, which make launching games or apps outside of the App Store costly</a> – something long-time legal rival Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney called "hot garbage".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-pledges-action-over-inappropriate-use-of-its-characters-so-players-not-made-to-feel-uncomfortable<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Nintendo has responded to concern over the inappropriate use of its characters online and said it would take "appropriate action" against anything that would make some players "feel uncomfortable".
</p>
<p>
Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa was <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/qa2406e.pdf">recently</a> questioned by a shareholder who said they had "come across cases on social media where Nintendo IP and games are used inappropriately". This "inappropriate" use of Nintendo's characters "poses the risk of damaging" the company's brand, the question continued - so what was Nintendo planning to do about it?
</p>
<p>
In response, Furukawa said Nintendo's management policy was to "bring smiles through entertainment" (but presumably not the kind of smiles generated by "inappropriate" use).

<p>
"I will refrain from commenting on individual cases, but we believe that appropriate action must be taken against any behaviour that undermines this policy," Furukawa continued, without specifying what that action might entail. 
</p>
<p>
"Our goal is to create an environment where everyone can enjoy playing games. We will continue to make every effort to ensure that our consumers are not made to feel uncomfortable, not only in our games but also anywhere they come into contact with our IP."
</p>
<p>
Of course, fans have been using Nintendo characters for "inappropriate" reasons for a very, very long time. The most high-profile example of this in recent memory was a certain Bowsette - a spicy fan mash-up of Peach and Bowser that Nintendo initially <a href="https://www.j-cast.com/2018/09/25339499.html?p=all">refused</a> to comment on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bowsette-is-trending-on-twitter">when it went viral</a> and trended on social media worldwide, and then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-pooh-poohs-bowsette">later ruled as non-canon</a>.
</p>
<p>
Few creators address the use of their characters by fans for less-than-appropriate reasons. Why? Well, I'm reminded of when Ken Levine once asked <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1o09p2/we_are_ken_levine_iglevine_and_andres_gonzalez/">reddit</a> to stop drawing naughty pictures of Elizabeth from BioShock Infinite. Simply put, it doesn't work. 
</p>
<p>
People will always be horny, especially Nintendo fans. 
</p>
<p>But perhaps it's worth remembering - Nintendo is watching.</p>

        <p>The Viper will become less ‘busy’, with other changes for Astrologian, Black Mage, tanks and more from 7.01</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail">Dawntrail</a>, the latest expansion for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy XIV</a>, has officially been out just three days, arriving earlier this week after a brief early access release. Despite its story and extra 10 levels spanning dozens of hours of playtime, that’s apparently been ample time for players to complain loudly enough about one of the expansion’s brand new jobs - so much so that Square Enix have already announced a set of incoming changes planned across the game’s next run of patches.</p>
<!--more-->
<div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span> </p>
</div>
<p>In a <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/e2da42164b4e6c9967ebb2e41d6321a515d36909">blog post</a> that also dropped the tidbit that Dawntrail’s release saw the MMO reach its highest concurrent player count since the release of base game A Realm Reborn over a decade ago, director Naoki ‘Yoshi-P’ Yoshida detailed various fixes and changes planned for multiple classes from patch 7.01 onward.</p>
<p>The headline changes will tweak the Viper, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-14s-new-viper-job-is-a-dual-wielding-blademaster-thats-new-to-the-entire-series">dual sword-wielding class introduced in Dawntrail</a>. Players have spent enough time with the new job to raise concerns about its skill rotation being too “busy”, leading to plans to reduce its demand for directional requirements and tweak the effect of various actions. Most of that reduced “busyness” will come in with patch 7.05, Yoshida said, though there’ll be some adjustments to the range of some actions in the next patch.</p>
<p>Dawntrail’s other new job, the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-14s-new-jobs-bring-a-splash-of-splatoon-and-pokemon-to-its-dawntrail-expansion">artistic mage Pictomancer</a>, will instead see a smaller bug fix that solves the issue of effects for the Subtractive Palette, Aetherhues and Aetherhues II being possible to manually disable by players, which will be included in 7.01.</p>
<p>One older job in for some fixes is the Monk, which will look to address what Yoshida called an “inadequate performance” caused by the wrong potencies for some actions and an issue with stacking the Fury status, both accidentally introduced as part of wider changes to core Monk attacks in 7.0 that the producer said “significantly changed how it feels to play the job”. The next patch will help make area-of-effect attacks better again, with “minor adjustments” to the Monk’s HUD as a result.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-krile-pictomancer.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Square Enix</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Elsewhere, the Astrologian job has apparently received “considerable feedback” from players about being hard to use during damage burst phases of battles, which will be addressed by changing the recast time of Light Speed and making it a charged action, as well as dropping the recast time of the job’s draw actions. Level 90 action Macrocosmos will also see its potency tweaked.</p>
<p>The Samurai will similarly see some recast timers shortened - for Tendo Setsugekka and Tendo Kaeshi Setsugekka, specifically - while the Red Mage will have the effect time of Manafication lengthened. Black Mages struggling to recover MP without the Umbral Soul action should also find it easier from the next patch on, with other attack potencies being adjusted in 7.05.</p>
<p>Tanks as a whole will also be changed, as players have expressed that remaining the target of enemies using Enmity has become difficult due to the high-damage attacks of other jobs, made particularly difficult for Dark Knight and Gunbreaker characters who have seen damage removed from their movement abilities. Those movement abilities will have increased enmity effects added in 7.01, with extra enmity also added to area-of-effect attacks.</p>
<p>The changes will roll out over the next couple of patches, with Yoshida also assuring that “several issues that may have proven a hinderance to your overall experience” aside from the job complaints will also be resolved as soon as possible. Otherwise, Dawntrail’s rollout seems to have been far smoother than the hours-long queues suffered by previous expansion <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-endwalker">Endwalker</a>, in part thanks to some shiny new servers and other <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-14-braces-for-dawntrail-login-queues-with-plans-to-limit-travel-and-crack-down-on-afk-players">congestion-easing measures</a> put in place ahead of the launch.</p>

            <p>
We never covered the original Nocturnal, an “intense 3-hour-long action-platformer” from Sunnyside Games, but the Steam user reception seems very positive for a pay-upfront game that actively describes itself as three hours long, and the just-announced sequel seems excellently awash with fire, darkness and death. It’s a “fast-paced, juggle-based” 2D metroidvania that stands apart for a couple of reasons. Firstly, your character’s magic sword is also your means of illumination, and the levels are gloomy. And secondly, the whole “juggle-based” thing.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
In Nocturnal 2, you search the forgotten island city of Ytash for the First Brazier, which very much sounds like an earlygame Souls objective. The 2D levels and art, however, put me in mind of Capybara’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/below">Below</a>, except viewed from a classique Prince of Persia perspective. It’s certainly an atmospheric setting, abundant in pillared doorways and negative space – and a hazardous one, especially when you can’t see the nameless things you’re fighting.
</p>
<p>
“Keeping your Flame alight is your only way to survive the many dangers ahead,” instructs <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2847780/Nocturnal_2/">the Nocturnal 2 Steam page</a>. “Maintain it at any cost by striking fire sources and protect it to better see the enemy attacks.” You will find that your incendiary attacks are all the more potent when performed against aerial foes. “Master your flames to hurl enemies and juggle them into ashes,” the Steam page goes on. I’m not sure that’s how thermodynamics works, but I’d be a fool to complain. There are also fire gems you can mix and match to unlock spells.
</p>
<p>
A single playthrough may not take you much longer than the original Nocturnal – which, frankly, now looks like a prototype for this game – but you’ll want to complete it several times to discover everything. “Nocturnal 2 is meant to be consumed in a relatively short amount of time, but many surprises are on the menu for those who seek different paths…and true revelations,” the Steam page concludes. I hope those are genuinely revelatory revelations and not, for example, unlockable wallpapers. Nocturnal 2 will be lighting up screens in 2025. If you like the sound of the original, it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1634080/Nocturnal_Enhanced_Edition/">60% off till 11th July</a> as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-how-were-all-spending-our-last-tenner-on-the-best-deals-in-the-steam-summer-sale">the latest Steam summer sale</a>.

            <p>Early 2022 was a glorious time to be on Twitter. I mean, obviously it wasn’t, but it was still <em>named</em> Twitter. That’s something, right? May accelerated absurdity re-contextualise all your hells as, like, still hells but with air conditioning. It was February that year when Gearbox writer Sam Winkler done a funny tweet about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>. Here’s the tweet:</p>
 <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Dark Souls revolutionized games, in the sense that instead of a story now you can just have some guy with a big sword named Myrmidon of Loss who gasps “Zanzibart… forgive me” when he dies and then twenty YouTubers will make an hour long video about how deep your lore is</p>— Sam Winkler (@ThatSamWinkler) <a href="https://twitter.com/ThatSamWinkler/status/1490070305859162113?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 5, 2022</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>The tweet got a lot of attention because it was very funny, and also because a lot of people are very sensitive about Dark Souls and think they’re very clever for understanding what environmental storytelling is, and got unnecessarily mad about it. Much mirth and soapstone clutching followed, Twitter moved on, a twat spent billions of dollars on it so he could stop HardDrive sharing that picture of him and Ghislaine Maxwell, world kept turning.</p>
<p>But! After encountering a hidden boss in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a>, it occurred to me there’s a small chance that someone at FromSoft - or maybe the localisation team - may have seen that tweet, and decided to have a little fun of their own. <strong>Big large spoilers</strong> ahead, obviously.</p>
<p>So, after finding your way past a maze of elevators and invisible walls, and probably an ulcerated tree spirit or two let's be honest, you’ll arrive in a large secret area named the Abyssal Woods. Deeper on in the woods, you’ll find one of the best mini-dungeons in the game, capped off by a boss. You can check out the fight below - courtesy of 'tuber Shirrako - but you only really need to watch the intro cutscene.</p> <figure>

<p>“I ask you forgive me, dearest Nanaya,” Midra sadly croaks in one of his very few dialogue lines, in a vague lament oddly reminiscent of Winkler’s tweet. Yes, yes, pass the back-putting-out-boluses for my incredible reach, but I’m still putting the chances of this being a cheeky wink at non-zero. Although Nanaya’s quite an easy NPC to learn about, to be fair, since you’ll find some items related to them on the path to Midra.</p>
<p>Still, even if it’s nothing, I’m glad to be reminded of one of my favourite gently mocking FromSoft tweets, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/me_irl/comments/8o8t19/me_irl/">alongside this classic</a>. Although I would posit that Big Hat Logan’s presence as comic relief actually contrasts against the prevailing mood of Lordran, further drawing out its mysterious and evocative qualities. Furthermore….</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gaming-business-roundup-july-5th<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's time for another gaming business roundup, and this week, we've got green initiatives in gaming, as well as another round of acquisitions, more layoffs, and some slightly sobering losses for a couple of studios.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at what's been happening this week on the business end (so to speak) of the gaming industry!</p>
<hr><h2><em>Guilty Gear&nbsp;</em>dev Arc System Works opens a new branch</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/arc-system-works-gaming-business.jpg?itok=_wMSp7bn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/arc-system-works-gaming-business.jpg?itok=tjpwHzki 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Arc System Works now has a European presence.</figcaption></figure><p>Arc System Works, best known for fighting games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/guilty-gear-strive-dual-rulers-anime">Guilty Gear</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>BlazBlue</em>, opened a new branch this week, expanding its operations to Europe for the first time.</p>
<p>Catchily named Arc System Works Europe, the branch is <a href="https://www.arcsystemworks.fr/en/news/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">based in Paris</a>, and its first endeavor is the European release of upcoming anime and manga tie-in game&nbsp;<em>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact</em>, which is coming to PC, PS5, and Switch later this year.</p>
<h2>Green initiatives abound in the gaming industry</h2>
<p>The environmental impact of game development is an issue that's becoming more and more pressing for the industry. Whether it's developers <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-dev-claims-gaming-nfts-are-harmful-to-game-design-environment">commenting on the harmful nature of NFTs</a>&nbsp;or indie devs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saltsea-chronicles-climate-report">sharing reports on their climate impact</a>, the green question is one that pressingly needs to be answered.</p>
<p>This week, two new initiatives sprung up that aim to contribute to this conversation.</p>
<p>The first, Make Green Tuesday Moves, sees not-for-profit <a href="https://www.planetplay.com/mgtm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">climate organization Planet Play</a> bringing new DLC to games like&nbsp;<em>Avakin Life&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Subway Surfers&nbsp;</em>in order to highlight green initiatives and projects. The org's first partner is none other than 80s legend David Hasselhoff.</p>
<p>This week also saw the launch of the <a href="https://sustainablegamesalliance.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sustainable Games Alliance</a>, a non-profit dedicated to making the gaming industry "the leader in sustainability" by setting new goals for environmental responsibility.</p>
<h2>Layoffs and losses</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-kenzera-zau-gaming-business.jpg?itok=YTvb-cxz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-kenzera-zau-gaming-business.jpg?itok=hxHwvSZZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau&nbsp;</em>developer Surgent Studios has been hit by layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>Sadly, the gaming industry is still looking a little gloomy, and that means some studios made layoffs this week, while others reported somewhat sobering losses that should give us pause for thought.</p>
<p>In the world of layoffs,&nbsp;<em>Watch Dogs: Legion&nbsp;</em>studio Ubisoft Toronto <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-lays-off-30-ubisoft-toronto-devs-so-it-can-deliver-on-its-ambitious-roadmap" rel="noopener" target="_blank">laid off around 30 employees</a> earlier this week, ostensibly an effort to "deliver on its ambitious roadmap". I'm not much of a fan of that kind of wording.</p>
<p><em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau&nbsp;</em>developer Surgent Studios <a href="https://x.com/surgentstudios/status/1808216664145576284" rel="noopener" target="_blank">also confirmed layoffs this week</a>, letting around a dozen employees go and pointing to a "difficult time in the games industry" as its reason.</p>
<p>Two major companies also announced losses this week, the first of which was&nbsp;<em>Dying Light 2&nbsp;</em>studio Techland, which <a href="https://x.com/MauroNL3/status/1809128485043978480" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lost around $25 million last year</a>.</p>
<p>It joins workhorse studio Tose, which <a href="https://x.com/gosokkyu/status/1808819444178956649" rel="noopener" target="_blank">revised its projection</a> for the financial year ending in August from a 20 million yen profit to a 450 million yen loss owing to the cancellation of projects by some of its partners, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-financials-profits-down">likely including Square Enix</a>. This one hits particularly hard because Tose hasn't posted a loss in 20 years.</p>
<h2>More acquisitions</h2>
<p>This week has also seen a number of studios being acquired or gaining new investment, beginning with legendary iconoclast Devolver Digital, in which publisher Kwalee <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/kwalee-makes-minority-investment-in-devolver-digital" rel="noopener" target="_blank">now owns a 3.58% stake</a>.</p>
<p>Keywords, a large "technical and creative solutions provider" that counts studios like Hardsuit Labs and High Voltage among its roster, was <a href="https://irpages2.equitystory.com/websites/rns_news/English/1100/news-tool---rns---eqs-group.html?article=34403122&amp;company=keywords" rel="noopener" target="_blank">acquired this week</a> by newly-formed UK company Houting UK for a whopping £2.2 billion (roughly $2.81 billion).</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Capcom announced that it has <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240701.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">acquired two thirds</a> of CG production company Minimum Studios' shares, and sports media company Sporty Group <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sporty-group-acquires-sociable-soccer" rel="noopener" target="_blank">acquired the rights to&nbsp;<em>Sensible Soccer&nbsp;</em>spiritual successor&nbsp;<em>Sociable Soccer</em></a>.</p>
<h2>Also in the industry this week</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warlander-publishing-gaming-business.jpg?itok=Ez23F1uk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warlander-publishing-gaming-business.jpg?itok=LzSyx8eI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Warlander&nbsp;</em>is being published by its developer now. Hooray!</figcaption></figure><p>We've just got time for a little look at some of the other stories that have been circulating in the gaming industry this week.</p>
<p>If you're a fan of MOBA-come-hack-and-slash-RPG&nbsp;<em>Warlander</em>, you'll be pleased to know developer Toylogic <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675900/view/4246413199423327840" rel="noopener" target="_blank">took over its publishing duties</a> this week, and if you love military warfare games, then&nbsp;<em>World of Tanks Blitz&nbsp;</em>passing $1 billion in revenue is sure to tickle you.</p>
<p>We also took a detailed look at two major stories in the industry:&nbsp;<em>Palia&nbsp;</em>developer Singularity 6 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palia-singularity-6-daybreak-acquisition">being acquired by Daybreak</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Star Citizen&nbsp;</em>studio Cloud Imperium being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-citizen-discrimination-tribunal">ordered to pay compensation</a> to a disabled employee over a discrimination claim.</p>
<hr><p>That marks the end of another gaming business roundup! There's lots to chew over this week, but make sure you join us again next week, when we'll be taking another look at the industry and all its goings-on.</p>

When used in tandem with the Lighting and/or Frenzyflame perfume bottle, the build was able to evaporate enemies pretty quickly, and in some cases, it’d even one-shot them. </p><p><strong>Spoilers for <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s final boss follow.</strong></p><p>This build became a particularly popular tool for players who were stuck on the DLC’s final boss fight against <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-dlc-radahn-final-boss-tank-all-hit-run-1851566306&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-dlc-radahn-final-boss-tank-all-hit-run-1851566306">Promised Consort Radahn</a></span>, who hits like a goddamn truck and kind of demands you use a cheese strategy—which are often dubbed cheap tricks because they rely on overpowered builds or exploiting something wrong with the game.</p><p>Now, players need to go back to defeating Radahn the good ol’ fashioned way. The update also nerfs the Swift Slash Ash of War (thank goodness) due to its <em>over</em>-effectiveness in PvP, as well as the new thrusting shield weapons, which began to take off in popularity. Guarding while attacking with them wouldn’t consume <em>that </em>much stamina, allowing players to spam attacks on the thrusting shields with little consequence.</p><p>While many new weapons were nerfed, the Carian Sorcery Sword actually had its Intelligence scaling tuned up higher, though its general attack damage was knocked down a bit. This should make it more powerful to use spells via the sword, while appropriately nerfing its raw damage, since that’s rarely the move for anyone prioritizing the Intelligence stat.</p><p>Though weapons are the focus of the balance changes in this patch, it also makes life a little easier as far as two of the DLC’s more demanding boss fights. Both Commander Gaius and the Golden Hippopotamus have had their spawn point fixed. Now, they should begin in a fixed point a fair distance away from the fog gate entrance, so as to not obliterate the player too quickly, which has become a common complaint among players for most of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-boss-difficulty-combos-1851560177&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-dlc-boss-difficulty-combos-1851560177"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s boss encounters</a></span>.</p><p>And so <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fromsoftware-ransomware-hack-elden-ring-bloodborne-2-1851564840&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fromsoftware-ransomware-hack-elden-ring-bloodborne-2-1851564840">FromSoftware</a></span> giveth, but it also taketh away. Given the cadence of these updates, I’d expect a few more balance changes over the next few weeks before the developer decides everything is in its rightful place.

<p>As spotted <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1809239858587586624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by Gematsu</a>, a new <a href="https://x.com/tite_official/status/1809237306882089286" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> from the official Tite Kubo account hints that Bandai Namco could announce a new Bleach game during Anime Expo 2024.</p>



<p>Tite Kubo is popular for their work on the iconic source material, and their post confirms Bleach will appear at Anime Expo. It also teases the Bandai Namco Summer Showcase at Petree Hall, suggesting the two are related.</p>



<p>This is a fairly vague tease that does not officially confirm a Bleach game will appear. Still, Gematsu also pointed out a recent trademark filing for Bleach: Rebirth of Souls, filed last month.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Bandai Namco <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/1807936302140252559" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously announced</a> that its Summer Showcase will return today, July 5, 2024, at 5:30 pm PDT. Fans will also be able to view the event on YouTube and Twitch. </p>



<p>In the same thread, Bandai Namco only confirmed some playable games for the event. Those will include Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero, Sword Art Online Fractured Daydream, and Gundam Breaker 4.</p>



<p>With Bandai Namco potentially adapting Bleach into a game, some fans already speculate it could resemble Sparking Zero. Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero recently got a release date <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for October 11, 2024</a>, and Bandai Namco <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-game-modes-officially-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed its game modes</a> last month.</p>



<p>At this time, Bandai Namco has not issued a statement about a potential Bleach game or its appearance at the Summer Showcase.</p>

After several years in development, the 1.0 version of Satisfactory will launch on September 10, and to mark the occasion, Coffee Stain has released a new trailer celebrating the release date <em>and</em> confirmation of a sought-after feature that will be added in the 1.0 release: premium plumbing.

Available initially on the Epic Games Store, it eventually made its way to Steam and it received several substantial updates--including a shift to Unreal Engine 5--alongside hundreds of smaller tweaks. If you haven't heard of it, imagine a first-person take on Factorio where you string together machinery and assembly lines to exploit all the natural resources on an alien planet, like some sort of Rube Goldberg machine powered by late-stage capitalism.</p><p>Up to four players--or pioneers as they're called in the game--can band together to turn a natural paradise into an industrial hub, although they'll have to deal with hostile alien lifeforms and frequently research new technologies to keep their factories running. In early access, the game has sold over 5.5 million copies so far and it has built a dedicated community of pioneers.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">In a surprise to almost no one, a former Rockstar employee claims that planned Grand Theft Auto V story DLC was canceled because of the blockbuster success of GTA Online. It was "so much of a cash cow" that a Trevor-focused expansion was reportedly shut down after already being in the middle of production.</p><p dir="ltr">Joseph Rubino, who worked at Rockstar from 2010-16 as a senior camera artist and virtual cinematgrapher, spoke to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uikfph7oQoE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTuber SanInPlay</a> about the scrapped Trevor DLC project, per <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/gta-5s-story-dlc-was-scrapped-because-gta-online-was-a-cash-cow-cinematics-editor-claims/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>. "What happened was when GTA Online came out, it was so much of a cash cow and people were loving it so much that it was hard to make an argument that a standalone DLC would out-compete that," Rubino said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As one of the people working on the DLC, Rubino admitted he was "a little sour at the time, because I was like, 'Yo, what the f**k guys, this sh*t's awesome, let's keep going, let's finish this sh*t.'" The developer has worked at Microsoft and Amazon since Rockstar, contributing to projects like Forza Motorsport and The Outer Worlds 2.</p><p dir="ltr">This corroborates Trevor voice actor Steve Ogg revealing earlier this year that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-have-had-a-james-bond-like-story-dlc-actor-says/1100-6522891/" data-ref-id="1100-6522891">GTA V could have had a James Bond-like story DLC</a> focused on his character. Ogg mentioned that he had already recorded lines for the expansion in which Trevor went undercover. Dataminers had previously discovered Agent Trevor references in game files.</p><p dir="ltr">GTA V is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/#9" data-ref-id="2900-4814">one of the best-selling games of all time</a>, now surpassing 200 million copies sold. The game--thanks to GTA Online--also continues to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-most-played-games-recently-on-playstation-xbox-and-steam/2900-5467/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5467">one of the most-played titles on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Looking ahead, GTA VI is planned for a Fall 2025 release window. In May, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-boss-highly-confident-in-fall-2025-release-window/1100-6523562/" data-ref-id="1100-6523562">Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick stated that he felt "highly confident" about that launch timing</a>.</p>
