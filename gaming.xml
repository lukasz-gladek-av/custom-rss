        <p>Development has apparently already finished, suggesting it might wait until the next season of the HBO show</p>

<p>The claims come from <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/mais-quand-sortira-la-version-pc-de-the-last-of-us-part-ii-52283">Dealabs’ Billbil-kun</a>, who has accurately reported similar news around PlayStation PC ports in the past - including the news of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-quarry-devs-horror-hit-until-dawn-is-reportedly-the-next-playstation-exclusive-headed-to-pc">the Until Dawn PC release</a>. According to the reliable leaker, a PC version of The Last of Us 2 has been in the works since at least 2021 - and, most intriguingly, reportedly finished development in last November or earlier.</p>
<p>While there’s no word on whether a Last of Us 2 release on PC would be based on the remaster of the former PS4 exclusive, it seems extremely likely. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-1">The Last of Us Part I</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-last-of-us-part-1-resurrects-on-pc-on-march-3rd-2023">arrived on PC in March of last year</a>, six months after its own remastered re-release of the game formerly known as just <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us">The Last of Us</a> on PS5. That remaster tuned up gameplay elements such as AI and improved visuals for things like lighting, along with adding brand new modes for speedrunning and permadeath. That said, the gap between Part 2’s original release and its remaster was notably shorter, so the leaps in visual improvements and such were a bit less drastic.</p>

</figure>
<p>The Last of Us Part II’s own remaster came to PS5 at the start of this year - meaning that the wait on a PC release may be down to giving the console version a bit of breathing room, hence the wait despite development supposedly being wrapped. Billbil-kun suggested that Part 2’s PC release might not arrive all the way until next year, launching alongside the second season of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hbos-the-last-of-us-makes-history-as-the-first-live-action-video-game-adaptation-nominated-for-major-awards">acclaimed live-action HBO adaptation</a> - which will adapt <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/forget-two-seasons-the-last-of-us-tv-show-co-creator-wants-at-least-three">at least part of</a> the sequel’s fairly brutal story.</p>
<p>With no official word from Sony just yet - and no sign of The Last of Us during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-concord-and-more-everything-pc-relevant-announced-at-playstation-state-of-play-may-2024">their latest State of Play</a> showcase - we’ll have to wait and see for now. With so many PlayStation exclusives finding their way to PC, it seems a given that The Last of Us 2 will cross over at some point. Expect to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghost-of-tsushimas-psn-login-requirement-will-stop-you-playing-multiplayer-on-steam-deck">need to sign in with a PlayStation account</a> when it does, mind.</p>

			<p>With Starfield, Bethesda Game Studios produced its first science fiction IP and decided to make a game with <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-gameplay-revealed-xbox-and-bethesda-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over a thousand explorable planets</a> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-has-100-planets-10-of-total-with-life-on-them/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">100 of which with life on them</a>) to sell the idea of a proper space adventure.</p>
<p>To do so, the developers of Starfield had to <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-will-follow-elder-scrolls-vi-starfields-procedural-generation-discussed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extensively employ procedural generation</a>, which Bethesda had used in some capacity ever since Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall. That game featured over fifteen thousand cities, villages, towns, and dungeons, with a playable area estimated at around 161 thousand square kilometers (real-life Great Britain is 209K square kilometers).</p>
<p>Some of the developers behind Daggerfall are now making a spiritual successor called The Wayward Realms, currently on a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/oncelostgames/the-wayward-realms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kickstarter campaign</a> for funding ahead of an early access debut slated in 2025. <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-wayward-realms-kickstarter-qa-there-are-plenty-of-ways-to-advance-procedural-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In a recent interview with Wccftech</a>, the developers at OnceLost Games shared their belief that Starfield would have benefited from sticking more closely to the Daggerfall procedural generation formula, especially for dungeons.</p>
<p><em>Starfield was enjoyable but took a different approach to procedural generation from ours. We feel it would have benefited from having some Daggerfall-esque “dungeon” generation instead of reusing premade dungeons.</em></p>
<p>In the Q&amp;A, the developers of The Wayward Realms also explained how they plan to advance procedural generation in their game, which will not feature a traditional main quest.</p>
<p><em>We feel that there are plenty of ways to advance the procedural generation and integrate more memorable interactions and encounters within it.</em><br>
<em>We are also taking advantage of procedural generation in order to be able to change things within the world, such as a town being burned down to the ground as a result of the political struggle.</em></p>
<p><em>The VGM is meant to work like a real life tabletop game master would, tailoring the game around the player, who/what they are playing as, and what they enjoy doing. For instance, a player who collects books may be offered more quests with books as a reward to entice them. Meanwhile, a melee-focused player may be offered more challenges based on their melee skills. The idea is to track what the player is doing and avoid offering more of what the player is not doing.</em></p>
<p><em>The VGM is also in charge of creating new quests for players, taking into account recent events, NPCs that the player has interacted with, and what factions the player is allied with and against in order to fill in the variables in potential quests. This helps make the game more relevant to the player in each playthrough.</em></p>
<p><em>There is no main quest, but we do have major World Events that occur throughout a playthrough. They act as sort of an overarching narrative. There are also questlines for each of the major factions. With both of these there will be a sort of finality to a narrative for players, but they can continue to play one beyond them, and the VGM will continue to create new adventures for the player to experience</em>.</p>
<p>Do you agree with OnceLost that Starfield should have stuck to the Daggerfall formula when making procedurally generated dungeons? Let us know below.</p>

<p>I want more of The Last of Us. I realize the second game brought about controversy, but the first game, specifically the story between Ellie and Joel, remains one of my most cherished gaming memories. I’m open to the sequel on PC. But when is The Last of Us Part 2 coming to PC?</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-last-of-us-part-2-pc-release-date">Do We Know The Last of Us Part 2 PC Release Date?</h2>



<p>According to recent claims, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-part-2-pc-port-under-development-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we previously reported on</a>, the PC port of The Last of Us Part 2 is under development and began sometime in 2021. Allegedly, the game’s development concluded in November 23, meaning PlayStation is sitting on the port until it’s ready for a launch.</p>



<p>Seeing as we saw nothing about the project at State of Play, there’s a chance they’re withholding the sequel’s PC port until the next season of the television series. If that’s the case, it may be another year before we see The Last of Us Part 2 on PC.</p>



<p>We don’t have a release date for The Last of Us Part 2 on PC yet. When we do, we’ll update this article to ensure you know as soon as possible!</p>



<p>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-the-last-of-us-part-3-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">When is The Last of Us Part 3 Release Date?</a></p>



<h2 id="h-what-about-the-last-of-us-season-2">What About The Last of Us Season 2?</h2>



<p>There was supposedly a delay to the upcoming The Last of Us season two following the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strike. However, we know about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-season-two-casting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numerous casting choices</a> made for the second season of the live-action adaptation. These casting choices include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Kaitlyn Dever (Abby)</li>



<li>Isabela Merced (Dina)</li>



<li>Danny Ramirez (Manny)</li>



<li>Ariela Barer (Mel)</li>



<li>Tati Gabrielle (Nora)</li>



<li>Spencer Lord (Owen)</li>
</ul>



<p>Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsay will reprise their roles as Joel and Ellie, respectively, for the series’ second season.</p>

<p>If you enjoy a bit of horror in your games, we’ve heard the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/slitterhead-world-premiere-gameplay-trailer-coming-to-summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slitterhead world premier gameplay reveal</a> is coming to Summer Game Fest!

Movie.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of all the developers, Nintendo may have found the most ideal Hollywood relationship. Compared to other companies, it’s more deliberate with what gets adapted and how, mainly because of the trauma of the near-universally panned 1993 Mario movie. But it ended up working out in the long run. Two Mario games came out in 2023, and neither were made in relation to the then-upcoming Super Mario Bros. movie. Because Nintendo was so involved during its production, the movie works as “just another Mario game” instead of something the entire franchise is dependent on. That same feeling may extend to the upcoming Legend of Zelda movie: if a game (new or remake) comes out in the same relative proximity, it’ll feel like a natural intersection instead of predetermined steering.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Through the ever-growing Pokemon anime series and movies, Nintendo practically created transmedia as we now know it. The often annual games serve as the foundation for the trading card game and anime, all of which have spent decades as pop culture fixtures. A child will watch the show, which makes them want to buy cards (hopefully before </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/van-gogh-museums-event-gets-gatecrashed-by-pokemon-tcg-scalpers-in-a-prime-example-of-why-we-cant-have-nice-things/">scalpers</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> take that chance from them) or the newest game, or whichever order of operations you wish to apply. That kind of cultural cache can’t be engineered in the way corporations often want it to, and it further helps that Nintendo just has a game for any occasion to be released whenever it so chooses.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Publishers like Sony and Microsoft would very much like their games to become big transmedia enterprises, where games become movies that lead to more sales and further franchising. A lot of these would-be franchises are growing from double and triple-A games, the latter of which have become more costly to make. Movies are no stranger to high budgets, but games have started to really feel that strain, and not every one of them can get away with a remaster or PC port ahead of a silver screen adaptation. In other instances, a game project meant to build off an adaptation’s momentum may just </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/firesprite-s-twisted-metal-game-among-canceled-playstation-projects">get the ax</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for reasons out of its developer’s control. Abrupt studio closures or layoffs can be as game-changing as growing a game out into a multimedia juggernaut in the first place.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Games and Hollywood have had a relationship for decades, but the new advent of adaptations is showing how one-sided this has become. The former has bent itself into a pretzel readying itself for adaptation, but that isn’t always going to work. Audiences for both have become adept at spotting when companies are steering media to a particular end goal, and will sometimes refuse to play along. Ensuring a healthy dynamic between the two mediums going forward will mean being less obvious in IP strategizing, as Nintendo has done. Having a direct hand in adaptations is important, but it's equally key to know when to ease off the throttle and let things play out organically.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A Kansas City, MO native, Justin Carter has written for numerous sites including IGN, Polygon, and SyFy Wire.

<p data-characters="149" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Iker Muniain End of an Era SBC is now live in <em>EA FC 24</em> Ultimate Team, and you can obtain a special card of the Bilbao star to add to your squad. </p> <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="291" data-injectable="false">EA Sports has been on top with regular releases of Flashback and End of an Era cards as part of the Ultimate TOTS celebrations. While few of the earlier releases have been expensive, the latest entrant is pretty cheap. This makes tonight’s SBC a perfect one for beginners to complete. </p> <h2 id="h-all-ea-fc-24-iker-muniain-end-of-an-era-sbc-tasks" data-injectable="false">All EA FC 24 Iker Muniain End of an Era SBC tasks</h2> <p data-characters="242" data-current-count="533" data-injectable="true">Tonight’s challenge has only one task, but there are certain conditions which would have to be satisfied during squad submission. The solo squad means that you’ll need just eleven fodder items, which shouldn’t be a problem. </p>

The card has good in-game stats, and the ability to play in various positions. </p> <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="483" data-injectable="false">However, the new End of an Era card has 4* Skills and 4* Weak Foot, which can be problematic in the current meta of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-maintenance-when-will-the-servers-come-back/">EA FC 24</a></em>. As I said, tonight’s SBC is more suited for relative beginners who are still building their squads. </p>

<p data-characters="93" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Path to Glory and Greats of the Game players are coming very soon to <em>EA FC 24</em> Ultimate Team. </p> <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false">An official blog post from developers EA Sports has announced plenty of exciting content arriving in Ultimate Team. It appears that the Euro cards will be part of the next promo, which will have two sets of special cards. Both types of players will be eligible for upgrades, and these dynamic items could end up becoming cornerstones in many squads. </p> <h2 id="h-how-will-path-to-glory-cards-upgrade-in-ea-fc-24" data-injectable="false">How will Path to Glory cards upgrade in EA FC 24</h2> <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="607" data-injectable="true">Path to Glory will include special cards of active footballers taking part in Euro 2024. These could feature some massive names in the days to come. Unlike previous promos in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-anthony-martial-flashback-sbc-solutions/"><em>EA FC 24</em> Ultimate Team</a>, Path to Glory will be all about national team superstars. </p>
 <p data-characters="95" data-current-count="95" data-injectable="false">There will five levels of upgrades, featuring boosts to overall ratings, playstyles, and more. </p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="295" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Win 1: +1 OVR</strong></li> <li><strong>Win 3: +1 Playstyle+</strong></li> <li><strong>Win QF: +1 OVR</strong></li> <li><strong>Win SF: 5*WF/5* Skills or +1 OVR</strong></li> <li><strong>Win Final: +1 OVR</strong></li> </ul> <p data-characters="148" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="true">Naturally, certain items could become interesting investment options, based on the chances for their respective nations to win the Euros this year. </p>

These superstars, once rampaging forces for their nations, will aim to leave their footprints on the <em>EA FC 24</em> Ultimate Team community. With the potential for upgrades, these Heroes and Icons could have incredible demand in the market. </p>

Global Loans and Time Loans will be pretty different from Match Loans. These loan items can be used indefinite times until they reach their expiry dates and time. All global loans will expire on July 18, so the community could have more than 1 month with these items. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dimension-20-never-stop-blowing-up-pulls-cast-of-mall-employees-into-vhs-to-live<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today <a href="https://www.dropout.tv/">Dropout </a>has released the first trailer for the new season of <em>Dimension 20: Never Stop Blowing Up</em>. The new season of the hit anthology TTRPG show will begin airing on June 26th, 2024. With only a few weeks until viewers are invited into the adrenaline-fueled world of <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> we have a chance to learn more about the setting and who is playing in the dome.</p>

<p><em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> follows the story of "six down-on-their-luck strip-mall employees [who]&nbsp;are sucked into a magic VHS tape, transforming into high-octane action heroes." Once inside the action movie, it's up to these characters to find their way through the movie to ultimately escape and get home.</p>

<p>Check out the full trailer below:</p>


<p>The players on this season of Dimension 20 are listed below first by the name of their 'real world' character and then by the action star that they become once they're inside the VHS.</p>

<ul><li>Jacob Wysocki as Andy 'Dang' Litefoot /&nbsp;Greg Stocks</li>
	<li>Ify Nwadiwe as Wendell Morris / Vic Ethanol</li>
	<li>Ally Beardsley as Russell Feeld / Jennifer Drips</li>
	<li>Alex Song-Xia as Liv Skyler / Kingskin</li>
	<li>Isabella Roland as Paula Donvalson (neé Buocadifuoco) / Jack Manhattan</li>
	<li>Rekha Shankar as Usha Rao / G-13</li>
	<li>Brennan Lee Mulligan as the GM</li>
</ul><p>The trailer begins with DM Brennan Lee Mulligan describing scenes from a movie where a motorcycle-riding action star is wielding a katana attached to a chain. After a VHS for the movie <em>Never Stop Blowing Up</em> is placed before the players they're pulled into the action themselves. Throughout the trailer you can see Lee Mulligan's attire get more torn and dirtied as he morphs into a John Mcclane look-alike from <em>Die Hard</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"This is the craziest you've ever been at this table" Ally Beardsley to GM Brennan Lee Mulligan</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a montage of character introductions, we meet the different action archetypes; rugged fighters, femme fatales, '<em>Fast and Furious</em>' style speed demons, gentlemen spies, and more.</p>



<p><em>Dimension 20: Never Stop Blowing Up</em> will be a 10-episode season beginning to air on June 26th, 2024 on Dropout. At the moment the game system in use for Never Stop Blowing Up is not explicitly clear, we have reached out to Dropout for clarification.</p>

<p>This season is coming hot off the heels of Fantasy High: Junior Year.

        <p>It’ll play nice with SteamVR, at least</p>

            <p>We knew a PC adapter for PlayStation’s VR2 headset <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-officially-working-on-pc-game-support-for-the-ps-vr2-headset">was on the way</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/playstation-vr2-pc-adapter-certification-surfaces-marking-one-more-step-towards-official-support-in-2024">it looked to be fairly soon</a> - and we were right! Sony’s shiniest virtual reality offering is now confirmed to be adding official PC support via a nifty wired adapter at the start of August. It’ll cost £50/$60 - but whether it’s worth the price given a number of key features will be missing is another question entirely...</p>

</div>
<p>On the good news side of things, the PlayStation VR2 PC adapter will support SteamVR out of the box when it releases on August 7th, meaning you’ll be able to hook it up and play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-vr-games">virtual reality games</a> on Steam - including Valve’s own <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life-alyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a>. To do that, you’ll just need to hook up the headset to your PC using the adapter and a DisplayPort 1.4 cable, then run both SteamVR and the new PlayStation VR2 app, which will let you tweak around with settings for things like play area.</p>
<p>That’s great news, especially as the VR2 is a very comfortable headset by all accounts and puts some lovely 120Hz 4K (2000x2040) OLED displays in front of your eyes across a 110-degree field of view.</p>
<p>What’s not so great is that many of the features that arguably make the VR2 a strong contender for one of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-vr-headset">best VR headsets</a> overall won’t be supported on PC, even when using the official adapter. Notably, those panels, crisp as they are, won’t support HDR on PC, and the VR2’s impressive eye-tracking won’t work either - though foveated rendering without using eye-tracking will still function. Headset feedback also won’t function, nor will the handheld controllers’ DualSense-based adaptive triggers or haptic feedback beyond simple rumble.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/playstation-vr2-pc-adapter.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Sony</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That leaves the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/03/playstation-vr2-players-can-access-games-on-pc-with-adapter-starting-on-august-7/">list of working features</a> at the panels themselves, the headset’s see-through view - handy in case you’re about to bump into something - and the controllers’ finger-touch detection, along with 3D Audio in some games - albeit using SteamVR’s audio tech rather than the PS5-only Tempest 3D AudioTech.</p>
<p>If you’ve already got a VR2, being able to play VR games on PC without having to cough up for a whole new headset seems a no-brainer. If you’re weighing this up against other PC offerings such as the Meta Quest 3, though - which is already cheaper than the base VR2, and almost on par feature-wise due to these limitations - the combined cost of the VR2 itself the adapter certainly makes this a harder sell, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Still, the VR2 apparently hasn’t exactly set the world on fire since it came out a couple of years ago, so it might be you’re able to grab one for a steal and make the most of its nice hardware - even if some of its promising potential goes unrealised on PC.</p>

  <p id="V5Q0iB"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23889773/dropout-anniversary-collegehumor-brennan-lee-mulligan-sam-reich">Dropout</a> released a first trailer for “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/24164051/best-new-tv-summer-2024-release-calendar-schedule-shows-series">Never Stop Blowing Up</a>” on Wednesday, lifting the curtain on the next season of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23883220/dimension-20-dropout-tv-show-anniversary-season-dnd"><em>Dimension 20</em></a>. </p>
<p id="rsqRoj">Hosted by founding game master Brennan Lee Mulligan in a series of increasingly incinerated outfits, “Never Stop Blowing Up” will follow six strip-mall employees played by Jacob Wysocki, Ify Nwadiwe, Ally Beardsley, Alex Song-Xia, Isabella Roland, and Rekha Shankar — but it sounds like they won’t be strip-mall losers for very long. </p>
<p id="vsh9bH">Our heroes find themselves “sucked into a magic VHS tape, transforming into high-octane action heroes - and must figure out how to navigate the movie to get home,” according to Dropout’s news release. </p>
<p id="O1aJFv">The trailer makes clear that those action heroes are drawn from a specific mold, echoing the likes of John McClane, Rambo, Dominic Toretto, and more. There also appears to be some kind of prop mechanic going on? With items like a dynamite bomb, a deck of cards, a bundle of “cocaine,” or a pack of cigarettes rotating around the table. </p>
<p id="Mqmv16">Fans will have to wait a few weeks to unravel those mysteries, however. “Never Stop Blowing Up” premieres on June 26 on Dropout TV, and run for 10 episodes. </p>

<p>While countless upcoming games have us in a perpetual state of excitement for this summer, few compare to the hype surrounding Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree. The first and only expansion for FromSoftware’s monolithic action game, thankfully, won’t require our entire SSD to play. Here’s the Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree file size to help you prepare!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-big-is-the-shadow-of-the-erdtree-download">How Big is the Shadow of the Erdtree Download?</h2>



<p>To fully download and install Shadow of the Erdtree, you must have <strong>approximately 16GB of free space on an SSD</strong>. For comparison, Elden Ring requires 45GB for just the base game. In total, you’ll need ~61GB of free space for the main game and its DLC. </p>



<p>Overall, considering just how many hours you can squeeze out of the game, that’s seriously good value for the space requirements. We’re witnessing countless video games balloon in size, with Call of Duty and Destiny 2 proving to be the biggest offenders, requiring hundreds of GB of free space on your drive. It’s nice to have such a high-quality product that doesn’t eat space like candy.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-who-is-messmer-in-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/who-is-messmer-in-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Who is Messmer in Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree?</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-how-to-prepare-for-shadow-of-the-erdtree">How to Prepare for Shadow of the Erdtree</h2>



<ul>
<li>Take some time to track down key resources and materials, such as <strong>Smithing</strong> <strong>Stones</strong>, <strong>Bell Bearings</strong>, <strong>Grave Glovewort</strong>, and <strong>Ghost</strong> <strong>Glovewort</strong>. These upgrade materials allow you to improve your weapons and spirit ashes significantly before the difficulty spike in Shadow of the Erdtree.</li>



<li>You must <strong>defeat Mohg </strong>to access Shadow of the Erdtree. He’s weak to <strong>Bleed</strong>, <strong>Physical, </strong>and <strong>Poison Damage</strong>, so prioritize dishing those out during his boss fight to make quick work of the monstrosity.</li>



<li>While the DLC recommends you level to somewhere between <strong>100 and 150</strong>, if you can defeat Mohg at a lower level, then you should be okay to access the new zone. If you want to feel safe and endure less of a challenge overall, level to 150 beforehand.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-set-to-add-cole-palmers-signature-ice-cold-celebration/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ea-fc-24-set-to-add-cole-palmers-signature-ice-cold-celebration<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="166" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After lighting the Premier League on fire in his first season with Chelsea, <em>EA FC 24</em> is introducing Cole Palmer’s signature ‘ice cold’ celebration. </p> <p data-characters="530" data-current-count="530" data-injectable="true">EA posted a video on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@easportsfc/video/7376949627825786144?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok</a> confirming that Cole Palmer’s celebration will be added to <em>EA FC 24</em> on June 6. If you thought opponents who did the<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-perform-the-griddy-ea-fc-24/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> griddy</a> after scoring were annoying, wait until they rub their arms after scoring a 90th-minute winner. Palmer finished second in the Premier League Golden Boot race with 22 goals and contributed 11 assists in 2024. The breakout season earned the 22-year-old a spot on England’s provisional Euros squad, and he’s expected to play a significant role in the tournament. </p>
 <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="210" data-injectable="false">The celebration started after Palmer began his goal-scoring streak, earning the nickname Cold Palmer. From there the Chelsea player embraced the name and started rubbing his arms after goals as if he was cold. </p> <figure data-current-count="510" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="380" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false">Unfortunately, EA did not share how to perform Cole Palmer’s signature dance, but once the secret is out, you will see this celebration everywhere. For players who don’t like Chelsea or Palmer, plenty of other celebrations are worth trying. Diogo Jota, Jude Bellingham, Erling Haaland, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Lionel Messi all have their signature celebrations as well.</p> <p data-characters="147" data-current-count="527" data-injectable="false">Next up, players in the comment section also want <em>EA FC 24</em> to add Swedish star Viktor Gyökeres’ signature hands-over-the-mouth celebration. </p>

<p data-characters="157" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Pax Dei</em> is an open-world sandbox MMO that presents players with a colossal game world and gives them the tools to do pretty much anything they want with it. </p> <p data-characters="197" data-current-count="197" data-injectable="false">The game will be launched in Steam early access, but you might be wondering whether it will continue to be a free MMO or use a paid subscription model like <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> and <em>World of Warcraft</em>. </p> <p data-characters="522" data-current-count="719" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/pax-dei-release-date-editions-and-early-access-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Pax Dei</em> will be in Steam early access</a> for as long as developer Mainframe Industries needs to reach the goal of getting the game into a state where it feels it’s ready for a 1.0 launch. This could take a year, or it could take longer. While it’s in early access, the game can be purchased alongside a Founder’s Pack, but once it hits 1.0, the game won’t be in early access any longer, and that brings into question the subject of how the developer will continue to fund work on adding new features. </p>
 <h2 id="h-will-pax-dei-have-a-paid-subscription-after-steam-early-access" data-injectable="false">Will <em>Pax Dei</em> have a paid subscription after Steam early access?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Pax Dei | Early Access Announcement" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m9kbu7qtYR4?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="684" data-injectable="true">During a preview event with Mainframe Industries, the developer confirmed that once <em>Pax Dei</em> leaves Steam early access, it will have a paid subscription model to support work on adding more features in the future. However, the developer couldn’t confirm how much that subscription would cost; it would probably be in line with what players expect to pay for an MMO subscription. </p>
 <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="368" data-injectable="false">There’s no point in speculating about the cost because subscription fees could change between <em>Pax Dei’</em>s early access release and its 1.0 launch. Server and energy costs may fluctuate, and it will likely be somewhat based on the average concurrent player count, so Mainframe Industries will need to work out how much it needs to fund continued development. </p> <p data-characters="510" data-current-count="878" data-injectable="true">Mainframe Industries will need to charge a subscription fee once<em> Pax Dei</em> 1.0 has been released because it wants to keep the game alive and add to it for years to come. The player ecosystem of <em>EVE Online</em> is what the developer wants to achieve in <em>Pax Dei</em>, but doing that requires time and money. The initial influx of revenue from Founder’s Packs will go some way to funding the extra work and keeping the game alive, but if <em>Pax Dei</em> is to stand the test of time, it’ll need to generate cash somehow. </p>
 <p data-characters="490" data-current-count="490" data-injectable="false">It’s rare to see a game launch and charge players a subscription fee, while games like <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Destiny 2 </em>have moved into a battle pass model that effectively earns the same amount but offers players more upfront. Titles like <em>World of Warcraft</em> and <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> are still going strong with huge player bases who are happy to pay the subscription because they adore those games, which bodes well for <em>Pax Dei</em>, provided Mainframe Industries can deliver the game it has promised. </p>

<p data-characters="259" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As you navigate the Temptation mission, you’ll encounter a sealed passage within a cave. The only way to breach it is by changing the layout of three mechanisms. Here’s how to solve all the Temptation Conduit puzzles in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fastest-way-to-start-the-final-shape-for-new-and-returning-destiny-2-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a></em>.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-deactivate-conduits-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape-temptation-mission" data-injectable="false">How to deactivate Conduits in Destiny 2: The Final Shape Temptation mission</h2> <p data-characters="432" data-current-count="432" data-injectable="true">Upon reaching the blocked cave entryway, you’ll notice several waypoints scattered across the map. The key to progressing here is to position the Conduits correctly, aligning them with a light beam. However, the crucial step is to <strong>eliminate the Insight Psions. </strong>Their defeat grants you Psionic Insight temporarily, a vital resource that allows you to manipulate the Conduits, rotating them either clockwise or counterclockwise.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="117" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="true">For a general overview of the Temptation Conduit puzzle solutions in <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>, use these maneuvers:</p>

 <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="440" data-injectable="true">The first Conduit puzzle is located to the left of the blocked-off cave. Cross the bridge and clear out the nearby enemies. Once the area is secure, eliminate the Insight Psions on the bridge or caves to gain Psionic Insight temporarily. Then, interact with the Conduit, selecting the ‘Clockwise’ position. If you happen to run out of Psionic Insight, don’t worry; more Insight Psions typically spawn during this mission. </p>
 <h3 id="h-puzzle-2" data-injectable="false">Puzzle 2</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="465" data-current-count="765" data-injectable="true">Go up north to reach the next Conduit puzzle in <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em>. There will be a lot of surrounding enemies nearby, and you’ll need to rotate the Conduit a few times to hit two beams of light. It’ll be fairly tricky to do with all the chaos going on, but just try to get rid of the foes quickly and use the interactions mentioned above. You may also need to Transcend, as you have previously done in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-complete-transmigration-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Transmigration</a>, to defeat some opponents. </p>

Dispose of any remaining enemies and gain Psionic Insight to manipulate the Conduits. The sequence is one clockwise rotation followed by five counterclockwise rotations. </p>
 <p data-characters="141" data-current-count="141" data-injectable="false">Once that’s over, it’s time to return to the Crow and progress further in <em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape’s </em>Temptation mission. </p>

<p data-characters="307" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In space, no one can hear you scream. That didn’t stop millions of <em>Alien</em> fans from howling to the heavens when the latest trailer for <em>Alien: Romulus</em> dropped earlier today. This promising preview introduced us to <em>Romulus</em>‘ cast of young Xenomorph bait and revealed when the film will hit theaters.</p> <h2 id="h-alien-romulus-release-date" data-injectable="false"><strong>Alien: Romulus’ Release Date</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Disney</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="668" data-injectable="true"><em>Romulus</em>‘ trailer doesn’t pull its punches. It assaults viewers with a marathon of terrifying scenes that prove that the seventh installment of the <em>Alien</em> franchise will return<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alien-romulus-is-going-back-to-the-franchises-roots-in-new-trailer"> the series to its grungy, claustrophobic root</a>s. After a brutally effective smash cut to the title card, the trailer ends by unveiling the film’s release date, August 16, 2024.</p>
 <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="268" data-injectable="false">While the release date comes with an “only in theaters” subtitle, the film will likely be available on a streaming service a few months after its big-screen debut. Twentieth Century Studios produced <em>Romulus</em>, so the film will be available to stream on<a href="https://www.hulu.com/network/twentieth-century-studios-4e51bbc4-7a9e-442b-b7f1-673eed92cbcb"> Hulu</a>.</p> <h2 id="h-alien-romulus-cast-is-as-young-as-they-are-vulnerable" data-injectable="false"><strong>Alien: Romulus Cast is as young as they are vulnerable</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Disney</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="463" data-current-count="463" data-injectable="true">Much like the original Alien film, Romulus follows a crew of very unlucky space travelers who stumble upon and fight for their lives against the titular alien predator. The cast of <em>Romulus</em> is quite a bit younger than those featured in other <em>Alien </em>films, with director Fede Álvarez<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/alien-romulus-trailer-ridley-scott-1235856321/"> explaining in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter</a> that he wanted to explore the <em>Alien</em> universe through the eyes of young people who are just learning how to navigate the stars.</p>
 <p data-characters="312" data-current-count="312" data-injectable="false">The cast of<em> Romulus</em> consists almost entirely of talented twenty-something rising stars who have only just started breaking into leading roles in other films, so it will be fascinating to see how this cast compares to the star-studded casts of previous <em>Alien</em> films. Here are all of the actors featured in <em>Romulus</em>.</p> <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="552" data-injectable="true"> <li>Cailee Spaeny – Rain Carradine</li> <li>David Jonsson – Andy</li> <li>Archie Renaux – Tyler</li> <li>Isabela Merced – Kay</li> <li>Spike Fearn – Bjorn</li> <li>Aileen Wu – Navarro</li> </ul>
 <h2 id="h-romulus-title-has-some-interesting-mythological-roots" data-injectable="false">Romulus’ title has some interesting mythological roots</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Disney</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="429" data-current-count="729" data-injectable="true"><em>Alien </em>films have a long history of referencing mythology and religion. <em>Romulus</em> is no exception. The film’s title, which doubles as the name of the abandoned space station our young heroes get trapped on, shares its num-de-plume with the legendary founder of Rome, who, according to the myth, was raised in the wild by a kindly she-wolf after he and his brother Remus were left in the woods to die by their traitorous uncle.</p>
 <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="457" data-injectable="true">The story of Romulus and the unfortunate fate of Remus is a tale drenched in themes of siblinghood, and <em>Romulus </em>will explore similar ideas<em>. </em>In<a href="https://ew.com/alien-romulus-director-fede-alvarez-star-cailee-spaeny-tease-new-xenomorph-8642159"> an interview with Entertainment Weekly</a>, Alvarez explained that he wanted <em>Romulus</em>‘ core cast to be a sort of “small town found family.” If the founding myth of Rome is an accurate blueprint of <em>Romulus’ </em>story, the horrors these kids encounter might push their familial bond to its breaking point.</p>

            <p>The makers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> over at Behaviour Interactive are no strangers to the cold, calculating mindset of killers, having created <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evils-nemesis-is-coming-to-dead-by-daylight">plenty</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-big-bad-albert-wesker-is-coming-to-dead-by-daylight-soon">of</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/aliens-iconic-xenomorph-is-stalking-into-dead-by-daylight">them</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-by-daylight-is-adding-dd-killer-vecna-voiced-by-critical-role-dm-matthew-mercer-with-castlevania-also-on-the-way">now</a> for their multiplayer hunt-and-seek <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror game</a>. That coldness seems to have seeped into the company itself too, as they racked up their career-killing bodycount with nearly 100 more layoffs this week.</p>

<p>Behaviour’s <a href="https://media.bhvr.com/behaviour-interactive-implements-strategic-changes-for-future-growth">announcement</a> - the opening of which ominously dubs the studio as “The Company” in true killer-like fashion - confirmed that they will look to cut up to 95 staff. Of those almost 100 devs, the majority will be laid off from the developers’ Montreal studio.</p>
<p>In true corpospeak, the announcement euphemistically dubbed the firing of dozens of people as “strategic changes for future growth”, citing a “challenging period for the games industry” amid “unprecedented competition” as part of thinking behind the move. The studio also noted that their headcount has more than doubled from just shy of 600 employees to 1,300 staff in the last five years, in what seems to be a sadly continuing trend of games companies having richly gorged themselves during the at-home pandemic boom - Behaviour calls it “remarkable growth” - only to forcibly vomit up their blameless workers as things then contract due to the lightening of lockdowns and the subsequent cost-of-living crisis.</p>
<p>Behaviour say that the “multiple strategic changes to its corporate structure” - i.e. putting dozens upon dozens of people out of a job - will help “ improv[e] the distinction between its product, production, business development, and marketing resources” as the studio double down on their “historical strengths” of horror and development services, along with a possible expansion into whatever “location-based entertainment” means.</p>

<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For all their hard work on the likes of Dead by Daylight, Behaviour waved off the laid-off devs with the caring, heartfelt acknowledgement that “each of these individuals offered valuable contributions to Behaviour” - which I’m sure they’ll be grateful for as they try to pay their rent and put food on the table - while adding that Dead by Daylight’s development won’t be affected by the changes. (Upcoming single-player spin-off The Casting of Frank Stone is being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/supermassive-reveal-the-casting-of-frank-stone-a-single-player-dead-by-daylight-game">worked on over at Supermassive</a>, so that won’t be affected either.)</p>
<p>“I would like to express my deep personal appreciation for any employee affected by today’s changes,” said CEO Rémi Racine. “While changes to our structure and strategic vision have led to challenging decisions, we are confident that these decisions will position us for continued success. As we begin the next phase of Behaviour’s growth, our commitment to excellence in our products and workplace culture remains steadfast.”</p>
<p>The latest layoffs at Behaviour come fewer than six months after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-layoffs-as-behaviour-interactive-and-ci-games-adjust-scope-and-make-optimisations">close to 50 staff were cut at the start of the year</a>, meaning around 10% of the studio have been dropped in 2024 so far. Behaviour are far from the only studio to be part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">the unrelenting barrage of job losses across the games industry over the last year or so</a>, with thousands of staff losing their jobs at developers, publishers and more. Hard to match that level of fear and wanton destruction with someone in a pig mask, honestly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24171899/xbox-showcase-2024-preview-analysis<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="9aZs9Z">In theory, Microsoft approaches this week’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24167070/summer-game-fest-2024-schedule-sgf-e3">Summer Game Fest</a> and the annual Xbox showcase on June 9 from a position of fantastic strength: Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/30/24055445/microsoft-q2-2024-earnings-revenue-profits-windows-xbox-gaming-surface">supercharged the revenues</a> of its gaming division and turned it into a super-publisher the likes of which the game industry has never seen. It now owns an astonishing war chest of hall-of-fame gaming properties that includes Call of Duty, Minecraft, Warcraft, Halo, Fallout, Diablo, The Elder Scrolls, Doom, Gears of War, Forza, and much, much more.</p>
<p id="gNeJ7F">Microsoft gaming chief Phil Spencer and his team are also well poised to make a strong impression in what is shaping up to be a fallow year for the rest of the industry. Sony, having already confessed that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24072730/no-new-ps5-games-exclusives-2024-release">PlayStation won’t see any major exclusive releases</a> this year, went early with a short, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2024/1/31/24057143/playstation-sony-state-of-play-ps5-showcase-announcements-trailers">low-key showcase</a> last week. Nintendo has delayed its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo/23899504/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-power-name-games">successor console to the Switch</a> into 2025; at <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24151013/nintendo-switch-2-direct-announcement-teaser">its own showcase later in June</a> it will be forced to lean on whatever games it’s been able to scrape together for the Switch’s last holiday season. And Summer Game Fest MC Geoff Keighley has <a href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-2024-geoff-keighley-sets-expectations-1851516386">moved to temper expectations</a> for his roundup showcase on June 7.</p>
<p id="Mxdcgt">Microsoft has faced similar lulls in its release schedule in the recent past, but on this count it is now simply too big to fail. On the Activision Blizzard side, Microsoft will trumpet its ownership of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24145559/xbox-games-showcase-june-2024-call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty with a special showcase</a> highlighting this year’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24166198/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass"><em>Black Ops 6</em></a>, and can point to big expansions coming this year to both <em>World of Warcraft </em>and <em>Diablo 4</em>. Bethesda has <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> to show, plus a possible <em>Starfield </em>expansion, and a strongly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages/">rumored new game in the Doom series</a>. Meanwhile, Xbox Game Studios is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/5/24122208/microsoft-xbox-kareem-choudhry-leaving-xbox-cloud-gaming">reportedly</a> ready to unveil a new Gears of War, as well as show more of <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> and Obsidian’s<em> </em>fantasy role-playing game <em>Avowed</em>.</p>
<p id="Q1KWrZ">That one of these three powerhouse gaming brands also happens to appear on game consoles almost seems like an afterthought. But this is precisely Microsoft’s problem — or one of them, anyway — as it prepares to deliver this crucial address to fans. In 2024, Xbox finds itself in the grip of a profound identity crisis.</p>

</p>
<p id="W68mD7">The Xbox fandom, and the wider gaming community, has been shaken over the last few months by reports that Microsoft (which already publishes all its games simultaneously on Xbox and PC) was planning to push deeper into multiplatform publishing by putting previously console-exclusive titles on Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 5. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24063938/microsoft-xbox-exclusivity-playstation-5-nintendo-switch">Microsoft eventually did just that</a> with <em>Pentiment</em>, <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, and <em>Grounded</em>, but reports persist that much bigger properties — including <em>Starfield</em>, the Indiana Jones game, and franchise jewels like Halo — are also on the table. Windows Central reports that there is <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsofts-quest-for-short-term-dollardollardollar-is-doing-long-term-damage-to-windows-surface-xbox-and-beyond">“no red line” for this initiative</a>, codenamed Latitude, and that more PlayStation versions of Xbox-owned games are in development.</p>
<p id="PweIJ5">The move has a simple business goal — increase the profit margins on Microsoft’s in-house games <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24166647/aaa-exclusive-games-are-dead-playstation-xbox-multiplatform">in a challenging market</a> — but it completely upends a foundational marketing strategy for console gaming, by which the worth and desirability of a platform are deeply linked to its exclusive games. This has become a tenet of almost religious faith for gamers, and the suggestion that it might be abandoned is head-spinning.</p>
<p id="rxmsJk">The context for Microsoft’s decision is important, too. With its push into PC, cloud gaming, mobile, and subscription services with Game Pass, and by buying <em>Minecraft</em>, Microsoft has been clearly signaling that it was thinking beyond the boundaries of Xbox consoles for a decade now. But the acquisition of Activision Blizzard went further by turning the company into a huge multiplatform publisher overnight. </p>

<p id="y445JU">Thanks to regulators, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23797265/microsoft-sony-xbox-playstation-call-of-duty-deal">Microsoft couldn’t make Call of Duty Xbox-exclusive</a> even if it made sense to (it doesn’t). It isn’t any more likely that it would do the same to Blizzard’s games. A massive chunk of Microsoft’s gaming business now lies on PlayStation, Nintendo, and PC, and that’s bound to change the strategic thinking of Xbox leadership.</p>
<p id="jBIXpE">But while Microsoft’s gaming horizons have broadened, the same can’t be said for the Xbox platform itself. According to analysts quoted in the Financial Times, Xbox Series X and S were <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3b89e9f7-e3cf-4e60-bfa4-987af24efa75">outsold three-to-one by PlayStation 5</a> in 2023. Microsoft does not report console sales figures, arguing they don’t present an accurate picture of the overall health of its games business. It does report figures for Game Pass, but only intermittently; after a period of rapid growth, the service seems to have plateaued somewhat at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/23570040/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-subscriber-numbers-34-million">34 million subscribers</a>.</p>
<p id="1v998j">There are more troubling signs still. In early 2024, Microsoft <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24050311/microsoft-xbox-activision-blizzard-layoff">laid off 1,900 workers</a> across its gaming division. This was very bad, though in line with the rest of the game industry, and arguably not the worst of it. That came in May, when the company <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24151045/microsoft-xbox-studio-closures-tango-gameworks-arkane-austin-redfall">shuttered several Bethesda studios</a>, including Arkane Austin (<em>Dishonored</em>, <em>Redfall</em>) and Tango Gameworks (<em>The Evil Within</em>, <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>). The closures stirred uncomfortable memories of Microsoft’s botched management of other studios in the past — especially Fable developer Lionhead, which <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/4/29/11537392/lionhead-studios-closed">was shut down in 2016</a>.</p>

</p>
<p id="A547N8">The cumulative effect of all this is to raise huge existential questions for Xbox, and for Microsoft’s ambitions in gaming. What is Xbox now? Do the consoles matter at all? Is Microsoft now just a massive third-party publisher — a bigger EA? Is the Game Pass strategy working? How does owning Call of Duty help any of this? How has Halo, Xbox’s flagship franchise, been allowed to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23590852/halo-infinite-343-industries-future-franchise-reboot">fall into disrepair</a>? And, perhaps most worryingly for players beyond the Xbox community: Can Microsoft be trusted to keep tabs on this vast empire and manage all these beloved properties and storied studios responsibly, without doing irreparable damage like we saw with Fable and Lionhead?</p>
<p id="szRBhZ">On Sunday, Spencer and his team need to do something much more nuanced, and challenging, than just unleash a megaton of game announcements. They need to organize all this bigness into a coherent vision for Xbox’s place in the industry, its relationship to fans, and its strategy for the future. They need to be extremely clear in their messaging about exclusivity on all upcoming games. They need to show commitment to Game Pass (this is where Call of Duty comes in — with regulators insisting the series remains available on rival cloud services and consoles, Game Pass is the only strategic play open to Microsoft with CoD). And they need to show commitment to console hardware; <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24108660/xbox-handheld-console-phil-spencer-interview">unveiling a new handheld</a> would go a long way here.</p>
<p id="82TitY">To be fair to Xbox management, these are uncharted waters. No one has ever attempted to combine the roles of platform holder and third-party publisher before, and whether the move makes sense at all remains an open question. On Sunday, Microsoft needs to show the gaming community why it was worth doing, and how it will make a brighter future for both the industry and the art form — rather than just eating them up and running them down. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/counter-strike-skin-sells-1-million/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>The most expensive skin ever sold <strong>publically </strong>in Counter-Strike history has just changed hands for over $1 million. The final sum wasn’t disclosed by the private buyer, but it was referenced that the transaction was worth ‘more than $1 million’. It was a StatTrak Factory New AK-47 in Blue Gem (Pattern 661), a one-of-one weapon skin that was shielded in secrecy for more than a decade. It was known to be in the wild, but it was never revealed who owned it – but the value of the skin was always common knowledge.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-moolah">Moolah</h2>



<p>In January 2024, the Blue Gem AK-47 – a one-of-a-kind skin – was ‘discovered’, with many users surmising it had been unboxed in a CS weapon case. This extraordinary pull would have had the clout to turn an average gamer into a millionaire overnight – but it’s believed that it sat firmly in the grip of a collector for several years. In 2022, a slightly ‘more worn’ variant of this skin sold for a whopping $400,000 – but that’s far from being the most expensive Counter-Strike skin ever auctioned off.</p>



<p>This news was broken on social media by Jake Lucky, who shared an attractive montage of the weapon:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The most expensive skin in Counterstrike history was publicly sold this morning, a StatTrak Factory New AK-47 Blue Gem pattern 661</p><p>For over $1 million <a href="https://t.co/1FdxoNM2ov">pic.twitter.com/1FdxoNM2ov</a></p></div>— Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/1798387413313868135?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Last year, one user unboxed a $150,000 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-csgo-player-blue-gem-karambit-lucky/">rare Blue Gem Karambit</a> – a type of knife – mere weeks into playing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Before that, a wealthy Chinese collector secured a super-rare AK-47 skin <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/csgo-ak47-skin-sold/">for a staggering $160,000</a>.</p>



<p>Many have dubbed CS skins the ‘OG NFTs’, but what’s ironic is that the value of these top-tier cosmetics has outlasted the value of the most popular NFTs, and will probably continue to do so for quite some time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/does-concord-require-a-psn-account-on-pc-answered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>There is an unfortunate and rising trend of upcoming titles, specifically once-console-exclusive games from PlayStation that require a third-party account to run on PC. We saw it with Helldivers 2, where the community came together to revolt against Sony’s decision. Even today, that decision isn’t fully reversed. But here we are once more. Does Concord require a PSN account on PC?</p>



<h2 id="h-do-you-need-a-psn-account-for-concord">Do You Need a PSN Account for Concord?</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, like with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-god-of-war-ragnarok-require-a-psn-account-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War Ragnarok</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-until-dawn-require-a-psn-account-on-pc-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Until Dawn</a>, users will require a PSN account for Concord once it launches on PC. The upcoming hero shooter will require a PlayStation Network connection on Steam and Epic Games Stores, meaning you can’t play the online-only game if you don’t have a PSN account. There are still <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/countries-that-dont-have-psn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 120 countries where the PlayStation Network isn’t available</a>. That’s countless millions of players left in the dust yet again.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, following State of Play, Concord proved to be the most lackluster announcement of the bunch. By now, most people find themselves exhausted by hero-based arena shooters, and yet developers keep forcing them out the door. The decision to require a PSN account on PC doesn’t help anyone, especially not the studio behind the game.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-concord">What is Concord?</h2>



<p>During the first few minutes of the game’s announcement, I thought Concord was a single-player adventure in the same style as Guardians of the Galaxy. Instead, the team revealed a 5v5 arena shooter with hero characters—a PvP-only, frantic first-person shooter focused on social play and semi-competitive gameplay elements.</p>



<p>We’re still learning more about the game, and perhaps it will surprise us in the end, so fingers crossed for something a little more unique!</p>

Over the years many indie developers have bigged up Game Pass, with money paid by Microsoft taking much of the risk out of launching new games across multiple platforms. Day-one Game Pass deals are even more lucrative. Hypercharge: Unboxed, it seems, has achieved relative success on Xbox without either.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p data-characters="390" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">You’ll solve puzzles in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> for many reasons, from opening a locked chest to completing various quests. One puzzle you’ll encounter at the lighthouse in Frosting Harbor asks you to look afar at the break of dawn to find something, but it doesn’t give additional context for what you’re looking for.

        <p>Microsoft confirms commitment to scheme in UK despite key retailer pull-out.</p>

            <p>
UK high street chain GAME will no longer offer Xbox All Access to new subscribers beginning later this month, Eurogamer can confirm. 
</p>
<p>
Xbox All Access, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-all-access-the-best-way-to-buy-an-xbox-series-x-or-xbox-series-s">which lets you pay for an Xbox Series X or S console via 24 monthly installments</a>, is available through only a handful of partner retailers globally, and just three in the UK. 
</p>
<p>
GAME is by far the largest chain to have supported the subscription, but Eurogamer understands it is now dropping the offer as part of an ongoing series of changes as many of its high street stores are replaced by concessions in other Frasers Group chains, such as Sports Direct.
</p>

<p>
Earlier this week, Eurogamer reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-shutting-reward-scheme-next-month-and-you-should-use-any-remaining-credit-while-you-can-still-can">GAME was scrapping its long-running GAME Rewards membership scheme</a>, including its premium Elite tier. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-retailer-game-to-cease-video-game-trade-ins-staff-say">we also reported that GAME was set to drop its trade-in program</a>, too. 
</p>
<p>
In each case, Eurogamer understands this is to streamline the offerings GAME provides as the brand operates increasingly out of concessions.
</p>
<p>
"GAME is simplifying its credit offering and, as of 26th June, will no longer be offering Xbox All Access," a GAME spokesperson confirmed to Eurogamer. "This decision will not impact any of our existing Xbox All Access customers. 
</p>
<p>
"We continue to offer our full range of Xbox products and customers will be able to apply for flexible financing options through Frasers Plus."
</p>
<p>
Microsoft has separately confirmed it will continue to offer Xbox All Access in the UK. Currently, the scheme is operated here by GAME, Smyths Toys and 4Gadgets.
</p>
<p>
"Xbox All Access - which allows players to purchase Xbox Series X|S and Game Pass for a monthly price - will continue to be available at participating retailers throughout the UK,"  a Microsoft spokesperson confirmed. 
</p>
<p>
It's been a year of change for GAME, as it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-staff-told-to-expect-redundancies-as-most-workers-move-to-zero-hours-contracts">moves staff to zero-hour contracts and makes others redundant</a>, while the company shifts to operate from fewer high street outlets.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/summer-game-fest-to-be-good-for-horror-fans-with-alan-wake-dlc-slitterhead-more-teased.890406/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-alan-wake-dlc-slitterhead-good-for-horror-fans/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The big <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Summer Game Fest</a> kickoff show is only a couple days away, and, as you would expect, the teases for what we can expect at the show have begun. It seems like Summer Game Fest will be particularly good for horror fans, as a majority of the things teased for the show thus far have been horror related.</p>
<p>First up, Remedy has posted this teaser, which seems to be a reference to the upcoming “Night Springs” story DLC for <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/alan-wake-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alan Wake 2</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Dark Triangle Coffee. Just coffee, nothing else. Have a sip at Night Springs' One and Only Coffee World.</p>
<p>Join the percolation on June 7th... in Night Springs.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NightSprings?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NightSprings</a> <a href="https://t.co/qzXEwVxDWB">pic.twitter.com/qzXEwVxDWB</a></p>
<p>— Alan Wake 2 (@alanwake) <a href="https://twitter.com/alanwake/status/1798006904150458559?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 4, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>For those who haven’t been keeping up, here’s how Remedy has <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-story-dlc-detailed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously described the Night Springs DLC</a>…</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Visions and dreams. Fiction is written and coming true. Fiction collapses and remains just words on a page. These are those stories… in Night Springs.</em></li>
<li><em>Play as several familiar characters from the world of Alan Wake and experience the unexplainable in multiple self-contained episodes of Night Springs, a fictional tv-show set in the world of Alan Wake.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Second, Geoff Keighley has promised Blumhouse Games will be officially unveiled. Blumhouse is, of course, the biggest name in horror cinema right now, and some movie production companies, like Annapurna, have had quite a bit of success in the realm of video games recently, so this is something to watch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Excited to reveal the first details about <a href="https://twitter.com/BlumhouseGames?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BlumhouseGames</a> live on stage with <a href="https://twitter.com/jason_blum?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@jason_blum</a> this Friday! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SummerGameFest?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SummerGameFest</a> <a href="https://t.co/je3j1KY0Ne">https://t.co/je3j1KY0Ne</a></p>

<p>Finally, for those who perhaps aren’t feeling the <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-new-2024-trailer-gameplay-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, many of the original creators of that series will finally show off first gameplay of their new horror game <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/slitterhead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slitterhead</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Don't miss the gameplay world premiere of SLITTERHEAD, from the mind of Silent Hill creator Keiichiro Toyama and <a href="https://twitter.com/BokehGameStudio?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BokehGameStudio</a> during <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SummerGameFest?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SummerGameFest</a> live this Friday.</p>
<p>Catch the global livestream at <a href="https://t.co/59xiIzf5AN">https://t.co/59xiIzf5AN</a> at 2p PT / 5p ET / 10p BST / 11p CEST. <a href="https://t.co/qxTQhO9DcS">pic.twitter.com/qxTQhO9DcS</a></p>
<p>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1798367846449430889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The Summer Game Fest kickoff show will be livestreamed this Friday (June 7) at 2pm PT. Geoff Keighley has cautioned that the show may be a <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-2024-will-be-quieter-when-it-comes-to-shocking-announcements-says-keighley/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bit light on “shocking announcements,”</a> but at least for horror fans, it looks like there’s still going to be plenty of reason to tune in.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24171995/killers-game-trailer-release-date-cast-dave-bautista-action-movie</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dave-bautista-takes-on-the-entire-assassin-underworld-in-the-killer%E2%80%99s-game-trailer.890400/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24171995/killers-game-trailer-release-date-cast-dave-bautista-action-movie<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="YKh9Sx">It’s finally Dave Bautista’s time to shine as a bona fide action lead. The first trailer for <em>The Killer’s Game</em>, an assassin comedy with a star-studded cast and action royalty behind the camera, has dropped. The movie, based on the novel by <em>The Walking Dead</em> comics co-writer Jay Bonansinga, is coming to theaters September 13.</p>
<p id="v3THfO">Bautista plays an assassin diagnosed with a terminal illness who decides to put out a hit on himself for a quick death, rather than have him and his partner suffer through the deterioration of his health. But when he finds out his doctor made a mistake and he’s not actually dying, he has to fend for his life against some of the deadliest killers in the world. It’s a bit similar to the set up of last year’s <em>King of Killers</em>, starring Frank Grillo as an assassin who put out a hit on himself, but with a more fun twist and a much more exciting lineup.</p>
<p id="8vnwrD">Bautista has been largely relegated to side roles in the action genre, and here’s a real chance for him to shine in a genre well-suited to his considerable skills. And you can bet he’ll shine, with the support around him. <em>The Killer’s Game </em>is directed by legendary stunt performer and action director <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23301622/action-horror-comedy-movies-like-day-shift-watch-streaming">J.J. Perry</a>, who has been involved in a significant percentage of the great American action movies of the past 30 years, from <em>Blade </em>to <em>John Wick</em>. Perry’s feature debut as a director, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23301934/day-shift-review-netflix-vampire-movie-jamie-foxx-scott-adkins"><em>Day Shift</em></a>,<em> </em>was a fun vampire action comedy starring Jamie Foxx with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23301720/day-shift-vampires-netflix-contortionists-jamie-foxx-jj-perry">creative action choreography and camera work</a>. </p>
<p id="zmu4hf">Bautista will also have more support than just <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23835899/blue-beetle-flight-scenes-action-director-interview">Perry</a>. <em>The Killer’s Game </em>has a tantalizing cast, with Ben Kingsley (I’m obsessed with how he says “There are only two ways out of the killer’s game, Joseph”), Pom Klementieff, Sofia Boutella, Terry Crews, and WWE wrestler Drew McIntyre all involved. For the action diehards, the presence of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/videos/2021/1/29/22256482/scott-adkins-breaks-down-video-game-fights-mortal-kombat">Scott Adkins</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23664737/fist-of-the-condor-movie-review-marko-zaror-martial-arts">Marko Zaror</a> (who features heavily in the trailer), and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22973113/hell-hath-no-fury-hulu-thriller-movie-watch">Daniel Bernhardt</a> is especially appealing. All three are legends in their own right, and Bernhardt in particular has made a career of making movie stars look god at kicking his ass (<em>Atomic Blonde</em>, <em>Nobody</em>).</p>
<p id="nXbyhO">The project’s been in the works pretty much since Bonansinga’s novel came out in 1997. At different points over the past few decades, Wesley Snipes, Michael Keaton, and Jason Statham were each attached in the lead role. But ultimately, it’s Bautista who got the part, and it seems like a promising vehicle for his combination of charm, humor, and physical ability as a former professional athlete.</p>
<p id="SoAoJh">The trailer advertises lots of action and plenty of gore, as Bautista shoots, stabs, and garrotes his way through a bevy of targets. The comedy’s a bit hit-or-miss for me in the trailer, but that’s how trailers go sometimes. The lineup of talent and the teases of great action are more than enough for me to be counting down the days to September. </p>

When I was first here, I felt so small, but coming back to my old haunts all these years later as a bigger and better version of myself has revealed just how much I’ve grown in the years since.<br></p><div data-video-id="195460" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="195460,196880,196742" data-current="195460"><div><p>Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20938.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/destiny-2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/destiny-2"><em>Destiny 2</em></a></span>, like just about anything that’s been running for ten years, is tough to break into. There’s lots of characters, motivations, plot twists, and proper nouns to keep track of. For the longest time, <em>Destiny 2 </em>has reveled in these things, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-lore-catch-up-mynameisbyf-1851513216&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-lore-catch-up-mynameisbyf-1851513216">spinning a hell of a yarn</a></span> for the fans who have stuck around for all of it over the years. <em>The Final Shape </em>is unconcerned with most of those nitty-gritty lore tidbits as it brings some of these arcs to a close, placing emphasis instead on big feelings and a surreal environment that lends those feelings real power. This makes it a bit messy, but there’s something deeply moving about how much <em>The Final Shape </em>wears its heart on its sleeve, too.</p><p><em>The Final Shape </em>has the unenviable task of having to close out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-the-final-shape-ten-years-tiktok-1851518305&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-the-final-shape-ten-years-tiktok-1851518305">this book of <em>Destiny</em>’s history</a></span>. I worried about how it might begin to tackle such an immense task, which seems impossible to accomplish to the satisfaction of everyone playing. The answer Bungie found, however, is pretty simple: keep the story lean, funnel the player to the climactic fight, and tug on some heartstrings while you’re at it.</p><h2 id="h8790"><a id=""></a><strong>Feelings given shape</strong></h2><p><em>Destiny 2</em>’s climactic conclusion to the Light and Darkness saga does center the series’ villain, the Witness, more than it ever has before, but it’s difficult to call them and their motivations the heart of this expansion. That honor’s reserved for the most highly esteemed and messy fireteam in <em>Destiny</em>’s history, the Vanguard. Commander Zavala, Ikorra Rey, and the returning Cayde-6 make <em>The Final Shape </em>thrum with an electric and uneasy energy as their painful reunion gets swept up into the larger crisis of the end of the world.</p><figure id="" data-id="2da72661542cfdf73c45dde382db2a66" data-recommend-id="image://2da72661542cfdf73c45dde382db2a66" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot showing some of The Final Shape's more distorted and dark environments." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot showing some of The Final Shape's more distorted and dark environments." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bungie / Sony</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2da72661542cfdf73c45dde382db2a66" data-recommend-id="image://2da72661542cfdf73c45dde382db2a66" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot showing some of The Final Shape's more distorted and dark environments." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Upon entering the Pale Heart of the Traveler, a destination that reuses and distorts several environments from <em>Destiny</em>’s past, things feel immediately off. The Pale Heart is often beauteous, especially where nature seems to have reclaimed long-forgotten locales, but pockets of it tout these vast veiled statues of ghastly figures that <em>Destiny 2 </em>players have become familiar with, and calcified hands seem to jut from the ground and caves. As you push deeper into the festering wound the Witness has cut here, the environments grow more tortured and agonized faces protrude from walls. <em>The Final Shape </em>leans into pain, fear, and anger, and it especially comes through in the Pale Heart. If I may, it looks good on <em>Destiny.</em><br></p><p>This expansion’s central cast is going through it just as much as the world appears to be. Ikorra and Zavala’s reunion with their best friend Cayde-6 is…less than joyous. His appearance, as well as the current, urgent state of things, prompts crises of faiths that see some characters pushed beyond their breaking points, and here is where I’d like to give a nod to <em>Destiny</em>’s stable of voice actors. Everyone from Keith David (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-zavala-keith-david-lance-reddick-1851497272&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-zavala-keith-david-lance-reddick-1851497272">taking over as Zavala</a></span> from the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lance-reddick-death-age-actor-john-wick-destiny-horizon-1850238254#:~:text=Reddick%20was%20a%20particularly%20big,the%20beloved%20in%2Dgame%20character.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lance-reddick-death-age-actor-john-wick-destiny-horizon-1850238254#:~:text=Reddick%20was%20a%20particularly%20big,the%20beloved%20in%2Dgame%20character.">late Lance Reddick</a></span>) to Kirsten Potter as Mara Sov clearly understood the assignment, and their line readings in this expansion are some of the most emotive and expressive stuff I’ve ever heard in the series. Mara Sov’s anguished cries for her brother haunted me the entirety of the campaign, and Zavala, Ikorra, and Cayde in particular have some emotionally resonant and tough conversations. They verbally spurn each other like jilted friends that never got over the sour end of a cherished relationship, but they also have the most tender moments of the whole experience too. Their performances help ground the finality of the events occuring throughout <em>The Final Shape</em>.</p><h2 id="h8791"><a id=""></a><strong>Growing pains</strong></h2><p>The strength of these various performances helps mask the fact that little else seems to be going on for all of <em>Destiny 2</em>’s countless ongoing threads outside of the Pale Heart. While I’m grateful for the emotional weight of the beats <em>The Final Shape </em>does deliver for some beloved characters, I can’t help but be let down that this doesn’t feel like <em>Destiny 2</em>’s “Avengers, assemble” moment. I will likely be proven wrong by the time the raid rolls around—and there’s a seasonal story appended to <em>The Final Shape </em>that’ll likely tease out some of those secondary plots—but it’s a bummer that more of the allies and friends we’ve made along the way haven’t figured in more prominently.</p><figure id="" data-id="345c86b6fcac85901294f7fcd5e0c30f" data-recommend-id="image://345c86b6fcac85901294f7fcd5e0c30f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of a fireteam taking on The Final Shape's great new strike." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of a fireteam taking on The Final Shape's great new strike." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bungie / Sony</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="345c86b6fcac85901294f7fcd5e0c30f" data-recommend-id="image://345c86b6fcac85901294f7fcd5e0c30f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of a fireteam taking on The Final Shape's great new strike." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>The Final Shape</em>’s missions are a bit uneven, too. Though they’re certainly a step above <em>Lightfall</em>’s campaign, which felt tonally confused from the get-go, they don’t quite reach the highs of <em>The Witch Queen</em>, either. <em>The Final Shape </em>gets the stakes, at least, but fails to make immense moments or mechanical setpieces of them. Which isn’t to say I didn’t have a blast, because I did, especially as <em>Destiny </em>campaigns continue to borrow mechanics from its endgame raids that deepen the story experience. While most of the campaign missions came and went, a thrilling strike and the final mission were the biggest standouts, boasting a mixture of environmental design and mechanics that recalled the highs of <em>Destiny</em>’s very best encounters. But whereas I felt I could point to numerous landmark moments in <em>The Witch Queen </em>campaign, like a certain boss encounter in a sprawling maze-like environment, I mostly found approximations of some of <em>Destiny</em>’s greatest hits, including that very same encounter, in <em>The Final Shape</em>.<br></p><p>It also struggles to make the new Prismatic subclass stand out, though this isn’t exactly new to <em>Destiny </em>expansions. Prismatic blends all of the previous elements (Void, Arc, Solar, Stasis, and Strand) and turns players into a super-powered warrior capable of using them all simultaneously. It is the definition of a power trip, and yet, the campaign deploys the new subclass as more of a gimmick than a new part of the player’s arsenal, though I’m sure that will give way to radical builds once players clear the story and get into <em>The Final Shape</em>’s postgame.<br></p><p>I still really enjoyed <em>The Final Shape</em> (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-servers-1851519144&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-servers-1851519144">despite server issues</a></span>) and I’ll admit that some of the cheap nostalgia plays it pulled successfully made me teary-eyed. Even if it doesn’t entirely land, it’s got so much heart, and wrings so much from a cast and world I love, that I can’t fault it too heavily for its missteps. It is at least as focused as <em>Destiny 2 </em>has ever been, and as the twists and turns kept piling up, I couldn’t wait to see where folks wound up. It’s a little hard to believe, but an era of <em>Destiny 2 </em>is ending, and true to itself, <em>The Final Shape </em>is an appropriately uneven but endearing close to one chapter and the beginning of a new one.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Never underestimate the fans who want to see more Shenmue. After raising over $7 million to partially crowdfund Shenmue III in 2018, passionate followers of the franchise haven't given up on pushing for Shenmue 4. Now, six years after the latest game in the series, Shenmue fans have ramped up their efforts by purchasing a 15-second ad on a Times Square video billboard to campaign for a sequel.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shenmue-fans-rented-a-times-square-billboard-to-campaign-for-shenmue-4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, the ad was placed by a fan site, <a href="https://shenmuedojo.com/letsgetshenmue4-trending-at-new-yorks-times-square/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Shenmue Dojo</a>. The stated goal of Shenmue Dojo's campaign is to "support the continuation of the series and attempt to spread global awareness to find [developer] Ys Net a potential partner for Shenmue 4." The Times Square ad also included the hashtag #LetsGetShenmue4.</p><p>In the short term, the campaign successfully managed to get Shenmue trending on X. However, getting a fourth game in the series may still be an uphill battle. Shenmue III debuted to mixed or negative reviews in 2019, and the sales weren't high enough to immediately warrant a sequel. Regardless, the team behind the Shenmue 4 campaign remains optimistic about the franchise's future, as explained in the following message posted on the site.</p><p>"Thank you to everyone that helped to show their support with the timed mass tweets/posts today. It was very much appreciated and proves that together, as a collective, we can spread the awareness that we are not going to sit back without a fight. We will continue to strive until Shenmue 4 is a reality."</p>

                <p>The Last Of Us Part 2 is one of the most-acclaimed games of the past few years, but it has stubbornly remained a PlayStation exclusive for that time. A leaker with a proven track record of reliably releasing game info ahead of time recently said that the PC port of The Last Of Us Part 2 Remastered has been finished for more than six months.</p><p dir="ltr">That leaker--Billbil-kun, over at <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/mais-quand-sortira-la-version-pc-de-the-last-of-us-part-ii-52283" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dealabs Magazine</a>--claims that development on The Last Of Us Part 2 started way back in 2021, and that it concluded prior to this year, perhaps in November 2023. The leaker notes that the remastered version of the game was released on PS5 in January 2024, which perhaps means that Sony is deliberately holding back the PC port. Billbil-kun then speculates that it may release with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-last-of-us-season-2-release-window-cast-and-everything-else-we-know-so-far/2900-4679/" data-ref-id="2900-4679">season 2 of the HBO TV adaptation</a>, which is set to come out in 2025.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Last Of Us 2’s Roguelite Mode Explained</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As with all leaks of this nature, we recommend you take it with a grain of salt. However, it has been almost four years since The Last of Us Part 2 came out, which means Sony's had plenty of time to work on a PC port. Over the past few years, Sony has released PC ports of its big exclusives months or even years after their launch on PS4 or PS5. For example, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima/" data-ref-id="5000-474583">Ghost of Tsushima</a> came out in May of this year, almost four years after its 2020 console launch.</p>

        <p>Check out our panel featuring Shawn Layden, Michael Pachter and Van Burnham</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
Where will gamers be playing in the future? That's the question we're going to try and answer during a special panel at <a href="https://www.ign.com/live/">IGN Live on Sunday.</a>
</p>
<p>
<em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> head Christopher Dring will lead a panel featuring former PlayStation exec, and current advisor to Tencent, Shawn Layden, veteran games analyst Michael Pachter and author, curator and historian Van Burnham. It takes place at 2pm local time in Los Angeles, with coverage on IGN and GamesIndustry.biz. 
</p>
<p>
During the 30-minute session, we will discuss the role of consoles, the trends on mobile and PC, and look to the potential impact of areas such as game streaming, Netflix and 'metaverse' titles such as Fortnite and Roblox.
</p>
<p>
IGN Live is one of several games events taking place in LA this week, during a period previously occupied by the E3 trade show. Other events include Summer Games Fest, Play Days and Ubisoft Forward, while Xbox will also be on the ground meeting with media following the close of its Games Showcase.
</p>
<p>
There are also a string of digital events scheduled over June, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/summer-games-showcases-what-to-watch-and-when">which you can read all about here. </a>

<p data-characters="357" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/every-scheduled-eso-event-ongoing-and-scheduled-for-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elder Scrolls Online</a></em> has a great deal of customization options among its classes, so it can be overwhelming. It uses a dual bar system where you can quickly swap between weapons and skillsets at the press of a button. But that’s just more complications. Thankfully you can create builds that just use one bar, like this one bar PvE Magicka Sorcerer Build.</p> <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="296" data-injectable="false">There isn’t really one single “one bar” build. Finding out the best one that works for you is often a matter of experimentation. So, try this, but if it doesn’t work for you, change what doesn’t work. However, you will definitely be able to get a capable defense/attack from this build.</p> <p data-characters="217" data-current-count="513" data-injectable="true">If it isn’t clear, as you level your character and decide on where to put your stats and Champion Points, you’re going to want to <strong>focus mainly on improving magicka</strong>. Build your Health and Stamina only as secondary.</p>
 <h2 id="h-skills-for-one-bar-pve-magicka-sorcerer-build" data-injectable="false">Skills for One Bar PvE Magicka Sorcerer Build</h2> <p data-characters="222" data-current-count="222" data-injectable="false">We’ll start with what skills you need for a One Bar PvE Magicka Sorcerer Build. I feel it’s easier to explain the gear you’ll want if you know what you’re slinging. So, my recommended one bar build looks like this:</p> <p data-characters="23" data-current-count="245" data-injectable="false"><strong>Weapon: Lightning Staff</strong></p> <figure data-found-rows="7" data-current-count="825" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Skill</strong></td><td><strong>Skill Line</strong></td><td><strong>Base Skill</strong></td><td><strong>Use</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mystic Orb</strong></td><td><strong>Undaunted</strong></td><td><strong>Necrotic Orb</strong></td><td><strong>Attack</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Unstable Wall of Elements</strong></td><td><strong>Destruction Staff</strong></td><td><strong>Wall of Elements</strong></td><td><strong>Attack</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Critical Surge</strong></td><td><strong>Storm Calling</strong></td><td><strong>Surge</strong></td><td><strong>Damage buff</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Summon Volatile Familiar</strong></td><td><strong>Daedric Summoning</strong></td><td><strong>Summon Unstable Familiar</strong></td><td><strong>Passive damage/damage mitigation</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Summon Twilight Tormentor</strong></td><td><strong>Daedric Summoning</strong></td><td><strong>Summon Winged Twilight</strong></td><td><strong>Passive damage/damage mitigation</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Greater Storm Atronach</strong></td><td><strong>Daedric Summoning</strong></td><td><strong>Summon Storm Atronach</strong></td><td><strong>Passive damage/damage mitigation</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="203" data-current-count="203" data-injectable="false">This build provides a great deal of passive damage from your summons, gives you two straightforward attacks to keep you engaged, and a buff to keep your damage high enough to take down difficult targets.</p> <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="533" data-injectable="true">Your rotation should start by summoning your familiar and twilight tormentor. Once they’re at your side, it’s time for Critical Surge. Throw a Mystic Orb, then an Unstable Wall of Elements. It’s then time to mix in your heavy attack. Whenever one of your skills expires, recast it. Once your Ultimate is charged, unleash it.</p>
 <p data-characters="115" data-current-count="115" data-injectable="false"><strong>Summon Volatile Familiar&gt;Summon Twilight Tormentor&gt;Critical Surge&gt;Mystic Orb&gt;Unstable Wall of Elements.</strong></p> <h2 id="h-gear-for-one-bar-pve-magicka-sorcerer" data-injectable="false">Gear for One Bar PvE Magicka Sorcerer</h2> <p data-characters="115" data-current-count="230" data-injectable="false">Get your crafting character ready to work out some upgrades for the One Bar PvE Magicka Sorcerer’s best gear.</p> <h3 id="h-sergeant-s-mail" data-injectable="false">Sergeant’s Mail</h3> <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="593" data-injectable="true">This is going to sound somewhat strange for a magic-centric character, but my recommended set Sargeant’s Mail. That means it’s heavy armor. It gets dropped in the Wayrest Sewer Dungeons (1 and 2). It might sound bulky (you can always change its appearance at an Outfit Station if it interferes with your drip), but the helpfulness of its bonuses are apparent:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>(2 items)</strong> Adds 1206 Maximum Health</li> <li><strong>(3 items)</strong> Adds 129 Health Recovery</li> <li><strong>(4 items)</strong> Adds 129 Weapon and Spell Damage</li> <li><strong>(5 items)</strong> When you deal damage with a Heavy Attack, you gain a stack of Sergeant’s Focus for 5 seconds, increasing the damage of your Heavy Attacks by 645 per stack. This effect can occur once every second and stacks up to 4 times.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="131" data-current-count="291" data-injectable="false">Not hard to gain, upgrades your heavy attack (which you’ll be using, er, heavily), your spell damage, and Health. Very effective.</p> <h3 id="h-deadly-strike" data-injectable="false">Deadly Strike</h3> <p data-characters="194" data-current-count="485" data-injectable="true">If you’re willing to do some PvP in Cyrodiil, you can supplement with Deadly Strike gear. This is useful, because you don’t need to pile on the equipment in order to get some useful effects:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>(2 items)</strong> Adds 129 Weapon and Spell Damage</li> <li><strong>(3 items)</strong> Adds 657 Critical Chance</li> <li><strong>(4 items)</strong> Adds 129 Weapon and Spell Damage</li> <li><strong>(5 items)</strong> Increase the damage your damage over time and channeled attacks do by 15%.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="53" data-current-count="213" data-injectable="false">As mentioned, you can find Deadly Strike in Cyrodiil.</p> <h3 id="h-oakensoul-ring" data-injectable="false">Oakensoul Ring</h3> <p data-characters="270" data-current-count="483" data-injectable="true">For any One Bar build, the Oakensoul ring is indispensable. It prevents you from swapping between your weapon sets, but… that’s the point of this build. That was already our objective. So, why not just take that option a way in favor of some of these terrific perks.</p>
 <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="40" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>(1 item)</strong> While equipped, you are unable to swap between your Primary and Backup Weapon Sets and gain Minor Berserk, Minor Courage, Major Brutality, Major Sorcery, Major Prophecy, Major Savagery, Minor Force, Minor Protection, Major Resolve, Minor Mending, Minor Fortitude, Minor Intellect, Minor Endurance, Minor Heroism, Minor Slayer, Minor Aegis, and Empower.</li> </ul> <p data-characters="149" data-current-count="189" data-injectable="false">Damned right. You can get the Oakensoul ring through the Antiquities system. You’re going to need to focus your search around High Isle and Amenos.</p> <h2 id="h-other-considerations" data-injectable="false">Other considerations</h2> <p data-characters="97" data-current-count="286" data-injectable="false">Beyond what has already been listed here, there are a few other things you’ll want to consider.</p> <p data-characters="328" data-current-count="614" data-injectable="true">In terms of the race you choose for your character, <strong>High Elf (Altmer) is probably your best bet</strong>, as its passives are magicka and destruction staff-based. Breton is the next best, as they also receive Magicka Bonuses. Dunmer also gets bonuses to spell damage, but the Dual Wield proficiency and Stamina boosts are largely wasted.</p>
 <p data-characters="154" data-current-count="154" data-injectable="false">Otherwise, the race of your character <strong>isn’t a crucial decision</strong>. Choose the one you want to play as or build around the suggested ones. It’s up to you.</p> <p data-characters="218" data-current-count="372" data-injectable="false">As for the Mundus sign you’ll want to align with, the build provided here doesn’t depend too much on it.

However, you probably also want something that can heal you since you don’t have any direct healing skills to keep yourself topped up.</p>
