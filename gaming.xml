<p>Use these Roblox Wings Of Glory monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get free Tactical Medals, allowing players to progress through the levels of the game quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re a fan of the legendary Tom Cruise movie Top Gun, then <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-roblox-prospecting-codes-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> Wings Of Glory is going to be right up your alley. Wings Of Glory is a highly detailed combat flight simulator game that boasts over 150 aircraft, ranging from vintage classics to modern beasts. It features intense 10v10 dogfights in historical locations, allowing players to relive some of the greatest battles the world has ever seen. The fast-paced gameplay can provide hours of endless fun, with six different nations’ aircraft to choose from. Wings Of Glory has extremely realistic flight controls as well as highly customisable planes, making it the ideal game for fans of the aeronautical world. The progression system in the game allows players to get their hands on timely upgrades, but some additional rewards would go a long way, and that’s where the Wings Of Glory codes can come in handy.&nbsp;</p>

However, the easiest way for players to stay up to date with the latest codes would be to simply keep this page bookmarked and check in every now and then.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The Switch 2 continues to be a sales juggernaut, as Nintendo has announced that it has sold over 10 million Switch 2 consoles in its first six months.</p><p>In its <a href="https://chrome-extension//efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251104_4e.pdf">2nd quarter fiscal year report</a>, Nintendo states 10.36 million Switch 2 units have been sold from its June 5 launch through the end of September. Although Nintendo frames this number as an overall decrease from the Switch 2’s hot start, which established it as the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/11/nintendo-switch-2-is-the-fastest-selling-console-ever-with-35-million-units-sold-in">fastest-selling home console ever</a>, it has remained a strong performer.&nbsp;</p><p>This number now means that Switch 2 is selling more than twice as fast as the original Switch did during the same launch period (4.7 million in its first six months in 2017). The Switch 2 has also outperformed the PlayStation 5's sales during its first six months (<a href="https://gameinformer.com/2021/04/28/playstation-shatters-industry-sale-records-for-fy2020-over-78-million-ps5-consoles-sold">7.8 million</a>), albeit that console also suffered from supply shortages.</p>

<p>The report also reveals sales figures for the Switch 2’s marquee first-party titles, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/mario-kart-world/roam-if-you-want-to">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/breaking-through-to-something-new">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>. Mario Kart World, a launch title that was also a pack-in for the $499 Switch 2 bundle, has sold 9.57 million units, with 8.1 million from the console bundle. This means nearly every Switch 2 owner grabbed a copy of the latest Mario racer. Donkey Kong Bananza, which launched on July 17, has sold 3.49 million copies. Overall software sales for Switch 2 in the first half of the fiscal year sit at 20.62 million.</p><p>With the holiday season approaching, the recent launch of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/pokemon-legends-z-a/maintaining-rank">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>, and the highly anticipated release of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/09/12/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hits-nintendo-switch-2-and-switch-this-december">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> on December 4, it’s likely the Switch 2 will continue its strong momentum heading into 2026. In fact, Nintendo has modified its sales forecast for the next fiscal year; it now expects to sell 19 million Switch 2 consoles before the end of March 2026.&nbsp;</p><p>For more on Switch 2, you can see what remaining games will hit the console this year with our <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/29/2025-nintendo-switch-2-game-release-schedule">Switch 2 release calendar</a>.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/i-owe-my-workday-to-criterion-24-7</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-owe-my-workday-to-criterion-24-7.1343692/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Most of the time when I’m working I need a little background noise. Sometimes that means music, sometimes podcasts, sometimes streamers. Most recently I’ve been working with the Criterion 24/7 channel on my second monitor, and I swear to god it’s fixing my mental health.</p><p>My husband and I are very aware of how much bullshit we let into our minds. We try not to binge television shows—after three episodes, we watch something else. For every fluffy blockbuster we watch, we make an appointment to watch something off the beaten path. We pop on an episode of <em>The Gilded Age</em> before embarking on an hours-long baseball game. It’s all about balance: If you’re going to have cotton candy, you have to eat your vegetables too.</p><p>But when I work, I often seek out the kind of slop I try to avoid in the rest of my life. For a long time my bread and butter for working was extremely long Let’s Plays, but I also keep podcasts in the rotation for a similar reason: I just like to hear the sound of human voices while I work on something. Streamers like NorthernLion and Hasan Piker have also worked their way into my routines, though there’s only so much I can take of grown men playing video games at this point in my life, as amusing as their anecdotes may be.&nbsp;</p><p>Reality television (my husband dates it, so I can only watch it in my office), podcasts and streamers genuinely do help me to get started with my work, because they help me feel like I’m not just typing alone in my office with my cat. The problem with all these sources of “content” is that they make me feel like my brain is melting after a while. So last week, on a whim, I tossed on the Criterion’s 24/7 channel, which plays movies from the Criterion Collection 24 hours a day, and I had the complete opposite effect.</p><p>I know that watching a dense, foreign language film like <em>Ceddo</em> while working on an essay or typing emails isn’t going to help me retain much of what I’ve seen. But that said, looking over to my second screen and seeing a frame that’s been arranged deliberately, with care, makes me simply feel more like an adult. I know I can’t really watch the movie with the focus it deserves, but at the very least it’s another really cool film to add to my list, and my growing collection of Blu Rays from Criterion.</p><p>Because of Criterion 24/7, which is available with a subscription to the Criterion’s streaming service, I’ve enjoyed the pleasures of Orson Welles’s<em> The Trial</em>, Pierre Creton’s experimental gay coming of age story <em>Un Prince</em>, as well as <em>In Celebration</em>, which features a very young Brian Cox. Sometimes I’m still in the mood for slop, but it’s a more balanced diet. Even if I’m not grasping every detail from these films, I still feel better off for having seen them—and am sometimes drawn into ten or fifteen minute stretches of beautifully framed shots. Since all of these movies are already in the Criterion streaming collection, I can always watch them again when I’m not working. But when I am working, they remind me that I am not sitting around bullshitting. Like these artists, I have the ability to make things with care, too.</p><p>My mom, who is a professor, used to watch Turner Classic Movies all day long while grading papers before she formed a mild addiction to home renovating shows on Bravo. Maybe I picked up this habit from her instead of inventing it wholecloth. Either way, watching images that are more than incidental, and aspire to more than just entertainment, is healing my neural pathways. It gives me no joy to admit this, but my mom had a point there.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ea-saudi-arabia-creative-control-jared-kushner-donald-trump"><h3>EA Says It Will Retain Creative Control Following Saudi Sale, But, Like, Come On</h3></a><p>Big companies have shown time and time again that they'll say whatever is necessary to get mergers approved</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-halo-white-house-trump-vance"><h3>And Also, Who Even Cares About Halo And Lord Of The Rings These Days</h3></a><p>"All of these things do have a feeling of dragging and resuscitating a corpse"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/final-fantasy-tactics-grind-jp-mandalia-plains"><h3>I Will Grind In Final Fantasy Tactics Every Single Time And You Cannot Stop Me</h3></a><p>Final Fantasy Tactics without grinding Mandalia Plains is like a day without sunshine.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/i-owe-my-workday-to-criterion-24-7]]></content:encoded>

<p>The demo arrives on the Switch eShop — for both the Switch 1 and 2 versions of the game — at <strong>9pm PST</strong> <strong>today</strong> (that's <strong>midnight EST</strong> and <strong>5am BST</strong> on <strong>5th November)</strong> and will allow you to play up to Episode 2.</p>

<p>In case you missed it earlier this year, Raidou Remastered is a completely refreshed version of the 2006 PS2 action RPG <strong>Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army</strong>, which itself is part of the Devil Summoner spin-off series from the Megami Tensei series.</p>
<p>The remaster features completely overhauled visuals and compat, full voice acting, fast travel, the ability to save anywhere, and a number of other quality-of-life features.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/raidou-remastered-the-mystery-of-the-soulless-army">reviewed the Switch 2 version</a> of the game when it launched on 19th June 2025, calling it "a wonderful retread of a forgotten classic", though with some quibbles about the visuals and some simplistic gameplay elements.</p>

			<p>Every year, there are games that are, in the minds of some, criminally underrated and not given the credit they deserve, whether by the large-scale media, awards season, or public tone. For a certain subset of narrative indie game fans, last year's underrated game was 1000xResist by a new Canadian studio, Sunset Visitor.</p>



<p>It was released first on PC and Nintendo Switch and was nominated for several awards, including Outstanding Achievement in Game Director, Story, and Character at the DICE Awards, Best Debut and Best Narrative game at the GDC Awards, and Excellence in Narrative at the IGF Awards, but would only actually win a Peabody Award for Interactive and Immersive Work. I didn't play it last year, though I heard a lot about it and was keen to jump at the chance to review it <a href="https://wccftech.com/1000-x-resist-arrives-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-xbox-game-pass-november/">now that it is arriving on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S</a>.</p>



<p>I'm not going to use this review to rant about games that should or should not be recognized in award season. Something is going to get missed every year; that's just how it goes. What I will say is that I think it is absolutely criminal that 1000xResist was last year's big miss.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Knower. 1000xResist</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>1000xResist is by no means a perfect game, but it has to be said that what Sunset Visitor has created here is one of the best narrative experiences in video games, bar none. There's no real gameplay to speak of, and by the time you're reaching its final chapter, you might be emotionally tired and feel like you just want it to end, but its flaws do not come close to truly weighing down what is probably one of the best narrative games ever, and for my own personal rankings, perhaps the best story I've experienced in a video game.</p>



<p>I love games, but as a means of telling stories, they are not my first love. That belongs to theatre: plays, musicals, opera. Those are the artistic experiences that have given me such immensely powerful stories that affected me the most from a young age, so much so that theatre was my life, professionally and personally, before I started covering video games and writing criticism. </p>



<p>1000xResist is the closest a game has ever come to matching some of the theatrical experiences I've had, and I hold it in the same regard for its storytelling that I do Tetris for its gameplay. It's simply a must-play. You owe it to yourself to experience this game, regardless of the kinds of games you like.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Iris, also known as ALLMOTHER. 1000xResist.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>I will avoid spoilers where I can, because with the story being the core offering here, you're better off experiencing it yourself if you choose to play it. There are, however, a few contextual details that I feel are important to outline when talking about this game, so be warned that while I won't reveal anything too major, I'll discuss some key details you might not care to know about before going in, and some that you would have preferred to remain unspoiled.</p>



<p>With that said, some quick context that's not spoilery at all because it's in the basic description of the game and is all information you get early on. You play as Watcher, a clone living in a world where you and all of your clone 'Sisters' are given functions, and you live within those functions until the ALLMOTHER (sometimes called AllMo) calls you to live with her on the other side. When you start the game, the AllMo is revered as the God of this clone community, and her religious rule is carried out through you, Watcher, and five of your Sisters: Healer, Knower, Fixer, Bang Bang Fire, and Principal.</p>

<p>Their names are their functions, with Knower being the keeper of the archives, Fixer being the one who fixes and keeps the facility working, Healer in charge of printing new clones and keeping the medical bay, Bang Bang Fire (mostly called BB/BBF for short) charged with keeping the facility safe from Occupant attacks, and Principal running the whole operation for AllMo as her administrative figurehead. Finally, the Watcher's job is to watch, to observe.</p>



<p>Occupants are these alien creatures who are why you're in this clone society in the first place. They are alien creatures who came to Earth many years before Watcher was born, and while they didn't attack humans outright, their presence caused a plague that decimated the human population, driving remaining survivors underground and leading them to research new means of keeping humanity alive, hence the cloning. </p>



<p>The AllMo, who was a young Chinese-Canadian girl named Iris in her life before becoming the God to hundreds of clones made in her image, is the only one who is immune to the disease, so she is taken underground to be cloned, studied, all of which leads to a series of events that lead to the story you experience.</p>

<p>To avoid spoilers for as long as possible, with that all laid out, I'll start by talking about the gameplay, or more accurately, the lack thereof. There's no real gameplay loop to speak of here. For most of your time, you are just walking/running to different NPCs, talking to them, and moving the story forward. Because large chunks of the gameplay do involve you entering what are called 'communions' with other characters, where you inhabit the memories of the AllMo/Iris and learn about her life, that space is less grounded in reality and contains sections where you fly from one point to another, but it honestly just felt like something to do that wasn't running around.</p>



<p>To be clear, I don't mind that there isn't any major gameplay loop or mechanic here. How you experience the story through dialogue trees, environmental storytelling, and cutscenes was honestly enough for me. I can appreciate that Sunset Visitor is trying to change things up with the sections that have you flying from one place to another, but they never felt properly woven into the storytelling. </p>



<p>In an otherwise very well-directed game, these sections felt directionless in their gameplay. Speaking of being directionless, the other major gameplay issue I have with 1000xResist is how easy it is to get lost in the main space you explore, the Orchard. I was constantly getting lost running around the Orchard, trying to find the next character I had to talk to. The layout of the Orchard is confusing, and the game doesn't give you a lot of help to find your way around.</p>


<figure>
<div>

<figure>
<figure><figcaption><em>Most of what you're doing in 1000xResist is walking down halls like this.</em></figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption><em>The map doesn't really help.</em></figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption><em>The flying sections felt disconnected to the rest of the game.</em></figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption><em>These areas have narrative meaning, but they're still not engaging to run around and get lost in.</em></figcaption></figure>
</figure>
<div>
				    		
				    		
					    	<p><span>2 of 9</span>
				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>Now, it's not like the Orchard was made confusing to navigate for no reason. There's narrative intention behind the design, but that doesn't mean it was fun to get lost and have the pacing of the story broken up by moments where I want to move forward but can't because I'm suddenly lost and stuck running around. I get the 'why' behind it, but it's a choice that comes with drawbacks.</p>



<p>Since that's about all there is to say about the gameplay in 1000xResist, the story is all that's left, and it's also all it needs, because Sunset Visitor wrote a beautiful, layered, complex story that I genuinely think is important to play and experience in the same way I think it's important to experience work by artists like Wajdi Mouawad and Sarah Kane. </p>



<p>Remember all that context I explained earlier? You learn all that early on in the game, but that's not how it starts. It starts with you witnessing Watcher kill Iris, the AllMo, the original from which the rest of the clones came, and you begin to work your way up that event, learning what drove Watcher to kill her 'mother.' The first half of the game is about waking up to reality, about going from someone who is observing and 'watching' to someone who is taking action, and how we can't choose comfort and convenience over our humanity. The second half presents a nuanced and complex view of what resistance looks like, why it's important to resist those who would take from you, because not resisting means not being able to even breathe freely.</p>


<figure>

				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>While its core message of resisting plays out as what I feel is the core arc for the plot, you have all these incredibly powerful character arcs about a variety of difficult topics. You see a story about diaspora, the struggles that Iris and her family faced as immigrants from Hong Kong living in Canada. There's an incredibly powerful allegory for the societal damage wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic and what came after. An impactful marriage story about two people pushed to unimaginable lengths, stories about friendship, about community action, and the whole time, the game is challenging you by asking you meaningful questions, asking you to decide where you draw the line.</p>



<p>What's unforgivable along the path of resistance? What actions are necessary evils, and what crosses the line? What can we learn from tradition, and where do we need to accept change? What can you forgive, and what can only God forgive, if God is still paying attention at all? Which moments in our lives define us, and do we get to choose what they are?</p>



<p>It culminates with the 1000xResist very directly asking you what to keep and what to leave behind. It holds a mirror to the world and makes you choose, with each of its seven endings playing out in different (and sometimes not so different) ways. The multiple endings are also another reason why I love this game. While Sunset Visitor is asking you these grand questions about life and the world, it doesn't leave its own feelings in total ambiguity. The studio provides its own answers, stands its ground for what it believes, and you're left to wrestle with that and everything else presented.</p>

<p>I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that the story hits as hard as it does from more than just its incredible writing and voice acting. The striking images paired with a score that plays a huge role in making every big story beat have an impact, all work in tandem to make this game the best narrative experience I've had in a video game.</p>



<p>I also feel that I can't close this review without mentioning one last disappointment, which is I had a few more performance hiccups than I would like. Nothing too egregious, but it felt odd that on my PS5, a game that is not at all taxing on the hardware compared to the big triple-A titles of the modern era had any performance issues at all, with the frame rate dropping in some particularly important scenes.</p>



<p>1000xResist is a nuanced story that actually has something to say, that doesn't provide a clean image because life isn't clean. Life is disruptive, it's sad, it's violent, and it also holds beauty, love, happiness, and community. Living is more than suffering; it's more than just being alive, and you should resist anyone who tries to impose less than that on you, even yourself. A point hit home at every corner of the game, when you really start to think about how almost every character you meet in 1000xResist has the same face.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>It's the kind of game, the kind of story that will always stay with me. I'll always be jealous of people who get to play it for the first time because I can never do that again. Play 1000xResist. Live for more than just being alive.</p>

				<p>1000xResist is probably the best narrative experience I have had with a video game ever. It's incredibly impactful story is nuanced, complex, layered and most importantly, it actually has something to say, while asking you to reflect and wrestle with your own core principles and how you carry yourself through the world. It's unfortunate that its minor gameplay struggles bring the experience down enough to interrupt the pacing, but 1000xResist more than over delivers with a story that stays with you long after the credits role. It is a must-play because it is a vulnerable, honest, and important work of art that everyone should experience.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-review-changes-new-map-short-2000640868"><em>Fortnite’s</em> latest season is all about</a> <em>The Simpsons,</em> the long-running animated sitcom that premiered in 1989 and is still running on Fox to this day. And one location in the new Springfield-inspired island is The Simpsons’ home, a strange, mysterious place that has no set layout and changes from episode to episode. And somehow, Epic had to recreate this cartoon logic in a static location for a video game, and the end result is, as you might expect, weird in its own way.</p> <p>I want to warn you now that the rest of this post is filled with some <a href="https://kotaku.com/homer-cubed-3d-treehouse-horror-fox-30-years-ago-1995-2000639909"><em>Simpsons</em></a> nerd nonsense. Be prepared for that. If the idea of someone seriously thinking about the layout of a cartoon home might upset you, I’d suggest you move on to something else. For everyone else, let’s go.</p>

 <p>742 Evergreen Terrace, aka the Simpsons’ home, is a place that many of you are likely familiar with and can imagine in your mind. Even if you haven’t watched the long-running animated series in many, many years, I bet the iconic Simpsons house is still rattling around up there in your grey matter. But let me ask you some questions. How many bathrooms does it contain? Where’s the door to the basement? Is there a closet in the foyer? How does the garage connect to the rest of the living space? You might think you know the answer to some or even all of these queries, but you’d be wrong because the <a href="https://x.com/Joshstrangehill/status/1255163988163215360">show’s writers and artists are always changing the house</a>.</p>

 <h2>The weird place next to the kitchen</h2> <p>For example, let’s dive into the hallway to the right of the kitchen. This is one of the least documented spots in the Simpsons’ house in the entire series. Scenes rarely happen here; the show often uses camera angles that hide most of this spot, and the layout of this area changes constantly. Sometimes there’s a door over here to the basement, but sometimes that door leads to the garage. This area is also where the <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/742_Evergreen_Terrace#Rooms:~:text=There%20is%20a%20rarely,appearance%20in%20later%20episodes.">legendary rumpus room</a> exists, though there are episodes where this room is missing entirely. So how does <em>Fortnite</em> handle this bizarre area? In it’s own really weird way!</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000641155" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641155"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641155">©Epic / Disney / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Epic has decided to expand this usually empty utility space and has added a foosball table, dart board, and chair. The rumpus room is still here, but lacks a door. And oddly, there’s now a laundry room or mud room connecting the garage to this part of the house. This laundry room area is a totally new invention for <em>Fortnite</em>, and I think it’s only here because Epic stuck a bathroom down here and had some space to fill.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000641164" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641164"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641164">©Epic / Disney / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Oh, and yeah, there’s a bathroom down here. Some fans have theorized there might be one here; otherwise, the Simpsons would have to go upstairs every time they need to use the toilet. But evidence of a downstairs bathroom is scarce, and when it has appeared, like under the stairs in the foyer, it rarely sticks around. So I guess shoving a bathroom down in this hallway is probably the best option. As for a basement door, nope. There’s not even a basement at all. Epic just didn’t include it.</p>

 <h2>Things are weird upstairs, too</h2> <p>Moving upstairs, things get even weirder, but that’s not entirely Epic’s fault. This section of the Simpsons’ house, where you can find the characters’ bedrooms and at least one bathroom, is a very strange place. The layout here can shift from episode to episode or even scene to scene, with Bart’s room moving around at least twice in the episode “My Sister, My Sitter.” So trying to model this area was always going to be tricky. And for the most part, I think Epic did a good job. But uh, what the heck is this area?</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000641156" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641156"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641156">©Epic / Disney / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>When I first spotted this odd hallway/sitting area connected to the master bedroom, I was extremely confused. There’s a couch up here? What is going on? Even weirder, this is where Epic has decided to shove the upstairs bathroom. I guess Epic didn’t want to have this space be a bathroom, as that would mean the master bedroom would be connected to both the upstairs bathroom and the master bath. Which would be odd, but I find this whole new room and space even weirder.</p> <p>However, in a way, Epic adding two new spaces to the Simpsons’ house is perfectly on brand for this place. The Simpsons’ house is and always has been a wild mess that changes constantly to suit the needs of whatever joke or story is being told. Like the show’s timeline and reality, the house is extremely flexible, and that’s fine. This is an animated comedy. The house and everything else can move around as much as needed as long as I’m laughing. It just means that when you start to think about it or have to rebuild it in a video game as a static object, things get funky. If you want to learn more about the house, check out <a href="https://youtu.be/PKQ6CmIDV1g">RealJim’s video about it and all its quirks</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ahead of its November 14th, 2025, release, Activision has put out the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 launch trailer. Despite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-release-date-remains-unchanged/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors of an early release</a>, this all but confirms it’s sticking to its launch date with no early access.</p>



<p>As the next mainline entry, Black Ops 7 is putting a big emphasis on multiplayer. With a co-op campaign and 18 launch multiplayer maps, it’s honing in on what fans want. Despite returning to the futuristic settings of games past,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-not-have-jetpacks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">without jetpacks</a>, it’s still one of 2025’s biggest titles. Now, we have the launch trailer for the upcoming FPS that showcases just about everything it has to offer.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-called-the-biggest-black-ops-yet-in-new-launch-trailer">Black Ops 7 Called “The Biggest Black Ops Yet” in New Launch Trailer</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Call of Duty Black Ops 7 | PC Features Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8P1Z6CyfEjk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In the trailer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P1Z6CyfEjk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shown above</a>, we see a lot of Black Ops 7, from its campaign to multiplayer and zombies. It does show off all of the game’s offerings through gameplay and cinematics. There’s some new footage like the return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-standoff-meltdown-maps-season-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 2</a>‘s Menendez and campaign locales, but it’s more or less the same. Still, it does state that Black Ops 7 is the biggest Black Ops game ever, which is a bold statement.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen if it will live up to the sub-series’ pedigree, given how well-received Black Ops titles are. Some of Call of Duty’s best titles were from Black Ops, like 1 and 2. Even then, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-free-trial-battlefield-6-redsec-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>, which came out last year, was one of the more positively reviewed entries in years. As a fan of the series, I do hope Black Ops 7 lives up to the hype, even with the emphasis on multiplayer. We’ll know for sure as we head to November 14th.</p>

                <p>For the last two decades, Valve's Steam has grown into a gigantic hub for distributing PC games. It's become one of the most important marketplaces in the entire gaming industry. Now, a new poll suggests that a majority of developers believe that Steam has a monopoly on the PC gaming business. But that doesn't seem to be stopping any of the companies from using Steam.</p><p>Atomik Research has shared the findings of its survey, "The State of PC Game Distribution," through the PC distribution platform Rokky (via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/72-of-devs-believe-steam-has-a-monopoly-on-pc-games-according-to-study" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a>). The survey was conducted in May of this year with responses from 306 industry executives in the United States and the United Kingdom.</p><p>According to the results, 72% of all responding executives felt that Steam has a monopoly on the PC games market. The survey participants also acknowledged that Steam sales provide over 75% of their revenue. But only 32% of responding executives said that their companies still support physical media of some form.</p><p>The survey notes that 48% of executives' companies also distribute through the Epic Game Store and the Xbox PC Games store. A much smaller percentage, 10%, uses GOG, while only 8% use Itch.io. However, 80% of responders expect to use alternative sales channels in addition to Steam over the next five years.</p><p>In the meantime, success on Steam can provide a huge windfall, especially for the small developers behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rv-there-yet/" data-ref-id="5000-697807">RV There Yet</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/escape-from-duckov/">Escape From Duckov</a>, and this year's indie blockbuster, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. Steam recently shared the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/50-most-played-steam-next-fest-demos-are-heavy-on-horror-and-adventure/1100-6535607/" data-ref-id="1100-6535607">50 most-played Steam Next Fest demos</a>, which featured a mixture between large studio titles and games created by smaller devs.</p>

                <p>The newest Fortnite season, which is all about The Simpsons, is putting up big numbers.

As such, you can expect all kinds of coverage about the game from our time visiting Square Enix's Shibuya, Tokyo, offices to play Reimagined for two hours and interview various leads on the development team. That coverage begins today!</p><p>While talking to Reimagined producer Takeshi Ichikawa about this remake – Square Enix's second remake following the release of the original Dragon Quest VII in 2001 (in the U.S.) and the Nintendo 3DS remake in 2016 – he spoke about some of the changes happening in the main scenario. We'll have more on that this month, but for now, I want to focus on something that might excite players already familiar with the narrative of Dragon Quest VII: a new ending.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z13aCVkZaaw"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z13aCVkZaaw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"[Reimagined] follows the narrative of the original story, but depending on some of the [...] player choices, players will get to see a new conclusion that's never been seen before in previous iterations," Ichikawa tells me. "So, even players who have played previous versions of Dragon Quest VII, they'll still get to have this fresh narrative experience with Reimagined."</p><p>Unfortunately, I couldn't glean much more from Ichikawa about this new conclusion, but Reimagined launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC on February 5, so we don't have to wait too long to learn more.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/digital-issue/2025/11/04/the-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-digital-issue-is-now-live">check out this article</a> breaking down everything in the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2025/10/21/cover-reveal-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined issue of <em>Game Informer</em></a>, and be sure to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">subscribe here</a> if you haven't yet so you can access the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/adventure-doesnt-wait">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined cover story</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/the-history-of-dragon-quest-as-told-by-creator-yuji-horii">our deep dive into Dragon Quest history</a> with creator Yuji Horii, and so much more.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/exclusive/2025/11/04/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-will-have-a-new-never-before-seen-conclusion]]></content:encoded>

<p>This is the Raye</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Holiday season is almost upon us (this writer's local supermarket rolled out the advent calendars weeks ago), and Nintendo UK is equally keen to spread some festive cheer with its new TV ads.</p>
<p>This year's offering once again puts the record-breaking singer-songwriter star Raye front and centre, showing that even Brit-winners like to let off some steam with a few rounds of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Mario Party Jamboree</a>.</p>
<p>Much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/nintendo-uks-latest-switch-advert-shows-just-how-little-we-know-about-pop-music">last year's affair</a>, which also starred Raye, the ads focus on the family-friendly joy of a Nintendo system, as if to say, "forget the Brits, Grammys and Forbes list, only a Switch 2 can make you <em>this</em> happy". And once again, we'd be lying if we said that Raye doesn't do a good job of selling it — that's the face of someone who knows the joys of smashing a Crockoid in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>. Sure, it's cheesier than a Christmas cheese board, but nobody's after gritty realism from a holiday ad.</p>
<p>While Raye is this year's returning face, it's the <em>first</em> festive ads for the Switch 2 — hence all the GameChat and Mouse Mode. Expect to see similar shots of merry, bright faces playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> via a Switch 2 Camera for years to come...</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Eight years on from its initial announcement, the long-awaited <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is now just a month from launch — and today, fans can watch a fresh trailer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Due to launch on December 4, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond remains mysterious, with Nintendo keeping details of its much-delayed first-person shooter largely under wraps. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Exactly how it picks up the story of the Metroid Prime trilogy, 18 years later, we have no idea. All the areas Samus will visit? Not a clue. Chozo lore? Dark Samus? Phazon? Other bounty hunters? Time will tell. (Though, as of September, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-finally-has-a-release-date-while-samus-has-a-motorbike">we know Samus somehow has a motorbike</a>.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This year, in particular, has seen Nintendo fans fret over the continued wait for more information, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-metroid-prime-4-beyond-delay-rumors-nintendo-recommits-to-2025-launch">rumors of a delay spread</a> as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-reportedly-set-for-september-as-metroid-prime-4-release-date-and-mario-40th-anniversary-speculation-mounts">the wait for a release date dragged on</a>. Glimpses of the game to date have not prompted an outpouring of excitement, either, with a fairly mixed response to the Switch 2 event demo (to be fair, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-played-metroid-prime-4-beyond-first-hands-on-preview">linear and not overly exciting section from the game's opening</a>) and brief showing in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-september-2025-live-updates-everything-announced">September's general Nintendo Direct</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fan eyebrows have been raised, too, by the apparent lack of marketing dedicated to the game. Where Kirby Air Riders has been featured in two lengthy dedicated Nintendo Directs, Metroid Prime 4 has had none.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there is still time for the Metroid Prime 4 hype machine to kick into gear. And now, 30 days from launch, fans are celebrating today's new trailer doing just that. While there are no standout reveals in the video, it does an entertaining job of showing Samus in action, highlighting baddie Sylux, and revisiting more of the game's setting: the planet Viewros.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Metroidvania Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Trailer felt like, 'Yes, we've heard you all about the marketing. Please have this,'" wrote Metroid fan Jawmuncher on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/metroid-prime-4-beyond-survive-trailer.1343221/page-2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ResetEra</a>. "I approve. This is a trailer I could use to sell someone on the game. The last trailer I could not unless they REALLY like motorcycles."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Finally a good trailer," agreed AppleKid. "Still want to know more but this trailer at least isn't hype deflating like the last 2. Game looks great!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But still, there are calls for a dedicated Metroid Prime 4 deep dive, via a dedicated Nintendo Direct. "Kirby Air Riders got two," noted Khanimus. "The game people have been actively anticipating since it was announced 8 years ago probably should get one."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond launches for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 next month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <p>
Just weeks after Japan rejected Nintendo's initial efforts to patent a variety of Pokémon-style monster capture and throwing mechanics - a patent that might prove critical in the company's ongoing patent infringement lawsuit against <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> - the US has taken the "rare" step of re-examining a previously granted Pokémon patent, believing it could be invalid.
</p>
<p>
Back in September, the US Patent and Trademark Office <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-nintendos-potentially-industry-changing-new-monster-battling-patent-enforceable-we-asked-some-lawyers">granted Nintendo a new patent</a> (Patent No. 12,403,397, applied for in March 2023) covering gameplay mechanics relating to the summoning of a sub-character to battle an enemy. However, as <a href="https://gamesfray.com/huge-blow-for-nintendo-head-of-u-s-patent-office-takes-rare-step-to-order-reexamination-of-summon-subcharacter-and-let-it-fight-in-1-of-2-modes-patent/">reported by Games Fray</a>, USPTO director John A. Squires has now "personally ordered" the organisation to re-examine that patent following the discovery of prior art references in two older patents.
</p>
<p>
In his <a href="https://gamesfray.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/25-11-03-Director-Initiated-Order-for-Ex-Parte-Reexamination-397-Patent.pdf">re-examination order</a>, Squires says he has "determined that substantial new questions of patentability have arisen" in relation to certain claims in Nintendo's granted patent. These claims broadly reference controlling a player character on a field in a virtual space based on movement input; causing a sub-character to appear on the field based on input; using a sub-character to battle an enemy placed in the same location based on input; placing a sub-character into an unoccupied location and having its movements controlled automatically, plus situations where battling unfolds automatically.
</p>
<p>
However, Squires' order specifically cites two earlier patents - one filed by Konami in 2002, the other by Nintendo in 2019 - both relating to the manual and automatic control of players and sub-characters in a virtual field and in battle. "Therefore," the order continues, "a reasonable examiner would consider [the patents] to be important in deciding whether the claims are patentable, and [each] raises a substantial new question of patentability."
</p><p>
Games Fray notes Squires' order (seemingly the first such re-examination order since 2012) doesn't automatically mean Nintendo's patent will be revoked, but it does make it "highly likely" this will occur. Nintendo has two months to respond to the order, and third parties are also able to present their own challenges within that timeframe.
</p>
<p>
All this follows the Japan Patent Office's recent decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/could-palworld-triumph-over-pokemon-in-lawsuit-japans-rejection-of-nintendo-patent-might-make-things-more-interesting">reject an application filed by Nintendo in March last year</a> - attempting to patent certain capture and item-throwing mechanics - on the grounds "claimed invention(s)" already existed "in Japan or other foreign countries prior to the filing of the patent application". The rejection - which isn't final - was based on documentation provided by an unnamed third-party (believed to be Palworld developer Pocketpair) pointing to instances of similar mechanics existing prior to the filing in games such as Monster Hunter 4, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-survival-evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">launched its controversial lawsuit against Pocketpair last year</a> following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-reaches-25m-players-in-first-month">Palworld's wildly successful launch</a>, accusing the studio of infringing "multiple" patents. In response, Pocketpair <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-vows-to-fight-nintendo-lawsuit-on-behalf-of-fans-and-indie-developers">vowed to fight the legal action</a>, saying it wanted to ensure small studios could not be "hindered or discouraged from pursuing creative ideas".

			<p>Today is November 4, 2025, making it officially one month until the release of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. A game we've been waiting on for years now is a few short weeks, days, away from being in the hands of players on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2, and its latest gameplay trailer feels like it is meeting the moment.</p>



<p>The new "<em>Survive</em>" trailer showcases more of the new world players will explore in Metroid Prime 4, but mostly shows off the new enemies and dark challenges Samus will face.</p>



<p>With a few undeniably cool shots of Samus <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-vi-o-la-motorcycle-details/">on her new motorcycle for good measure.</a></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition – Survive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3fN5zFkeA4A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>When Metroid Prime 4 arrives on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 devices in a month's time, on Switch 2 it'll be playable at 4K/60 FPS, or at 1080p/120 FPS. It'll be the latest cross-generation release from Nintendo that'll likely highlight just how far behind the OG Switch is compared to the Switch 2, though hopefully that doesn't mean it's a mess on the OG Switch.</p>



<p>Metroid Prime 4 was first announced in 2017, and two years after that, <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-retro-studios/">development was completely rebooted</a>. Nintendo started from scratch, and now, almost a decade later, we're finally going to see what all the waiting was for.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-impressions/">Wccftech's Nathan Birch previewed the game earlier this year,</a> he wrote, "<em>Based on my early hands-on, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond probably won’t change how most fans feel about the series. It’s more of a good thing that we haven’t got a fresh dose of in a long time, and make no mistake, this is going to be the most playable, technically-sound version of Metroid Prime to date. A few easily-tweakable issues aside, the mouse controls work, and 120fps on a Nintendo console is a real thing that’s actually happening. I still have a lot more I need to play, but it seems like Metroid Prime fans have a rewarding bounty coming their way</em>."</p>

                <p>The next big addition to Fortnite generated some big complaints, but fortunately, you can raise those directly at developer Epic Games in a new survey from the studio.</p><p>With the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-simpsons-season/2900-7202/" data-ref-id="2900-7202">mini-season based on The Simpsons</a> comes the debut of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-will-let-you-buy-pet-sidekicks-next-month/1100-6535822/" data-ref-id="1100-6535822">Sidekicks, adorable pets that accompany you</a> (and offer no gameplay advantage) on your battle royale bouts. But a closer look at the fine print reveals that the base appearance of these cute cosmetic creatures can only be customized once they have been obtained.</p><p>That means if you purchase a Sidekick from the Fortnite item shop, you only get one chance to determine its basic look, and you won't be able to change it afterward. If you want the same Sidekick but with, say, a different fur color, you'll have to buy it again. You can change the names of your Sidekicks at any time, however. Players have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1ok0yco/sidekicks_sound_fun_until_you_read_the_fine_print/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">leveled complaints online</a>, accusing Epic Games of greed.</p><p>A new <a href="https://epicgames.questionpro.com/a/TakeSurvey?tt=B4iH6pExGWwECHrPeIW9eQ==" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">survey from Epic Games</a> sent to players addresses this point head-on, explicitly asking participants about their familiarity with Sidekicks and how they feel about having to buy an entirely new Sidekick for different basic features. Survey participants can only answer through multiple-choice bubbles, with responses ranging from "Strongly Dislike" to "Strongly Like."</p><p>From a certain perspective, having the basic appearance of Sidekicks is somewhat logical--you can't just change how your real-life pet looks at any time, and their base features are forever part of their identity. On the other hand, Fortnite is a video game, and players desire to do whatever the heck they want. Plenty of games let you change your physical appearance at any time.</p><p>Sidekicks will be available in the item store starting November 7, costing 1,200 or 1,500 V-Bucks, which is around $10 to $13.50 USD. They'll include a dog named Spike and a raptor named, uh, Lil' Raptor.</p><p>Until then, the only Sidekick you can obtain is the banana-like puppy Peels, who you can earn through unlocking the current battle pass. Peels comes with its own progression track that includes outfits, accessories, and emotes.</p><p>This mini-season of Fortnite lasts until November 29, after which the battle royale's Chapter 7--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-seven-teasers-hint-at-kill-bill-collaboration/1100-6535910/" data-ref-id="1100-6535910">rumored to include a Kill Bill collaboration</a> -- commences.</p>

                <p>Nintendo's litigation against <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/palworld/" data-ref-id="5000-532768">Palworld</a> developer Pocketpair is becoming increasingly complicated by the day, with one recent patent granted to the Pokemon franchise now under review by the United States.</p><p>According to <a href="https://gamesfray.com/huge-blow-for-nintendo-head-of-u-s-patent-office-takes-rare-step-to-order-reexamination-of-summon-subcharacter-and-let-it-fight-in-1-of-2-modes-patent/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a new Games Fray report</a>, the new head of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), John A. Squires, has ordered a reexamination of Nintendo’s <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US12403397B2/en?oq=12%2C403%2C397" rel="nofollow ">Patent No. 12,403,397</a>. Filed in January 2023, granted to Nintendo in September 2025, and dubbed the '397 patent, the listing is oftentimes oversimplified to "summoning characters and making them fight." It's for this reason that Squires's office is seeking to determine if such a feature is even patentable.</p><p>"I have determined that substantial new questions of patentability have arisen as to claims 1, 13, 25, and 26 of U.S. Patent No. 12,403,397 B2 (the '397 patent')," Squires wrote in his order, citing two older applications filed by Konami in 2002 (Yabe) and Nintendo in 2019 (Taura) as justification for the patent's reexamination. "Thus, a reasonable examiner would consider each of Yabe and Taura to be important in deciding whether the claims are patentable, and Yabe and Taura each raise a substantial new question of patentability. I hereby order [the] reexamination of the '397 patent."</p><p>Konami's Yabe patent revolves around a sub-character battling with you either automatically or manually. Nintendo's Taura patent refers to the same thing.</p><p>So, in Squires's view, Nintendo's '397 patent doesn't constitute <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-argues-game-mods-arent-prior-art-in-palworld-lawsuit/1100-6534882/" data-ref-id="1100-6534882">the "prior art" argument</a> the company put forth against Palworld because games that came out before the patent was filed and awarded contradict that. The "summon character and let it fight" mechanic is an oversimplification of the patent's language, with The Verge <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/779062/nintendo-pokemon-summoning-battle-patent" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">describing</a> it as closer to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-scarlet-pokemon-violet/" data-ref-id="5000-559213">Pokemon Scarlet and Violet's</a> "auto-battling" system. However, with other games like the Digimon franchise, the Persona series, and even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/" data-ref-id="5000-497664">Elden Ring</a> letting you summon characters that fight alongside you, Squires wants to relitigate what exactly is patentable in the first place.</p><p>Nintendo has two months to respond to the USPTO's order.

<figure data-uuid="a331f14a956ca"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a331f14a956ca/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The world of video games hasn't provided much respite from global issues recently, not for those of us who love games and the people who make them. The issues facing the industry and players post-COVID — including mass layoffs, cancelled projects, questionable acquisitions, the encroachment of generative AI, rising prices, an unstable economy and a cost-of-living crisis — mean it's easy to assume there's no going back.</p>
<p>But just when you catch yourself pondering whether the good ol' days of games as an artistic medium and pastime are numbered, just when it looks like we're hurtling down a F2P, games-as-a-service slide greased with AI-generated turds, Nintendo goes and proves that there's life in the old console model yet.</p>
<p>All the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/switch-2-has-sold-more-than-6-million-units-and-almost-as-many-copies-of-mario-kart-world">hardware numbers following launch</a> have been encouraging, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">today's financial results</a> give a much better picture of Switch 2's status, including figures from its first full quarter on the market. Any console from the big platform holders would be expected to sell well early doors, but numbers from July to September have maintained good momentum throughout a summer period where sales traditionally dry up in the biggest gaming territories.</p>
<p>To recap, Switch 2 has sold 10.36 million units since launch, causing the company to bump up its first-year sales forecast from 15 to 19 million ahead of the holidays. Software forecasts have also been bumped from 45 to 48 million.</p>
<figure data-uuid="061603600aafb"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/061603600aafb/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:193371 @ 1762284657 -->
<p>As you might expect, especially when its successor offers very broad backwards compatibility with performance improvements, Switch 1 numbers have plummeted 60% year-on-year. Yet 1.89 million isn't a bad figure either, and Nintendo still thinks it can sell 4 million OG Switches this financial year, half a million fewer than previous forecasts. Switch 1 is just <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-is-poised-to-be-nintendos-best-selling-console-of-all-time">10,000 units away from DS' all-time console record</a>, with only the PS2 ahead of that. And despite the hardware decline, S1 software forecasts have gone up by 20 million to 125 million. More positive news for Nintendo's accountants.</p>
<p>Games-wise, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> bundle worked wonders (with most people presumably avoiding the $80 standalone price), with 9.57 million copies of the game out there as of 30th September. And <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> has sold 3.49 million units to date. Not Mario Kart numbers, but healthy for a non-bundled release; around a third of all Switch 2 owners also have a copy of DKB. It's never going to trouble MKW's current, colossal 92% attach rate, but the ape is holding his own.</p>
<figure data-uuid="931c4e78e3c32"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/931c4e78e3c32/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>High prices and uncertainty in the US made it a tricky launch; with Microsoft and Sony increasing hardware prices this year, Nintendo had a tricky needle to thread with its pricing. But despite the hashtags and general dismay at an $80 Mario Kart — at present, Nintendo's only non-NS2 Edition game at that price point — and increased accessory costs, the numbers speak for themselves. They threaded that needle well enough.</p>
<p>The system could have been rushed out last year, but again, holding back and stockpiling hardware to satisfy demand has paid dividends, with the ball rolling nicely over the summer months. Despite industry trends and suboptimal circumstances, Nintendo has proved that the market is still there, the appetite still healthy. People <em>are</em> still willing to pay for quality. The slow and steady approach has paid off. The strategy is working.</p>
<p>The third-party support has been excellent, too. Sure, multiplatform gamers may have played a lot of these games before, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-release">Game-Key Card</a> discontent is real, but looking at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-best-nintendo-switch-2-games">the best games on Switch 2 so far</a>, 'old' games or otherwise, the quality is undeniable.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8ecc82dfd0fd1"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8ecc82dfd0fd1/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The wider problems with the games industry surround us still. While PS5 is selling well, Sony's hardly had the most exciting generation, benefiting as Microsoft lurches between <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/10/price-increases-are-never-fun-for-anybody-says-xbox-exec-defending-game-pass-changes">PR disasters</a> and makes Xbox a less viable option by the day. Price increases across the board, however, seem to be making the value proposition of gaming hardware and subscription services worse all the time.</p>
<p>Yet here's Nintendo putting out a little tablet console that, against the odds, is tracking very favourably with its trailblazing predecessor. Switch 2 certainly isn't cheap, and it's arguably still lacking its truly killer app, its 'I <em>must</em> own a Switch 2 to play Game X!' Mario Kart was a great opening salvo. Bananza is brilliant, but it's not a Mario. Switch 2 doesn't have its Breath of the Wild yet. (In fact, you could argue that, weirdly, Switch 2's BOTW <em>is</em> BOTW, but that's another article.)</p>
<p>What it does offer, though, has been enough for more-than-enough people. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-one-month-on-how-did-nintendos-switch-2-launch-go">The launch had its stresses</a>, but Nintendo has maintained the momentum beyond that opening month and is very well-placed to get stuck in over the holidays and into the new year with a packed and varied lineup. Next quarter's results — the October-November-December crop — will include figures for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a>, <em>and</em> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4</a>.</p>
<p>That's four brand new games, including two S2 exclusives, and we already know that Pokémon had a monster-sized launch, scoring <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/pokemon-legends-z-a-scored-us-biggest-physical-game-launch-since-totk">the US' biggest physical launch since</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a>. Packed, varied, and super effective indeed - and that's just the first-party-published stuff.</p>
<figure data-uuid="41c00c3939cc3"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/41c00c3939cc3/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Over the past few months, I've pondered if peppering umpteen NS2 Edition upgrades between its brand new S2 exclusives would be enough to get people on board and sufficiently excited to splash out on a pricey console, despite the pent-up desire for something new. For all the buzz, the next Animal Crossing is, well, the 'old' Animal Crossing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/surprise-animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition-arrives-next-year">with some Bells and whistles</a>. Will that be enough? Will the inevitable 'Super Smash Bros. Ultimate - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Hyper Fighting Dash Dojo EX' keep this ball rolling?</p>
<p>All evidence points to 'Yes, absolutely.' Well played, Nintendo.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Xbox has announced the first batch of games coming to Xbox Game Pass for the month of November 2025, with the big ticket of the month being Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which is only available to PC Game Pass and Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, but will still undoubtedly make the biggest splash.</p>



<p>Surrounding Call of Duty is a slew of indie games, almost like Xbox didn't want to go out and grab anything too major for November for fear of overshadowing its golden goose. That's just some joking speculation, of course, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-far-behind-battlefield-6-pre-order-sales/">it would be difficult for any game, no matter how big, to overshadow a Call of Duty release</a>.</p>



<p>That said, the games you'll be able to check out on Xbox Game Pass include Pigeon Simulator, a game where you play as a pigeon that is a member of a top-secret unit that has orders to deal with dangerous anomalies harming New Squawk City. Winter Burrow is a woodland survival game where you play as a mouse coming back home for the winter. Dead Static Drive is an indie survival horror game with Eldritch themes while carrying a spooky tone underneath it all.</p>



<p>All of those games, along with Black Ops 7, are available on their launch days, and as day one releases are only available to those at the Game Pass Ultimate tier.</p>



<p>For those not at the top tier, you'll be able to add Sniper Elite: Resistance, Voidtrain, Great God Grove, and Lara Craft and the Temple of Osiris to your gaming time this month.</p>



<p>Here's a full list of what's coming to Xbox Game Pass in November 2025, and which tiers they'll all be available for:</p>



<ul>
<li>Dead Static Drive - November 5 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Sniper Elite: Resistance - November 5 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Egging On - November 6 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Whiskerwood - November 6 - PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Voidtrain - November 7 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Great God Grove - November 11 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris - November 11 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Pigeon Simulator - November 11 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Relic Hunters Legend - November 12 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Winter Burrow - November 12 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 - November 14 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, with games entering the subscription service, there are games leaving. This month, five games will leave the service, a couple of them being major departures. The departures are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Football Manager 2024 (both the PC and console versions)</li>



<li>Blacksmith Master</li>



<li>Frsotpunk</li>



<li>STALKER 2: Heart of Chernobyl</li>



<li>Spirittea</li>
</ul>

              <p>The computer role-playing game, most widely known as the RPG, turns 50 today! Well, as close as we can pin it, anyway. Happy birthday, RPGs!</p> <p>In 1974, the year <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> began publication, a couple of guys at Southern Illinois University called Gary Whisenhunt and Ray Wood became interested in programming in the TUTOR language for the educational computer system PLATO (Programmed Logic for Automatic Teaching Operations). PLATO was kind of extraordinary: a network of around a dozen mainframe computers running processes for several thousand terminals around the world. And like all educational devices, the University of Illinois’ PLATO was frequently misused by students, in this case to create a role-playing game on that proto-internet. That game was to be <em>The Game of Dungeons</em>, more commonly known—because of its filename—as <em>dnd.</em></p> <p>In 1975, a University of Illinois resident called Rusty Rutherford—aware of the as-yet unfinished <em>dnd</em> but not involved—spent a handful of weeks creating his own RPG for PLATO. His was called <em>The Dungeon</em>, but again due to filenames became known as <em>pedit5</em>. Due to the speed with which Rutherford worked, <em>pedit5</em> would release first, and as such take the mantle of the first-ever RPG.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, at the Claremont University Center in California, student Don Daglow (the person responsible for the first-ever baseball game in 1971, <em>Baseball</em>, and the first-ever RTS game in 1981, <em>Utopia</em>) worked on a game for the DEC mainframe computer, the PDP-10, also based on 1974’s breakout pen-and-paper hit <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. It was called—wait for it—<em>Dungeon</em>. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_(video_game)">Wikipedia</a>, it’s unknown whether the game released in 1975 or 1976, but given Daglow’s propensity for being first to genres, the former seems more likely. (He also made the first MMO in 1991, <em>Neverwinter Nights</em>.)</p>

 <p>Oh, and on November 4, 1975, another PLATO-based RPG—this time multiplayer—was released by John D. Daleske and Gary Fritz among others, with the groundbreaking title of…<em>Dungeon</em>.</p> <p>So whether&nbsp;<em>The Game of Dungeons</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Dungeon</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dungeon,</em> or&nbsp;<em>Dungeon</em> was first, what we know for sure is that they appeared in 1975, 50 years ago, and one of them on this exact day. Which is plenty of reason to mark today as the day to celebrate the birth of the genre.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000641119" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641119"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641119">© John D. Daleske et al</figcaption></figure> <p>It seems to be generally accepted that Rutherford’s&nbsp;<em>pedit5</em> was the very first of them all, a game about wandering through a single floor of a dungeon while doing the two most important RPG things: killing monsters and collecting treasure. There were spells to cast, with randomly generated enemies and loot, and a battle and leveling system based on the rules of the brand new <em>D&amp;D</em>. It was all there, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110707162725/http://armchairarcade.com/neo/node/1948">albeit limited to around 50 rooms and only 20 stored characters across the whole network</a>, due to the hefty limitations of the system. That name, <em>pedit5</em>, <a href="https://insight.ieeeusa.org/articles/going-rogue-a-brief-history-of-the-computerized-dungeon-crawl/">came from the area in which the code was stored</a>, sectioned off for Rutherford’s department of the Population and Energy Group. The group had five slots, the first three used for relevant programming, while the fifth stored&nbsp;<em>The Dungeon</em> and the fourth contained its manual. As a result, the university naturally deleted this frippery to make room for “proper” programs, but Rutherford persistently re-added it.</p>

  <p><em>dnd</em>, meanwhile, was a story as old as time: a game with large ambitions that was thus delayed and scaled back before eventually being “released.” The intention had been for the game to be a graphical multi-user dungeon (MUD), but this was never achieved, and the game eventually emerged as a more complex version of&nbsp;<em>pedit5</em>. From my reading, there appears to be a fair amount of confusion over whether developers Whisenhunt and Wood created their game contemporaneously with&nbsp;<em>pedit5</em>, or whether it eventually became an embellished version of the earlier game. Either way,&nbsp;<em>dnd</em> offered a multi-layer dungeon called Whisenwood, in which players sought a mystical Grail and Orb. Once again, it merrily ripped off <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>‘ core rules, leveling and spells, although didn’t feature <em>pedit5</em>‘s randomization. But it also boasts two extremely important firsts of its very own.</p>

 <p>The first first for&nbsp;<em>dnd</em> is nonlinearity: Players were able to return to previously explored levels, approaching the game in their own preferred order, relying on the fixed position of enemies and items to let the computer network to store all that data. The second first, and perhaps the more significant, is that this was the first game to feature a boss encounter. Heck, this post could easily have been titled “Happy 50th Birthday, Boss Fights.” Each dungeon’s exit was guarded by a high-level monster, including the Golden Dragon that protected the Orb.</p>

 <p>Then, come November 4, we get the release of the PLATO network’s&nbsp;<em>Dungeon</em> which,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/101218/dungeon/">according to <em>Mobygames</em>,</a> is considered one of the first-ever MUD games. However, there’s a weirdly small amount of information out there about this one other than that, none of which supports its being multiplayer. The <a href="https://crpgadventures.blogspot.com/2014/08/dungeon-1975.html">wonderful obsessives over at&nbsp;<em>CRPG Adventures</em></a> have been similarly stumped, unable to get it running at all.&nbsp;<a href="https://crpgaddict.blogspot.com/2021/06/brief-everything-we-know-about-1970s.html"><em>CRPG Addict</em> also had no joy</a>, finding the game missing from many retrospectives, but noting that it was <a href="https://www.daleske.com/plato/plato-games.php">marked by co-creator Daleske</a> as “incomplete,” and also as a “predecessor to <em>Moria.”&nbsp;</em>That would appear to be 1975’s PLATO <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/100905/moria/"><em>Moria</em></a> by Kevet Duncombe and Jim Battin, yet another RPG from that year, but this one able to have ten players joining in together. It was played in the most basic form of first-person you can imagine, but that’s enough for it to claim the title of first 3D RPG! All in that same year!</p>  <p>Obviously none of these games were technically “released,” instead being stored on university servers and spread by word-of-mouth among students and staff. This had been the case since the early 1970s, with text-based adventures already proving popular on the same systems. Others took over development of some of the games mentioned above, elaborating on them through the late ’70s as the technology improved, but it wouldn’t be until 1980 and the arrival of <em>Rogue</em> as a commercial product that anything like an RPG could be considered as becoming mainstream as opposed to mainframe.</p> <p>But it remains undeniable that 2025 marks the 50th anniversary of the RPG as a computer game, and with&nbsp;<em>Dungeon</em> (PLATO)’s November 4 release, today as good as any date on which to recognize it.</p> <p>Happy birthday, RPGs! 50 years old and still one of the most popular types of games on the planet. From <i>dnd </i>to&nbsp;<em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, the impact of the <em>D&amp;D</em>-inspired genre on video games cannot be overstated.</p>

The six industry veterans we spoke with described a number of nightmare scenarios that dragged out and sometimes doomed the development of high-profile games (some requested anonymity to speak freely about their experiences without fear of retaliation).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Their experiences show why claims that generative AI—or any piece of technology—will speed up game development are missing the point. You can build the fastest racecar in the world but if the team owner keeps shuffling mechanics, engineers, and drivers around, there's no way it will stand out from the pack.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="There are seven key traits of poor leaders that slow down game development">There are seven key traits of poor leaders that slow down game development</h2><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/leadership-lessons-from-mark-darrah-s-days-at-bioware-game-developer-podcast-episode-57" target="_self" data-discover="true">Leadership lessons from Mark Darrah’s days at BioWare - Game Developer Podcast Ep. 57</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is a longer piece, so we're going to take an unusual step here and outline the behaviors we identified in multiple conversations with developers.

(generally witnessed among those in project and studio leadership, but some anecdotes described team leads guilty of them as well) can dramatically and unnecessarily slow down how games are made.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Failing to understand the realities of game development">Failing to understand the realities of game development</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers we spoke with described different scenarios where key decision makers did not understand the nitty-gritty details of making games. 3D rigger Sol Brennan said they've witnessed experienced leads decide to skip the "grey-boxing" step of level design and dive straight into art production, not recognizing how much of that work would need to be redone whenever a necessary change came to the level design.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a

- Game Developer Podcast Ep. 55</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile, an anonymous game designer said they worked under project leads with outdated expectations of the development process </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>and</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> leads with zero experience at all. This designer described how at multiple studios, project leads would approve content to go in production, then throw it out after review, sometimes just because they'd become bored with playing it over and over again.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They called it "circular iteration," as often the final content would be so similar to discarded earlier versions. These leads were also the most likely to be irritated when encountering bugs in a build, seeming to forget they would be hopefully removed in the final version.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They sometimes demanded extra work because they couldn't picture what their colleagues were pitching them. "Frequently, management staff don't come from dev backgrounds and won't be able to understand what they see unless it looks like a final game," explained producer Masao Kobayashi. To appease these leaders, developers produce what he called "fancy concept art and highly-polished, super early demos."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Usually all of this is fake and is thrown out as soon as it is made," he said. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/what-s-the-real-reason-games-are-taking-longer-to-make-">As we noted last time</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, ever-improving graphical fidelity standards have made this a more lengthy process—and time spent on that wasted content is time not spent on making the final game.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kobayashi also said that across the multiple games he's shipped, leaders often have poor understanding of project timelines and departmental dependencies—the kind that can leave some teams spinning their tires while others are overwhelmed by poorly-scoped tasks.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Failure to trust employees">Failure to trust employees</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">An anonymous game writer we spoke with said that across their work in triple-A games, double-A games, and indie games, it was leadership on triple-A games that seemed to actively distrust their employees. They described one big-budget project where every department needed sign-off on their work not just from department leads, but leads from departments who had little-to-no experience on the work they were reviewing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Whenever these leads couldn't come to a consensus, it led to weeks of work hanging in limbo, as these individuals were (justifiably) busy and difficult to get in the same room at the same time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"This to me was a lack of trust in the people who worked for them," they said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The industry's dismissive attitude towards quality assurance as a discipline can also lead to leaders ignoring colleagues who are the first to ring the alarm bell. Community manager and QA specialist Rose Whitcomb recalled a project where developers deprioritized bugs centered around less popular selectable characters. "The dev played into community favorites and would prioritize those while directing QA to focus on them despite the piling issues for the others," she said. Some of these bugs triggered hard crashes when underplayed characters were paired together.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Then the game launched—after those under-loved characters had been improved and were more likely to be selected for missions. The team lost precious time hotfixing an issue that could have been cleared up months before.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Treating developers as interchangeable">Treating developers as interchangeable</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Time and again, Kobayashi and the other employees we spoke with watched their employers greenlight games or shift direction solely on the basis of what was commercially successful in the last quarter. Setting aside the fact these games weren't as safe a bet as companies believed, they also were dangerous projects because studio leads didn't understand their employees may have little-to-no experience in the new genre they were chasing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For example, developers used to family-friendly platformers can't quickly pivot to making a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>League of Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-like MOBA. MOBA developers may struggle to understand third-person "hero shooters," even if there's design overlap. And developers experienced with hero shooters may struggle when working on family-friendly platformers.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Studio leads might also dig their heels in when it comes to refusing pay or promoting key employees, observed Brennan. That refusal would come back to haunt the team when said employees when searching for better-paying jobs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That interchangeability gets worse when you consider what happens when developers leave the studio—either as a result of being laid off or because they received a better offer at a competitor. This phenomenon is only growing more frequent as studios rely on external development studios like Keywords or Virtuos, said Kobayashi. "With the massive layoffs and increased reliance on external co-dev partners, these previously-solved problems became novel problems that cost more and take more time to solve," he said.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The failure of slow decision-making">The failure of slow decision-making</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another anonymous developer recalled their experience making games in the 2000s where for unexplained reasons, their department lead was incapable of making decisions. "He was confoundingly incapable of making decisions," this developer recalled. If the team presented this lead with three options—all equally executable—it would sometimes take them months to make a final call.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What was this unnamed team lead doing while his team waited in frustration? Apparently obsessing over minor details of the game's story.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This trait can be another consequence of top-heavy approvals process like the kind discussed by the anonymous game writer. Even if individual leads can make decisions on a feature, the requirement for consensus bogs down the project. Whether it's one person or a committee—the refusal to make a decision can have massive downstream effects on development.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Providing useless or unclear feedback">Providing useless or unclear feedback</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developers we spoke with said one of the most frustrating moments they encountered was when their leads criticized their work, but offered vague guidance on how to improve it. The anonymous level designer recalled their coworker summarizing the vacuous feedback they both received from their lead.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Another designer described it as 'get me a rock. No not that one, a better rock,'" this person said. "They would just do that until string lock forced us to ship whatever was the last iteration."</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vdsJ27p61uM?si=PJbgNmIKiQybR52K&amp;start=1731" height="315px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video" loading="lazy"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Readers interested in a clear case study of this phenomenon should revisit Double Fine and Two Player Productions' documentary </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/vdsJ27p61uM?list=PLIhLvue17Sd70y34zh2erWWpMyOnh4UN_">on the making of </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/vdsJ27p61uM?list=PLIhLvue17Sd70y34zh2erWWpMyOnh4UN_">Psychonauts 2</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It highlights how unclear feedback from studio &nbsp;founder Tim Schafer and then-project lead Zak McClendon frustrated employees and left some designers working on R&amp;D while the game was working towards an Alpha build.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Demanding sudden changes due to playing other games/watching shows">Demanding sudden changes due to playing other games/watching shows</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over a decade after FromSoftware and Bandai Namco released </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dark Souls</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in 2011, game designers still joke about what might be called the "Dark Souls phenomenon," where creative leads in game development head home for the weekend, play a (deservedly) popular game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dark Souls</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodborne</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Elden Ring</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and return to the office with sudden directives for new features inspired by these titles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The anonymous writer pointed out that these changes sometimes happen after the game director watches a hotly-talked-about movie or TV show as well. Sudden narrative changes can have a drastic downhill effect on all departments if they happen too late in the process.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The willingness to make these pivots can be compounded by the lack of trust for employees and a lack of understanding for the cost of implementing these changes. The developers we spoke with said that the best leaders they had listened to workers when they explained a requested feature wasn't possible or might take too much time. They didn't always cancel the feature, but they would either give direction on how to implement it, or adjust their demands based on the team's capabilities.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Vague crunch policies">Vague crunch policies</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Crunch is a consequence of poor planning," goes the industry refrain. Poor planning can strike in all manner of ways, not just as a consequence of bad leadership. But when crunch hits, how leaders manage the need for overtime can bring a team together or grind them into the ground.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some crunch failures might come down to poor team culture, while others can be about company policy. On the team culture level, the developers we spoke with described how "no-crunch" policies began driving conflict between developers when some workers would be vigilant about their work hours while others pushed into overtime. Not only did they see some colleagues express resentment for their decision to leave on time, they felt pressure from leadership to crunch anyway despite stated policy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Companies that employ hourly workers can create a codified version of this by capping out the number of workable hours. If team leads set unrealistic goals, but employees can only put so many hours on the clock, it's inevitable they'll start doing unpaid work in their time off. Then the game they worked on might go to make millions of dollars while they don't see a penny for the extra time spent.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="When is bad leadership a structural problem? When is it an individual one?">When is bad leadership a structural problem? When is it an individual one?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A quote from writer </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/01/magazine/robert-caro-working-memoir.html">Robert Caro</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> rang through my head as I listened to these different stories: "Power reveals." It's a more complex phrase than "power corrupts," which implies anyone in leadership will inevitably become harmful and self-serving. "Power reveals" asks us to define not only a leader's actions, but the nature of the authority they possess.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There is no one way to speed up game development. And there is no one way to improve leadership across the video game industry. Sometimes educating how much power a small group of individuals can have over the project will clear mid-development blockers. In other occasions, leaders who plan early and stick to decisions made early in the process, changing course only when needed, can turn studios into game-making powerhouses. Change what "power" means in game development, and you can change what it "reveals" about those who hold it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But there are those in leadership who, when given power, will always reveal themselves to be unworthy of it. They might verbally abuse colleagues, lock key team members out of meetings, or pit workers against each other. At the very worst, they might join the ranks of those accused of harassing or discriminating against developers, only keeping their position until some exposé shines a light on their deeds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is the contradiction at the heart of the game industry's leadership struggles. Structural reform is necessary. But poor leaders sometimes sneak through any attempts at positive change, keeping power thanks to close relationships with people up the food chain.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">AI can't fix any of this. If you want to speed up game development, you need to do the one thing bad leaders refuse to: listen to the people who actually make games.</span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/how-poor-leadership-slows-down-game-development]]></content:encoded>
