            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/30/planet-coaster-2-update-1-5-1-adds-sci-fi-theme-and-security-guards/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The latest patch for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/planet-coaster-2">Planet Coaster 2</a> is here, bringing a major new theme for your parks, and a significant new management feature. Security guards can be added to your park to tackle a wave of crime that can emerge in your guests, while a new Sci-Fi theme will add more diversity through Planet Coast 2 update 1.5.1.</p>
<p><iframe title="Planet Coaster 2 | Update 5 Highlights" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Z1U3T1dejs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Security Guards and cameras will be needed to tackle a new guest behaviour of criminality, with pickpockets and vandals on the loose. Meanwhile, the Sci-Fi themed static and animated scenery can tie in with Sci-Fi theme music, SFX and ambient audio.</p>
<p>Beyond this, new glass panel scenery has been added with colour customisation, there’s better rock and inflatable customisation, and improved pathing tools. Frontier has “de-themed” two more coasters, so they can be used more generally, and brought back a Trident coaster from the first game, the Vector – Return Mk II.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of other fixes, changes and tweaks throughout, so here’s the full Planet Coaster 2 update 1.5.1 patch notes:</p>

			<p>An Elden Ring Nightreign duos mod is currently in the works, and its release could address one of the game's most critical issues at launch.</p>
<p>The mod, which is sadly not yet available to the public, is being developed by <a href="https://ko-fi.com/lukeyui" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yui</a>, who showcased it in a new video shared on YouTube. As the mod runs without connecting to the matchmaking service, Easy Anti Cheat is deactivated and thus other mods can be used during gameplay.</p>
<p><iframe title="Elden Ring Nightreign: 2 player demonstration (w/ no EAC &amp; mod compatible)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VbKF9TOiMWI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While the Elden Ring Nightreign development team already <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-may-get-proper-duo-support-post-launch/">confirmed</a> that duos could be added to the game in the future, it's nice to know that, at least on PC, a two-player mode could be a thing, regardless of what the developer decides to do. One of the other critical issues of the latest game developed by FromSoftware, the lack of cross-platform play, however, cannot be easily fixed with mods, so hopefully, the development team will look at implementing it down the line in some form.</p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. You can learn more about this unique take on the Souls series formula by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">review</a>.</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring: Nightreign is one of the most unique titles ever developed by FromSoftware, and arguably one of their best to date. Adapting the traditionally slow-paced Souls formula into a fast-paced, co-op-focused experience with roguelike elements was no easy feat, but the Japanese studio has fully delivered, once again proving why they remain masters of their craft.</em></p>

                <p>Last year, a story broke that Microsoft was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-working-on-xbox-handheld-prototypes-report/1100-6522128/" data-ref-id="1100-6522128">working on prototypes for an Xbox handheld console</a> that could potentially compete with Valve's Steam Deck. However, a new report suggests that Microsoft is putting aside its ambitions for a dedicated Xbox handheld, at least for now.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-xboxs-handheld-pembrooke-has-been-sidelined-for-now-as-microsoft-doubles-down-on-windows-11-pc-gaming-handheld-optimization" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a>, Microsoft is shifting its priority away from its Xbox handheld to focus on improving the gaming performance of Windows 11 on third-party handheld devices including ASUS' Project Kennan. The report notes that Microsoft still has ambitions of releasing its own handheld and it's developing additional technology towards that goal. But for the immediate future, that's not a priority.</p><p>There have been rumors about Xbox handheld consoles for the better part of the last two decades. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/an-xbox-handheld-was-designed-in-the-past-says-phi/1100-6449311/" data-ref-id="1100-6449311">there were Xbox handheld prototypes in the past</a>, none of which made it out of development.</p><p>Spencer acknowledged <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-handheld-device-is-a-few-years-out-apparently/1100-6527758/" data-ref-id="1100-6527758">the possibility of a new Xbox handheld</a> last year without directly confirming it. He also suggested that any Xbox handheld was still "a few years out." More recently, Spencer demonstrated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-handheld-is-an-intriguing-idea-to-phil-spencer/1100-6522161/" data-ref-id="1100-6522161">how he plays his Xbox games on the Lenovo Legion Go</a>. He also shared his belief that the "team could do some real innovative work" on an Xbox handheld.</p><p>There have been prior reports that the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-console-generation-could-include-a-handheld-report/1100-6526635/" data-ref-id="1100-6526635">next-generation Xbox console may support a handheld device</a>, perhaps in a similar way to the Nintendo's Switch. Windows Central's latest reports suggests that development on the next Xbox console was not impacted by the decision to pause the potential handheld, which may call the earlier report into question.</p><p>Earlier this year, Xbox president Sarah Bond suggested that Microsoft's next home console will offer the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6525379/" data-ref-id="1100-6525379">"largest technical leap" in Xbox history</a>. But for now, Microsoft has yet to disclose any details about that system or when it may be released.</p>

            <p>
Microsoft has reportedly "sidelined" the development of its long-teased first-party handheld gaming device as it focuses its attention on third-party portable opportunities, including ASUS' Project Kennan, which is supposedly still due this year.
</p>
<p>
Xbox boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> first discussed an Xbox handheld back in 2017, when he revealed Microsoft had "roughly designed" one in the past, and it's a subject he's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-discusses-potential-xbox-handheld-plans">repeatedly returned to in recent years</a>, fuelling speculation the project had been revived. Then, this March, Windows Central reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-next-gen-console-reportedly-targeting-2027-with-handheld-device-due-this-year">Microsoft had settled on a multi-pronged handheld strategy</a>, and would be teaming up with a third-party to release an Xbox-branded portable gaming PC this year under the codename Kennan while it worked on its own internally developed device to release alongside an Xbox Series X/S successor in 2027.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, Windows Central <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-xboxs-handheld-pembrooke-has-been-sidelined-for-now-as-microsoft-doubles-down-on-windows-11-pc-gaming-handheld-optimization">claims</a> Microsoft has had a bit of a strategic rethink, and development of its own handheld device has been "sidelined". According to the publication's source, the company has internally announced it'll instead "prioritise its teams to improve Windows 11 gaming performance, specifically for devices like the ASUS partner device Project Kennan" (NB. the site originally reported this under the name "Keenan" back in March, but has since updated its original story). It doesn't sound like Microsoft is completely abandoning its own handheld plans, however; Windows Central says the company "still has big ambitions and is investing heavily to deliver a native Xbox handheld", but third-party devices and Windows 11 improvements will be where it focuses its resources for now.
</p>
<p>
As for Project Kennan specifically, the website claims it's "essentially finished" on the hardware side, but that there's currently a "significantly boosted effort" between Microsoft's Xbox and Windows teams to "improve the experience on the software side". The plan, however, is that the Xbox-branded ASUS device will still launch "later this year".
</p>
<p>
Microsoft's decision to refocus on providing adequate infrastructure for Windows 11-powered third-party devices is perhaps not entirely surprising given increasing competition elsewhere; back in January, Valve announced it's been working to bring SteamOS, which powers Steam Deck, to third-party handheld gaming, and the operating system is now available on a variety of devices, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lenovo-unveils-legion-go-2-and-go-s-handheld-gaming-pcs-including-steamos-model">recently released official partner machine, the Lenovo Legion Go S</a>.
</p>
<p>
Beyond its handheld plans, Microsoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-says-next-xbox-will-deliver-largest-technical-leap-seen-in-a-hardware-generation">continues to developed its Xbox Series X/S successor</a>, which Xbox president Sarah Bond previously claimed would deliver "the largest technical leap that you will have ever seen in a hardware generation." According to Windows Central, there are currently "three prototype devices in development for Microsoft's Gen-10 effort", and the company is also said to be working on "next-gen Xbox cloud systems" to bring latency more in line with NVIDIA's GeForce Now service.
</p>
<p>
As for games, we'll know more about Xbox's future slate once <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-announces-june-showcase-event-reveals-game-getting-this-years-big-spotlight">this year's Xbox Games Showcase</a> airs on Sunday, 8th June at 6pm UK time. Eurogamer will, of course, have news from that and more as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">Summer Game Fest season</a> gets underway next week.

		<p>Taleworlds has announced that the upcoming War Sails expansion for Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord has been delayed, with the June 17th release date now becoming a more general Fall 2025 release window. The main reason for this delay is that the team needs more development time to refine and polish the content. This in turn means that a new timeline for content is being worked on.</p>

<p>In a statement Taleworlds said,<em> “Greeting Warriors of Calradia, We’re excited for each of you to set sail in War Sails, the upcoming expansion for Mount &amp; Blade II: Bannerlord. However, after taking a hard look at where things stand, it became clear we won’t be ready by the originally planned release date of June 17th. The title is currently on track for an early Fall 2025 release window.</em></p>
<p><em>We came to this decision after a lot of thought (and a few long meetings), because we need more time to reach the level of quality you rightfully expect. The extra development period will give us more time to apply additional polish, and continue making progress on the improvements to the base game that are already in motion – We believe this short delay will ultimately lead to a better and more enjoyable experience for all players. The team is currently working on a revised timeline, and we’re aiming to share the new release date with you in the upcoming weeks.”</em></p>

<p>In our review for Mount &amp; Blade 2: Bannerlord Jim said, <em>“My return to Calradia wasn’t entirely jubilant, though Mount &amp; Blade 2 Bannerlord is a game I’ll likely stick with, simply due to my love of the original. A wealth of new systems and activities help this sandbox strategy sim feel more alive than ever, though the busywork required to get anywhere can feel like a grind. Overall, existing fans will rejoice while newcomers may look on unimpressed, unsure what all the fuss is about.”</em></p>

			<p>HLX, the project in development by Valve rumored to be Half-Life 3, may be close to the end of development, judging from some recent findings.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TylerMcVicker1">Tyler McViker</a> in a recent video, big updates have been pushed for Deadlock and Dota 2, and they are more packed than has been seen in years of changes made to the Source 2 engine related to the HLX project, some of them heavily suggesting that the project is near to the end of development. For example, one of the new changes is a save and load system rewritten from scratch, which allows for the state of any entity within the game world to be edited in the save file. No other game powered by the Source 2 engine has a save and load system, as even Half-Life Alyx used the system lifted from the previous version of the engine. While this addition may not sound particularly significant, it actually is, as rewriting from scratch such a basic system is usually part of the polishing phase at the end of development.</p>
<p>Other additions, such as the introduction of three new player flags that determine if the player is in a situation where it is not possible to save, is driving a vehicle or is inside a vehicle driven by an NPC, are also, usually, additions made to the end of development, so it definitely seems like work on the project rumored to be Half-Life 3 is close to completion. The fact that work on HLX may be close to completion, however, doesn't mean that the game is going to be announced soon, so expectations should be kept in check for the incoming not-E3 season that will begin next week.</p>
<p>Besides the addition outlined above, the latest updates pushed for some Source 2-powered games added a few more files related to the yet-to-be-revealed HLX project, including support for meshlets, surface properties having attributes specifically related to vehicle-based gameplay, vehicle transportation for both player and NPCs, electrical interactions simulated system similar to the systems allowing for flammability of elements and material deformation, electrification of surfaces and props, improved sight and hearing system to allow the enemy to better detect the player, a wind system that can interact with volumetric fog and flammability-based items related to a fan system that should allow wind to move players, NPCs and objects and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="17 New HLX Leaks, it's Almost Here - HLX Files #11" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FUj4iMRKGqM?start=3&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Seeing how much work is being put into the HLX project rumored to be Half-Life 3, there's no doubt that something is indeed cooking up at Valve. The game is rumored to be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-last-entry-series/">final entry in the series</a>, so even though its story hook may not be <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-main-story-hook/">widely appreciated</a>, at least fans will be getting a conclusion to the story, and not another cliffhanger that could be left unresolved for decades.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/elden-ring-nightreign-how-to-change-skins/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> does not feature the same degree of character customization as other games developed by FromSoftware or other multiplayer-focused games, but this doesn't mean that it's not possible to change your Nightfarer's appearance. During your war against the Night in Limveld, you can unlock different skins for all characters, allowing you to alter their appearance and make each Nightfarer feel more like your own.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250530111235_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>Changing skins, or Garbs, in Elden Ring Nightreign is really easy</strong>, and does not require performing any complicated operation or getting to a hard-to-reach location. To change the appearance of any Nightfarer, <strong>open the Roundtable Hold main menu, and select Change Garb</strong> to get transported instantly to the mirror inside the main hub that allows changing skins.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250530111240_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>At the beginning of your adventure in Elden Ring Nightreign, the only available skin will be the one representing the Nightfarers' vanilla appearance, but more can be unlocked by playing the game and completing Remembrance episodes, the personal quests of each Nightfarer which provides additional details on their story, and how they ended up in Roundtable Hold to fight the war against the Nightlords. You will also need Murk, the only in-game currency, to unlock them, but the currency is pretty easy to come by, as you are rewarded with a minimal amount even for Expeditions, so if you play the game enough, you won't have any trouble unlocking additional skins with little difficulty.</p>

            <p>
Dispatch is a swanky visual novel with light <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> elements in which you manage a bunch of reformed supervillains, assigning them to pop-up emergencies around town. So far, I have asked a dancing French assassin to rescue a balloon from a tree, sent a randomly transforming literal batman to thwart a boat robbery, ordered a golem and an invisible woman to break up a barfight between rival vigilantes, and tasked a light-manipulating popstar with cutting a supermarket ribbon.
</p>
<p>
We managed to retrieve the balloon and open the supermarket with flying colours, but the boat is now at the bottom of the harbour. The golem and the invisible woman tried to resolve the barfight firstly by proposing that the participants form a Dynamic Duo, and then by way of a drinking competition. Now, the bar is in ruins. Also, the team's Human Torch equivalent can't go on break without starting a fire.

<p>
It's a laugh, mostly because all these supervillains have pretty good voice actors, and they are given ample words to wallow around in. Each shift teems with podcasty backchat between the patrolling heroes, all of which seems to fit organically around your decisions and interjections as dispatcher. Your character, the newly mech-less and deskbound Mecha Man, is voiced by Aaron Paul off Breaking Bad. There's also Westworld and Boardwalk Empire's Jeffery Wright, who plays a speedster who has artificially aged himself while using his powers. Other performers include Laura Bailey off The Last Of Us Part 2, Critical Role's Matthew Mercer and Youtuber Jacksepticeye. 
</p>
<p>
Between shifts, there are suavely animated and directed story scenes in which you hang out with these invariably outsized personalities, making the occasional three-way dialogue choice. The game's creators, AdHoc Studio, include a few of the Telltale alumni behind Tales From The Borderlands and The Wolf <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/among-us">Among Us</a>. I definitely get a Wolf Among Us vibe from this: each character's baggage is writ large through their powers, and there are more obvious callbacks such as an "X will remember that" notification.
</p>
<p>
There've been a fair few "team of misfits" superhero stories now across TV, film and games. It's easy to do this kind of thing badly, if the cast are too WACKY and the banter is too overclocked. It also risks being crass when you overlap the comedy freakshow element with portrayals of, say, neurodivergence or disability, of which there are a few in Dispatch. 
</p>
<p>
Its too early to make a call there, but the 20 minutes I've played of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/">Dispatch's Steam demo</a> inspires some confidence, though there are some racialised jokes that make me worry about punchlines down the road. The writing is both more fluid and less showy than it may seem in the above trailer, and a lot ruder. You will definitely feel a certain warmth for the game if you pine for Telltale and are sceptical of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/telltale-games-rise-again-kinda">the studio's "rebirth" under LCG Entertainment</a>. Why not give the demo a go?

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, released today, is off to an immediately strong start on Steam.</p>
<p>The online co-op spin-off has already reached a peak concurrent player count of 313,593 players within its first few hours of availability.</p>
<p>It's also sitting comfortably in the top five most played games of the last 24 hours.</p>

<p>Of course, Steam's most played games list tends to be dominated by multiplayer games - by their nature, they attract more players.</p>
<p>By contrast, the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> has a peak concurrent player count of 953,426, sitting at ninth in the all-time most played games.</p>
<p>Still, there's clearly interest in FromSoftware's multiplayer experiment, although user reviews so far are "Mixed". Many are complaining about the inability to play with two players, as well as the poor communication options without voice chat.</p>
<p>"No duo option, had random people join to just run off and do their own thing. Let me duo with my mate..." reads one particular review.</p>
<p>Indeed, the game is at its best when played with three friends. It's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/should-you-play-elden-ring-nightreign-solo">possible to play solo, but isn't recommended</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-could-receive-two-player-mode-post-launch">FromSoftware has stated it's considering a two-player option in future</a>, admitting it was "overlooked" during development.</p>
<p>The game is also available across PS4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-gets-balance-adjustments-in-day-one-patch">day one patch is available to download</a>, which brings balance adjustments and bug fixes. However, <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-101?">FromSoftware has warned</a> some PC configurations using the latest graphics cards may experience frame rate drops.</p>

			<p>Gaming is all about immersion. Visuals are the entry point to our digital worlds, gameplay the mechanical interaction, while audio can wrap, envelop and enhance the entire experience, but how can we take all of that further? Woojer know a thing or two about immersion, releasing a series of haptic-enhanced belts and vests over the last five years, designed to take your gaming immersion to a new level. Now, they’re releasing the Vest 3, the culmination of everything that’s gone before. If you’re looking for a new level of immersion, especially in VR, it’s the ultimate accessory.</p>
<p><iframe title="Meet Woojer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YmP8ijaclmg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Woojer Vest 3 feels like a premium experience from the moment you open the box. The sleek, glossy packaging opens up to reveal the backplate of the vest, black leather, fabric and stitching pulled together by a white, rubberised Woojer logo.</p>


<p>Pulling it free of the packaging, one of the first things you’ll wonder is how much weight there is to it, and that’s despite slimming down from the previous version. The 1.5kg of weight is all thanks to the bevy of tech attached to the Vest 3, with all the fabric and leather punctuated by a chunky battery pack, control unit, and six haptic units. Frankly, it looks like something straight out of Cyberpunk, and it’s possibly the most exciting piece of gaming hardware I’ve seen in a long time.</p>
<p>You won’t notice that weight when you’re wearing it. The Vest 3 does a great job of dispersing the weight evenly across your back and shoulders, and when you’re focused on your game, it practically disappears. Save for all the thumping.</p>

<p>You’re strapped in via a thin clasp across the chest, and a chunky belt strap at the waist, and there’s plenty of variability for different body sizes. I’m relatively small and slim, and I have both the belt and chest straps nearly fully tightened, and there’s a lot of slack if you need it. Smaller players, like the kids in our house, were able to wear it too, though the effect wasn’t quite the same as the haptics couldn’t all sit directly against their body. Overall, I’d expect the majority of teens and adults to be able to wear it comfortably, living up to what Woojer describe as, “One size fits most”.</p>

<p>The front view gives you a clearer look at the haptic units, with two positioned at your chest, and another two attached to the waist straps. Each is a black plastic disc, etched with the Woojer logo, and when you touch them they actually feel lighter than you’d expect.</p>
<p>The main control unit sits on the left hand side if the vest, giving you easy access to all the controls you’ll need. It lights up brightly, depending on what you’re doing, and if you’re choosing to watch something via a flat panel display, it’s worth knowing that the lights may well reflect on your screen.</p>
<p>The control panel houses a large power button, physical volume controls and buttons for setting the overall haptic level, while there’s also LED displays for the connection types and the different levels. Meanwhile, the underside of the panel has 3.5mm sockets for incoming and outgoing audio, and a USB-C port at the centre.</p>
<p>The first thing you’ll want to do is charge the Vest 3, and there’s some mild confusion to be found here, with the vest having two USB-C ports. The one on the front control unit is not for charging, so you’ll need to flip it over and use the one on the back. In fairness, there’s a very clear sign on the rear, and in the instructions, but I still managed to get it wrong. I imagine that plenty more will along the way.</p>

<p>That comes down to the multitude of inputs the Vest 3 is capable of, with wired USB-C audio sitting alongside analog 3.5mm and wireless Bluetooth connections. When connecting via Bluetooth you can use the Vest 3’s mutipoint connection to receive audio, before sending it to separate Bluetooth headphones, at the same time, while adding in its haptic response.</p>
<p>And what a response it is. We reviewed the original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/08/woojer-vest-edge-review-can-strapping-haptics-to-your-body-make-vr-more-immersive/">Woojer Vest Edge</a>, and it felt absolutely great. The Vest 3 takes things up a step, and its Osci V2 TRX transducers – which claim to be the most powerful and precise iterations of this tech – thump away in unison in an utterly beguiling way. If you want to literally feel your music, movies and games, Woojer have a compelling solution.</p>
<p>I tested the Vest 3 across a range of different platforms and use cases, and I started with the PlayStation 5, wired audio connections, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/31/the-last-of-us-part-i-review-ps5/">The Last of Us Part I</a>. This is an interesting game to play with the Vest 3. The heavy-hitting action is punctuated by plenty of moments of silence, but then it ramps up, with percussive gunshots sitting alongside the game’s evocative acoustic music. It certainly adds an additional layer to the game, and the moments of light and dark make a perfect match for the Vest 3. There’s a sense though, that you’re not getting everything out of it.</p>
<p>What you need is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/09/doom-the-dark-ages-review/">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>. If the Woojer Vest 3 needs a proof of concept for flatscreen play, then Doom is it. From the moment the id Software logo rumbles into view, and the Vest 3 responds with a resonating rumble, you know you’re in for something special. Combine the unbelievably weighty gunplay with the heavy metal soundtrack and ominous cracks of thunder and lightning, and the Vest 3 translates all of that into a full body experience. Doom: The Dark Ages doesn’t even feel remotely the same now playing it without the Vest 3, and if you’re a fan of this type of FPS, I’m telling you to start saving for a Woojer device right now. You’ll thank me later.</p>

<p>Of course, VR remains the ultimate expression of the Vest 3’s potential. Here, all of those brushes, rumbles and thumps become real and physical actions that aren’t quite translated in the same way when you’re playing on a flatscreen. Batman: Arkham Shadow is an ideal candidate for this, with its bruising, high-intensity combat made all the more enthralling by being able to physically feel the impacts you’re dishing out and receiving.</p>
<p>The best VR game? Given that it would sit at the top of most VR lists, it’s little surprise to find that Beat Saber gets even better when the music is coursing through your body as well as your ears. While you flail around with neon lightsabers, the music is translated into all-encompassing thumps and rumbles, making it all feel like some futuristic clubbing experience where the music is booming through your body. If you’re looking for the next step in a Beat Saber addiction, here it is.</p>
<p>As a side note, while the Vest 3 has some seriously powerful haptics, I don’t think they’d ever be capable of causing actual bruising, unless you’re medically predisposed to them. If you are, then I’d perhaps check in with a medical professional before playing.</p>
<p>There is plenty of customisation to the effects that the Woojer Vest 3 is capable of, which is pretty important to tune to your liking. The vest produces its haptic feedback based via the audio input, as opposed to triggering in tandem with a gamepad rumble – this would require game and platform-level support. To that end, the manual recommends turning up your source device to 100% and then altering the volume and haptic response on the Vest itself, but I had more success with turning the input down ever so slightly – to more like 80% – as that seemed to help the Vest 3 focus on the larger or more serious impacts or beats, rather than translating everything you hear into a rumble. It does remarkably steer clear of speech, and your setup will, of course, change from game to game, but I do recommend tweaking and tuning each time to find the right level of feedback.</p>

<p>At £450, the Woojer Vest 3 is a significant investment, though they are currently offering a serious reduction to £360 via their official website to make the price slightly more palatable. It’s clearly a luxury product, but if you’re a household that already has its gaming systems in place – particularly when it comes to VR – and you’re looking for the next level of immersion, the Woojer Vest 3 makes a very compelling argument for its pricetag.</p>

			<p>Hypercharge: Unboxed feels deeply nostalgic, like upending a toy box from your childhood and letting your imagination run wild amidst a sea of action figures, vehicles, building blocks, and other vibrantly-coloured plastic. Clearly inspired by late 90s animated movies such as Toy Story and, perhaps more notably, Small Soldiers, the game can be split into two parts: a wave-based tower defence mode playable either in solo or co-op, and a traditional spread of competitive PvP match types.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hypercharge: Unboxed - Release Date Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IbJRzi2CX0o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The former is the more fun and fleshed out of the two, featuring a list of campaign missions that task up to three other players (or bots) with fending off incoming hordes of enemies. They’ll make a beeline for your Hypercores, critical structures that can be reinforced by spending resources on walls and traps to impede enemies as you line them up in your crosshairs.</p>


<p>There’s an increasing variety of enemy types to help spice things up, from lumbering robots and speedy spinning tops, to evasive toy planes and towering bosses. Each of the maps are fairly small and self-contained with replayability coming mainly from running these stages on tougher difficulty settings while also crossing off a series of optional objectives to earn medals and unlock new customisation options and buildable fortifications.</p>


<p>Naturally, co-op with friends is the best way to enjoy this mode, putting your team tactics to the test against the toughest difficulty tier. While there’s an option to play alongside bots, they’re not the brightest bunch. Coordinating with other humans helps offset the creeping repetitiveness though this could also have been helped with more dynamic combat mechanics.</p>
<p>The gunplay in Hypercharge opts for arcade-like simplicity as you pick up weapons, ammo, and health packs, hopping through portals and launching yourself into the air using jump pads. It’s fun for a while though the Hypercharge arsenal lacks a certain depth or pizazz: there are no secondary fire modes, grenades, power-ups, or hero-style abilities that have become the norm in first person shooters. When facing down an opponent one-to-one in competitive play, wielding the bigger gun matters more than having a strategic play in your back pocket.</p>

<p>Speaking of competitive play, Hypercharge: Unboxed features five classic modes including Deathmatch, TDM, King of the Hill, Capture the Flag, and Infection, the latter being the most fun due to its unpredictable frenziedness. Each mode allows for 8 players which is an optimal number considering how tightly packed some of these maps are. However, much like solo play and co-op, the basic gunplay (and lack of engaging player progression hooks) quickly eats into the novelty factor.</p>
<p>One of the game’s highlights is seeing everyday settings transformed into makeshift battlegrounds, from cluttered bedrooms to playgrounds, creating vantage points and defences from otherwise inconspicuous objects. Developer Digital Cybercherries have also taken a page from the Aldi supermarket playbook with many toys and props accurately emulating well-known brands, augmenting them ever-so-slightly to avoid a copyright lawsuit. The game’s visuals are its strongest asset, with oversized environments and deep action figure customisation.</p>

			<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is a very different game from every other game developed by FromSoftware, sporting the mechanics made popular by their Souls series. Instead of making co-op multiplayer an optional element that can make certain segments of the game easier, the experience has been designed around co-op, resulting in a game that is clearly best played together with two other players.</p>
<p>Despite this, <strong>the challenges that the land of Limveld offers can be experienced by lone Nightfarers not keen on teaming up with others.</strong> Doing so it's extremely simple. All you need to do is <strong>interacting with the big table found in the central area of the Roundtable Hold</strong> main hub, press the <strong>R1 / right shoulder button</strong> on your controller to access the <strong>Matchmaking Settings tab</strong>, scroll down to the Expedition Type option and press either left or right to change between Multiplayer and <strong>Single Player</strong>. Once the option has been set to Single Player, any expedition you choose to embark upon will be played solo.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250526143623_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While it is definitely possible to play Elden Ring Nightreign by yourself,<strong> should you do so</strong>? In terms of incentives, the game provides none, as the experience has been clearly balanced around co-op, so by playing solo, you will still have to handle a massive number of enemies, even during select boss battles, with only lower hit point values than in co-op mode. As such, playing Elden Ring Nightreign solo can often end up being a frustrating experience, and should be considered as an option only if you want to practice against bosses, find optimal strategies and prepare for multiplayer sessions. Completing certain Remembrances episodes can be faster in solo mode as well. So, if you want to truly experience the game at its best, you will have to team up with others.</p>

            <p>A sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> trope I quite enjoy is arboretums that provide oxygen to ships or structures, both because it's a nifty (<a href="https://www.rbg.ca/botanicult-fiction-plants-in-space-fact-or-fiction/">if spurious?</a>) idea, and because I like the concept of people who've only seen iron bulkheads for months staring wistfully at small trees. I think Alex Garland's <em>criminally underrated</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_(2007_film)">Sunshine</a> did it. Kenny Lentil's Biological Shock did it. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a> too. The derelict ark you'll be scavenging and surviving in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dandelion-void">Dandelion Void</a> also has plants, but the caveat is that the plants can move.

<p>This one's a single-player bad place explorer 'em up where you play as a stranded astronaut, squirreling away supplies and making shelters for periodic life support shorts, crafting weapons, and traversing dangerous junglefied environs, while also trying to keep your morale up. Among the game's features is a novel 'asphyxiation or treats' system, where you'll pry open sealed doors, not knowing if there's valuable supplies or just a horrible bit of space on the other side. More features! More!</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Cut through jungle corridors in search of crafting supplies, exotic weapons, and rare decorations.</li>
<li>Pry open long sealed bulkhead doors — just pray the void of interstellar space isn’t waiting for you on the other side.</li>
<li>Patch up rotted spacesuits, lead lined radiation gear, and other protective garments to traverse dangerous new areas.</li>
<li>Stockpile for the next cold snap; life support is on the fritz after centuries of neglect, and you can never be sure when it might fail… for days or even months at a time.</li>
<li>The jungle is alive, and extremely hostile. Will you chance a run through the serrated tendrils of crawling plant life, or barricade up and hide somewhere safe?</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>Dev team Manzanita Interactive have roots in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/project-zomboid">Project Zomboid</a> modding community, and they say they've carried this spirit of customisation forward. As such, the game will ship with a custom map editor and its Lua API. "A game made by modders, for modders, from modders". I might have added that last bit. Release date is still TBA.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign-%E2%80%93-what-do-you-get-for-defeating-the-tutorial-boss.1202313/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/elden-ring-nightreign-what-do-you-get-for-defeating-the-fell-omen-in-the-tutorial/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In true FromSoftware fashion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> features a challenging boss battle against a familiar face from the original game in the tutorial that is meant to be lost, which delivers a straightforward message: the game is challenging. While this first fight against the Fell Omen can be difficult, it can be won using a relatively simple strategy, and you will also get a nice reward for your effort.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250529133512_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As the tutorial features a set number of enemies and specific equipment, putting together a <strong>winning strategy is much easier than in the actual <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> experience</strong>. Make sure to defeat every enemy you encounter as you proceed and open every treasure chest. By doing so, you can get to level 6 and have the Cold Katar and Rogier's Rapier Armaments in your possession. Equip both of them to use the powerful <strong>Hoarfrost Stump</strong> skill and activate the <strong>Multiple Periodical Glintblades</strong> passive.</p>
<p>With these Armaments equipped, head over to the ruins where the Fell Omen awaits, <strong>bring the Duchess back to life</strong> as prompted, and wait for the enemy to appear. When it does, keep your distance, let the Duchess hold his attention, and <strong>use Hoarfrost Stump or attack repeatedly with the Cold Katar after he uses any hammer attack to inflict frostbite</strong>. Once you have accomplished this, keep your distance and attack only after the boss uses hammer attacks, letting the Continual Glintblades deal some nice burst damage without doing anything else. If the Duchess dies, use the <strong>Wylder's Ultimate Art</strong> to bring her back instantly. Try as much as you can to defeat the boss without dying, as you won't have the Duchess' help during your second and final try, making everything much more challenging.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250529133752_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>After defeating the Fell Omen, sit in the chair to end the tutorial and begin the proper Elden Ring Nightreign experience. As you awaken in the Roundtable Hold, you will be informed of having been gifted the Fell Omen Fetish relic, which boosts your attack power when you switch weapons, improves throwing knife damage, and increases Vigor by 1. If you have not defeated the Fell Omen on your first try, you can<strong>&nbsp;replay through the tutorial</strong> by accessing the Visual Codex, selecting Guide, and pressing the Square/ X button.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/elden-ring-nightreign-5-tips-to-conquer-the-night/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Though rooted deeply into the hardcore action-RPG mechanics made popular by the Souls series, Elden Ring Nightreign is a very different sort of experience from what FromSoftware usually offers in its games. With a focus on co-op play and a time limit, playing the new game from the Japanese studio can feel overwhelming for those more used to the slower pace of typical soulslike.</p>
<p>To help you better understand the unique take on the Soulslike mechanics featured in Elden Ring Nightreign, and to start having fun just a few Expeditions in, here are a few tips that will be helpful as you run from one side of the other of Limveld, trying to stay one step ahead of the Night.</p>
<h2>1 - Plan For the Whole Game</h2>
<p>With the first two in-game days lasting only 15 minutes, you must upgrade your character as quickly as possible in Elden Ring Nightreign. As such, you will want to start planning what to do right from the start of a game. While the spectral hawk is carrying you to Limveld, open up the map and locate the most critical upgrades to have an easier time later in the game, and plan around their locations. Flask charges, situated inside the churches with a gold outline, are a must for survivability, so grab them as quickly as possible, possibly clearing a few other locations along the way to level up and get your first few upgrades. If you can, prioritize locations on the edges of the map, as there's a good chance they will no longer be available for the day once the Night approaches.</p>
<h2>2 - Level Up As Much as You Can</h2>
<p>While it can be tempting to explore an enemy camp or an enemy stronghold near your landing point at the start of the game, it's not a very good idea to head into them at a low level. Look around your starting location, find some mobs, and take them down to get some runes and level up to at least level 3 to have a much easier time. In Elden Ring Nightreign, character level matters a lot, as it not only increases stats but also allows your Nightfarer to wield weapons of higher rarity, so you will want to make some quick preparations before heading into any location guarded by bosses. Dying will also make you waste time, which you don't have a lot of in the game.</p>
<h2>3 - Ignore Mobs</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250520003440_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Killing mobs at the start of a game in Elden Ring Nightreign is the way to go to level up enough to handle bosses, but after reaching level 3, it's almost always a good idea to ignore all those mobs that aren't getting in the way. After a certain point, the runes you get from defeating them are not worth the time you need to dispose of them, which could be used to take down bosses, which give plenty of runes and offer you one between three different upgrades, which may be more crucial to defeating a Nightlord than runes to level up. This holds even more true when going through the Castle in the center of Limveld. This location is filled with enemies that reward Nightfarers with upgrades, so ignore the mobs to get to them as quickly as possible to reap some beneficial rewards.</p>
<h2>4 - Get a Ranged Combat Option</h2>
<p>By pressing the Triangle or Y button with the map open, you will be able to get more information on the upgrades that can be obtained in each location in Limveld, and you will be surprised by how many bows and ranged weapons can be found. There's a good reason for this: ranged combat options work great in Elden Ring Nightreign, as you have infinite ammo and can spam attack from a safe distance. Having to resort to healing as little as possible, taking out enemies from afar is extremely important, so make sure to get a ranged attack option for your character, no matter how good they may be at using it. The same goes for all magic spells, as they can make your life significantly easier under certain conditions. Most Nightlords don't leave themselves open too often, so having a ranged attack option is a great help against these powerful enemies as well.</p>
<h2>5 - Don't Go Off on Your Own</h2>
<p>Going off alone in Elden Ring Nightreign can be tempting, especially if you have uncollaborative companions, but doing so is never a good idea. Always stick together with your fellow Nightfarers, as there's nothing that you can do by yourself that can help the team as a whole. For example, you may defeat some bosses by yourself, but your companions will not receive upgrades automatically, only runes, rendering your efforts almost useless, in the grand scheme of things. With more experienced Nightfarers and excellent team coordination, spreading out may be a viable strategy to take down multiple bosses and rush from one location to the next picking upgrades, but this requires a lot of game knowledge as well, which you will obviously lack at the start of your adventure in Limveld.</p>

This makes for a fast-paced game focused on combat and exploration that's easy to set up and learn, but still offers much of the customization, continuity, and replayability of pen-and-paper RPGs.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">The game originally launched in 1989 and was out of print for several years until it returned with the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/HeroQuest-Tabletop-Immersive-Fantasy-Adventure/dp/B08Q4J1XHZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">HeroQuest Game System (2nd Edition)</a></strong>, thanks to a successful crowdfunding campaign. You can pick up a copy for $91.60 at Amazon, which is very close to the lowest price this year. Though the retailer briefly sold it for under $50 in early 2024, the price has trended up ever since--it hasn't dropped below $85 since Black Friday. The price has bounced between $90 and $110 throughout 2025 (so far). HeroQuest's MSRP is $135.</p><p dir="ltr">There is a cheaper path to accessing the new expansion.
