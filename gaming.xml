If you like your board games a little less physical, and a little more not technically a board game any more if we're being honest but that's fine because it's a neat looking, strategy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> now, then boooooy howdy do I have the game for you! Those familiar with the dungeon crawling tabletop game Descent will be interested to learn that it's getting a video game adaptation in the form of Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent.
</p>
<p>
Before we press on, I'd just like to say that it's specifically Terrinoth with the all rights reserved symbol, <em>then</em> it says Heroes of Descent. That's silly! Don't do that! It makes your game name look weird. Anyway, this just so happens to be the first game adaptation of the modern classic board game, and it's sounding like a pretty tight experience overall.
</p>

<p>
For starters, there's eight different adventurers to choose from, which judging from the trailer includes some guys that can do magic, some gals that can slice 'n' dice or shoot a bow and arrow, a thiefy lookin' fellow, the usual kind of fantasy RPG type characters. Dungeon crawling is still the name of the game too, with apparently 20 dungeons to play through, all with different storylines, and characters that'll adapt to whichever adventurers make up your party.
</p><p>
I quite like that on the Steam page it highlights that the different missions you can complete in the main campaign can be beaten in one night, makes it feel like it's going for a "getting the gang together for DnD" kind of vibe. Which you can do! Because there's co-op for up to four people at once.
</p>
<p>
The combat is described as accessible, though that is more meant in terms of it being not annoyingly complex as opposed to having accessibility features. It's turn-based, with a big emphasis on positioning, elevation, line of sight, and timing, all that jazz. For those more familiar with the board game's story, Terrinoth: Heroes of Descent is also a prequel to Descent: Legends of the Dark, but that'll probably mean more to those in the know than it does to me.
</p>
<p>
And there's even a demo you can try out right now, which is quite nifty as there's no release date other than sometime this year, so it'll give you something to mess around with until then. You can check it out on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3929630/Terrinoth_Heroes_of_Descent/">here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The patch notes for Overwatch’s Season 1 are here. Updates include general quality-of-life fixes, updates, and more.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/overwatch/" id="197">Overwatch </a>recently announced that, with the launch of its next season, it would revert to the name “Overwatch” after several years as “Overwatch 2.” Along with these changes comes a story-focused mentality and a new Rise of Talon story arc.</p>



<p>The February 9 patch notes detail a new conquest event and some updates fans can look forward to.</p>



<p>The conquest event will be a 5-week-long event. Players will choose their faction each week and can represent either Overwatch or Talon. After making their selection, there will be weekly faction challenges with their own rewards. Once the entire pass is unlocked, players can choose to switch factions and earn all of the faction-specific rewards on that side as well.</p>



<p>Learn more about the faction warfare and new Heroes added to the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-2-to-be-renamed-overwatch-with-next-update/" id="174168">here</a>.</p>







<h2 id="h-game-mode-update-clash-leaving-quick-play">Game Mode Update: Clash Leaving Quick Play</h2>



<p>In a game mode update, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/blizzard-entertainment/" id="87642">Blizzard </a>announced that Clash has been removed from Quick Play. This also means removing Hanaoka and Throne of Anubis from the map selection. It is stated that the mode will remain in Stadium, and it may return to Quick Play in the future.</p>



<p>“We have some amazing new maps lined up for the next year, and our reworks will continue…and get bigger. Redesigns that completely change how certain areas of our maps play are coming soon.”</p>







<h2>More Information on the General Updates to Overwatch</h2>



<p>New updates also feature a revamped UI that focuses on your friends and favorite Heroes. Loot box updates include a selection of Cosmetics from Seasons 15 through 20. Also, players can now adjust the Field of View on Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 5 Pro consoles.</p>



<p>Much more is included in the official notes. Read the full patch notes <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/patch-notes/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Instead, there may be "a new series on a different line"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="9342ae3b609b1"><a title="Yakuza Kiwami 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9342ae3b609b1/yakuza-kiwami-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure><p>Alongside continuing the stories of Kazuma Kiryu and introducing the world to Ichiban Kasuga, Sega and RGG Studio has spent about a decade bringing back some of the older <strong>Yakuza / Like A Dragon</strong> games for modern audiences. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</a>, out on 12th February, is the latest of those remakes, following on (naturally) from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami">Kiwami</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Kiwami 2</a>. But it sounds like, rather than moving onto the fourth game, the end of the Kiwami series is here (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/02/no-more-yakuza-kiwami-games-after-kiwami-3-story-changes-new-series-could-happen">Push Square</a>!).</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wCglSfda04">Ryusta TV livestream</a> broadcast earlier today, RGG Studio head Masayoshi Yokoyama said that "I think 'Yakuza Kiwami 3' will be the last one, and the 'Kiwami line will come to an end." (translation from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yakuzagames/comments/1r17x0o/yokoyama_announced_kiwami_3_will_the_last_game_in/">u/Dastanovich on Reddit</a>.)</p><div><figure data-videoid="MWHW8NC1uMo" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MWHW8NC1uMo?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytMWHW8NC1uMo" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MWHW8NC1uMo?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MWHW8NC1uMo?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed8af228gykinw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Of course, that's far from the end of the Yakuza — after all, we need more Ichiban in our lives (especially on Switch 2) — and Yokoyama elaborates that "I don't think it'll continue as the 'Kiwami' series anymore. I think a different series will begin. And not something like 'Like a Dragon 9,' but rather a new series on a different line, with a different meaning."</p>
<p>This sort of sounds like new timeline stuff, but it also means that Yakuza 4, Yakuza 5, and Yakuza 6 will be skipping the remake treatment — presumably. But with Yakuza Kiwami 3 reportedly making some controversial cuts and changes to the game's story, there's perhaps too much friction between the Kiwami games and the rest of the series.</p>

<p>Yokoyama seems to suggest that's the case, as he says the decision to stop the Kiwami games "... might be something you'll understand once you play 'Yakuza Kiwami 3.'"</p>
<p>Reviews for the upcoming remake have been more on the mixed side than Yakuza is used to. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties">We scored it a 6/10 on Switch 2</a>, for example, with our own Ollie Reynolds calling it "a fair series entry, but one that's tainted by poor pacing and a recasting controversy that simply didn't need to happen."</p>
<p>So, what's next for Yakuza / Like A Dragon? A break? The next game? RGG <em>is</em> also working on a brand new IP, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/stranger_than_heaven">Stranger Than Heaven</a>, and appears to be unrelated to RGG's premier franchise.</p>

I ranked it as the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/791574/best-switch-2-controllers">best Switch 2 controller</a> you can buy, thanks to its satisfying rumble sensation in games, support for motion controls as well as Nintendo’s amiibo NFC figures, plus the ability to remotely wake your console. Not to mention, it has durable TMR joysticks that are designed to last a lot longer than the hardware used by Nintendo in its controller.</p><p>I think it’s worth considering even at its original $59.99, but it’s considerably cheaper for the rest of the day at <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FM7Z4D7D/?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a>. You can get the black version for $41.99, and the blue and white version is $44.99.</p><p>I’d wager that most people aren’t willing to spend $89.99 on Nintendo’s Switch 2 Pro controller. Even for those who have the cash to splash, the S10 proves to be just as comfortable to use, even during long gaming sessions. Aside from lacking the Switch 2 Pro’s 3.5mm headphone jack that’s used for private listening, this controller is functionally identical. My biggest issue with the S10 is that the Screenshot, GameChat, and Home button placement is cramped, leading to some accidental presses. But at this price, it’s easier to overlook a small design flaw.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/876544/easysmx-s10-switch-2-wireless-controller-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

Users who aren’t verified as adults or determined to be under 18 will have a “teen-appropriate” experience with certain limitations, like being blocked from age-restricted servers.</p><p>Some platforms, such as Instagram, YouTube, OpenAI, and Anthropic, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/715343/youtube-age-estimation-ai-minor-account-restrictions">already use AI to “guess” the age</a> of users on their services as they inch their way <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/876131/discord-age-verification-mandates-web-future">toward implementing age verification</a>. Discord says it uses account information, device and activity data, and “high-level patterns” across the platform’s communities to estimate someone’s age.</p><p>Many users <a href="https://x.com/zachbussey/status/2021297270281384424?s=20">expressed frustration</a> <a href="https://x.com/DachyVille/status/2021157445889118209?s=20">with Discord</a> after the platform announced that it would start <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/875309/discord-age-verification-global-roll-out">imposing an age verification requirement</a> on users around the globe next month. While some claimed they’re going to leave the platform and cancel their Nitro subscriptions, others raised privacy concerns. Last year, a third-party vendor used by Discord <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/792032/discord-customer-service-data-breach-hack">experienced a data breach</a>, exposing user information and a “small number” of ID cards uploaded to the platform for age verification.

            <title><![CDATA[No, AI Written Romance Novels Are Not Inevitable]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/ai-romance-novel-new-york-times/</link>
            <guid>1431643</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>In an article called “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/08/business/ai-claude-romance-books.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>The New Fabio is Claude</u></a>,” the New York Times speaks to romance novel “authors” who claim that AI is the future of the genre. This is both obviously untrue, but also not at all what these two authors have demonstrated with their financial success from using AI.</p><p>The Times spoke to two authors who use AI to write entire books. One, who uses the pen name Coral Hart, says that by using prompting and Claude, she can generate an entire book in 45 minutes. Interestingly, she also sells courses about how to best use AI to write romance novels.</p><p>“Ms. Hart has become an A.I. evangelist,” the article reads. “Through her author-coaching business, Plot Prose, she’s taught more than 1,600 people how to produce a novel with artificial intelligence, she said. She’s rolling out her proprietary A.I. writing program, which can generate a book based on an outline in less than an hour, and costs between $80 and $250 a month.”</p><p>Out of curiosity, I checked out the Plot Prose website. The “script the draft” package on the homepage of Plot Prose promises it can deliver “your next novel 90% complete and fully packaged for publication,” saying you can skip the “hardest part” of writing, which is writing. She also offers “AI creation kits,” which are pre-packaged drafts and outlines that also include “AI-writer optimized scene beats for fast execution.”</p><p>Another so-called “author,” Elizabeth Anne West, says that eventually, readers won’t care if a book is written by AI. Coincidentally, West <em>also</em> sells courses on how to use AI to write romance novels.</p><p>“Ms. West, who also teaches classes on how to write with A.I., has gotten blowback from opponents of the technology, including occasional death threats on social media,” the article says. “But she believes that in time, A.I. generated fiction will become widespread and popular.”</p><p>In between these two buried pieces of context–that both of these writers have an economic interest in the success of AI in the writing space because they sell courses on how to use AI to write books–this article only barely describes whether or not these books are any good or if readers like them. Another author who uses AI to write romance novels even admits that the technology is pretty bad at doing so.</p><p>“Whenever Ms. Rompoti’s curvy protagonist, an event planner named Sienna, was in a scene, the A.I. constantly referenced her weight, for example, noting that a chair groaned when she sat down,” the article reads. “‘When you make a point that someone is plus size, it will exaggerate, somebody is suddenly humongous,’ Rompoti said.”</p><p>Both Hart and West claim that their courses are popular—Hart makes the claim that even authors who are against AI in public sign up for her classes–but of course they would. They both run businesses that depend on the idea that romance novels are best written with AI. Except, curiously, West also says that the books that have a disclaimer about AI being used in the writing process don’t sell as well.</p><p>“If you hide that there’s A.I., it sells just fine,” she told the Times.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/nanowrimo-ai-statement-controversy/"><div><p>You Don’t Need AI To Write A Novel - Aftermath</p><p>AI isn’t a privilege issue, no matter what National Novel Writing Month says</p><p><span>Riley MacLeod</span></p></div></a></figure><p>My response to this as a journalist and reader of the occasional romance novel is: of course she would say that. Of course she would say that “eventually, audiences won’t care.” Hart and West have a vested economic interest in this technology succeeding in the literary space. Hart claims she made six figures off of her AI-published romance novels, mostly because she uses AI to produce a manuscript in under an hour. She said that her 200 AI books garnered collectively 50,000 sales, meaning each book sold on average 250 copies. The only way this is a viable business model is if you don’t care if the books are good or if people like them.&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, my friend and romance novel author Ella Dawson pointed out that the GoodReads presence for both Hart and West paints a sobering picture of how these books are received. Most of Coral Hart’s books on GoodReads<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/54945185.Coral_Hart?ref=aftermath.site"><u> are rated one or two stars</u></a>. West’s work seems better received, but I think it’s worth pointing out that it appears that <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/list/5204939.Elizabeth_Ann_West?ref=aftermath.site"><u>every single piece of fiction she has published is fanfic about <em>Pride and Prejudice</em></u></a>, a work currently in the public domain, making her entire output dependent on the work of another author as a baseline.&nbsp;</p><p>“This reporter got snowed,” Dawson told me over text. “The New York Times has a bumpy track record when it comes to taking the romance genre seriously (a Fabio headline? In 2026? Seriously?) but I’m still baffled by their decision to profile these AI-reliant con artists masquerading as authors.”</p><p>For these AI evangelists featured in this article, finding a dedicated audience and reaching those readers through the quality of your work is not the goal. Writing for readers to “feel seen,” as Rompoti describes in the Times’ article, is immaterial. The goal is to make money using fiction. These people have already decided that the fiction they produce is not art—it is content, and the best way to make money through content is either to produce a lot of it, or sell a course on how to get rich fast by producing a lot of content.</p><p>Even according to the Times’ own reporting, readers do not seem to like AI romance novels. One of the two AI critical sources quoted in the article said that she would never knowingly pick up a book written by AI. Another, an author whose work had been scraped by Anthropic to train their AI model, pointed out that flooding the zone with slop makes it much harder for real human authors to be discovered by readers.&nbsp;</p><p>What I found most curious was Coral Hart’s reasoning for using a pseudonym in the article. Coral Hart is a retired pen name and the source would not give any of her current pen names “because she still uses her real name for some publishing and coaching projects. She fears that revealing her A.I. use would damage her business for that work.” Huh! That’s weird!</p><p>The lack of care paid to the actual readers of these AI books feels like a deliberate exclusion. The article describes romance readers as “voracious” and romance novels as “reliant on formula." Ergo, romance novels don’t have to be good, because romance readers will read any old shit as long as it has a Happily Ever After!</p><p>“Credulous reporting like this does nothing but prop up the lie that these ‘authors’ and AI companies desperately want us to believe: that the proliferation of AI across every industry is inevitable .It isn’t! I mean seriously, why would you ever take the word of a self-proclaimed coach who sells courses on using AI to create novels?” Dawson told me. “Readers are not ATMs, romance novels are not content to farm, and if you can’t write a book without firing up a plagiarism machine, you’re not meant to be an author.”</p><p>There’s not much daylight between what these two women do and what’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3xSJuoUnN8&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>described in this Super Eyepatch Wolf video about “Influencer Courses” grifts</u></a>. Through the course of this video, the improbably named John Walsh actually takes some of the YouTube influencer courses only to discover that the people selling these courses don’t even have the YouTube numbers to back up the claims they make. One person selling a multihour lecture about how to be successful on YouTube only had 4,000 subscribers.</p><p>It’s the same model for these grifters. If you make the claim that you are successful—claims which the Times makes very little effort to confirm independently—then you can become a subject matter expert, and sell your expertise for a pretty penny. And the content itself can be complete bullshit that sucks and no one likes, because the content is merely an advertisement for the courses you sell. And those courses don’t have to be good, either! You can just charge $250 for bullshit!</p><p>To me, this is all evidence that <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-is-the-ultimate-forced-meme/"><u>AI is still a forced meme</u></a>. You don’t have to listen to the grifters who tell you that “eventually” everyone will be using this technology and that no one will mind if their books are written by AI. That eventuality is not a guarantee, and there is no real indication that it will ever arrive. Similarly, Christa Désir, vice president and editorial director of Bloom Books, says that AI books will become “undetectable at a certain point.” Handily, to make a prediction like this, you don’t have to provide any evidence to support your claim. You can just say shit, and the Times will print it.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-is-the-ultimate-forced-meme/"><div><p>AI Is The Ultimate “Forced Meme”</p><p>There are few things in this world more insufferable than a rich person trying to force their shitty ideas on everyone else. And in 2025, there are very few things that feel more forced than “Generative AI.”</p><p><span>Aftermath</span><span>Janus Rose</span></p></div></a></figure>

			<p>Last week, <strong>Blizzard Entertainment</strong> hosted the second of <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-announces-showcases-for-world-of-warcraft-diablo-hearthstone-and-overwatch-all-within-the-next-two-weeks/">its flurry of showcases</a> to kick off 2026 with an <strong>Overwatch Spotlight</strong>, digging into the future of the game and everything players can expect for the coming year. Outside of the official name change back to just 'Overwatch,' we got a look at everything coming in <strong>Season 1: Reign of Talon</strong>, which has officially gone live.</p>



<p>The showcase clearly reinvigorated the Overwatch community, because not only did the game have its "<em>biggest weekend by player count in over a year</em>," according to a press release after the showcase, but the launch of the new season has driven it to reach a new peak concurrent player count on Steam. At the time of this writing, Overwatch has reached <strong>107,004 concurrent players on Steam,</strong> stomping the previous peak of 75,608 players that came when Overwatch (then Overwatch 2) arrived on Steam in 2023.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Across 2026, Blizzard will add a total of 10 new heroes to the game, with <strong>five</strong> of those heroes all arriving in Season 1. The five new heroes are <strong>Domina (Tank), Emre (Damage), Mizuki (Support), Anran (Damage),</strong> and <strong>Jetpack Cat (Support).</strong></p>



<p>The classes for each hero will, of course, be recognizable for veteran players, but it's worth remembering that today's update and the arrival of Season 1 also introduce several mechanical changes, like the introduction of sub-classes that all heroes are categorized into on top of their Support, Damage, and Tank classes. If you want a refresher on more of the mechanical changes and the UI/UX changes coming in today's update, <a href="https://wccftech.com/were-dropping-the-2-overwatch-2-is-now-just-called-overwatch-moving-forward/">check out our breakdown</a> of everything that came out of the Overwatch Spotlight.</p>



<p>There's also the introduction of a new narrative structure, which sees the story of each hero unfold through cinematics, animated comics, in-game events, and map updates. The first cinematic shows Vendetta defeating Doomfist, which you can check out below if you missed it during the Spotlight.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-battle-revolution-shiny-hunting-costumes-kyogre-2000667344</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-shiny-odds-scarlet-violet-ivs-red-gyarados-1850248457"><span>Shiny hunters</span></a><span> are Arceus’ strongest soldiers in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>community, but I think we may have found the strongest among them. One fan did a somewhat unorthodox Shiny hunt not in one of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>RPGs, but in a 20-year-old battle simulator spin-off on the Wii. Collecting these alternate-colored monsters in it is far more complicated than doing so in your average </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game.</span></p> <p><span>User Noa_Kyogre on X (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/pokemon/pokemon-player-spends-5-years-completing-one-of-the-weirdest-shiny-hunts-in-history-immediately-promises-to-never-do-it-again/"><i><span>Gamesradar</span></i></a><span>) took five years to find Shiny costumes in </span><i><span>Pokémon Battle Revolution</span></i><span>. The Wii game doesn’t have wild Pokémon encounters, but its various trainers can dress up as monsters if the player chooses to wear themed outfits based on creatures like Groudon, Kyogre, Roserade, and Lucario. However, it’s possible to find these outfits in their respective Pokémon’s Shiny colors, such as a yellow-and-green Lucario rather than its usual blue-and-black color scheme. It will just take you thousands of hours of playtime to do it.</span></p>

 <p><span>You can acquire these outfits by beating a trainer wearing them in the game’s single-player mode, but each of these trainers shows up during what is essentially a long boss rush of high-level battles, and their outfits have as little a chance of changing as a rare Pokémon has of showing up in a base game. That’s a roughly 1 in 8192 spawn chance.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">ポケモンバトルレボリューション (通称バトレボ)<br>日本語版と海外版 それぞれで色違いコスチューム コンプリートしました！😋💫<br>多分、史上初だと思います🤔<br>海外版は肌の色が3種類から選べるので褐色ガチ神！😍<br>多分5〜6年ぐらいこの厳選やってました！🤣<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E8%89%B2%E9%81%95%E3%81%84%E3%83%9D%E3%82%B1%E3%83%A2%E3%83%B3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#色違いポケモン</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ShinyPokemon?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ShinyPokemon</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Shinyhunt?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Shinyhunt</a> <a href="https://t.co/20K0tvLc9F">pic.twitter.com/20K0tvLc9F</a></p> <p>— のあ (@Noa_Kyogre) <a href="https://twitter.com/Noa_Kyogre/status/2020371004934221837?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>So, if you want to Shiny hunt these outfits, you’ll have to reload and fight through these battles over and over just to get one of them. That wasn’t enough for Noa_Kyogre, who has collected the full set of six, not once but twice, and asserts they are the first person to do so. The double dipping came from finding the full set in both the Japanese and international versions of the game.</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s definitely worth the bragging rights, but is it worth the likely insanity you’ll subject yourself to in order to get it? Probably not, and Noa_Kyogre says they will </span><a href="https://x.com/Noa_Kyogre/status/2020382448736207114?s=20"><span>never do it again</span></a><span>. I’m surprised they didn’t come to that conclusion the first time through.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Pokémon Battle Revolution </span></i><span>was pretty maligned back in the day for being more of a battle simulator than a full-blown game, but it does still have some of the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-battle-revolution-animations-wii-scarlet-violet-1850362666"><span>best animations of the series’ 3D games</span></a><span>. It really captured each monster’s personality in a way that doesn’t come across in games like </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, but it also had the benefit of a much smaller Pokémon selection than most modern games. </span><i><span>Pokémon Champions</span></i><span>, the Switch and mobile battle simulator </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-champions-legends-z-a-presents-day-stream-1851766818"><span>coming later this year</span></a><span>, is essentially its spiritual successor, and will act as the battle platform for competitive </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>moving forward.</span></p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/ryu-ga-gotoku-studio/" id="96159">RGG</a>‘s Masayoshi Yokoyama has stated that Sega’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/yakuza-kiwami/" id="154859">Yakuza Kiwami</a> series will conclude with the third installment, setting the stage for a new series.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/yakuza-kiwami-3/" id="2971">Yakuza Kiwami 3</a> is set to release on February 12. It is the latest in the line of Kiwami remakes for the Yakuza series. Unfortunately for those looking for more of this style of game, Masayoshi Yokoyama revealed during a recent livestream that the forthcoming game will be the series’ final installment, making way for new games with a different title. The spin-off will not be comparable to the Like A Dragon series either.</p>



<p>“I don’t think it will continue as the ‘Kiwami’ series anymore. I think a different series will begin, and not something like ‘Like A Dragon 9, ‘ but rather a new series on a different line, with a different meaning. This might be something you’ll understand once you play Yakuza Kiwami 3.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-yakuza-kawami-3-also-comes-bundled-with-dark-ties">Yakuza Kawami 3 Also Comes Bundled With Dark Ties</h2>



<p>In addition to the remake of 2009’s Yakuza 3, this new game also comes with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties/" id="173294">Dark Ties DLC</a>. In this expansion, you will play as the antagonist of Yakuza 3, Yoshitaka Mine. This is a prequel story following Mine as he joins the Yakuza Tojo Clan. </p>



<p>This version is comparable to Sonic x Shadow Generations in that it gives players a choice of which mode to launch first.</p>

<p>Still coming in 2026</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><em>Are</em>Fans are still speculating as to what exactly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/danganronpa-2x2">Danganronpa 2x2</a> is — part a remaster and rerelease of the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/danganronpa_2_goodbye_despair_anniversary_edition">Danganronpa 2</a>, part a brand new scenario, the game is largely shrouded in mystery. But while we wait for more info (and a firmer 2026 release date), Spike Chunsoft has opened up pre-orders for the physical release of the game.</p>
<p>On both Switch 1 and Switch 2, Danganronpa 2x2 will be getting a standard physical release — stocked at various retailers for <strong>$59.99 USD</strong> — which appears to include the game fully on the card for Switch 2.</p>
<p>Plus. there's a special collector's edition, appropriately-named the 'Psycho Tropical Vacation Package'. This will set you back <strong>$139.99 USD</strong> and includes a RSVLTS reversible Psycho Tropical hat, a Kidrobot 3" figure of bother tropical Monokuma and Monomi, an OST which includes remixes of the best tracks from the original game, and a clamshell-style outer box to display your collection in.</p>
<p>In addition, if you pre-order directly from <a href="https://store.spike-chunsoft.com/">Spike Chunsoft</a>'s Shopify page, you'll get a 4" Monokuma Flight Tag.</p>
<figure data-uuid="aee2552de968a"><a title="Danganronpa 2x2 Psycho Tropical Vacation Package" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/aee2552de968a/danganronpa-2x2-psycho-tropical-vacation-package.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Spike Chunsoft</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Canadian store <a href="https://videogamesplus.ca/products/danganronpa-2x2-standard-edition-nintendo-switrch-pre-order?bg_ref=0VD60ZTsIP" rel="sponsored noopener">VGP</a> has also opened up pre-orders for the game for <strong>$84.99 CAD</strong> (or <strong>$194.99 CAD</strong> for the special edition). European European orders will be handled by Reef Entertainment.</p>
<p>We haven't seen much of Danganronpa 2x2 since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-september-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">its reveal at the September 2025 Nintendo Direct</a>, though it was shown off at the Danganronpa 15th Anniversary Fes: Ultimate Appreciation Festival back in November.</p>
<p>The "all new storyline" being added to this rerelease is reportedly meant to be as long as the base game, which means double the content. And probably double the shenanigans. After <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/danganronpa_v3_killing_harmony_anniversary_edition">Danganronpa V3</a>, anything is possible...</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Binding Of Isaac Dev’s New Game Takes 500 Hours To Complete And Will Take Players ‘Months or Years’ To Find All Of Its Secrets]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-completionist-secrets-hours-binding-isaac-roguelike-2000667343</link>
            <guid>1431577</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>On Tuesday, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-edmund-mcmillen-roguelike-impressions-2000666865"><i><span>Mewgenics</span></i></a><span>, the tactical RPG-slash-life-sim roguelite about breeding and battling cats, created by developers behind </span><i><span>The Binding of Isaac </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Closure</span></i><span>, launched and almost immediately shot to the top of Steam’s charts. </span><i><span>Mewgenics </span></i><span>seems like it’s shaping up to be the next big hit for roguelite sickos, in no small part thanks to how absolutely massive its scope is.</span></p> <p><span>In </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1qzfwae/edmund_mcmillen_here_mewgenics_is_steam_deck/"><span>an AMA on the Steam Deck subreddit</span></a><span> over the weekend, developers Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel teamed up to answer fans’ questions about the game, and they revealed that it’s a </span><i><span>lot </span></i><span>larger than anyone previously expected. In one response, McMillen referred to the game as “one of the largest tactical RPGs of all time.” In another, he revealed that “it will take an average player about 200+ hours to ‘beat the game’ and 500+ hours to 100% :)” (thanks, </span><em><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/roguelike/its-going-to-take-you-over-500-hours-to-100-percent-complete-mewgenics-according-to-creator-edmund-mcmillen/"><span>PC Gamer</span></a></em><span>).</span></p>

 <p><span>Judging by the game’s 281 Steam achievements and the fact that it has 1,000 unique abilities to unlock, that estimate doesn’t sound like much of a stretch. And it seems like </span><i><span>Mewgenics</span></i><span>’ most dedicated players might end up pouring quite a few extra hours into hunting for secrets. According to Glaiel, “there’s a lot of little things that I think people will be discovering for months or years. But we will reserve the true ARG level stuff for DLC.” (thanks, </span><em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/mewgenics-dlc-secret-unlock-arg-binding-of-issac/"><span>Polygon</span></a></em><span>).</span></p> <p><span>While the base game’s absurd length should tide players over for a long time, McMillen also said the team is planning on beginning work on the game’s DLC in the next few months, with a planned release around a year later. McMillen also hinted that a Switch 2 port might be on its way. The game is currently only available on PC.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2>From delayed development to the top of the charts</h2> <p><i><span>Mewgenics </span></i><span>was announced all the way back in 2012, but the project entered a long period of development hell (and was even cancelled at one point). Despite the game’s wildly tumultuous development cycle, it’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-edmund-mcmillen-roguelike-impressions-2000666865"><span>apparently pretty good</span></a><span>. It’s currently the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/">highest-rated game</a> on Metacritic for the year so far. If <em>Binding of Isaac</em>‘s trajectory <a href="https://kotaku.com/binding-of-isaac-designers-new-game-is-both-uncomfortab-1728533526">is any indication</a>, this is only the start of a long and wild post-launch life for <em>Mewgenics</em>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I haven’t had a chance to pick up the game yet, but I’ve been having a blast watching players share their freakish findings online all day. Even McMillen couldn’t resist sharing some of his own discoveries in the AMA—he wrote: “my nephew Eli had one where he could punch one of his other cats in the face and it would send out 1000 sparkles to totally destroy all enemies instantly…the game is so insane man, you don’t even know.”</span></p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/mixtape-preview-its-all-about-the-music-in-the-idyllic-90s</link>
            <guid>1431571</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm sure I'm not alone in thinking that mixtapes (or Spotify playlists now) were an important part of those crucial, formative teenage years. I'm also sure that I'm definitely not alone in the shared experience of putting together the perfect playlist to share with my friends or a significant other. Simply put, those playlists tell a story. And while the ones from my teenage years may seem like nothing more than whatever cool metalcore bands I was into and in at the time, te memories created from those long lost CD-Rs and iTunes playlists still stick with me years later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The importance of music during that formative but extremely awkward time is how we expressed ourselves and built an identity. The subgenres and scenes were as important to me as anything during those teenage years playing in garage bands, getting sunburned at the Warped Tour, and sifting through thousands of MP3s on my beat-up laptop in order to build that week's lineup of songs. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In video game form, Mixtape does – at least so far – an excellent job at invoking the feeling of needing that perfect soundtrack for day-to-day life. From the start of the demo, I was skating in a picturesque northwestern town during golden hour while listening to Devo’s “That’s Good”. The vibe check was passed immediately when the protagonist, Stacey, breaks the fourth wall and explains the importance of good headphones and a good playlist. Mixtape’s presentation is a hybrid of a traditional point-and-click adventure similar to Life is Strange, mixed with abrupt but natural fourth-wall breaks for exposition and what the characters are feeling in that moment. While this isn't a new thing, very few games have managed to pull it off like Mixtape does, and it has yet to overstay its welcome. </p><p>Mixtape seems best described as a blend of a video game and a stylish TV show.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">From the few chapters I've played, Mixtape seems best described as a blend of a video game and a stylish TV show. The camera work and intentionally low frame rate animation on the characters lend a charm to it, and the dialogue, while a bit campy, never took me out of the moment. Stacey, Slater, and Cassandra are very much your typical teenage archetypes in the best way possible. While they weren't annoying or overbearing like some rebellious teen-fronted games tend to be, the trio are definitely written in an unrealistic way that works perfectly for the story Mixtape is trying to tell. It's obvious that these three are meant to be stereotypical in a way that evokes a feeling of nostalgia from the player. There were a few moments where I found myself saying “been there before,” and for a story that's clearly trying to invoke a specific feeling of anemoia (nostalgia for a time that never existed) with the player, it nails that. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Let's talk about Mixtape’s namesake. The music here, while not necessarily anything that would have landed on one of the thousands of CD-Rs I made as a teen, is outstanding. In the little bit of the campaign I played, the needle drops included a mix of songs ranging from Devo to Silverchair, which show the potential diversity of Mixtape's final soundtrack, and I'm glad the developers at Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur  didn't go with your run of the mill “safe” selection of hits from the ‘90s. It's obvious that the team is digging deep with the music selection in order to not only tell its story about music snobs hoping to craft the perfect mixtape in order to get a job as a music supervisor, but also tell the story about the final day of three teens' high school years. </p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, vibes and music aren't everything when it comes to video games, and the gameplay is where Mixtape started to feel a little flat. While there were a few moments in the demo that required a bit more interactivity than finding something highlighted on screen, such as escaping from the police in a shopping cart, throwing toilet paper at Stacey’s principals house, and positioning Stacey and Slater into various poses in a photo booth, the select chapters I played felt like they were missing the welcome bit of interactivity that other point-and-click adventures offer. While the best moments had a decent amount of gameplay, a few chapters felt like I was watching a (very polished) interactive show rather than playing a video game. That being said, Mixtape's gameplay isn't necessarily the selling point here, because every time I found myself thinking about it, something cool would happen on screen, the needle would drop, and I would be pulled right back into Stacey Rockford's story. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mixtape - February 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After playing 30 minutes of Mixtape, I can clearly see the direction Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur is looking to take with this ‘90s-set teenage adventure. The visuals are striking, its sense of nostalgia and warmth are unlike anything I've seen recently, and the needle drops definitely made me want to play more than what the demo allowed me. Is it going to be everyone's favorite thing? Probably not, but that's the fun of making the perfect mixtape, isn't it? </p></section><div><h3 data-cy="title3"><svg data-cy="icon-logo" viewBox="0 0 76 24" title="IGN"><title>IGN Logo</title><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M5.38 7.65a7.85 7.85 0 0 1 2.26-2.26c.13-1.18.31-2.26.52-3.21a10.605 10.605 0 0 0-6 6c.95-.22 2.03-.39 3.21-.52M16.34 5.36v.02c.9.59 1.67 1.37 2.27 2.27 1.18.13 2.26.31 3.21.52a10.627 10.627 0 0 0-6.02-6.01c.22.95.4 2.02.54 3.2M7.64 18.62c-.9-.59-1.67-1.37-2.27-2.27h-.03c-1.19-.14-2.26-.32-3.19-.54 1.07 2.75 3.26 4.95 6.01 6.02-.22-.95-.39-2.03-.52-3.21M18.64 16.35h-.03c-.59.9-1.37 1.67-2.27 2.27v.03c-.14 1.17-.32 2.25-.54 3.19a10.59 10.59 0 0 0 6.03-6.03c-.94.22-2 .4-3.19.54M10.04 0h3.9c.85 1.85 1.2 4.59 1.3 5.52.04.22.06.43.06.63L12 9.11 8.7 6.15c0-.17.02-.35.05-.55.1-.95.43-3.75 1.29-5.61M8.7 17.83c0 .17.02.35.05.55.1.95.43 3.75 1.29 5.61h3.9c.85-1.84 1.2-4.59 1.3-5.52.04-.22.06-.43.06-.64L12 14.87l-3.3 2.96ZM6.16 8.68c-.17 0-.35.02-.55.05-.95.12-3.75.45-5.61 1.31v3.9c1.84.85 4.59 1.19 5.52 1.3.22.04.43.06.64.06L9.11 12 6.16 8.7ZM24 10.02c-1.86-.86-4.66-1.19-5.61-1.29-.2-.03-.38-.05-.55-.05l-2.96 3.3 2.96 3.3c.2 0 .41-.02.64-.06.93-.11 3.68-.45 5.52-1.3v-3.9Z"></path><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M42.83 13.9V10h10.45c1.06 0 1.93.86 1.93 1.92v4.63c0 2.38-1.91 4.36-4.33 4.36h-6.69c-4.96 0-8.97-4-8.97-8.94s4.04-8.95 8.98-8.95h10.36v4.11H44.2c-2.67 0-4.86 2.17-4.86 4.84s2.16 4.83 4.86 4.83h6.91v-2.91h-8.27ZM33.86 3h-4.07v16.02c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.15V3M74.37 3.01h-2.18v13.81s0 .08-.03.11a.29.29 0 0 1-.24.14c-.09 0-.16-.04-.25-.15L64.83 4.93a4.347 4.347 0 0 0-3.72-2.11h-.07c-2.39 0-4.32 1.93-4.32 4.32v11.88c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.17V7.14s.02-.09.04-.13a.29.29 0 0 1 .24-.14c.09 0 .18.03.24.14l6.88 12.07c.76 1.27 2.12 2.05 3.69 2.05h.07c2.39 0 4.32-1.93 4.32-4.32V4.92c0-1.05-.85-1.91-1.91-1.91"></path></svg>Recommends</h3></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/mixtape-preview-its-all-about-the-music-in-the-idyllic-90s]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">We'll have an old fashioned wedding.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of Stardew Valley are eager to get married... again. To whom? They don't know. But they're hoping their bride/groom will be a couple of individuals in particular.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To understand why, take a look back at our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valleys-17-update-will-add-2-new-marriage-candidates">own interview with ConcernedApe</a>, where he exclusively revealed to us that the next update, 1.7, would include two new marriageable characters. He wouldn't say who they were, and we don't even know if these will be brand new characters or existing characters that suddenly become available. While ConcernedApe will let us know later this month on the game's 10th anniversary, that hasn't stopped people from wildly speculating who it'll be, and there are a few theories reigning supreme right now.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Logically, we can put together that we will likely get both a man and a woman, as all the other candidates have opposite-gender pairings for events like the Flower Dance. To find out who the most popular people in the game for romance were, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1qv52zk/a_form_to_see_which_unmarriageable_npc_people/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit user JeffTheKillerFa put together a poll</a> for fans to see who came out on top. They've since posted the results, showing Sandy coming out waaay ahead of the other single women (Marnie was in second place), and the Wizard winning the vote for single men.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But interestingly, fans have latched onto another possibility that we could see in 1.7: breaking up an existing couple. The poll also asked fans who of the currently married individuals in the valley they wanted to steal. Robin was the clear winner, with players clearly not losing any sleep over breaking her up with Demetrius. That's even something <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1qvlwl7/concernedape_talking_about_wanting_to_make_robin/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ConcernedApe has discussed as a possibility before</a>! But Caroline (currently married to general store owner Pierre) was also a favorite.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As a bit of a gag, the poll also included a section for "non-giftable" characters, or individuals who you can't currently form even a friendship with due to a lack of ability to give gifts and limited dialogue options. Marlon of the Adventurer's Guild was a pretty obvious winner here, followed by Gunther from the museum. And in a final poll, it seems like people don't necessarily want to marry the Dwarf, but like Krobus, they wish she would move in as a roommate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These poll results do seem to line up roughly with comments posted all over the community since our interview about who people want to see. However, there's one character that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1qxi6ei/my_number_one_pick_for_a_marriage_candidate/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">got some attention on socials</a> who wasn't in the poll at all:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/10/hat-mouse-1770744501998.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image source: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1qxi6ei/my_number_one_pick_for_a_marriage_candidate/">https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1qxi6ei/my_number_one_pick_for_a_marriage_candidate/</a></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, the Hat Mouse! I too would love to marry the Hat Mouse! We could run a little hat store together! Of course that's realistic!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, it's possible we're going to get two brand new characters in the valley, and all of this speculation will have been just silly wishcasting. But until ConcernedApe says otherwise, I will be eagerly awaiting the addition of my preferred combo of Hat Mouse and the Wizard, the most obviously romantic individuals in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/space-warlord-baby-trading-simulator-prediction-markets-kalshi/</link>
            <guid>1431553</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>“Your life is going to be horrible, so that’s free money as far as I’m concerned,” streamer Northernlion said before setting a short position on a small alien baby made of molten igneous rock. He was playing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3642000/Space_Warlord_Baby_Trading_Simulator/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator</u></em></a>, an absurdist stock market simulator that lets you speculate wildly on the lives of alien babies. Short, brutal and laugh out loud funny, it is a game that is only marginally more evil than the financial markets that rule our lives.</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64/app.bsky.feed.post/3meacbkreps2u" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreicndkjei5x4d6qyacndmxrdfzhjnq47xmzgygutatsuzlkmrtymq4">— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Chris Person (@papapishu.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64/post/3meacbkreps2u?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">2026-02-07T01:45:21.507Z</a></blockquote></figure><p><em>Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator</em> starts on a positive note: in the year 3478, devices called FutureSee terminals have given the intergalactic masses limited insight into the long term consequences of the future of companies, conflicts and star systems. This was a massive boon for civilizations everywhere, as technology improved and most wars were now avoidable. But it also devastated all speculative financial markets, as now nothing could be speculated on. With no other options, the financial industry turned to the only speculative asset it had left: the lives of individual babies, which were too volatile and immediate for the terminals to see. That’s right, it’s time to get out there and speculate on the lives of babies.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PCiL6h8x7qM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator -  STEAM LAUNCH TRAILER"></iframe></figure><p>The latest game from publisher <a href="https://aftermath.site/xalavier-nelson-interview-strange-scaffold-el-paso-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/"><u>Strange Scaffold</u></a>, <em>Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator</em> feels retro in a thoroughly specific way. It feels like a throwback to a game like <em>Drug Wars</em>, a game I spent <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/history-drug-wars-calculator-game/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">endless hours playing on a TI-83 </a>instead of getting work done in math class. Tonally and aesthetically it feels indebted to games like <em>Dinopark Tycoon</em>, <em>Afterlife</em> (a<a href="https://aftermath.site/27-years-later-lucasarts-afterlife-is-brilliant-brutal-and-few-know-how-to-beat-it/"><u> game I was obsessed with</u></a>) and the masterpiece that is <em>Star Control 2</em>. It is absurd on its face, totally unsubtle with what it’s saying, and none the worse for it.</p><figure><figcaption><span>"Likely event: MELTED DOWN FOR BEING TOO OLD" Credit: Strange Scaffold</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like <em>Drug Wars</em> before it and the stock market generally, the goal is to buy low and sell high. You follow the lives of individual babies on a market-style ticker, buying stock in their lives at their worst and selling at their best. The baby’s overall health is indicated by a beating heart on the right side of the screen. The goal is to optimize your profit and make more than you started with plus the cost of the entry fee. The stock ticker will flash various events in the baby’s life from “covered in gleple poop” to “learned what reading is” (their value goes down after this event).&nbsp;</p><p>On top of simply buying stock, you can <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_(finance)?ref=aftermath.site"><u>short</u></a> a baby if you are confident their life will get measurably worse in the near future. However, this can backfire tremendously and potentially bankrupt you should you be wrong and they get a promotion or find love. If a baby dies in the span of the short, the short is voided. And though you can choose one of four potential babies every day, side bets can be placed on each of them for potential events, life span and overall value.</p><figure><figcaption><span>"BURNED IN JAIL CELL." Credit: Strange Scaffold</span></figcaption></figure><p>The campaign features nine distinct characters and scenarios representing different traders. The plot of each character adds a significant mechanical tweak to each trading period, with four distinct outcomes to each scenario: failure, bronze, silver or gold. For example, trader Holmit Miskie is a disgraced junior financial planner at Holmit &amp; Spawns whose elderly clientele wishes to get in on the new baby trade, a market his bosses are not confident in and thus are setting him up for failure. He is a sad sack who looks like the alien equivalent of Jack Lemmon in <em>Glengarry Glen Ross</em>, and mechanically he is not allowed to take side bets. Nuria Voll is a retail trader who puts their rent and everything they have to get into the lucrative baby trading market. Mechanically, she is scammed every day by the lease on her “HiValue Guaranteed trade license” and enters the market just as the entire thing goes to shit in what’s known as “The Great Flip.” Mechanically, the market gets twice as expensive and half as profitable halfway through her run. Rep. Hoddle is a legislator who regulates the market, and thus is not allowed to interact with it, save through an intermediary named Willy “No Hands” Shig. Mechanically, this legal loophole of an unscrupulous proxy adds a significant delay to every purchase and sale, making it harder to trade on volatility.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Wenbill is one of the most vile creatures in all of video games. Credit: Strange Scaffold</span></figcaption></figure><p>In addition to this, there are seven different planets you can trade on, each of which have wildly different market tendencies for the babies on them. For example, Google Gibby is a “war world,” where half of the planet is permanently in conflict to benefit the arms industry. This constant state of war means that baby investments tend to trend steady upwards before the baby’s life turns reliably horrible, often for war-based reasons. Cantor Vantis, meanwhile, is a tropical reality tv show planet where galactic children are sent to compete on the show “Get Big or Die Trying,” and which can lead to sudden fortunes before sudden, comically </p><figure><figcaption><span>"Legally, not a dog." Credit: Strange Scaffold</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>Real Housewives</em>-themed deaths. Though the potential for wealth is high, you could lose everything if they die in a celebrity mishap while you’re holding the bag.</p><p>Assisting in your buying and selling are advisors, who can lend insight into the lives of each baby for a fee with varying degrees of accuracy. Details range from the average price of the baby, the value of the baby at age 30, the floor price of the baby, random events in the baby’s life, the longest duration of its positive upswing, and so on. Advisors are key to making money. For example, if you know the average price of a baby is about $3,000, and the baby has been trading below that for several decades, you know that it will have to swing upward above $3,000 for a specific period of time for the overall amount to average out. Occasionally, the knowledge of the advisors will sometimes intersect with the side bets, allowing you to make smarter calls on which baby will pay out aside from the general odds given by the bookies.</p><figure><figcaption><span>What if ancient Greece was also Disney Land.</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator</em> is exhilarating, absurd and compelling in the same ruinous way that day trading or speculative investment is. Like <a href="https://aftermath.site/qup-esports-universal-paperclips/"><em><u>Q-UP</u></em></a>, it is a game that takes the mechanical form of the thing it is lampooning, successfully having its cake and eating it too. It is the ideal game for someone like Northernlion to stream, and him screaming like a r/WallStreetBets guy is an incredible bit of comedy. It is not a game that overstays its welcome, and it leaves you wanting more to play (an endless mode would be nice, but maybe that defeats the purpose).&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qn7c7fg31xw?start=127&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="I'm actually a mod on r/WallStreetDads (Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator)"></iframe><figcaption><p><span>He really does sell it well.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p><em>Space Warlord Baby Trading Simulator</em> is also a game that could not be more germane to the moment. The last six years have been maddening if you believe in anything resembling financial regulation. Gambling is functionally legal from your phone in most of the country, the market has never been less rational, insider trading is happening nakedly on a historic scale and the entire economy is held together by bubble gum, petty scams and investments that mathematically could never pay out. Every day you wake up, and every day you think “this will be the day that the bottom falls out,” and that sensation of freefalling you felt in 2008, if you were old enough to remember it, forms like a lead ball in your stomach.</p><p>This is not to say that there was some golden era in which the markets were ever ethical–the average 401k or pension quietly finances pure evil–but there was a degree of plausible deniability diffused in the market. Private equity, crypto, and the AI bubble have made those realities increasingly harder to ignore, and now everything is gambling to some degree. And now prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket let you bet on the outcomes of everything <a href="https://www.404media.co/unauthorized-edit-to-ukraines-frontline-maps-point-to-polymarkets-war-betting/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>including war</u></a> with little to no oversight. There’s literally a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzXFURkcCt4&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>grotesque Kalshi ad</u></a> with roughly the premise as this game made with enthusiastic generative AI slop aliens and zero self awareness. Given how supremely warped the world we live in is, how much worse is it, really, to short a baby?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Darrington Press has announced a new board game set in the world of Exandria. The new board game, <em>A Familiar Find</em>, is all about the loyal animal companions going on an adventure on behalf of their summoner.</p><h2>Critical Role's <em>A Familiar Find</em> Board Game Announcement</h2><p>According to an official <a href="https://darringtonpress.com/afamiliarfind/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> on Darrington Press' website, A Familiar Find is a fast-paced strategic card game. In the game, players take on the roles of magical familiars charged with an important task by their arcane master.&nbsp;</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/a-familiar-find-card-screenshot.jpg?itok=Ewl2J80l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="1200">

  </picture><p>That task is to find rare magical ingredients across the land of Exandria. To that end, you will explore ever-shifting magical locations, seek and collect magical components, and try to stay one step ahead of rivals attempting to sabotage you. Those rivals will set traps, call your bluff, and attempt to ruin any strategies you implement. Thankfully, you can utilize your own wits and magical spells to vex them as well.</p><p><em>A Familiar Find</em> is designed for up to four players. Each copy of the game contains a rulebook, over 84 Arcane Cards, 13 Location Cards which contain various game-changing effects, and ten playable familiars complete with their own unique character boards. The first player to either collect a full set of ingredients or three Astral Essence cards is declared the winner.</p><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/critical-role-campaign-4-episode-1-review-fascinating-narrative-frame-glorious" rel="nofollow">Critical Role</a> fans may recognize a few of the playable options. They include Trinket, the armored bear from Campaign 1 and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/legend-of-vox-machina-season-3-review-darker-season-of-dd-twists" rel="nofollow"><em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em></a>, the Wildfire Spirit Monkey, Mister, and the reanimated rat Pate de Rolo are from Campaign 3.</p><p>Curiously, <em>A Familiar Find</em> doesn't feature any companions from Campaign 2.

It's another day, another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> dev vlog, this time one with a big focus on multiplayer. This ability to play with, heaven forbid, other people is one that developer Unknown Worlds very much understands is not for everyone, given the first game's big focus on isolation and ruffing it yourself. So, this vlog is all about explaining why you don't need to worry if you like to go solo. And also to show off a dive elevator.
</p>
<p>
In the video, lead engineer Jon Bjarnason noted how the very first internal demos the studio held only a few weeks after development were multiplayer, and that "every single feature that we made since then has been multiplayer capable." But, as design lead Anthony Gallegos explained, "The important distinction there is that any part of the game isn't going to require cooperative play. If I want to come along and bring a friend, they can totally participate with me in every moment along the way. We never wanted to encroach on someone's game that just is like, 'I want to play solo.'"

Essentially, co-op is entirely optional through every aspect of the game, it's just that every aspect of the game also has co-op in mind. This stretches right through to things like animations too, as now other people can see your whole human body, so limbs and the like need to work properly, something that Brandt Beach, who I'm making sure to mention by name because it's funny his name is Beach and he's working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>, says is more work, but worthwhile.
</p><p>
There's also that snazzy new dive elevator, which is as literal as it sounds, a fancy doohicky you hold onto to help you dive down deep into the depths. "The Dive Elevator just adds a lot to co-op in general," lead gameplay engineer Adrian Lopez-Mobilia explains. "I realized that it would be really cool to be able to both go with friends on it, but also to be able to attach stuff to it. So, as we started developing the prototype we realised that that would make it even more meaningful. Be able to load it up and then shoot it down to the depths and then come back with all the stuff you collected down there."
</p>
<p>
It also sounds like they're trying to make playing with your friends as easy as possible, as you'll have the option to invite folks to play either through your platform of choice's friends list, or through an in-game one for cross-play functionality. A big emphasis was placed on being able to play the game anywhere too, as a whole team is apparently devoted just to optimising the game for handheld devices like the Steam Deck apparently.
</p>
<p>
It's worth noting that Subnautica 2 is also a slightly contentious game at the moment, given that the ex-leads of the game are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-publishers-krafton-accuse-ousted-bosses-of-abandoning-duties-and-now-those-ex-leads-are-suing">suing publisher Krafton</a> after being ousted from the company, ultimately leading <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-studio-unknown-worlds-are-now-suing-their-former-execs-for-stealing-docs-and-sharing-them-with-the-press">Unknown Worlds themselves to sue these former execs in kind</a>. A tad messy! So throw an appropriate amount of caution to the wind here.
