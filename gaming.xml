            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher NIS America has announced <em>Disgaea Mayhem</em>, which, as the name suggests, is a spinoff of the popular <em>Disgaea </em>strategy RPG series, and it's coming to PC and consoles this summer.</p><p>As revealed via a new trailer, <em>Disgaea Mayhem </em>will land on PC, PS5, and both Switch machines sometime later this year (sorry, Xbox owners). It marries <em>Disgaea</em>'s signature silly style with more kinetic and action-foucsed gameplay.</p><p>Per the newly-released Steam page for <em>Disgaea Mayhem</em>, the game will cast you as N.A., a mercenary hired by a princess in order to help her, erm, eat as much sweet stuff as she can. It's classic off-the-wall <em>Disgaea </em>fare.</p><figure role="group">

<p><em>Disgaea Mayhem </em>will offer seven different classes for you to play as, each based on classic <em>Disgaea </em>weapons like swords, guns, and axes, and you can switch between them at any time you like.</p><p>This being <em>Disgaea</em>, you can, of course, also look forward to two series staples in <em>Mayhem</em>: absurd grind and ludicrously over-the-top damage numbers.</p><p>NIS America says the game will feature the chance to "grind levels, improve your equipment, and...make the numbers go up until you're dealing a million damage with every hit", which sounds like <em>Disgaea</em> alright.</p><p>You can take a look at the debut trailer for <em>Disgaea Mayhem</em>, which shows off what you can expect from this new spinoff's gameplay (as well as its classic art style), right here.</p>
<p>Being a spinoff, <em>Disgaea Mayhem </em>isn't part of the mainline <em>Disgaea </em>series; the latest core title to be released is still <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disgaea-7-vows-of-virtueless" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d70f97e5-48e0-402f-bef0-abea488c70a0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">2023's seventh installment</a>, although judging by the past release cadence for the series, we shouldn't be too far off <em>Disgaea 8</em>.</p><p>In the meantime, however, you can check out <em>Disgaea Mayhem </em>when it lands on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4402250/Disgaea_Mayhem/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and both Switch 2 and Switch this summer.

              <p><span>Tomorrow is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-day-30-anniversary-go-anime-cosplay-stream-2000672824"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s 30th anniversary</span></a><span>, and The Pokémon Company is going all out to commemorate the big date. There’s a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-where-when-to-watch-generation-10-switch-2000671968"><span>livestream tomorrow</span></a><span> to reveal upcoming projects, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-30-anniversary-art-logos-every-pokedex-serebii-2000672767"><span>new art for all 1000+ monsters circulating social media</span></a><span>, and anniversary merchandise that includes throwbacks to the past 30 years of history. Now that we’ve seen some of that merch, y’all, I need the black-and-white Pikachu plush made to look like the little guy’s original </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-red-blue-yellow-green-review-game-boy-switch-2000671975"><span>Game Boy</span></a><span> sprite.</span></p> <p><a href="https://game.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/2088734.html"><i><span>Game Watch</span></i></a><span> attended an anniversary event in Japan that showcased several of the upcoming merchandise collaborations, and it’s unclear at the moment how many of these are coming stateside, but we might hear more in the next day or so when Pokémon Day actually begins. Some standouts include charms and art based on every box art from the mainline games, a line of camping equipment with the original Kanto starters on them, and the previously announced Fat Pikachu plush that harkens back to the mouse’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fat-pikachu-chunkachu-pokemon-30th-plush-2000661861"><span>original round design</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>The real winner is the pixelated Pikachu plush that carries all the distinct features the mouse had in the original games, long before it was morphed into the universal design we see today. The plush is missing the iconic yellow and red color scheme because it’s made to look like the critter’s sprite on the original Game Boy, which only displayed games in a monochrome color scheme. But it also has some features that have been phased out of the character’s design over the years, such as the colored paws and grey circle on the belly, though those elements have been retained by Raichu, its evolution. God, I shudder to think of how much that is going to cost on import and resale sites. Please come to the States, grey Pikachu.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/26/interview-modding-is-coming-to-rennsport-but-how-will-it-work-with-consoles/</link>
            <guid>1447042</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Modding has been around for almost as long as video games themselves, as other curious developers, hackers and fans keenly delving into game code and assets to twist them in new directions. For racing games, the most obvious mods add cars and tracks alongside the existing roster shipped by developers, and the most active modding scenes have been built up around more sim-minded racing games on PC. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/rennsport">Rennsport</a> is about to ask “why not on console too?”</p>
<p>As part of the game’s roadmap through 2026 and beyond, Competition Company is going to open up modding to the community, releasing tools to first allow track creation and eventually cars and gameplay modding too. The distinguishing factor between this game and its rivals will be that, in addition to still allowing custom mods on PC, they also plan to bring mod distribution in-game and expose them to console players as well.</p>
<p>“I think it does a lot for making it feel more seamlessly integrated into the game,” said Senior Lead Technical Artist, Joel Szlema. “For me, it’s a difference if I upload a track and next week it might just show up on the front page as, like, the next race coming up, right? That feels more like you’re directly contributing to the game, rather than put something up that people might find, might download. So it feels very connected in the fact that it’s just directly goes into the game.”</p>
<p>That’s potentially very exciting. Rennsport already features some community-created tracks that have been licensed by Competition Company to be a part of the game – Crest da Cauras, Orchard Road Street Circuit and the upcoming Kuala Lumpur Street Circuit. However, opening up modding and track distribution more freely will hopefully open the taps for a bunch of further tracks to be introduced, and then be easily discovered and featured in the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kuala Lumpur Street Circuit | NEW TRACK" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xV0UqpasGdw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Joel presented how Rennsport’s modding tools will start off, combining Unreal Engine’s SDK with custom tools created by Competition Company, providing a rounded suite of tools to create new tracks for the game. This will initially be opened up to a small group of creators this summer, before the net is widened in a closed beta, and with a full release pencilled in for the end of 2026. After that, they will turn their attentions to modding cars and modding gameplay, though not necessarily in that order.</p>

<p>Tracks are an easier starting point for Rennsport to tackle on multiple levels, especially when bearing in mind that mods will also be coming to console. Content needs to be moderated to appear on console, there are limitations to how things can be modded, and that’s all before any kind of licensing issues with car makers and track owners wanting to protect their IP.</p>
<div id="attachment_469268"><p id="caption-attachment-469268">The Kuala Lumpur circuit is a community-created track coming to Rennsport soon, and this could just be the start</p></div>
<p>“Once the tracks are done, we will definitely look into probably gameplay next. I feel like gameplay is something that it also naturally goes into, because if you can do tracks and you can you can put a contest config on the track, then you can already do quite a lot of like different experiences, right? Because we do have some tracks that are not like closed loop tracks, so you could do something that looks like a rally stage, for example.”</p>
<p>“And with that, you could naturally, I mean, it’s kind of a stupid example, but I always bring the example of an obstacle course. You could just make a level that looks like an obstacle course, and it’s A-to-B and it’s still like whoever finishes first finishes first, but you’ve kind of created a different game modes just by making a different track with some gameplay rules.”</p>
<div id="attachment_469280"><p id="caption-attachment-469280">Placing obstacles or making A-to-B races could be the foundations for new gameplay mods.</p></div>
<p>With an eye to wider gameplay mods, Joel said, “So in theory, there’s a lot of things you can do [on console]. The only thing is that you have to [make it] safe, that nobody does, like, code injection on console to hack the console or whatever. What you can do is you can create basically like an API, or you can, for example, if you have a spawn point in game, you can build a spawn point like a modular block, you programme it, and then people can like place it in a level, right? Or they can build stuff around it. So you have to do, like, defined building blocks that people can combine to make new logic out of it.</p>
<p>“Unreal has blueprints where you can, I don’t know if you know, you can programme with nodes or you place a node, like spawn something and press something and you can connect them. And I don’t think we would be able to allow people to use that freely, but if we make our own predefined building blocks, then you could potentially do that.”</p>

<p>One of the major changes to the modding community over the past decade, is that modders are able to ask for some kind of payment, whether it’s through their own subscriptions or one-off payments. Surely that can’t mesh with Rennsport having an in-game browser on consoles, though, can it? Those would need to be free to download?</p>
<p>“No,” said co-founder and co-CEO Marco Ujhasi. “So there is a difference for the console about the certification process, if it’s paid or unpaid content, that’s true. […] The general principle is when something is created, you can decide if it’s free or if it’s paid, and there is a way on any platform. [It can be] more or less complicated and it’s like with many topics, sometimes it gets so complicated, it’s not worth it, but technically possible.</p>
<p>“So what we are doing at the moment is, first and foremost, enabling the system and make it make it a fun thing to use. Because I think this is missing a bit, that it really feels like it’s part of the game. It’s not just about bringing the content in, but also what you can do with the content. Is it part of any progression system?</p>
<p>“And for us, it’s important that it’s really part of the whole game and the monetising? Honestly speaking, this is a side thing in that. But so many creatives sitting out there and talent and so on, and they do so much great stuff while we shouldn’t help them to make it in a more appealing appealing way. Why not?”</p>

<p>There’s still a lot of aspects of modding and distribution for Competition Company to really hammer out, I feel, but the core principles of having an in-game mod browser and ways to integrate them into the wider game more seamlessly for console is really an exciting one. Alongside the general roadmap of new cars and tracks being made by the team, modding is absolutely an aspect to keep an eye on as they evolve the tools and systems over the coming years.</p>

<figure data-uuid="e1b9a45f76984"><a title="3DS Family" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e1b9a45f76984/3ds-family.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Gosh, the passage of time is a nasty one, eh? There we are just trying to enjoy our day, when all of a sudden, <em>BOOM</em>, we're reminded that today is the 15th anniversary of the 3DS.</p>
<p>Yes, the 3DS, that console which, in our minds, is still a relatively young whippersnapper, was released on this day (26th February) <em>fifteen years ago</em> in 2011.</p>
<p>It's a system that many of us here at Nintendo Life still hold dearly in our hearts, and one that we return to with a surprising frequency, even though we've got <em>two</em> newer consoles from the House of Mario at our disposal. But there's something about the software lineup that we just can't knock. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/tomodachi_life">Tomodachi Life</a>? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/legend_of_zelda_a_link_between_worlds">A Link Between Worlds</a>? <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/animal_crossing_new_leaf">Animal Crossing: New Leaf</a>? Talk about bangers.</p><div><figure data-videoid="rsFcYrj6oHY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsFcYrj6oHY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytrsFcYrj6oHY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rsFcYrj6oHY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rsFcYrj6oHY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f132juxvhm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>843k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>But we're not here to discuss the software this time (we've got our list of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/50-best-nintendo-3ds-games-of-all-time">50 Best 3DS Games Of All Time</a> for that), we want to talk about the system itself. More specifically, we want to talk about its weird and wonderful family.</p>
<p>Because yes, while the 3DS is a system in its own right, it spawned a whole family of models to choose between. These were released every couple of years between 2011 and 2017, and included everything from bigger screens to additional control stick 'nubs'.</p>
<p>As the OG system celebrates a decade and a half since launch, we thought it'd be only right to remind you about each model's quirks before we pit them head-to-head in a poll to decide, conclusively, which one is the best (or which one is your favourite, at the very least).</p>
<p>So, here they all are, in release order.</p>
<h2>3DS</h2>
<figure data-uuid="322f2411bfd81"><a title="3DS" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/322f2411bfd81/3ds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>First released:</strong> 26th February 2011</p>
<p>The first model really was a beauty, wasn't it? The big selling point was that autostereoscopic 3D screen, of course, but let's not forget the internal and external cameras for all of those free AR games, a particularly slippery circle pad, and the trio of Select / Home / Start buttons that never <em>really</em> felt like buttons. <em>Magical</em>.</p>
<h2>3DS XL</h2>
<figure data-uuid="fa6500028ef05"><a title="3DS XL" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fa6500028ef05/3ds-xl.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>First released:</strong> 28th July 2012</p>
<p>Do it again... but bigger. Just a year and a half after the 3DS first appeared on the market, Nintendo launched the XL model. It had all the same features as its predecessor, but with a 124mm screen, compared to the old model's 90mm.</p>
<h2>2DS</h2>
<figure data-uuid="273f5b0adf4de"><a title="2DS" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/273f5b0adf4de/2ds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>First released</strong>: 12th October 2013</p>
<p>Another year, another 3DS. Only, this one <em>wasn't</em> 3D. Aside from being the ugliest-looking handheld Nintendo had released in a hot minute, the 2DS removed the family's trademark gimmick (and its internal stereo speakers) for a cheaper, <em>non</em>-autostereoscopic model.</p>
<p>A lot of people didn't get on with the 3D, so its removal is fair enough. The removal of the clamshell design, however, is a little harder to overlook.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/3ds/related-articles:156642 @ 1772118625 -->
<h2>New Nintendo 3DS</h2>
<figure data-uuid="4738e1324284a"><a title="New Nintendo 3DS" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4738e1324284a/new-nintendo-3ds.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>First released:</strong> 25th October 2014</p>
<p>The 'New' model felt like a big step up. This boasted all the same features as the OG system, but with a bunch of fresh bells and whistles thrown in to improve the play experience. We're talking face tracking for an improved 3D effect, automatic screen brightness adjustment, longer battery life, bonus ZL/ZR buttons, a 'C-stick' nub, amiibo support... the list goes on.</p>
<p>Throw in a more powerful processor, swappable faceplates, some exclusive games, and Virtual Console titles, and Nintendo was onto a winner of an upgrade.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/3ds/related-articles:172942 @ 1772118625 -->
<h2>New Nintendo 3DS XL</h2>
<figure data-uuid="6a7e526be8b13"><a title="New Nintendo 3DS XL" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6a7e526be8b13/new-nintendo-3ds-xl.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>First released:</strong> 11th October 2014</p>
<p>Launching in the same window as the smaller 'New' option, this model packed in all of the features outlined above, but, once again, with a 124mm screen to boot.</p>
<h2>New Nintendo 2DS XL</h2>
<figure data-uuid="eff0fdb60e904"><a title="New Nintendo 2DS XL" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/eff0fdb60e904/new-nintendo-2ds-xl.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>First released:</strong> 15th June 2017</p>
<p>The final member of the 3DS family actually launched after the Switch generation was already up and running. This model supported many of the same features as its 'New XL' counterpart, but with a new home button (shifted to the left of the screen), an updated SD Card and cartridge placement at the front of the system's base, and a little cart cover, vaguely reminiscent of the Switch. Naturally, this one dropped the 3D option, too.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, we learned that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-splinter-cell-far-cry-veteran-assassins-creed-hexe-creative-director-has-left-ubisoft/">Clint Hocking</a></strong>, the creative director on <strong>Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory</strong>, <strong>Far Cry 2,</strong> <strong>Watch Dogs: Legion</strong>, and most recently, the creative director behind the upcoming <strong>Assassin's Creed Hexe</strong>, had left <strong>Ubisoft</strong>. The newly named head of content for Assassin's Creed and former <strong>Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</strong> creative director, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-taps-senior-assassins-creed-black-flag-devs-to-lead-assassins-creed-future/">Jean Guesdon</a></strong>, is stepping in to fill his role on the project, which, according to a reliable Ubisoft insider, is showing a lot of promise within Ubisoft.</p>



<p>So much so that it's even the project that "<em><strong>everyone</strong></em>" across the company is looking to work on "<em>because of <strong>how good it's shaping up to be</strong></em>." The insider in question who made that comment is <a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/2026713095071047980">Tom Henderson</a>, who noted it alongside Insider-Gaming's coverage of Hocking's departure. </p>



<p>"<em>Some folk will be wary of this change</em>," Henderson writes, "<em>but Assassin's Creed Hexe is the one project that everyone at Ubisoft wants to work on because of how good it's shaping up to be</em>."</p>

<p>So far, we know very little about Assassin's Creed Hexe. It was<a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-project-red-japan-project-hexe-witchcraft-infinity-hub-detail/"> announced in 2022</a> alongside a slew of upcoming titles for the series, and in the time since, all we have to go on about what to expect from the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-hexe-magic-powers-possession-fear-system/">are a few rumours</a>. Back in 2024, we heard that <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-infinity-live-servies-assassins-creed-red-hexe-in-2026/">it had been pushed into <strong>2026</strong></a>, but after Ubisoft's <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">"<em><strong>major reset</strong></em>"</a> that was revealed last month, it could have easily been one of the projects that was pushed back further while Ubisoft works through this transition.</p>



<p>Regardless, Henderson's record when it comes to reporting on Ubisoft lends a lot of weight to his comments. Whether you're more pessimistic and figure that 'everyone' at Ubisoft wants to work on Hexe because they see it as a life raft to not get laid off during a tumultuous time for the company, or because they think it might be one of the best games Ubisoft has in the works right now, neither could be possible if it wasn't, as Henderson says, "<em>shaping up</em>" so well.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll hear more about Hexe soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Highguard Mode Nixes Looting And Ratchets Up The Action As It Hangs On For Dear Life]]></title>

            <guid>1447027</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Highguard</em> is changing up its menu in what could be <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-layoffs-dead-game-awards-live-service-2000668192">a last-ditch effort</a> to gain some traction as its player count continues to dwindle. A new mode dispenses with the looting phase entirely and will just have players raiding each others’ bases back and forth, nixing the phases that bored some players back at launch.</p> <p>Here’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4128260?updates=true&amp;emclan=103582791475413365&amp;emgid=518613785064243442">Wildlight Entertainment’s description</a> of Raid Rush which goes live later today as part of the hero shooter’s latest update:</p> <div data-block="true" data-editor="66hhr" data-offset-key="dmg9h-0-0"> <blockquote> <p><span data-offset-key="dmg9h-0-0">In Raid Rush, 2 teams of 5 players will take turns attacking and defending their bases with no pesky looting phase in between.</span></p> </blockquote> </div> <div data-block="true" data-editor="66hhr" data-offset-key="8iip3-0-0"> <blockquote> <p><span data-offset-key="8iip3-0-0">Instead, select your base and use Trader Flynn to upgrade your weapons and equipment in a round based format. After each round, you’ll switch sides between attacking and defending. Your base walls and generators will be repaired, and you’ll be rewarded some Vesper to spend at the Trader, who will have different offers after every round. And don’t worry about buying armor – everyone has the same armor, and it will escalate in rarity as the rounds progress.</span></p> </blockquote> </div> <p data-offset-key="8iip3-0-0">Raid Rush will be an interesting experiment to see if <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646"><em>Highguard</em></a> can be more appealing to players if they don’t have to wrap their heads around all of the map exploration, looting, and capture-the-flag mechanics in the first two thirds of each match. Personally, those are my favorite parts. One of the best things about <em>Highguard</em> are its mounts and those won’t be a part of Raid Rush at all.</p>

 <p data-offset-key="8iip3-0-0">The new update will also re-balance a few items and weapons. The Revive Amulet now gives a much smaller speed boost to the process of resurrecting fallen allies, and the Vanguard, by far the most dominant rifle in the game, has had its long-range damage taken down a notch. Similarly, the Dynasty, which has some wicked recoil, will now do increased damage to make up for the unwieldiness of it.</p> <h2 data-offset-key="8iip3-0-0"><i>Highguard</i> is hanging on by a thread</h2> <p data-offset-key="8iip3-0-0">If you play <em>Highguard</em> multiple times a week like I still do, the balance changes are good ones and the new mode will be interesting to try out, even if it’s fundamentally not what I want out of the game. But most people who gave it a shot at launch aren’t playing anymore. This week’s update is another incremental update that does little to address the lack of items and heroes the game needs to in order to feel more fully featured.</p>

 <p data-offset-key="8iip3-0-0">The game’s concurrent numbers on Steam have continued to fall off a cliff. <em>Highguard</em> started February at 15,000 concurrent players daily on PC. It’s now bobbing around just 500. The game seems to be doing better on console. Mat Piscatella shared with <em>Kotaku</em> that according to the Circana Player Engagement Tracker, <em>Highguard</em> was the 34th most played game on PS5 in the U.S. for the week ending February 14 based on weekly active users.</p>

 <p data-offset-key="8iip3-0-0">Anecdotally, I’ve never waited more than a few seconds during matchmaking on console, so despite all of the grim forecasts, it certainly <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-update-roadmap-servers-discord-2000670633">doesn’t feel like a dead game on console yet</a>. I would love for <em>Highguard</em> to recover somehow because, despite its shortcomings, I’ve been having a great time playing it. But games in its predicament need tons of runway or a major momentum-shifting boost, and so far <em>Highguard</em> doesn’t have either of those.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New York Attorney General Suing Valve Over Loot Boxes]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/ny-attorney-general-valve-loot-box-lawsuit/</link>
            <guid>1447021</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>On Wednesday, New York State Attorney General Letitia James <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2026/attorney-general-james-sues-game-developer-promoting-illegal-gambling-through?ref=aftermath.site"><u>announced</u></a> that the state is suing Valve, alleging that games like <em>Counter-Strike, Team Fortress, </em>and <em>Dota </em>“enable gambling by enticing users to pay for the chance to win a rare virtual item of significant monetary value.” The state is seeking to “permanently stop Valve from promoting gambling features in its games, disgorge all ill-gotten gains, and pay fines for violating New York’s laws.”</p><p>Most forms of gambling are <a href="https://nysba.org/the-state-of-new-york-gambling/?srsltid=AfmBOorpNzVkpIq9_6-qDRHWmILeltEj5u6ON534TOb-wqpRgSnZJmRq&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>banned</u></a> in New York State outside of certain exceptions (such as, depressingly, <a href="https://gaming.ny.gov/sports-wagering?ref=aftermath.site"><u>sports betting</u></a>). The state’s <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/court-filings/new-york-v-valve-corporation-complaint-2026.pdf?ref=aftermath.site"><u>lawsuit</u></a> alleges that “Valve has knowingly engaged in a variety of conduct that materially aids gambling activity, including creating and establishing loot boxes, maintaining systems that enable users to open loot boxes, and soliciting and inducing users to open loot boxes. Valve also has knowingly profited from gambling activity through the sale of keys and loot boxes pursuant to an agreement or understanding whereby Valve participates in the proceeds of gambling.”</p><p>The lawsuit spends a lot of time explaining exactly how loot boxes in Valve games work, highlighting their design (“The spinning display and the accompanying sound that plays when a user opens a Valve loot box are examples of gameplay experiences similar to those employed by slot machines”) and the way this presentation can encourage players to keep opening loot boxes. The AG’s office is particularly concerned about the ways this could entice young people–whom it claims make up a large portion of the user base for the games in question–to gamble, with potentially harmful results.</p><p>“Loot boxes, like other forms of gambling, can lead to addiction and result in real harm. But Valve’s loot boxes are particularly pernicious because they are popular among children and adolescents, who are lured into opening loot boxes by the prospect of winning expensive virtual items that convey status in the gaming world,” the suit reads.</p><p>The AG’s office also notes the ecosystem of creators on Twitch and YouTube who make videos devoted solely to opening Valve loot boxes, with the suit reading that “Opening loot boxes has become a subject of interest, distinct from playing Valve’s games… [S]ome well-known streamers have created videos and channels dedicated solely to opening Counter-Strike weapons cases.”</p><p>The suit details the various ways Valve makes money off of loot boxes. This includes Valve selling keys for loot boxes themselves, earning commissions on skin sales on Valve’s Steam Community Market, and by Valve designing “the Steam platform to facilitate the purchase and sale of virtual items on third-party marketplaces,” with the suit alleging that “Valve has long understood that third-party marketplaces are important to the economy of the virtual items it has created. By providing a means for users to sell their virtual items for cash, these marketplaces motivate users to purchase keys from Valve in the hopes of opening a loot box and winning a high-value item they can cash in. More loot box openings also means more virtual items will be sold, which drives transactions and Valve commissions on the Steam platform itself.”&nbsp;</p><p>The suit alleges that players also make money selling skins on Valve’s and third-party marketplaces, as well as through this delightful tidbit:</p><blockquote>Steam users also can readily convert virtual items to cash by purchasing Steam hardware and then reselling it off platform. Indeed, an OAG investigator did so, converting a Counter-Strike skin called a “Stiletto Knife” to $180 by: (a) selling the skin on the Steam Community Market for Steam Wallet funds, (b) using the Steam Wallet funds received from the sale of the skin to purchase a Steam Deck, and (c) selling the Steam Deck for $180 in cash at a store that buys and sells electronics.</blockquote><p>While the games themselves “have proven to be remarkably lucrative for Valve, even though the games have been free to play for years,” the suit reads, “Valve has managed this feat by pioneering an alternative model for monetizing its games: gambling.”</p><p>Loot boxes have long fallen out of favor in most games, with many games having previously transitioned to more transparent <a href="https://www.economicsonline.co.uk/all/the-history-of-the-battle-pass-and-its-impact-on-microtransactions.html/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>battle passes</u></a> in the last decade, following controversy such as the boxes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-2s-loot-box-controversy-expl/1100-6455155/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Star Wars Battlefront II</u></em></a> and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/loot-box-state-of-play-2024-another-trip-around-the-world-of-regulation?ref=aftermath.site"><u>global changes to laws</u></a> governing them. (Brazil most recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-campaign-against-predatory-in-game-practices-takes-a-step-forward-in-brazil-as-president-lula-bans-loot-boxes-targeted-at-under-18s?ref=aftermath.site"><u>banned their sale</u></a> to people under 18.) However, some games are also experimenting with them again, with <a href="https://www.crossplay.news/p/fortnite-is-adding-loot-boxes?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Fortnite</u></em></a> introducing a version of them to some in-game islands, alongside <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/in-island-transactions-restrictions-in-fortnite?ref=aftermath.site"><u>rules</u></a> governing their availability and presentation.&nbsp;</p><p>“Illegal gambling can be harmful and lead to serious addiction problems, especially for our young people,” James is quoted as saying in the suit’s press release. “Valve has made billions of dollars by letting children and adults alike illegally gamble for the chance to win valuable virtual prizes. These features are addictive, harmful, and illegal, and my office is suing to stop Valve’s illegal conduct and protect New Yorkers.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Skate </em>studio Full Circle has been hit by layoffs, and the way that parent company EA has chosen to announce those layoffs will probably come as no surprise if you're familiar with the standard corporate line on these things.</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/an-update-from-fullcircle" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">announcement post</a> on the official <em>Skate </em>website euphemistically titled "<em>Skate</em>'s Next Chapter", Full Circle says it is "transforming as a studio" and "reshaping Full Circle to better support <em>Skate</em>'s long-term future".</p><p>Wouldn't you know it, the way in which Full Circle is achieving this is by laying off staff. It's not clear how many staff members are affected, but the studio says "some roles will be impacted" and that the employees being let go are "talented colleagues and friends", blah blah blah.</p><figure role="group">

<p>In closing, Full Circle says its "commitment to <em>Skate</em>...remains strong", and that it wants to "move faster, listen more closely, and deliver consistently" for players.</p><p>I'm sure I'm not the only one, but I'm finding this kind of corpo-speak increasingly tiresome. The bottom line, to me, seems to be that <em>Skate </em>is now underperforming hugely in terms of player retention, and the devs on the ground at Full Circle are first in the firing line.</p><p>A quick look at <em>Skate</em>'s <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3354750/charts/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SteamDB numbers</a> (which, admittedly, don't take console players into account) shows a 24-hour player peak of 2,306 at time of writing, but considering the game enjoyed over 130,000 players at release, that's a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/highguard-developer-wildlight-reportedly-lays-off-most-staff" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="662d78d2-0c4f-4bac-903f-7998daba8b76" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Highguard</em>-level fall from grace</a>.</p><p>Couple that with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-map-paywall-season-3" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b3c8ee76-5e12-4b1b-a3ba-92c23f811a6f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">recent decision</a> to hide <em>Skate</em>'s first map expansion behind a paywall (technically, at any rate), and it looks like <em>Skate </em>is on a bit of a downturn. Still, I'm sure the people being let go at Full Circle are the ones responsible for the decisions that led the studio here, right? Right?</p>
<p>If you do want to see what all of this is in aid of, you can play <em>Skate </em>right now for free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3354750/skate/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/skate/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/skate-game-preview/9phf9k5q6zlz" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox</a>, although for how much longer that'll be true is another question.

<p>Crimson Desert looks fabulous, meaning Crimson Desert character creation tools are a given, a certainty. But you already know it isn’t necessarily the case because you’re here right now, so read on for a full explainer and information on other playable characters.</p>



<p>You only have to look around most outlets in the world to see how much hype and praise there is for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/crimson-desert/" id="888" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crimson Desert</a>. It has that <em>something</em> extra that other open-world RPGs are missing. From the outside, it seems to have everything, which is where the topic of character creation tools comes in.</p>











<figure><figcaption>Not much room for tweaking. Credit to Pearl Abyss</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s been confirmed that Crimson Desert does not have any sort of character creation tools or setup at the start of the game, which means you pretty much need to stick to Kliff’s default appearance.</strong></p>

<p>You won’t be seeing any humorous Crimson Desert creations online on social media. There won’t be Kliffs with giant heads, wonky noses, or hilariously oversized ears. Pearl Abyss has decided to keep the main character’s features intact, and it does mean you won’t spend your first hour of the game in a menu fiddling with sliding bars, buttons, and other customization features.</p>



<p>However, Crimson Desert doesn’t completely remove all creative liberties and freedom. In-depth looks at the game and interviews show that the RPG has Barbers and other world amenities to slightly tweak the appearance of Kliff and even your horse.</p>







<h2 id="h-every-playable-character-in-crimson-desert">Every Playable Character In Crimson Desert</h2>



<p><strong>Crimson Desert has three playable characters throughout your journey: Kliff, Damiane, and Oongka.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Kliff </strong>is the starting playable character, and can use all sorts of weapons and skills to inflict damage. He’s the most well-rounded of the three, and probably the one people will gravitate to the most out of familiarity. </p>

</ul>



<p>Another one of the Greymanes is <strong>Damiane</strong>, and she is the agile warrior of the trio—expect ranged combat and strategic repositioning to be her forte.</p>



<p>Finally, <strong>Oongka </strong>is the brute, the powerhouse, the metaphorical bull of the group. You already know how he’s going to play: Big weapons, heavy hits, tank-like movement, and an emphasis on see enemy hurt enemy!</p>

            <p>More drastic changes are being made to Highguard as developer Wildlight desperately tries to hold onto a playerbase leaking through its fingers like water.</p>
<p>Yesterday Highguard recorded a high-point of only 694 concurrent players, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/#1m">according to stat-tracker SteamDB</a>. This number has been steadily declining throughout February, a month Highguard began with approximately 13,000 daily concurrent players.</p>
<p>The latest effort to stem the drainage, and perhaps even reverse it, comes in the addition of a fast-paced game mode called Raid Rush, which arrives tomorrow, 27th February, 5pm GMT. This pits two teams of five against each other in base attack and defense, and does away with the faffy looting phase entirely.</p>
<p>During the match, teams alternate between attack and defence each round, bases will be automatically repaired and you don't need to buy armour (everyone will get the same armour and it will increase in rarity each round). The only admin you'll do is buy things from the Trader, if you want. It's basically all-out action. There are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/">various quality of life and balance fixes</a> alongside this.</p><p>Whether the Raid Rush update will affect Highguard's ominous predicament, I don't know, but I'm doubtful. With <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-reveals-one-final-character-trailer-ahead-of-its-server-slam-test-the-humble-rook">a public Marathon playtest</a> scheduled for this weekend, and likeminded hero shooters such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-havent-been-this-excited-about-overwatch-in-10-years">Overwatch resurgent</a>, there doesn't seem much air in the space to breathe. A more incisive question might be how long Highguard can hang on for.</p>
<p>Highguard was the show-closing announcement at The Game Awards in December, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-were-turned-into-a-joke-from-minute-one-fired-highguard-developer-reflects-on-games-ill-fated-launch-and-false-assumptions-after-game-awards-reveal">a suspicious silence followed that undermined confidence in the game</a>. Then, when the game was released, it struggled to convince. Wildlight quickly reacted by adding larger team modes to appease players, but by then the direction of travel, away from the game, seemed set. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/highguard-not-shutting-down-following-wildlight-layoffs-with-a-core-group-of-members-left-to-support-game">Wildlight underwent lay-offs as a result, though the team stoically insisted Highguard would live on</a>. But with only several hundred concurrent players a day, I don't know how long that's feasible for.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-red-blue-yellow-green-review-game-boy-switch-2000671975</link>
            <guid>1446985</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>The </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>franchise has undergone so many transformations since</span><i><span> Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Green </span></i><span>(</span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span> here in the States)</span> <span>launched in 1996 that these inaugural Game Boy games now feel almost like a period piece. The 8-bit visuals and somewhat archaic mechanics date the original games, but what is most fascinating about revisiting them 30 years later is being reminded that the world of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>has evolved just as much as any catchable critter does over the course of a playthrough.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Those original Game Boy games feel retro nowadays not just in their pixel art graphics and chiptune sounds, but in the way that the world within the games feels like it’s in a different, earlier era than it is in modern games like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span> or </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-indigo-disk-dlc-review-terapagos-1851100679"><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i></a><span>. As video games have become more advanced, the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>universe has developed along with it. The Kanto region of </span><i><span>Blue </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>is somewhat technologically advanced with its tiny Poké Ball gizmos capturing even massive monsters in machines, but by and large, this is the most grounded </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>has ever felt, and likely will ever feel again.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2>A simpler time with simpler struggles</h2> <p><span>The Pokédex you fill out with new data as you catch Pokémon hasn’t become a Rotom-possessed phone yet. The sluggish HM mechanic that requires you to teach Pokémon on your team traversal moves hasn’t been phased out in favor of simply riding monsters across large distances. And even the legendary creatures you find in the corners of its world don’t quite feel larger than life yet. It was a simpler time, one that was likely designed without any notion that it would persist for 30 years, expanding beyond a few freak experiments and urban legends into a world with a cosmic design at its center.</span></p> <p><span>Playing </span><i><span>Pokémon Red</span></i><span>, or any variation of those first-generation games, feels like opening a history text book and learning about how rough it was in the old days for those who set out on their </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>journey in the backseat of their parents’ car with the overhead lights on trying to angle their Game Boy just right. For some of us who grew up in that era, it’s an unsettling reminder that our past has become history, and only with time and by experiencing change firsthand can we learn just how much better we’ve got it now. Yeah, you can remake these games multiple times and let players journey through Kanto with a run button and colorful sprites, but there is a history here that even </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-fire-red-leaf-green-switch-pokemon-direct-price-2000671938"><i><span>FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen</span></i></a><span> can’t capture by putting players back in Pallet Town on a Game Boy Advance.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000671979" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000671979"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000671979">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Unchanged by the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-games-best-worst-part-scarlet-violet-red-blue-1850084491"><span>decades of Pokémania that would follow</span></a><span>,</span><i><span> Red</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span>’s unassuming nature means the world it offers up feels more mysterious, unknowable, and rewarding to uncover. In revisiting this game for the first time in over a decade, I decided to avoid checking databases like </span><i><span>Serebii</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>Bulbapedia</span></i><span> and just feel my way through it based on memory and vibes. I knew I needed to find a Pikachu in Viridian Forest before I headed out to win my eight gym badges, defeat the villainous Team Rocket, and become a regional champion, but beyond that, I tried to approach the game like I was playing it for the first time with no expectations or party-building goals, trying to recapture that same sense of discovery I felt in the ‘90s, though that’s easier said than done.</span></p>

 <p><span>30 years later, </span><i><span>Pokémon Red</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Blue </span></i><span>are immaculately designed games that are also burdened by years of iteration that make some of their more archaic parts insufferable to go back to. You can’t run through the small towns and metropolitan cities of Kanto like you can in </span><i><span>Ruby </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Sapphire</span></i><span>, the party-wide experience shared across your whole team of six is divided into fractions rather than universally given to every monster on your belt, and HMs, while an interesting way to make Pokémon feel like they exist beyond the simple turn-based battles they partake in, weigh down a party with mostly junk attacks that can’t be replaced and that’ll only be used outside of fights to traverse the world.</span></p>  <h2>As games have gotten better, so has the&nbsp;<em>Pokémon </em>world</h2> <p><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>has a weird quirk where it likes to add </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-photo-mode-selfie-roto-stick-1850834335"><span>quality-of-life updates diegetically</span></a><span>, with new features or fixes like sprinting only arriving because your character is given Running Shoes in </span><i><span>Ruby </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Sapphire</span></i><span> so they can do more than lightly jog through tall grass where wild Pokémon reside. The series isn’t merely building better games, it’s building a better, more efficient world with each new entry. The trade-off for these quality-of-life improvements is that some of the mystique has gone away as Game Freak has repeatedly pulled back the curtain and fans have made entire subcultures based around seeing what’s under the hood. Every mystery in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>universe has been documented in online databases, each attack interaction has been meticulously cataloged and rolled into the competitive meta, and there’s someone out there who’s learned how to manipulate stats and is ready to tell you why your favorite Pokémon isn’t viable in a hypothetical ranked match you’re not even signed up for.</span></p>

 <p><span>To know </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>more deeply doesn’t mean to love it less, but I think most people who are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-ken-sugimori-original-art-red-blue-gold-silver-1850352781"><span>nostalgic for old </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games</span></a><span> are less attached to the games themselves than the adventurous wonder they sparked inside of us at a younger age. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-red-blue-remake-logan-paul-firered-leafgreen-2000657176"><span>Fairweather fans who stopped playing </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>decades ago beg for another </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue </span></i><span>remake</span></a><span> like any adult pines for nostalgic media that beckons back to a time when the possibilities seemed endless. Even if </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue </span></i><span>are clunky by modern standards, its limitations gave you a lot of space to fill in as you journeyed through Kanto with your best friend by your side.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000671985" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000671985"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000671985">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Over 30 years, </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>has gone from the adventures you share secrets about with your friends on the playground to a corporate multimedia juggernaut propping up major esports events worldwide, and people have made entire businesses out of selling (or stealing) merchandise and cards where that once sounded like a pipe dream, the kind of thing your parents might jokingly suggest when you got a holographic card. It’s a phenomenon that has spawned over a hundred games, plenty of copycats, and over one thousand monsters. And it all began with </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span>, games whose seemingly timeless longevity has led to decades of iteration that makes them pretty annoying to go back to.</span></p> <p><span>Maybe you can’t go home again, but it’s important to remember where you came from. And even if there’s no turning back the clock, the foundations on which Game Freak and The Pokémon Company built an empire are still magical. Finding the Pokémon you’ve been looking for in random battles still feels special, and seeing them grow and overcome some of the toughest fights evokes feelings of pride in your furry friend and yourself for having overcome those challenges. As frustrating as HMs are, the mental image of my </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-raichu-x-2000652246"><span>Raichu</span></a><span> lighting up a dark cave with Flash as we try to find the exit makes him feel like more than just stats and a movepool for battles. Though future games would add more personalization, customization, and the ability to have your Pokémon follow you around the overworld, even in those original RPGs, Game Freak already understood that fostering connection between player and Pokémon was the secret sauce that made its games exceptional.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Pokémon Red</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Blue </span></i><span>are not the “peak” of the franchise as </span><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/genwunner"><span>genwunners</span></a><span> will have you believe, but they’re also not obsolete games only worth revisiting for the people who grew up with them. Every brick Game Freak and The Pokémon Company placed in building a decades-long legacy was on top of those first trips to Kanto. The franchise owes its longevity to the magic of </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span>, and even if parts of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>world look nothing like it anymore, there’s a reason its fundamentals are still the basis of even the series’ most experimental entries 30 years later.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-red-blue-yellow-green-review-game-boy-switch-2000671975]]></content:encoded>

<p>Crimson Desert is the long-awaited successor to Black Desert Online, and if you played the first one, it’s only natural that you want to know if Crimson Desert is a sequel, a prequel, or something else entirely.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-desert-online/" id="1332" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Desert Online</a> was an immediate hit, selling several hundred thousand copies. Now, in 2026, millions of players have registered, and the MMO has grossed billions. There’s a lot of love for Black Desert Online, which is why its direct connections to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/crimson-desert/" id="888" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crimson Desert</a> are fascinating for both old and new players.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-crimson-desert-a-prequel-to-black-desert-online">Is Crimson Desert A Prequel To Black Desert Online?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>New world. Credit to Pearl Abyss</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, despite being initially conceived as a prequel to Black Desert Online, Crimson Desert has dropped any notion of this idea.</strong></p>



<p>There’s your first big question about this story answered: Crimson Desert is not a prequel. Pearl Abyss has mentioned in interviews that the goal was to have Crimson Desert be another MMO, serving as a precursor to Black Desert Online.</p>

</ul>



<p>Abyss’ vision and scope for the project quickly expanded, which is why Crimson Desert is not a prequel.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-crimson-desert-a-sequel-to-black-desert-online">Is Crimson Desert A Sequel To Black Desert Online?</h2>



<p><strong>Crimson Desert is also not a direct sequel to Black Desert Online, and it’s closer to a spiritual successor than having any direct ties to the original game.</strong></p>



<p>There are many key differences between Crimson Desert and Black Desert Online—including its single-player and multiplayer focus—but the world itself is another big one.</p>

</ul>



<p>Crimson Desert is set in Pywel, whereas Black Desert Online was separated into several key and distinct regions. Aside from the setting being new, there are also new characters and a fresh narrative—underlining that while the game remains grounded in the same universe, this is a whole new game, and isn’t a sequel or prequel!</p>



<p>The main positive about this creative decision is that if you haven’t played Black Desert Online, you won’t need to play catch-up and can jump right in.</p>



<p>But if you have played Black Desert Online at any point, share your thoughts on the game and what you’re hoping for in Crimson Desert. You can do so via the usual place: The <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>



<hr>



<p>If you’re worried about delays or anything similar, you should be reassured by the news that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/crimson-desert-goes-gold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crimson Desert went Gold two months before release</a>.</p>

            <p>Skate developer Full Circle - which is part of EA's studio network - has announced "changes to [its] team structure", that will result in layoffs at the company.</p>
<p>Full Circle said it is "transforming" the studio, which will see it "reshaping to better support Skate's long-term future and focus the team on the things that matter most" to players. This transformation, it said, will include layoffs.</p>

<p>"The teammates affected are talented colleagues and friends who helped build the foundation of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skate-2025">Skate.</a> Their creativity and dedication are deeply ingrained in what players experience today," <a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/full-circle/news/an-update-from-fullcircle">Full Circle wrote in a blog post</a>, stressing the "decision is not a reflection of their impact and we're committed to supporting them through this transition".</p>
<p>As for Skate, which was released in September and proved especially popular on its first day <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/with-players-stuck-in-lengthy-queues-for-online-only-skate-those-who-made-it-in-are-comparing-its-bouncing-belly-flopping-traversal-to-mario-64">leading to lengthy queues</a>, work will still continue. "We look forward to working with you as we move faster, listen more closely, and deliver consistently for all of you," Full Circle said. "Our commitment to Skate, and to the millions of players who believe in it, remains strong."</p>
<p>The studio did not say how many Full Circle employees are affected by the this week's layoffs. Eurogamer has asked EA for a comment and will update when we know more.</p>
<p>"After an absolute age, EA's wheelie classic is back with great handling and a whole world of slightly jarring niceness," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skate-early-access-review">Skate early access review</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-phil-spencer-retires-sarah-bond-resigns-asha-sharma-takes-over-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sudden leadership change at the helm of <strong>Microsoft Gaming</strong> and <strong>Xbox</strong></a>, with <strong>Phil Spencer</strong> and <strong>Sarah Bond</strong> leaving their roles, has inevitably dominated the gaming industry conversation over the past few days. </p>



<p>While Phil Spencer's retirement was in the air (<a href="https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-retire-following-next-gen-xbox-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">despite Microsoft denying it just a few months ago</a>) after a long tenure, it was believed that Sarah Bond, who had been president of Xbox since October 2023, would be the natural successor. Bond has instead left the company, and a subsequent report by The Verge <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/sarah-bond-phil-spencer-no-one-liked-everything-is-an-xbox-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed that she was the main driver behind the controversial 'This Is an Xbox' marketing campaign</a></strong>, which fans didn't take well at all.</p>



<p>Microsoft has instead selected <strong>Asha Sharma</strong>, previously president of CoreAI, as the new CEO of the gaming division. It was another decision that has so far proven controversial; Xbox founder <strong>Seamus Blackley</strong>, who first thought of a Microsoft console and pitched it to Bill Gates over twenty-five years ago, openly <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-founder-thinks-new-xbox-ceo-will-sunset-division-ai-business/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared his opinion that Sharma will be Xbox's caretaker toward the eventual division's shutdown</a></strong> in favor of Microsoft's core businesses (chiefly AI-related).</p>



<p>His concerns are perhaps a little extreme, but certainly not entirely unfounded. <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/game-pass-500k-new-players-for-star?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=5141681&amp;post_id=189048025&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=4mhhpq&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a recent <strong>Alinea Analytics</strong> newsletter</a>, Head of Market Analysis <strong>Rhys Elliott</strong> mused that making games is more of an art than a business for a tech giant, adding that it's a "hits-driven" business with long development timelines. As such, while he believes that Sharma could perhaps do well as an executive <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-xbox-ceo-targeted-supposedly-using-ai-bot-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even without being a gamer</a>, Elliott adds that to really fly,<strong> Xbox should become its own independent entity</strong>: </p>



<p><em>Despite Sharma’s potential, <strong>the most logical long-term move is to spin Xbox off</strong>. It has Activision, Bethesda, and some of the most valuable IP in the business. A standalone Xbox would be free from the burden of matching the ROI of Azure or the ubiquity of Windows. It could return to its roots as a scrappier, game-focused competitor.</em></p>



<p><em>Sharma may well be the person to prepare Xbox for a transition away from Game Pass stagnation and ‘’this is an Xbox!’’, but for the brand to truly reclaim its 25-year legacy, <strong>it needs to stop being a footnote for Satya Nadella and become something of its own</strong>. It’s big enough.</em></p>



<p><em><strong>The best pathway forward, in my eyes, is to set Xbox free</strong>. Not by euthanising it, but by spinning it off. Gaming is in a better place with a strong, independent Xbox.</em></p>



<p>It's hard to imagine right now, but <strong>it could perhaps happen in the future</strong> if Microsoft opts to focus on surer bets than gaming. Of course, right now, it's more of a mental exercise than anything else, but what do you think of the possibility? Vote in the poll below and voice your thoughts in the comments.</p>

At the bottom of the list is the appropriately-named 'The Final Puzzle' — which is proving to be something of a headscratcher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/resident-evil-requiem/Final_Challenge_Puzzle_Solution">IGN has a work-in-progress guide to The Final Puzzle</a> where significant progress has been made through the challenge's convoluted early stages, which feel more complex than anything seen in any other Resident Evil game to date — and, seemingly, with still some way left to go.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Exactly what the final outcome or reward for the challenge might be remains unknown — but as the game continues its launch around the world, the hunt for answers here will undoubtedly become a major point of community focus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game's own description for the challenge offers only the vaguest of hints, to "Let the sweet pair hear the voice." The mechanics of the puzzle, or at least its first part, appear to rely on players picking up or examining a variety of objects throughout the game to determine fragments of a code.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Requiem's trail of clues relies on players picking up a specific severed hand which, if obtained, can also be scanned later on to provide a hidden RNA code in a blood sample analysis machine. Other items also hide their own codes, providing (with a bit more puzzling work) a version of that RNA sequence that can be plugged into a safe that features buttons labelled with a Star, Sun and Moon. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Resident Evil Requiem Review Screens</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After that... well, it's here the trail has gone cold, though likely not for long. We'll be keeping an eye on further progress made throughout the next few days, as players uncover further steps. For now, however, it's just fun to see that the game hides this kind of puzzle. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For a far more granular look at each step to-date, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/resident-evil-requiem/Final_Challenge_Puzzle_Solution">IGN's work-in-progress guide to The Final Puzzle</a> is right here.

The new playable class — the first to hit the explosive third-person action game since launch — has a unique Servo-Gun ability that locks onto enemies in a line of sight and automatically fires at them while the Techmarine continues fighting in melee or range.

The reason is that Space Marine 2’s engagement distances and recoil are extremely low, while average enemy size is rather big. It's very difficult to completely miss your enemies. This is why the only skill element of ranged combat is to aim for the head, and this is why head shots are so important for bolt weapons.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>That being said, I agree that we've overtuned headshots way too much, especially with how different perks and multipliers stack with each other. We will reduce the gap between body shots and head shots. But it's not going to be as easy as applying this perk by default to everybody. </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>We need to adjust base damage of all bolter weapons and then adjust damage sensitivity on all enemies and do it case by case.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem has finally arrived, ready to provide you with hours and hours of survival horror action, in which you can test your mettle as both Grace Ashcroft and Leon S. Kennedy. Much like its modern predecessors, Requiem boasts a reasonably stacked campaign, but just how long is it? Here, we’ll let you know exactly how many hours it took different members of the IGN team to finish the game, and what they prioritised doing with that time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">How Long is Resident Evil Requiem?</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li>Our fastest player finished the game in <strong>4.5 hours</strong>.</li><li>Our “slowest” player finished the game in <strong>16 hours</strong>.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Everyone plays games differently, so read on for more details about how everyone played, how long it took to reach the credits, and how much extra time players spent exploring. Once you've finished the game yourself, be sure to submit your times on our sister website, <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/169267" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>How Long To Beat</u></a>, and see how your time compares!</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Resident Evil Requiem Review Screens</h3></div></span></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Jesse Gomez - Senior Video Producer </h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Completion Time: 8 hours and 59 minutes on Standard (Modern) / 4 hours and 38 minutes on Insanity.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shy of just under nine hours, my first playthrough of Resident Evil Requiem consisted of meticulously hunting down every single Mr. Raccoon collectable, reading as many files as I could (I missed just three of the 75 available to find), and relishing in the blood-soaked glory of Leon's vast, yet costly arsenal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If I wasn't so engrossed by exploring every nook and cranny of the Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center and beyond for secrets, I'm sure I could’ve shaved an hour or two off my playtime. For my second playthrough, though, I cut that time practically in half. I dove into a run on Insanity difficulty right after hitting credits and, armed with knowledge of objectives and environment layouts from my first playthrough, I blitzed through it all in just over four hours and a half hours. Such speed does come with some hiccups, though; to Grace's dismay, I did get munched on a few times by the many monstrosities that stalk the care centers' halls. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Dale Driver -  Associate Director, Video Programming</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Completion Time: 16 hours on Standard (Modern)</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I hit credits 16 hours into my playthrough of Resident Evil Requiem after choosing what I assume to be the “good” ending! I played through the game on the standard modern difficulty; the hardest option available out of the gate that doesn’t demand you deal with Ink Ribbons taking up inventory space.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was quite thorough during my playthrough, making sure I got all the antique coins and all the safes' codes, and generally trying not to leave anything behind. When I got to Raccoon City later in the game, I spent a decent amount of time revisiting the classic locations and soaking up the nostalgia. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I did have an advantage that many first-time players won’t have, which I assume might have cut an hour or two from my playthrough. I’d previously played through the majority of the Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center section for IGN’s preview of Resident Evil Requiem, so when it came to that section I already knew what I needed to find and where it was hidden. That certainly sped up the early hours for me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far, I’ve only finished the game once, but I definitely plan to dive back in for an Insanity run and see what I missed!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Tristan Ogilvie - Senior Video Editor + Reviewer</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Completion Time: 10 hours on Standard (Modern)</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It took me just over 10 hours to roll credits on Resident Evil Requiem, however that was to arrive at the shorter and what I consider to be the worse of its two possible endings. Man, I hate that ending so much! So, I immediately reloaded my save game to play through the other, better, ending, which added close to another 30 minutes onto my playtime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I opted to play Requiem on the Standard (Modern) difficulty setting, mainly because I didn’t want to be restricted to using ink ribbons in order to save my game during Grace’s sections like you are on the Standard (Classic) setting. As the parent of two young kids who are liable to disrupt me at any moment and for no good reason, I need to have the ability to save my game without any restrictions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, I am now playing a second time through on Standard (Classic) and taking my time with it a bit more. I’ve still got a number of small things like notes and Mr. Raccoon bobbleheads to track down, as well as a few areas here and there tucked away in the Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center that I didn’t fully explore the first time through. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m too much of a coward to tackle the game a third time on the Insanity difficulty setting, however if Capcom ends up adding a Mercenaries mode to Requiem at a later date I’ll come charging back harder than a zombie chef with the smell of blood in his nostrils. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Matt Purslow - Executive Editor of Features</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Completion Time: 11 Hours on Standard (Modern)</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I completed Resident Evil Requiem in exactly 11 hours. And, if you’re planning to do a pretty “regular” playthrough, I expect you’ll clock up a similar playtime. While I didn’t scour every last corner, bookshelf, and drawer for the most fiendishly hidden treasures and lore drops, I was reasonably thorough in my exploration of the Rhodes Hill Chronic Care Center and the locations that await beyond it. I scavenged enough currency to buy a healthy selection of upgrades, ensuring both Grace and Leon were well equipped for the dangers they faced, but by the time credits rolled there were still guns that could be further modified and stats that could be improved. I unlocked some safes, but there are still several left to crack in a second playthrough. I read plenty of documents, and so learned many of the story’s extra details, but there are still mysteries to be solved by finding the papers I missed. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">11 hours is pretty typical for a Resident Evil game, but relatively slender compared to many of today’s massive, RPG-style games, and so a second playthrough is certainly on the cards. I not only plan to gather what I missed, but also play with the opposite perspectives of Requiem’s default set up – I’m excited to see what exploring Rhodes Hill as Grace in third person is like, and taking on Leon’s sections as a first-person shooter. That’ll surely clock up another dozen hours. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Brian Altano - Executive Producer</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Completion Time: 12 Hours on Standard (Classic)</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It took me around 12 and a half hours to beat Resident Evil Requiem on the Standard (Classic) difficulty setting, in which Leon can save the game infinitely at pretty much every save station, while Grace needs to find (or craft) limited, finite ink ribbons, just like in the classic Resident Evil games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m a huge fan of the series and I had a hunch I’d like this game, but I didn’t expect to practically adore it. I found myself exploring every inch of it for secrets, collectibles, easter eggs, and more. Ultimately I missed a few on my first run through the game, but then immediately started a second and third playthrough after initially rolling credits the first time in an effort to find everything. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are some really fun post-game options tied to beating the campaign with specific parameters (like finishing it without using a single healing item), plus a couple of other little challenges I’m excited to try. There’s one specific Mr. Raccoon bobblehead I definitely wouldn’t have found without the help of IGN’s guides guru, Brendan Graeber, so if you’re a completionist who doesn’t want to miss anything on your first trek through the story, be sure to give our walkthrough a look. Then there’s the unlockable “Insanity” difficulty that I absolutely can’t wait to repeatedly get my butt kicked in. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All in all, I’ll probably put about 40 hours into Resident Evil Requiem, a number that will only go up if Capcom decides to add a Mercenaries mode and additional story DLC post launch. I really love this game!</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/how-long-is-resident-evil-requiem]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[How Rennsport is building into a racing platform through 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/26/rennsport/</link>
            <guid>1446904</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Rennsport really didn’t get off to the greatest start for a racing game, but its developers are determined to put things right with a newly revealed roadmap for 2026, an AI overhaul and modding tools in the works, and a new mantra of “Double the content –&nbsp;Half the price” to get the ball rolling.</p>
<p>Stepping into the simulation racing genre is a tall task, as you need to try and cater to the varying preferences and demands of a keen and deeply invested audience, but for its launch in November 2025, Rennsport simply came up short. Not enough cars, not enough tracks, a slim set of single player championships, and AI that would launch itself through fast corners, seemingly without braking, and end up cartwheeling through the sky.</p>
<p>The first level that they’re pulling is to reset the expectations and value within the game. The Deluxe Edition price is being slashed by 45% and will now feature the first three paid DLC packs released through 2026 –&nbsp;the Endurance Classics Part 1, Touring Classics Part 1 and now also a September DLC. Current Deluxe Edition owners will have further in-game items given to them as compensation for the price they previously paid.</p>



<p>But all owners will benefit from the free updates from March through May, adding the Hyundai N Vision 74 and Porsche 718 Cayman GT4, iconic tracks like Laguna Seca, Sebring International and a community-derived Kuala Lumpur Street Circuit, and updated and new single player championships, and further improvements through the game’s multiplayer features. The capper to all of this will be the reworked AI arriving in May, a ground-up rebuild of this element in the game.</p>

<p>We got to go hands on with some of this new content at an event in Munich, spending the most time in the game with the Porsche 911 GT1 ’98 and Circuit Des 24 Heures Du Mans, both of which are featured in the Endurance Classics DLC. I’m someone that loves Le Mans and endurance racing as a sport, and this combination (admittedly with the current layout instead of that of the late 90s) was a joy to experience. Isn’t it always?</p>

<p>The rest of the DLC pack will feature the Porsche’s counterpart in the Mercedes-Benz CLK-LM, as well as the older Porsche 956 and current Peugeot 9X8 Evo. May will follow this up with a classic touring car bundle, the iconic Mercedes-Benz 190E and other cars able to take to the Hockenheimring Classic layout.</p>
<p>They’re good additions… free and paid, and the impact should hopefully be pretty swift for the multiplayer side of the game. The various added single player championships, though, will be beholden to the reworked AI coming in May.</p>
<p>The new AI wasn’t available for us to race against just yet, but the approach they are taking was outlined by Lead Gameplay Programmer Rikard Häggström. Instead of leaning into a machine learning approach to programmatically find the fastest racing line and learn to race, the AI is given the optimal racing line to try and follow, but then given situational awareness of other cars –&nbsp;visualised in the demo with laser beams zapping everything of note –&nbsp;to let them try to react more organically. They will also be driving with the same throttle, brake and steering inputs players have, and while there’s a slightly simplified physics model that they use compared to players, there won’t be any “cheating” mechanisms. While it’s expected in May, this could change depending on how development progresses.</p>
<div id="attachment_469268"><p id="caption-attachment-469268">The Kuala Lumpur circuit is a community-created track coming to Rennsport soon</p></div>
<p>The cherry on top, though, could be the modding support that will be added through 2026 and the years to follow. Modding and the ability for fans to add in additional cars, tracks and more to games, has been a major part of various PC racing games, but never really on console. Rennsport is looking to change that with an in-game asset store and manager to go alongside a growing suite of modding tools.</p>
<p>For this year, the focus is all about track modding tools. Built around Unreal Engine 5, the available tools are already robust, but will be combined with Rennsport’s in-house tools for better manipulating the tracks. The very first access to this will be in June for select creators, before expanding with a closed beta in August and a wider release potentially by the end of the year. From there, the modding focus will shift to gameplay and cars, over the next few years.</p>

<p>It’s ambitious for a number of reasons, not least that the most popular mods are now often supported via Patreon and other monetisation methods. To draw those talents to Rennsport, there’s the possibility that Competition Company’s in-game mod browser will also have to act like a shop and not just a platform for discovery. Needless to say there’s a lot of details still to be figured out with how to implement all of this, but it’s a fascinating direction to take, especially with console gamers in mind.</p>
<p>Rennsport is far from the only game to have had a rocky launch and need to pull off a recovery drive to get back to relevance. There’s earnest ambition behind this racing game, though, and a determination to improve the fundamentals while also broadening the horizons for the future.</p>
