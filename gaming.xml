This is "based on market conditions" (thanks to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lvdr2echyd2t">Wario64</a> for reposting!).</p>
<p>Price changes are coming to the Switch 1 consoles, some Switch 2 accessories, some amiibo, and the Alarmo, as well as some Switch 1 accessories. The Switch 2 console, Switch 2 games, and Nintendo Switch Online memberships will be unaffected for now.</p>
<p>This follows Nintendo of Canada's announcement in June that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/uh-oh-nintendos-seemingly-raising-a-whole-bunch-of-prices-in-canada">prices for Switch 1 will be increasing on 1st August</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ngjrzv&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The amount of the increase hasn't been confirmed yet, but as it's coming this weekend, we won't have to wait long to find out. So, if you want a Switch 1... you probably should go out and grab one today.</p>
<p>Console price increases have been happening all across the industry over the past few months, with the PS5 and Xbox both announcing price hikes. There's still uncertainty surrounding tariffs from the current administration in the US given how frequently they're changing, so this might not be the last increase we see.</p>

              <p>The Nintendo Switch <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-zelda-botw-anniversary-1851767489">is over eight years old</a>. It’s never seen a price cut during that time. And now it’s actually about to get <em>more</em> expensive. On Friday, the<em> Mario</em> maker warned customers that the older gaming consoles and their accessories will see price changes in the U.S. “based on market conditions.”</p> <p>Video game consoles are supposed to get cheaper as time goes on, but this console generation has bucked that trend entirely. <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-price-increase-may-2025-1851778615">The PS5 and Xbox Series X/S</a> are all more expensive now than when they launched, and the Switch is about to join them. And update on Nintendo’s website says the Switch ($300), Switch Lite ($200), and Switch OLED ($350) will all be impacted, but the Switch 2 ($450) will remain unchanged for now. Here’s the full statement:</p> <div> <blockquote> <p>Pricing for the original&nbsp;<span>Nintendo Switch</span>&nbsp;family of systems and products will change in the United States based on market conditions, effective August 3, 2025. These include Nintendo Switch – OLED Model, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch Lite and select Nintendo Switch accessories.</p> </blockquote> </div> <blockquote> <p>Other Nintendo products, including certain Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, select amiibo, and the Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo, will also see adjustments.</p> </blockquote> <div> <blockquote> <p>Pricing for the&nbsp;<span>Nintendo Switch 2</span>&nbsp;system, physical and digital Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 games, as well as Nintendo Switch Online memberships, will remain unchanged at this time. However, please note that price adjustments may be necessary in the future.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p>Nintendo isn’t revealing what the actual price changes are yet. It’s also not blaming <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-pro-game-console-prices-tariffs-report-1851779765">President Trump’s trade war</a> directly, but increased tariffs on imports into the U.S. are no doubt partly to blame. Depending on just how much more expensive the old Switch consoles become, it could make upgrading to the Switch 2 instead that much more appealing this fall. At least until that also gets more expensive. The company makes clear that more “price adjustments” i.e. “price increases,” are on the table moving forward.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I’ve had a lazy week. Not in terms of juggling childcare and work through the school holidays, but in my gaming. First, I’ve been reviewing the slow-paced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/28/tales-of-the-shire-a-lord-of-the-rings-game-review/">Tales of the Shire</a>, quietly enjoying being a Hobbit and making meals to enchant the townsfolk. After that, I went straight into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/30/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-preview/">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a>, beginning the careful task of farming, trading and finding a wife while working with gaming’s cutest cows. I have played a couple of things to raise the heart rate – though they were mainly on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/playdate-2025-review-a-handheld-hero-thats-in-love-with-gaming/">Panic’s Playdate</a>, which I’ve made a regular stop-off on my weekly gaming.</p>

<p>First up this week was <strong>Jason</strong>, who polished off some more Monster Train 2, fully unlocking the clans and then beating the titans down as well. He also told us, “I’ve also been playing Final Fantasy XV, which I’m really enjoying revisiting.” Which is only right, because it’s the best Final Fantasy since XIV and before XVI.</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> played Neverwinter Nights 2 and Peglin for review, as well as some Animal Crossing, Burnout Paradise and a bit of Planet Zoo, while Ade played the superb bullet-heaven Achilles Survivor for review, saying, “it’s great fun!” He continued, “I’ve also been on with Doom: The Dark Ages which is fantastic, maybe my favourite of the modern Dooms, though I’ll need to reach the end to know for sure. Finally, I played the demo for Shinobi: Art of Vengeance so so good, roll on release day!”</p>
<p><strong>Laura</strong> has been playing the Fantasy DLC for Two Point: Museum. She says, “It’s been great to have an excuse to revisit my favourite Two Point game (as if I needed an excuse!). I’ve also been playing more of Islanders: New Shores – did I mention it was addictively relaxing?”</p>

<p>It should tell you everything about the latest expansion that <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has given up on Destiny 2, swapping in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/28/killing-floor-3-review/">Killing Floor 3</a> and Helldivers 2 instead.</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> has been playing a lot of games for review, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-platforming-perfection/">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> being the pick of the lot, but Heartworm and One-Eyed Lokhi aren’t far behind. He told us, “I’m near the end of the surprisingly emotional Chibi-Robo like Misc: A Tiny Tale and enjoyed the first few hours of Wuchang once I got the performance stable on PC. Add in a couple of playtests and that’s my week pretty full with gaming.”</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> had a busy week, playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/30/birdigo-review/">Birdigo</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/29/atomic-owl-review/">Atomic Owl</a>, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/dear-me-i-was-review/">Dear Me, I Was</a> for review. He says, “I have also played more Wild Hearts, hunting some kemono. I did have a bit of a dumb moment where I was tasked to hunt a particular kemono so I fought one, beat it, waited for the hunt to complete, but it didn’t. Because I’d followed the wrong monster. Oh well, I got some crafting materials.”</p>

<p>And finally,&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> was our man with boots on the ground at the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/01/hands-on-battlefield-6-so-are-we-back/">Battlefield 6 multiplayer reveal</a>, and alongside his preview, he said, “The more I think about it, the more optimistic I am for Battlefield 6. So long as it’s not too buggy at launch, the gameplay, balance of classes, the setting all speak to the best of the series from the early 2010s.”</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played?</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-gameplay-showcase/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-system-works-showcases-new-marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-gameplay-in-beginner%E2%80%99s-guide.1259607/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ahead of Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls being playable at <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/22/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-debuts-at-evo-2025/">EVO 2025</a>, developer Arc System Works has showcased our first extended look at gameplay through a beginner's guide, a fitting delivery method for anyone who plans to be at EVO this year and wants to jump into the ring with at least some knowledge of how things work. </p>



<p>Announced last month during <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-soul-is-a-new-4-vs-4-fighting-game-by-arc-system-works-launches-in-2026-on-playstation-5-and-pc/">PlayStation's State of Play event</a>, this new fighter from Arc System Works is a new 4v4 fighting game, and while we're sure to see plenty of gameplay when members of the public are able to get their hands on it, this video diving into the basics is the most we've seen of the game so far.</p>



<p>The only unfortunate thing about it is that it's a relatively slow showcase of gameplay, and we see more of only one character, Captain America, than we do of the other fighters that'll be available at launch. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls Beginner's Guide" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v1c9TcMIWfA?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>That said, it's a very thorough guide, and if you are going to EVO with the intent of waiting in line to check out Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls, then you could call this video required viewing to ensure you're ready for the fight.</p>



<p>While players will be able to see even more of Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls at EVO 2025, and get to play it, they won't get to try it out with PlayStation's new fight stick, which we recently learned is officially called <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-flexstrike-project-defiant-fight-stick/">FlexStrike</a>. The FlexStrike will be at EVO, but behind glass cages for players to look and not touch.</p>

Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-star-just-gave-fans-their-biggest-hint-at-a-remake-yet"><u>the actor behind the game's hero, Edward Kenway, offered up some teasing words</u></a> at a convention. Asking a fan if they'd completed Black Flag, he teased: "Well, you might have to beat it again…" </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When the fan replied, "Is this true? I have to run through all of them again," Ryan responded with a knowing wink, saying, "Well, especially this one. There's a reason I say that, but I can't say anything."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story doesn't end there, though. Meeting fans at a different convention — and despite the fact the Black Flag remake feels like an open secret — Ryan would only respond to further questions on the subject with: "I don't know, mate," (thanks, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-star-just-gave-fans-their-biggest-hint-at-a-remake-yet">PC Gamer</a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When pressed further, Ryan said: "Well, the thing is, when that happened, someone was doing this—" (at this point Ryan pointed to the person holding up their phone to record the interaction) "— I was being very free and open, but I didn't know that they actually were recording me on their phone. And then the company threatened to sue me. Yeah, so I say nothing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked Ubisoft for comment.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Damn so it seems like Matt Ryan (voice actor for Edward Kenway) got into deep trouble with Ubisoft for hinting at the Black Flag Remake to that other guy..</p><p>He didn’t realize he was being recorded😵 <a href="https://t.co/2Vy8g6pMRr" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/2Vy8g6pMRr</a></p></div>— The Hidden One (@TheHiddenOneAC) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheHiddenOneAC/status/1950940394310545618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 31, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">While Ryan is likely aware of the ongoing speculation around a Black Flag remaster, could his involvement in it extend beyond seeing his prior work re-released? Reports have suggested Ubisoft is working on a substantial re-working of Black Flag — does that mean Ryan himself is involved, re-recordling dialogue, or contributing to new story elements?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With no all-new Assassin's Creed game set for the end of this year, fans believe the Black Flag remake would be well positioned to arrive in time for the holidays. Here's hoping Ryan isn't made to walk the plank for dropping this latest hint, and it's not too long before Ubisoft makes the remake official.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nba-2k26/" data-ref-id="5000-685486">NBA 2K26</a> is getting a major upgrade to ProPlay, the enhanced animation system available only on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC. 2K has called this year's upgrade the biggest change to player movement since 2K21, making the most of the consoles' extra power to move even further towards true realism.</p><p>ProPlay is a machine learning-powered technology that analyzes real NBA footage in order to translate that into more realistic gameplay and animations. In the latest edition of NBA 2K, ProPlay will power a new dynamic motion engine, improving the look of player movement on the court. The new motion engine will be especially noticeable when players are in the air, making sure they launch, plant, and cut in a realistic way.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aem-81ru6KQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aem-81ru6KQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Other improvements to ProPlay will be most appreciated by players who make use of advanced controls in NBA 2K, with a new and enhanced version of Rhythm Shooting on the way. The upgraded feature boasts more responsive jumpshots, for what aims to be a more skill-based style of gameplay.</p><p>Brand-new ProPlay features in offense include Signature Go-To Post Shots such as shimmy floaters, baby hooks, and up-and-unders. Players will be able to mix and match various advanced layups from different athletes in the league. As part of the broader move towards skill-based play, Green or Miss Shot Timing will be universal on higher difficulty levels, and Layup Timing will be permanently enabled. Defense will also be getting improvements in ProPlay, with more realistic movement across the board--but especially in player-to-player collisions.</p><p>Another new mechanic coming to NBA 2K26 is Quick Protect, which ball handlers can make use of to shield themselves from steals--which is just one of many little upgrades that 2K has added to make the game feel closer to real-life gameplay. Overall 2K promises new and revamped controls, with the goal of providing an "intuitive, deliberate, and free-flowing gameplay experience." Control revamps will also prioritize skill-based gameplay, with changes that will reward fast decision-making and quick reaction times.</p><p>Of course with new mechanics, 2K will also be providing new tutorials to ease players into it, with a special focus on intermediate-level tutorials to bridge the gap between beginner and advanced play.</p><p>NBA 2K26 is due to release on September 5 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Nintendo Switch 2, PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch--however ProPlay is only available on PC and the newer-generation consoles. Certain editions of the game will give one week of early access from August 29--check out all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nba-2k26-preorders-editions-bonuses-and-early-access/1100-6533141/" data-ref-id="1100-6533141">NBA 2K26 preorder details</a> here.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Atlus has announced that <em>Persona 3 Reload</em>, a full ground-up remake of the original 2006 JRPG, has reached a brand new sales milestone.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://x.com/Atlus_West/status/1951080103439413554" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media,&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em>has hit two million sales since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-persona-3-reload-trailer" rel="nofollow">launching last February</a>. The new sales figure means the game has picked up an additional million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-3-reload-sells-over-1-million-copies-fastest-in-atlus-history" rel="nofollow">since its launch week</a>, during which it cemented itself as Atlus' fastest-selling game (until being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaphor-refantazio-sales-1m-already" rel="nofollow">overtaken by&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a>, that is).</p>

<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>'s new sales milestone also comes just a handful of hours after the game was announced to be coming to Nintendo Switch 2 during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">yesterday's Partner Showcase Direct presentation</a>. It'll land on Nintendo's newest console on October 23rd.</p>

<p>The game focuses on an unnamed teenage protagonist who must battle through the mysterious tower of Tartarus at night while building relationships with his school friends and other acquaintances during the day.</p>

<p><i>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</i>lacks some of the features introduced by 2009's&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Portable</em>, including the playable female protagonist and associated social links. It also technically lacks much of the "Answer" storyline introduced in expanded re-release&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 FES</em>, although a version of that story was later sold as an additional DLC pack for&nbsp;<em>Reload</em>.</p>




<p><em>Persona 3 Reload</em>'s success has spurred Atlus on to create another&nbsp;remake in the form of the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Persona 4 Revival</em>, which was revealed during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">this year's Xbox summer showcase</a>. We don't yet know when that one's arriving, unfortunately.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2161700/Persona_3_Reload/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/persona-3-reload/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/persona-3-reload/9nkk6z0k3rh2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and it's coming to Switch 2 in October.&nbsp;</p>

		<p><em>When this goes live, Patrick will, god willing, be in a pub in London. </em></p><p><em>Vacations are odd. Are you going somewhere to relax, or are you going somewhere for experiences? Arguably, the path is in-between, because if you were to live in such a place, would you be chasing every tourist trip? </em></p><p><em>Maybe a trip is, instead, to hang with family or friends. The goal isn't to do much of anything at all except to soak up time with loved ones and be in proximity. Where you do that means less than the being off it all.</em></p><p><em>Either way, it's important to get out the house. </em></p><p><em>You don't need to travel halfway across the world to do something new and different. This week, though, Rob and Patrick unpack the travel they've done over the years, what it means to travel when it's really in service of work, and how long you need to be in a place to "be" there.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> It’s strange. Over my life, I’ve been fortunate enough to travel across the world a few times, landing up in Iceland, Japan, and Germany. Sometimes a few days, sometimes a week.</p><p>The one thing those trips have in common, though, was <em>work</em>. Iceland was to attend an <em>EVE Online</em> convention. Japan was, of course, Tokyo Game Show. Germany was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_Convention?ref=remapradio.com"><u>the show that would become Gamescom</u></a>. It’s hard to complain about a “free” international trip, but in every case, I was doing interviews, writing blog posts, and doing lots of <em>work</em>. Plus, it was a little bit like how I can say I’ve been to Seattle a dozen times. But have you really been to Seattle if you’re just going to PAX to walk around a convention center, before you hang out at a bar?</p><p>It wasn’t until I went to PAX with my family a few years back where we stayed long enough to actually do touristy stuff in Seattle. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iQhOmebDqo&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>I finally went on the damn Space Needle.</u></a> That’s ridiculous.</p><p>Are you really visiting a place if you’re just doing the same things you’d do somewhere else? But when I went to those other places for work, I didn’t have the money to stay an extra week!</p><p>It’s only in recent years that my wife and I have mulled a “real” vacation. Even then, we do not have the kind of family support that would let us drop off the kids for a week and jet off. I’m grateful for having my mom around in a pinch, but my mom couldn’t handle a week on her own.</p><p>So in reality, the cost of the vacation inflates and what you can <em>do</em> on it changes radically. We considered doing something closer, more explicitly centered around the kids. But fuck it, man.</p><p>A few years back, as we considered breaking the seal on Disney, my wife wondered aloud if the kids would be old enough in a few years for something more ambitious. She had never left the confines of North America, venturing only to Canada and Mexico over the years, and had always dreamed of visiting Paris. Worried it wouldn't be the “best” destination for young children, I told her we should go to Paris anyway. We’d figure out a way to make it really fun with the kids.</p><p>(Everything we’ve read since makes it sounds like it’ll actually be delightful for the kids. We’re even sneaking two nights and one day at Disneyland Paris, to bring things entirely full circle.)</p><p>Still, in some ways, I’m in the same place I was last time. I’m about to attend a cool place with a caveat. Now, it’s <em>kids</em> instead of <em>work</em>. I’ll happily take one over the other, obviously, but we spent decades clawing our way into a place where we could consider travelling and now, once again, it’s probably another decade until we could reasonably consider doing it only as a couple.&nbsp;</p><p>The reality is very few of us will ever have the means to pull off the idealized vacation. I still expect we’re going to have a wonderful time. And if I’m being honest, I’m delighted, proud, and jealous my kids are having a trip like this at their age. That wasn’t in the cards for my family at that age, and it’s a testament to all the support my family gave <em>me</em> that I’m now in this position.</p><p>Yet…I wish I could sneak off to the catacombs with my wife without jumping through hoops lol</p><p>Anyway. What have your vacations been like over the decades? What’s <em>your</em> Paris?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@chriskaridis?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Chris Karidis</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>We haven’t really had vacations until a couple years ago when we went on our big Disney World vacation. Which was, warts-and-all, a really special trip. The Animal Kingdom Lodge legitimately changed how we understood lighting, and how much it shapes a place. It’s an expensive hotel but it’s an experience MK and I refer back to <em>constantly </em>when we think about how to design and light an interior space.</p><p>I think the best (only?) real vacation prior to that was a tiny house on Lake Michigan. It was probably the most MK and I have ever had to ourselves to just hang out in our entire relationship. My entire memory of the days in that cabin is just the two of us sitting by a roaring bonfire watching the sun slide across the sky and the stars come out. It was a little early in the season so the lake was quite cold but it also made that fire feel like heaven on earth. It’s another thing we refer back to a lot and now I think of it, the place we’re buying has elements of both those vacations! It’s a cozy, sleek wood home with lots of private outdoor space. Hopefully it facilitates the making of those kinds of happy memories on a more regular basis.</p><p>As for what’s my Paris… I think it’s probably Paris or… Tokyo. I have never been to Japan but I’ve never met anyone who didn’t love their time there. It intimidates the hell out of me: I don’t speak or read any of the language and long flights are a struggle. But the idea of spending a few weeks or a month in Japan is captivating.</p><p>That’s the other thing: I don’t tend to do well with short trips. I like to live in a place more than I like to visit it. My ideal vacation is not a weekend or even a couple weeks, it’s spending a season somewhere. Long enough to find my own rhythms and relationship with it, to not feel like I need to go see a museum or a heritage site but can instead spend the day watching sports before going out for dinner at a restaurant or meeting up with friends in the area.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 - Official Multiplayer Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Activision's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> is confirmed for release in 2025 but it doesn't have a release date yet. It's rumored that the game will launch on November 14, which would be about a month after Battlefield 6 launches.</p><p>The Call of Duty series has been released on an annual basis since 2005, but the Battlefield franchise has no set schedule for releases. Battlefield 2042 was preceded by 2018's Battlefield 5, with a three-year gap between them. Battlefield 1, meanwhile, was released two years prior in 2016.</p><p>Developers on Battlefield 6 told <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1951000916188106868" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CharlieIntel</a> that they believes Battlefield 6 is "unique" as it competes against Call of Duty. "There's something about it you can't get in any other game. Our focus is on delivering the best Battlefield game we can. A game our old-school, hardcore fans will love."</p><p>You don't have to wait until October to play Battlefield 6, as there is a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">free open beta that kicks off very soon.</a></p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 - Official Multiplayer Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>

<p>Uchil went on to say, "I don't think it needs Nicki Minaj." That is seemingly a reference to the DLC skin for Call of Duty that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nicki-minaj-is-now-in-call-of-duty-with-some-epic-finishing-moves-and-voice-lines/1100-6517192/" data-ref-id="1100-6517192">lets you play as Minaj.</a> Instead, Uchil said the aim for Battlefield 6's skins is: "Let's keep it real, keep it grounded."</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/battlefield-6-skins-cosmetics/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ComicBook</a>, producer Alexia Christofi said much the same thing, explaining that Battlefield Studios is hoping to make Battlefield 6's skins "feel grounded."</p><p>"We want people to express themselves and to have cool skins and peacock in a way like, 'I look pretty cool and I have this great weapon skin,'" Christofi said. "But we want it to feel authentic to the franchise, that’s the approach we’re thinking."</p><p>Producer David Sirland added that keeping player skins in the "grounded" realm also has gameplay benefits. Each of the four classes--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6s-class-system-is-a-welcome-return-to-basics/1100-6533614/" data-ref-id="1100-6533614">and yes, the traditional classes are back</a>--are identified with designations on the shoulder, similar to how it worked in past games.</p><p>"For example, there is a ghillie material on the Recon skins, and they're not used on the other [classes] to really emphasize the differences," he said. "There are some rules there, but it's looser rules than, 'It's always going to look like this.' But it needs to feel like it fits the universe, because part of why I think we're getting good feedback here is because it feels like 3 and 4, in a sense, where it fits. I think that's really important."</p><p>Because Call of Duty and Fortnite are such massive games with huge audiences, it makes sense that companies see those games as a marketing and promotional vehicle for whatever they are selling. That's why we've seen skins in those games promoting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-as-godzilla-in-fortnite/1100-6528891/" data-ref-id="1100-6528891">movies</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-brings-back-the-boys-dlc-soon-along-with-these-unexpected-bundles/1100-6523618/" data-ref-id="1100-6523618">TV shows</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-leak-reveals-cheech-chong-devin-booker-operators-are-coming-and-snoop-dogg-is-returning/1100-6521642/" data-ref-id="1100-6521642">more</a>. The financial arrangements around these crossovers are unknown, but it would stand to reason that compensation, in some form or another, is part of the deal.</p><p>The Battlefield series has welcomed skins over the years, too, but not on the level of Call of Duty and Fortnite when it comes to crossovers or wacky stuff like a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-4-20-event-brings-cheech-and-chong-a-stoned-sloth-and-weed-themed-bundles/1100-6522208/" data-ref-id="1100-6522208">stoner sloth. </a> It appears that tradition is holding for Battlefield 6, and many fans are responding positively thus far.</p><p>Battlefield Studios has not yet fully unveiled its plans for Battlefield 6 microtransactions and store bundles, but we do know the game will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-preorder-guide-ps5-xbox-physical-edition-retailer-bonuses/1100-6533616/" data-ref-id="1100-6533616">have a Battle Pass and some kind of "BF Pro" token.</a></p><p>Battlefield 6 launches on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. An <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">open beta</a> kicks off very soon.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-financials-q1-2026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2-sales-hit-6m-worldwide-as-nintendo-revenue-soars.1259541/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has released its financial statement for the first quarter of the fiscal year, and shockingly enough, the company's revenue is up when compared to the previous year, while Switch 2 sales are looking pretty solid overall.</p>

<p>As revealed in its accompanying financial <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801_2e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">presentation</a>, Nintendo's sales jumped by 132% between April and June when compared to the same period a year prior. This is, of course, largely down to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">the release</a> of the Switch 2 in early June.</p>

<p>Net profits rose by around 18.6% when compared to last year, but as Nintendo points out, the Switch 2 has a smaller profit margin than the original Switch, which accounts for what might be a smaller number than you expected to see, given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-fastest-selling-nintendo-console" rel="nofollow">console's success</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-sales-q1-financials-bowser.jpg?itok=ARCic_pX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-sales-q1-financials-bowser.jpg?itok=YTIKsAO_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Looks like Bowser and his son bought themselves a Switch 2. Aww.</figcaption></figure><p>It's fair to say the Switch 2 has been a success, too. According to Nintendo, the console managed to sell over six million units within its first seven weeks, and since we're nowhere near the holiday season yet, those numbers are only likely to increase by the end of the year.</p>

<p><em>Mario Kart World</em>, which was the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">main launch title</a> for the Switch 2 where Nintendo is concerned, managed to sell 5.62 million units in the weeks leading up to June 30th as well. Technically, though, that figure refers to "sell-in" rather than "sell-through", which includes both copies Nintendo sent to business partners and those bought by customers either directly through the Nintendo site or as downloadable software.</p>

<p>As Nintendo points out, it's also got more than a few games in the pipeline for the Switch 2. This month will see the release of wheelchair basketball sim&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/drag-x-drive-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Drag x Drive</em></a>, and hotly-anticipated games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents" rel="nofollow">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-4-beyond-2025" rel="nofollow">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>&nbsp;</i>(both also coming to the original Switch) will arrive later in the year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-financials-q1-2026.jpg?itok=8k2241Sr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-financials-q1-2026.jpg?itok=rNRuUP-_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond&nbsp;</em>is just one of Nintendo's holiday titles (we assume).</figcaption></figure><p>In any case, things are looking up for Nintendo right now, although whether the Switch 2 can replicate the original console's long-term success remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Nintendo's financial statement for the first quarter follows <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">yesterday's Partner Showcase Direct</a>, during which we learned about new releases like Square Enix's HD-2D action RPG&nbsp;<em>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales&nbsp;</em>and Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Stories 3</em>.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/dear-me-i-was</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-dear-me-i-was-switch-2-a-bold-heartfelt-wordless-visual-novel.1259517/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Dear me, I was... Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157714/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>A common complaint levied against visual novels is that they’re some of the most text-heavy games one can find on the market. Who wants to spend hours upon hours reading dialogue during precious gaming time? Answer: me, and plenty of other people, but it’s a valid perspective to consider. Visual <em>novels</em> are generally wordy beasts with extended runtimes, which can make their appeal rather limited. That makes the occasional outlier that bucks genre conventions all the more intriguing.</p>
<p>Such is the case with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dear-me-i-was">Dear me, I was…</a>, a fresh <em>visual</em> novel from the minds at Arc System Works that eschews written or spoken dialogue in favour of relying on visuals and music to tell its narrative. It’s a bold stylistic move, but the heartfelt tale that this game weaves stands as a testament to how much a story can say without saying anything at all.</p>
<figure><a title="Dear me, I was... Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157710/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Over the course of its roughly hour-long runtime, Dear me, I was… chronicles the life of an unnamed woman from her early childhood years to adulthood and beyond. The narrative jumps between pivotal points in the protagonist’s life, capturing snapshot moments of joy and sorrow as she develops connections with the world and people around her. Most importantly, it depicts her lifelong journey as an artist and the way in which her relationship with this creative medium evolves as the years go by.</p>
<p>It’s a simple, grounded story devoid of the major twists or melodrama one might expect from the genre, but that’s entirely by design. The woman’s life is one that the average player can likely relate to on some level, and that makes her struggles, discoveries, and experiences all the more resonant. I was genuinely caught off guard by how hard some of the emotional moments hit me, in spite of the game’s abbreviated length. The story tackles themes of loss and self-doubt with an impressive degree of realism and restraint, which makes its heavier beats feel earned rather than coming off as cheap tearjerker attempts.</p>
<figure><a title="Dear me, I was... Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157716/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, the core story of Dear me, I was… is elevated considerably by its unique presentation. With art director Taisuke Kanasaki at the helm, the game’s visual identity evokes shades of Cing classics like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/hotel_dusk_room_215">Hotel Dusk</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/another_code_recollection">Another Code</a> series. This title features an elegant, painterly art style with heavy use of watercolours. Tonal shifts in the story are accompanied by movement between vibrant full colour, cooler blue-and-grey, and black-and-white palettes — a clever way of visually expressing the protagonist’s emotional state.</p>
<p>Characters also display an impressive degree of fluid movements and nuanced expressions thanks to the use of rotoscoping of the live-action cast for animation. These detailed visuals, combined with the melancholy tones of the piano-oriented soundtrack, add another layer of richness and depth to the story while simultaneously keeping everything expressive enough to clearly convey the narrative without words.</p>
<p>In terms of gameplay, Dear me, I was… features a touch of interactivity through the incorporation of basic point-and-click sections. Throughout each chapter, the occasional sequence sees you performing basic actions like eating breakfast or drawing a sketch. You have your choice of button controls, touch controls, or even the Switch 2’s built-in Joy-Con 2 mouse controls for these portions, which is neat.</p>
<figure><a title="Dear me, I was... Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157715/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, these scenes usually amount to little more than clicking somewhere on the screen once or twice without much in the way of game essence. Rather, the occasional interactive element serves as a means to deepen the player’s connection with the protagonist’s story by having them perform small actions to progress it. I’m fine with that limited degree of player input, though I would have appreciated some more creativity for these interactive sequences in the vein of the puzzles from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/florence">Florence</a> — a game with a similar tone and format.</p>
<p>All in all, Dear me, I was… is quite the enjoyable audio-visual experience — which, unfortunately, makes its incredibly short duration a bit of a bummer. While it’s priced accordingly and manages to tell a touching little tale in a very limited timespan, it’s tough for me not to feel like I breezed through the whole thing in the blink of an eye. It’s concise almost to a fault, and there are portions of the plot where slowing things down a bit and letting certain story beats breathe could have resulted in an even more compelling narrative.</p>
<figure><a title="Dear me, I was... Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157713/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I suppose that’s part of the game’s point, though — life goes by quickly. Perhaps the fact that I was left wanting more of Dear me, I was… speaks more to the quality of its content than any other compliments I could give it.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In some ways, it feels counterintuitive to write a review of Dear me, I was… — a title which centres upon capturing heavy feelings that can’t be so easily put into words. However, it’s not every day that a visual novel successfully manages to craft a moving narrative about art, life, and the passage of time solely on the merit of its visual and musical storytelling.</p>
<p>Even if the game itself remains silent, Dear me, I was… is worth talking about.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A lot of thought went into when to release Battlefield 6, but EA continued to target this Fall, regardless of Grand Theft Auto VI.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/battlefield-6-release-date-sims-movie-ea-laura-miele-interview-1236475794/">Variety</a>, EA Entertainment president Laura Miele commented on the release date of the highly anticipated next entry in the first-person shooter series, saying that they <em>"have always have been heads down, unblinking about this fall and executing at a level of excellence,"</em> working hard with the development team to not get distracted by anything else happening around them. With the level of effort and investement put into the game, however, the last thing the publisher wanted was to put Battlefield 6 in harm's way or too close to the release of something really large, so EA did have their eye on Grand Theft Auto VI, and were thinking about different scenarios, but weren't allowing these scenarios to impact schedules or development.</p>



<p>The confidence EA is showing in Battlefield 6 definitely seems to be warranted. Kai recently had the chance to try out the game and has found it to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-hands-on-impressions/">a return to proper form</a> after the blunders of the last entries in the series. </p>



<p><em>In a lot of ways, Battlefield 6 is how DICE and Ripple Effect have listened to the feedback from fans and brought back the massive squad shooter in a proper return to form. Despite the mayhem of crumbling infrastructure, this is exactly what I’ve wanted out of Battlefield multiplayer since the days of Operation Metro and Strike at Karkand. Massive maps with the flow of infantry, tanks, and jets all coordinating in tandem, and the constant chatter of squadmates calling for revives or ammo packs.</em></p>
