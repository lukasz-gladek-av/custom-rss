			<p>The long-rumored PlayStation 5 version of Starfield will reportedly not be announced this year, according to a well-known, reliable insider.</p>



<p>Replying to a question on <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2">X</a>, reliable insider NatetheHate, who correctly revealed many video game news in the past months ahead of official announcements, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-16th/">the official reveal date for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, suggested the port's announcement will be made in 2026, unless plans change.</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Believe the announcement will be in 2026 unless plans change.</p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1980100112702660639?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>As mentioned above, a PlayStation 5 release of Starfield has been rumored for a long time and reportedly in the works since the game's release in 2023. Earlier this year, we learned that the role-playing game developed by Bethesda would <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-port-happening-later-than-planned/">release later than originally planned</a> on Sony's current-generation consoles, and that its <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-2026-poor-sales/">release should coincide with the launch of the second expansion</a>, which could shake up the game considerably with the introduction of <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-developer-teases-story-dlc-space-changes/">space gameplay changes and new gameplay systems. </a>Considering the reliability of the sources of these reports, there's little doubt, at this point, that PlayStation 5 owners will have to wait a while before they can embark on a new journey through space.</p>



<p>PS5 owners waiting until 2026 to enjoy Starfield may not be bad, with the new content and gameplay mechanics on the horizon. So far, free updates and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/">Shattered Space expansion</a> haven't improved the game's core issues, so its late debut would allow new users to experience Starfield in a much better state.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-harry-potter-hogwarts-castle-potions-class-drops-to-pennies-as-amazon-clears-stock-for-spooky-season-2000637338</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-harry-potter-hogwarts-castle-potions-class-drops-to-pennies-as-amazon-clears-stock-for-spooky-season.1330219/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Lego has released plenty of Harry Potter sets over the years, and with Halloween just around the corner, Amazon’s kicking off the celebrations early by putting quite a few of them on sale. We’ve spotted Hagrid’s hut, Hogwarts Castle, and Aragog in the Forbidden Forest dropping in prices previously. But today, things are taking an even more magical turn – straight into the dungeons.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4895/">Amazon is being generous with a 35% discount on the Hogwarts Castle: Potions Class Building set, offering it for just $26</a>. That’s a nice $14 discount on a set that’ll fit beautifully into your current Harry Potter Lego setup, and even make a memorable gift for a fan in your family or friends. There’s no word on how long the discount will last, so it’s best to grab it sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4895/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Four Key Characters From the Movies</h2>
<p>This set lets you recreate Professor Severus Snape’s lessons in his dungeon classroom. It comes with 397 pieces, and includes a blackboard, potion bottles, ingredient jars, shelves, and all the other elements you’ll need to bring the setup to life. You’ll also get four minifigures; a very angry Severus Snape (not even surprised), Hermione Granger, Pansy Parkinson, and Seamus Finnigan. We would’ve loved to see a confused Ron or Malfoy up to some mischief, but this lineup works just fine too.</p>



<p>The set also includes two randomly selected collectible Hogwarts portraits. These are part of a larger collection of 14, and can be a valuable addition to your collection if you’ve got one. As with all Lego sets, you’ll get a step-by-step instruction book that walks you through the entire build. It’s pretty easy to follow, even for kids who are building for the first time, but if you need more help, we recommend installing the Lego Builder app. You’ll get 3D instructions, so you can view every step from all angles to get a better idea. There’s also a “Build Together” mode, which is great for when multiple people are working on the same set. Plus, you can keep track of your progress, and see all your Lego projects in one place.</p>
<p>All in all, this set offers a great chance to relive a classic Harry Potter moment, and bring your favorite characters home. It’s made for ages 8 and up, but you can also treat yourself to it (no judgements), or gift it to a Wizarding World fan in your life.</p>

<p>Switch 2 release, please?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="3dfe4b40afd5b"><a title="Ninja Gaiden" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3dfe4b40afd5b/ninja-gaiden.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Dotemu</em></figcaption></figure><p>Team Ninja, PlatinumGames, and Xbox Game Studios have just launched <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/ninja_gaiden_4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, the latest entry in the 3D hack and slash series.</p>
<p>While Switch 2 fans won't be getting in on the action (for now...), we can at least admire some stunning new artwork shared by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> publisher Dotemu. Created by David Liu, it depicts the protagonists from both major Ninja Gaiden titles this year: Kenji Mozu, Kumori, Yakumo, and of course, Ryu Hayabusa.</p>

<p>Pretty cool, right? We remain somewhat optimistic that Ninja Gaiden 4 will someday see the light of day on Switch 2, but we'll settle with this for the time being.</p>
<p>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound, meanwhile, is a stellar 2D entry in the series from acclaimed developer The Game Kitchen. While it certainly suffers from a few frame rate issues on the OG Switch, those on Switch 2 can boost the performance up to 60fps, and the resulting experience is simply extraordinary.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jhtyku&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>To commemorate the release of Ninja Gaiden 4, Ragebound players can also now experience the campaign with a free Yakumo skin, so that's nice.</p>
<p>It's also recently been confirmed that Tomonobu Itagaki has sadly passed away at the age of 58. Itagaki is the famed creator of the <strong>Dead or Alive</strong> franchise, and was chiefly responsible for Ninja Gaiden's 3D revival.</p>

            <p>Embark Studios CEO and former EA guy Patrick Söderlund has been chatting about the usage of generative AI and machine learning in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, the forthcoming looter shooter with the neat motorbike helmets. He's of the opinion that while generative AI tools at large are "pioneering" inventions that "should completely change how this industry functions", "the human aspect is still essential". Nonetheless, it's patently obvious from Embark's self-commentary in general that the real pioneering element of genAI technologies is cutting specific humans out of the picture, so that More Videogame May Be Made.
</p><!--more-->
<p>Arc Raiders has just concluded <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-final-free-arc-raiders-open-playtest-is-rolling-out-now-showing-off-quests-progression-and-crafting">a final "server slam" playtest</a> ahead of launch on 30th October, consolidating a rise in popularity that has punted it to third on the Steam wishlist charts. There's also been some negative reaction to the game's voice-acting, however, with some players <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/voice-quills.com/post/3m3ndhdcixc27">speculating that it is AI-generated</a>. The studio's previous multiplayer shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-finals">The Finals</a> made use of "a combination of recorded voice actors and AI based [text-to-speech] that is based on contracted voice actors", as Embark's brand director Sven Grundberg explained to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/embark-studios-ai-let-devs-do-more-with-less-when-making-the-finals">Game Developer</a> in December 2023.
</p>
<p>Embark have yet to reveal whether Arc Raiders features generated voice-acting - I'll ask them for comment. The game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/">Steam page</a> includes a very broad genAI disclosure that tells us little, save that Steam's disclosure policies are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-dutys-generative-ai-disclosure-reveals-a-glaring-issue-with-steams-policies">hopelessly unfit</a> for contributing useful information to the muddled and furious debate around genAI. It reads: "During the development process, we may use procedural- and AI-based tools to assist with content creation. In all such cases, the final product reflects the creativity and expression of our own development team."
</p>

</figure>
<p>Elsewhere, Arc Raiders has been confirmed to use proprietary machine learning tools for the animation of large robot enemies, and going by Söderlund's latest remarks, the developers also have the capacity to generate 3D weapon models from Youtube videos, though it's not clear whether Arc Raiders makes use of this functionality.
</p><p>As ever with conversations around generative AI, there's a tendency to jumble together myriad tools and approaches under one label. The systems in use at Embark appear to be proprietary, relatively specialised and for internal use only, inasmuch as we can tell from developer statements. As such, they aren't in quite the same bracket of existential dread as, say Microsoft's Copilot, which is envisaged as an omni-capable "companion tool" derived from vast quantities of media without the permission of individual creators, thrust upon billions of people worldwide in the shape of mandatory updates for existing operating systems and services, and openly designed to enable widespread workforce cuts by generating a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dear-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-please-prove-that-an-ai-didnt-write-your-insulting-vacuous-blog-about-why-youre-laying-off-thousands-during-a-time-of-huge-profits">"local surplus"</a> of productivity.
</p>
<p>It's also important to note the difference between Embark and older companies making use of genAI, such as Microsoft and EA. Embark are relatively junior - <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nexon-makes-strategic-investment-in-patrick-s-derlunds-ambitious-new-studio">founded in 2018</a> with funding from Nexon, then <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nexon-to-fully-acquire-stock-in-embark-studios">acquired by the latter in 2021</a>. They positioned themselves early on as an R&amp;D-driven company based around "connected players, big data, speech recognition, cloud computing, and advanced AI", as Söderlund gushed in the studio's announcement materials. They aren't a legacy business like the newly private EA, who are trying to reorganise and cut staff to take advantage of a new form of automation.
</p>
<p>That said, the arguments for Arc Raider's usage of genAI are broadly similar to those offered for Copilot - it's that perennial shareholder-pleasing mantra of "doing more with less". Speaking in Edge Magazine's latest issue, as picked out and passed along by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/amid-backlash-the-finals-lead-doubles-down-on-the-fps-controversial-ai-usage-says-it-allows-the-team-to-work-better-and-faster-and-do-more-with-less/">Gamesradar</a>, Söderlund touched on his desire for Embark to be "pioneers" in the field of machine learning, based on his previous experience as co-founder of EA's SEED research division. But he added that "the beauty of videogames, as with any artform, is that - at least so far - they can't be built by an Al. I hope they never can. The human aspect is still essential."
</p>
<p>Söderlund went on to offer the familiar argument that generative AI allows developers to skip work they'd rather not do. He gave the example of the machine learning-based animation of insectile robot enemies in Arc Raiders. "What if, instead of having to hand-animate or use mocap for every single frame, we created a model, gave it physical attributes, then used AI to train it to walk?"
</p><p>Embark <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzdAqEoDv6q/?utm_source=ig_embed">posted videos</a> of this approach to animation back in 2019. Since then, Söderlund says, they've developed systems for generating weapon models. "We've come so far now," he told the mag. "Let's say that you want a new weapon built in The Finals. We can take a video from YouTube, feed it through our tools and pipelines, and [produce] a 3D model of the weapon you had in that video." The results aren't immediately usable in themselves. "That might sound like wizardry and I would be lying if I told you that it's perfect - it isn't," Söderlund went on, "but it works, and that output is something we can then work with." 
</p>
<p>I quite like the spidery Arc Raider robot animations. They remind me of the Mobile Fortress boss in 2012's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/binary-domain">Binary Domain</a>. That said, it seems important to keep puncturing the mystique and reiterate that the point of such systems isn't really devising hitherto-undreamt forms of vidyagaming. It's about doing what developers already do at less time and expense, though mileages vary considerably as to whether genAI is the workplace accelerant it's cracked up to be - there's evidence that <a href="https://hbr.org/2025/09/ai-generated-workslop-is-destroying-productivity">it has the opposite effect</a>.</p>
<p>Back in 2021, Embark's machine learning engineer Tom Solberg <a href="https://medium.com/embarkstudios/transforming-animation-with-machine-learning-27ac694590c">published a Medium post</a> explaining the machine learning-based animation for Arc's robot enemies in more detail. While somewhat evangelical, the post is useful in that it alludes to differences of opinion within Embark about what kinds of development work are fit for automation - some people <em>want</em> to be able to place each robot footfall by hand.
</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The post also broadly reiterates the executive-level viewpoint that the real hook for genAI is theoretically being able to make more stuff at the same or less cost. "We've arrived at a workflow that allows us to create much more content with a comparatively small team, as we're not dependent on an army of animators to script every single movement and encounter that we put in the game," Solberg writes. "In fact, our aim is that our designers should be able to teach agents without input from engineers or animators at all." <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-medium">The Medium</a> post ends before spelling out the obvious conclusion here.
</p><p>There's a lot of this genAI stuff about, isn't there? I wrote <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">a massive feature</a> exploring my feelings about Copilot, Gemini and other "big" companion AIs over the summer, following on from Mike Cook's thorough and thoughtful <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/electric-nightmares">four-part exploration of the technology in 2024</a>. It feels like we should write another one, frankly. 
</p>
<p>One thing that perhaps gets lost in the tumult is that for many devs and players, objecting to genAI isn't really about the individual tools, which may have responsible or less responsible uses. It's about the overall industry push towards another threshold of profit that serves to maintain a status quo in which, for example, people like Patrick Söderlund get paid tens of millions a year, while less well-paid people are laid off whenever the upward curve on the earnings report seems worryingly shallow. Anyway I'll shut up now. This was supposed to be a quick news article. Did you catch the Arc playtest? Interested to Read Thoughts on the voices. I hear the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-players-were-terrorised-by-a-terrifying-foe-over-the-beta-weekend-tumbleweeds">tumbleweeds</a> are pretty disturbing as well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gamers, is there anything worse than having to delete a game just to make space for a new one? There isn’t and thankfully, you don’t have to deal with such problems. Game file sizes are growing, which calls for a storage solution that’s not just spacious, but also fast. The Seagate storage expansion card (1TB) offers all that and more, and you can now grab it without paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3767/">It’s currently sitting at $130 on Amazon, which is 19% off its regular price</a>. We know it’s not a massive drop, but considering how it doesn’t go on sale that often, it’s definitely worth grabbing. The only catch is that the discount might not be around for long, so it’s best to grab it quick.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3767/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fast Load Times, No Annoying Lags</h2>
<p>This card is designed in partnership with Xbox, so you won’t run into any frustrating compatibility issues. It also uses the same Xbox Velocity Architecture, meaning every title runs exactly as it would from internal storage. Expect faster load times, smooth gameplay, and an overall immersive environment without any slowdowns. Whether you’re playing an Original Xbox game or experimenting with the latest Series X|S release, this card handles it all. Quick Resume support means you can switch between games from both the internal SSD or the expansion card in literal seconds, and pick right where you left off.</p>



<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3767/">This version gets you 1TB of storage, which is more than enough to house all your favorite titles and then some.</a> This capacity should be enough for most gamers out there, but if you need more, Seagate also offers 2TB and 4TB options. Of course, these are priced a bit higher but the good news is that both are discounted right now too, with the 2TB version at $220 and the 4TB at $430.</p>
<p>Setting things up and getting started is fairly simple. There are no complicated procedures to follow, and you should be ready to play in just a few minutes. Seagate also includes <strong>a 3-year limited warranty</strong> with your purchase, so you will have that extra peace of mind if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>Altogether, if you are looking to bid annoying storage problems goodbye and play without feeling limited, this Seagate storage card can be a great investment. It’s built in partnership with Xbox, and offers plenty of space to store all your favorites. The deal might not be around for long, so grab it soon.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/eve-online-catalyst-sci-fi-mmo-next-expansion-new-resource-rush/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/eve-online-catalyst-is-the-sci-fi-mmo%E2%80%99s-next-expansion-and-ccp-reckons-it-will-spark-a-new-resource-rush.1330180/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, CCP Games unveiled EVE Online: Catalyst, the next expansion coming to the 22-year-old sci-fi MMO. Catalyst goes live on November 18, and the developers believe it will kickstart a new resource rush due to mining becoming even more important than it already was. </p>



<p>Lore-wise, this is explained by a failed experiment on the enigmatic Drifter Gates, which has caused spacetime to become unstable, resulting in Hyperspace Fractures appearing across New Eden. These short-lived anomalies reveal Phased Asteroids rich in Prismaticite, a volatile new resource that reprocesses into random minerals in unpredictable quantities. Outer Ring Excavations engineers have created Phase Anchor technology: a deployable system that stabilises fractured asteroids for coordinated mining.</p>



<p>Bergur Finnbogason, EVE Online's Creative Director, stated:</p>



<p><em>Mining is the foundation of all activity in EVE, and with Catalyst, it becomes the forefront of power. We’re reenergizing the mining experience, making it far more dynamic, social, and rewarding. To master the universe, you must master its materials. Whether you build or destroy, it all begins with ore.</em></p>



<p>Snorri Árnason, EVE Online's Executive Producer, added:</p>



<p><em>At face value, ore may seem unremarkable, yet it is the hidden catalyst of EVE’s biggest dramas. Creation, conflict, destruction, and rebirth – it’s the center of the eternal cycle of New Eden. But where valuable resources appear, so do rival capsuleers, turning mining operations into contested battlegrounds. Players will once again field the mightiest mining ships in pursuit of extraordinary resources, as well as the brand new Pioneer and Odysseus when Catalyst launches on November 18.</em></p>

<p>EVE Online players will explore these volatile, time-limited rifts to find Phased Asteroids. Once they extracted Prismaticite, they can test their luck with random reprocessing or choose a different base mineral for the Prismaticite to be reprocessed into. This gives players increased agency in fuelling the mining industry and impacting the player-driven economy of EVE Online. There are also two new ships, the ‘Pioneer’ Mining Destroyer and the 'Odysseus' Exploration Command Ship. The former can be piloted by Alpha clones and upgraded by Omegas, while the latter is a long-range vessel built to allow veteran explorers to launch extended missions into uncharted regions of space.</p>



<p>With Catalyst, mining cycles have been revamped to be faster and more immersive, featuring a refreshed scanning overlay and a 2D ore availability map. The easy-to-read, tactical 2D map provides players with improved system visualisation, clear jump ranges and dual data overlays, offering precise navigation and sharper insights for exploration. Both 2D and 3D maps feature ore availability indicators and enhanced data readability, with customisable scales for greater clarity in every view. </p>



<p>Overall, resource extraction is now more unpredictable, engaging, and rewarding. Additionally, CCP Games introduced PLEX transaction logs to improve the in-game economy's transparency, and also tweaked the balance and visuals of Empire carriers.</p>

<p>Last month, EVE Online <a href="https://wccftech.com/eve-vanguard-operation-nemesis-linked-eve-online-ccp-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">became linked to EVE Vanguard through Operation Nemesis</a>, allowing players of both games to influence the same universe, a long-time goal of the studio.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new list of games leaving PlayStation Plus in November has been revealed, and Battlefield 5 is one of them. </p>



<p>Like all other subscription services, PlayStation Plus is known for introducing a new collection of games to the library each month, with titles like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus-game-catalog-new-games-october/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Until Dawn, Silent Hill 2, Yakuza: Like a Dragon</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-plus-october-2025-alan-wake-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alan Wake 2</a>, and more being added in October. However, some games are removed from the library whenever new games are added, and PS Plus will lose out on seven games in November. </p>



<h2 id="h-7-games-are-leaving-playstation-plus-in-november">7 Games Are Leaving PlayStation Plus in November</h2>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/10/these-7plus-games-will-be-axed-from-ps-plus-extra-in-november-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PushSquare</a>, the PlayStation Store’s ‘Last chance to play’ section has been updated with seven new games that will be leaving PlayStation Plus in November. The highlights of this collection are the previously mentioned Battlefield 5 and Like a Dragon: Ishin. The exact removal date hasn’t been revealed, but these games are expected to be available until November 18. Check out the complete list of games leaving PS Plus in November 2025 below: </p>



<ul>
<li>Battlefield 5 (PS4)</li>



<li>Like a Dragon: Ishin (PS4/PS5)</li>



<li>Digimon Survive (PS4)</li>



<li>Football Manager 2024 Console (PS5)</li>



<li>Travis Strikes Again: No More Heroes (PS4)</li>



<li>Alternate Jake Hunter: Daedalys The Awakening of Golden Jazz (PS4)</li>



<li>Synapse (PSVR2)</li>
</ul>



<p>It seems that the release of Battlefield 6 has led to the removal of other Battlefield games from PS Plus. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-1-and-3-other-games-are-leaving-playstation-plus-in-october/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 1 </a>was removed this month, and BF5 will be removed next month. Similarly, the addition of Yakuza: Like a Dragon will be followed by removing Like a Dragon: Ishin next month. </p>



<p>In other news, Sony has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-files-injunction-to-bar-tencent-from-using-any-resemblance-to-horizons-aloy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filed a preliminary injunction</a> to bar Tencent from using any resemblance to Horizon’s Aloy. Will you play any of the seven games before they leave PlayStation Plus in November?

            <p>
EA is shutting down <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sims-mobile">The Sims Mobile</a> after seven years, with servers going offline - and all content becoming unplayable - on 20th January next year.
</p>
<p>
The Sims Mobile launched for iOS and Android in 2017, delivering a free-to-play Sims-style experience broadly similar to that of the main series. In January this year, however, EA announced there would be no more new content updates or events for The Sims Mobile, and the publisher has now confirmed the game's imminent closure, sharing a detailed timeline for its shutdown.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/the-sims/the-sims-mobile/news/final-update">detailed on EA's website</a>, The Sims Mobile is being delisted from the iOS App Store and the Google Play Store today, 21st October, at 1.30pm UTC. This follows the release of a final update earlier this week giving unlimited energy to all players (energy was previously earnable or available for purchase with real money). A schedule of events, as listed below, will remain available to players until servers shut down at 1.59pm UTC on 20th January 2026, after which The Sims Mobile will be unplayable. Additionally, all Build Mode and Create A Sim content will be unlocked for all players from 6th January.

EA notes it's no longer possible to purchase packs or spend real money within The Sims Mobile, but existing SimCash, Simoleons, and Tickets can be used until 20th January next year. Unspent currency is not eligible for a refund.
</p>
<p>
"On behalf of the entire Sims Mobile team," the publisher's announcement concludes, "thank you for sharing this amazing journey with us. We hope you enjoy the final update and that these final months allow everyone to finish projects, make memories, and celebrate their Sims."
</p><p>
While EA hasn't given a reason for The Sims Mobile's shutdown, it's likely in order to clear the way for its new mobile game, currently being referred to as The Sims Labs: Town Stories. Early footage from Town Stories leaked during playtests last year, when it was still being referred to as Project Rene. Further playtest footage - this time <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-minutes-of-eas-new-the-sims-game-concept-leak-online">under the moniker City Life Game With Friends</a>, and described as "small parts of a larger game concept" - surfaced in April, and it <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.gp.sims.mobile.town.building&amp;hl=en_GB">recently reemerged</a> on Android as The Sims Labs: Town Stories.
</p>
<p>
Project Rene was initially announced in 2022, when it was described as a "next generation Sims game and creative platform". However, EA's plans had seemingly shifted dramatically by September last year, when it revealed it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-5-not-happening-as-ea-moves-beyond-linear-sequential-sims-releases">no longer be pursuing a direct Sims 4 "replacement"</a> - ie. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-5">The Sims 5</a> - and was instead focusing on a new approach that would allow players to keep their progress between titles and have an "ongoing experience". Needless to say, Town Stories, with its apparent endless reward-incentivised to-do lists and front-and-centre currency focus, was not what fans were clamouring for.
</p>
<p>
For the time being, the series' main focus remains on The Sim 4, which continues to receive major updates and expansions, despite now being a decade old. Its most recent expansion, the getaway themed Adventure Awaits, launched earlier this month, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4s-adventure-awaits-expansion-is-exactly-the-kind-of-getaway-ive-been-looking-for">is a good 'un</a>.

            Former Ridgeline Games boss and Halo co-creator Marcus Lehto has spoken out against the diminished representation of certain old Ridgeline colleagues in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a>'s credits, pointing out that some have been "entirely omitted" despite their years of work laying the "foundation" for EA's new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a>.


</p><!--more-->
<p>Ridgeline were once pretty central to Battlefield 6. Back in 2022, they were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefields-next-campaign-being-developed-by-halo-co-creators-new-studio">unveiled as the creators of the next Battlefield singleplayer campaign</a>, but EA <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-shuts-down-ridgeline-games">shut them down</a> in the course of mass layoffs over February 2024, with some Ridgeline staff being transferred to another Battlefield studio, Ripple Effect.
</p>
<p>"I'm disappointed to see that many of my former teammates from Ridgeline Games were not properly credited in the recent release of Battlefield 6," Lehto wrote in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7386081189645885440/">a LinkedIn post yesterday</a>.
</p>
<p>"These talented developers worked tirelessly for 1 to 2.5 years, building the foundation of the game, before I left voluntarily and the studio was subsequently shuttered," he went on. "Despite their significant contributions, most who were laid off were relegated to a 'Special Thanks' section at the very end of the credits -- and several were omitted entirely, including myself.
</p>
<p>"Out of respect for my colleagues and the awesome work they poured into this project, I want to take a moment to properly recognize them -- listing their names and roles as I would have preferred them to appear in the credits. Game development is a team effort, and every contributor deserves fair acknowledgment."
</p><p>Specifically, Lehto cites software engineers Jessica Moore and Dan Carr, lead tech artist Rohan Knuckey, and lead character artist Andres Naranjo as having been unfairly overlooked. He credits himself as vice president, studio general manager and franchise director. Here's a video of the full official BF6 credit reel, for context.</p>

<p>Incomplete crediting of developers is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/05/18/video-game-credits-policy/">one of the persistent evils</a> that affects big budget games. Developers may labour on a game for the best part of a decade and come away without an appropriate namecheck, because they left or were laid off before shipping. External contributors and people in certain, devalued areas of game creation <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/translators-and-external-developers-reportedly-missing-from-baldurs-gate-3-credits">are more prone to being left out</a>. Sometimes, the threat of a withheld credit is used as a cudgel to stop people resigning from roles they hate.</p>
<p>All that said, it's worth noting that Lehto's reading of Battlefield 6's credits is a bit sketchy. As he acknowledges in the comments on that LinkedIn post, three of the people he says EA have omitted are actually cited elsewhere in the credits.</p>

            <p>Part three of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> trilogy will be more "concise", said director Naoki Hamaguchi, as fan feedback from Rebirth has been taken into account.</p>
<p>Rebirth, the second part of the trilogy, shifted to an open world filled with minigames, but some players criticised story sections for being too drawn out.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://screenrant.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-naoki-hamaguchi-interview-bgs/">Screen Rant</a>, Hamaguchi disagreed but is still taking on such feedback while developing the next game.</p>

<p>"Regarding time management in certain sections, especially in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">FF7 Rebirth</a>, I honestly don't believe that they were longer than necessary," he said. "I feel like nowadays, players just have too much to do and too much to play; so they often feel the urge that something has to be concluded quickly."</p>
<p>He added: "As we work on the conclusion to the trilogy, we are striking a balance on how story arcs are told and spread out so as to ensure that the game feels a bit more concise."</p>
<p>Rebirth did, however, introduce some great minigames like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-of-2024-final-fantasy-7-rebirths-queens-blood-is-the-best-card-game-of-the-year">card game Queen's Blood</a>. Hopefully being more "concise" with storytelling will still leave space for innovation and amusing side activities.</p>
<p>What's more, in a previous interview <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogys-part-three-will-have-some-sort-of-fresh-gameplay-experience-but-its-a-big-secret-for-now">Hamaguchi stated the third game will have some form of new gameplay experience</a>, though it remains under wraps.</p>
<p>"But moving forward to the third game in the series," he said, "obviously I can't say exactly what it is, but I don't want to deliver just exactly the same style of gameplay experience as we had with Rebirth again. We're going to evolve it and change it again to give another different and fresh take on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a> gameplay. Again, that will be revealed in the not too distant future. I can say we're working on it and we're trying to change that because we've actually got a build up and running in the development team right now where you can experience that new style of gameplay."</p><p>It certainly seems, then, that part three will be a step on from Rebirth, not only adding something fresh beyond simply wrapping up the story, but taking fan feedback into account too. Let's just hope the convoluted narrative of the Remake trilogy concludes comprehensively.</p>
<p>Additionally, Hamaguchi previously said the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-three-wont-be-impacted-by-multiplatform-approach-says-director-despite-xboxs-problematic-lack-of-memory">multiplatform approach for the trilogy won't impact development "whatsoever"</a>, now that Final Fantasy 7 Remake is heading to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> and Xbox, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-gets-switch-2-release-date">and will be followed by subsequent games</a>.</p>

            <p>Fingers have been pointed regarding the ROG Xbox Ally X's beefy £800 / $1000 price tag. Xbox, whose name is on the handheld, have pointed to collaborators Asus as having spearheaded that decision, with president Sarah Bond saying that it came down to the hardware company's assessment of what'd be acceptable to charge.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We looked at, how do we create multiple options for people? And it really was Asus, because this is their hardware," Bond told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/xbox-ally-handheld-release-president-sarah-bond-interview-1236555575/">Variety</a>. "That is all of their insight into the market, into the feature set, into what people want, to determine the ultimate prices of the devices."</p>
<p>"I feel really good about the value that we’re giving gamers for the price, based off the reception to the hardware," she added.</p>
<p>As our James acknowledged in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/asus-rog-xbox-ally-x-review">Xbox Ally X review</a>, the handheld's price certainly doesn't leave it a no brainer bargain, but isn't massively out of step with what other handhelds go for:</p>
<blockquote>The fact that it costs £800 (or a crisp $1000 in the US) doesn’t help, but then the MSI Claw 8 AI+ already proved that it can be worth splashing out if framerates and practicality are up to premium standards. The ROG Xbox Ally X sometimes makes the cut, though is just as often outpolished or outlasted by its peers, and even suffers from outright faults that undermine Asus and Microsoft’s genuinely good UX work.</blockquote>
<p>I'm having a little trouble believing that Xbox, whose CEO Phil Spencer made no secret of how much he pines for the handhelds prior to pulling the trigger on an Xbox-branded one, didn't have any say in the figure which was stuck on the box. If you're putting your company's name on the thing and want to minimise the potential that has to backfire, surely the price is one of the elements on your radar to discuss thoroughly, even if you think you're likely going to be happy trusting in Asus' cited mountains of wisdom.</p><p>Then again, an exec earning massive wads of cash to make these sorts of calls and deals I am not. Plus, there's the much-discussed issue of US tarrifs and their potential impact on the cost of goods like the like the Xbox Ally X, which seemed to be alluded to via the phrase "time to figure the macroeconomic impact to pricing" when Asus and Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-lock-in-a-release-date-for-their-rog-xbox-ally-handhelds-but-no-price-yet-because-macroeconomics">opted to push back announcing the handheld's price</a> by a couple of months.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Palworld developers have confirmed that a new Halloween update will arrive on October 23, 2025; however, details of this update are scarce. </p>



<p>Pocketpair has a lot of content planned for Palworld fans in the coming days. A collaboration with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworlds-next-crossover-is-with-ultrakill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultrakill</a> was announced last month, and a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-coming-to-once-human-in-crossover-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Once Human</a> update is set to arrive on October 30. Ahead of that, players can celebrate with some spooky fun through Palworld’s Halloween update, which arrives this week. </p>



<h2 id="h-palworld-s-halloween-2025-update-looks-like-it-s-more-than-just-cosmetics">Palworld’s Halloween 2025 Update Looks Like It’s More Than Just Cosmetics</h2>



<p>A post on Palworld’s official <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1980439049853710677" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account confirms the Halloween 2025 update. The description of the upcoming update mentions Zoe being spotted “in a rather unusual new outfit,” but that isn’t the only strange thing. It seems some mysterious figures are roaming the Palpagos Islands, dressed in Depresso costumes. More details about this update will be revealed soon. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It seems that Palworld is taking it up a notch from their Halloween update in 2024. Last year’s update provided players with free cosmetics for their pals, including Halloween Cattiva, Spectacled Katress, Pirate Pengullet, and Halloween Croajiro. It looks like the developers are upping their game in 2025, adding some spooky elements to the game’s world to match the festivals’ vibe. Moreover, this comes after the developers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-1-0-release-window-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that “things are going to be a little quiet from us for the rest of the year”, as they work on the 1.0 update. </p>



<p>In other news, a former Capcom designer recently stated that Palworld “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/palworld-crossed-a-line-says-former-capcom-designer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crossed a line</a>” and players shouldn’t buy the game. Additionally, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-is-so-wrong-it-hurts-about-mods-not-counting-as-prior-art-says-patent-expert/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a patent expert recently commented</a> on the Nintendo v Palworld lawsuit.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy director has mentioned the possibility of a DLC or another ‘full title’ after part 3.</p>



<p>There’s still some time left before Final Fantasy 7 Remake’s Part 3 is revealed; however, we do know that development has been progressing well, with the game already having <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-already-has-a-lot-of-playable-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘a lot’ of playable content</a>. Interestingly, the developers are already thinking about their plans after the release of part 3, which could entail a new expansion or a fourth game. </p>



<h2 id="h-there-s-a-possibility-of-a-fourth-game-for-the-final-fantasy-7-remake-series">There’s a Possibility of a Fourth Game for the Final Fantasy 7 Remake Series</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-tgs-2025-qa-no-dlc-rebirth-but-theres-a-chance-for-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WccfTech</a>, Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy director Naoki Hamaguchi was asked whether they had any DLC plans for Rebirth. Hamaguchi stated that there were ideas at some point, but they “revisited this topic” and realised that their priority should be what fans want the most. The dev figured that “what fans want the most is to bring the third installment as soon as possible.” Which meant that the next game took priority over DLC. </p>



<p>However, Hamaguchi revealed that the story doesn’t end there, as “there is the possibility of having a DLC for that third installment” after its launch. Moreover, with that being the conclusion to Final Fantasy 7 Remake Trilogy, “there’s probably going to be a much wider audience for Final Fantasy as a whole”, says the director. Which is why the developers are “actively considering” whether to introduce “another DLC or a full title”. </p>



<p>In other news, Final Fantasy 9 Remake <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-9-remake-might-be-on-ice-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">might be ‘on ice’</a>, according to a new claim.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Blockbuster games with outsized budgets and big spectacle are "not really sustainable in terms of the cost of development", said former God of War exec Meghan Morgan Juinio, adding games need to be "fun first".</p>
<p>Juinio recently left her position as director of product development at Sony's Santa Monica Studios, where she worked on the God of War series. She discussed the current state of blockbuster game development with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/god-of-war-producer-says-the-blockbuster-games-industry-needs-to-steer-away-from-spectacle-and-focus-on-what-matters-if-its-not-fun-its-not-worth-the-investment/">PC Gamer</a> at Gamescom Asia.</p>
<p>"I think it's already not really sustainable in terms of the cost of development," she said. "There's been a ton of layoffs, and a lot of that is focused on the West Coast of the US, and it's clearly because the minimum costs are so high. Development costs will necessitate that the big publishers create [new] pathways."</p>

<p>While big budget games like God of War won't be going away, Juinio believes larger publishers will look to AA or single A games for inspiration.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, successful games should be fun to play, rather than focusing on flashy graphics and presentation.</p>
<p>"I think what it comes back to," said Juinio, "is just make something fun. Just make something awesome, and that will achieve what you need it to achieve."</p>
<p>She continued: "My opinion is that it has to be fun first. It can look the most beautiful, the best soundtrack in the world, it can be winning all the BAFTAs for audio and all this, but if it's not fun it's not worth the investment, whether that's $2m or $500m.</p><p>"And I think that's where the biggest publishers can return: how do we go back to building solid games that are really fun to play. Maybe they aren't 40 hours long, and maybe they aren't the most cutting edge - but that doesn't matter if the core experience is really fun."</p>
<p>This year, the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> and Peak have proven that games from smaller teams with smaller budgets can still make a huge impact. Juinio acknowledged, however, there remains an increasing problem of access and game discovery when there are simply so many games being released.</p>
<p>For Sony specifically, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-ok-to-make-a-small-game-says-astro-bot-director-on-its-aa-level-success">Astro Bot is perhaps a key example of critical, award-winning success based on smart AA-sized ambition</a>.</p>
<p>"It's OK to make a small game," said its director Nicolas Doucet during a talk at this year's GDC.</p>
<p>"In order to exist in this very busy world, I think it's sometimes better to settle for a good spot in the second week rather than a bad spot in the first week," he continued. "A lot of choices we made with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> could be labelled as AA... like the size of the team, the size of the game, there's no voice, it's not open world, but that doesn't really matter. We could still make something that gets people really happy."</p>

<p>According to producer Takeshi Ichikawa in a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/10/19/158538.html">GameSpark</a> (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/dragon-quest-7s-dark-and-sorrowful-story-may-resonate-with-players-now-more-than-it-did-back-in-the-day-remake-producer-says/">Automaton</a>), this is actually a key factor in the team's decision to bring the game back for modern platforms.

<blockquote>
<p>“We decided to launch the project for Dragon Quest VII Reimagined because we felt that the game’s unique atmosphere and tone would resonate especially well with players today. Back when it first came out, VII was often said to have more dark and sorrowful episodes compared to other entries in the series.</p>
<p>"But nowadays, players are much more accustomed to games with darker stories. I believe that, through this new version, modern players will be able to feel VII’s story and the emotions of the characters even more deeply.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Due for release on <strong>5th February 2026</strong> (shortly after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> on 20th January 2026), Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is a full-on remake built from the ground up with gorgeous diorama-like visuals.</p>
<p>While the overall story will remain unchanged, Reimagined will streamline the narrative while introducing some key gameplay enhancements.</p>

            <p>It turns out that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> may be messing with the aim of PC users playing on mouse and keyboard. Thankfully, by adjusting a few settings, you should be able to improve your ability to hit your shots in EA's massive military shooter.</p>
<p>This process was first widely <a href="https://x.com/TorbisXD/status/1979494906830696780">publicised by Battlefield 6 content creator TorbisXD on X</a>, who messed around in the settings to discover three options that were impacting his ability to hit shots while aiming down sights.</p>
<p>Here's the fix. First, go to your Mouse and Keyboard settings, then go to the Controls sub settings menu at the top under the Infantry section. Once there, turn Uniform Infantry Aiming off for now, as this'll allow you to alter several other aiming settings linked to it.</p>

<p>With Uniform Infantry Aiming turned off, scroll down to the Zoom section of the Controls menu and you'll see an option called Zoom Transition Sensitivity Smoothing. Turn this off. Then, re-enable Uniform Infantry Aiming. For the final step, you'll see an option called Zoom Sensitivity coefficient right below Uniform Infantry Aiming - turn this to zero.</p><p>Okay, so what are all these tweaks to settings actually doing? Well, Uniform Infantry Aiming keeps your aiming sensitivity the same regardless of what you're doing - whether aiming down your sights or shooting from the hip. It's very useful, which is why it's been left on. However, Zoom Transition Sensitivity Smoothing attempts to add additional sensitivity to your aim when aiming-down-sights.</p>
<p>In layperson's terms, with default settings enabled, your aiming sensitivity was sped up whenever you aimed down your sights. With these changes to the settings, your ADS speed should be uniform across the board, which should feel a tad more natural.</p>
<p>It turns out a lot of people are having a grand time with Battlefield 6. According to an official statement by EA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-battlefield-6-is-best-selling-entry-in-the-series-7m-copies-sold-172m-online-matches">over seven million players bought and played the game in the week following its official launch</a>. This popularity came in spite of a few bugs, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/missing-shots-in-battlefield-6-well-you-might-not-be-bad-a-bug-might-be-throwing-your-shots-off">some even throwing off player's aim in extended firefights</a>, though many of these have been fixed in short order.</p>

            <p>Time to phone Genghis Khan. Tell him the news. There's gonna be a bit more waiting before you can become 13th century Mongolia's a truest Yam courier rider/horse befriender. Following its latest Steam Next Fest demo, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/im-fascinated-by-this-open-world-delivery-game-that-sounds-like-death-stranding-on-a-horse-in-13th-century-mongolia-with-unparalleled-equine-realism">The Legend of Khiimori</a>'s early access release has been pushed back to March next year.</p>
<p>I know, throw down your spurs like they're Yosemite Sam's hat. There's neigh way developers Aesir Interactive and NightinGames have done this to you. Well, they have, but they say they've got the game's best interests at heart.</p>

<p>The equine delivery sim's now set to emerge from early access on March 3rd, 2026, its developers have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2697000/view/519727718097487890?l=english">announced</a>. "The wonderful reception during Steam Next Fest has led to us sitting down with our publisher and together we have decided to take more time to create a more feature and content-rich experience," they wrote. "While this does mean that you all have to wait a little longer to get your hands on Khiimori, it also means we’ll be able to make sure you get a better game when we do release into Early Access."</p><p>Alongside fleshing Khiimori out with extra features, Aesir say their "main priorities" include improving "player guidance and world experience", as well as the camera, controls, and interface. They also plan to make some performance tweaks to help the game run a bit more smoothly and lower its fairly lofty minimum system requirements.</p>
<p>To help tide the bronco busters of the Steam corral over, the game's Next Fest demo has stuck around past the conclusion of the great demopocalypse and won't disappear until November 30th. So, if like me you've not had a chance to give it a go yet, there's an extra month or so to find a saddle.</p>
<p>I am keen to try it, though, despite not being a massive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> enjoyer. There's something in its description of breeding and caring for a steed as you negotiate delivery routes you've plotted out, occasionally stopping to forage or shoot a thing with your bow, that reminds me of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>'s wilderness-wandering. Or, like, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/american-truck-simulator">American Truck Simulator</a> with mares instead of Mack lorries.</p>
<p>Anyway, you can find The Legend of Khiimori's lingering demo if you gallop over to its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2697000/The_Legend_of_Khiimori/">Steam page</a>.</p>

<p>The sample shows off some gorgeous concept art from the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Metroid Prime</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime_2_echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">Metroid Prime 3: Corruption</a>. We get a glimpse at Samus' Phazon Suit, Dark Samus, Meta Ridley, Metroid Prime itself, and various enemies and environments from the trilogy.</p>
<p>Of course, the full book, created by Piggyback and retailing for <strong>£39.99 / $49.99 / C$69.99</strong>, contains a total of 212 pages, so this is merely an appetiser for the main course. It'll include an introduction from series producer Kensuke Tanabe, writing straight from Retro Studios to introduce each game, and a whole bunch of producer notes to give context to the visuals.</p><div><figure data-videoid="FsuAt4uVyTk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FsuAt4uVyTk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FsuAt4uVyTk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FsuAt4uVyTk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4022bdxqojnr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>If you want to check out the digital sample, head on over to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/metroid-prime-1-3-a-visual-retrospective-artbook-arrives-on-oct-28/">official Nintendo website</a> and click the relevant link – you won't miss it.</p>
<p>The art book's release comes ahead of two <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> amiibo on November 6th: 'Samus' and 'Samus &amp; Vi-O-La'. The third and final amiibo, 'Sylux', lands on 4th December alongside the game itself on Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond was announced over eight years ago (!) at E3 2017 before development was restarted from scratch in 2019. It was subsequently announced in 2024 with the subtitle 'Beyond' and its debut gameplay trailer.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-developer-doesnt-close-door-to-dlc/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ghost-of-y%C5%8Dtei-developer-doesn%E2%80%99t-close-the-door-to-dlc.1330099/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Now that Ghost of Yōtei is out, Sucker Punch's Jason Connell, who co-directed the game alongside Nate Fox, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/10/17/ghost-of-yoteis-creators-on-atsu-i-see-it-as-a-chapter-is-done" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was interviewed by Game Informer</a> to discuss the game and characters at length. Eventually, the interviewer also inquired about the possibility of the game getting a DLC, and Connell did not close the door to the idea:</p>



<p><em>I think for us, we are at the spot in the project where we just get to put it out there and see what's resonating with people and what people love and what people feel like they wish they maybe knew more about Atsu. And I think for us, this is like the most important part of the project, in terms of making decisions like these. [...] You get this rare opportunity to actually listen to millions of people about what resonated within a story versus maybe what didn't or what are the holes. And I think that's the mode that you want to be in. And that's sort of the gift. Certainly we love Atsu, and we think it's a great character. And just like with Jin, if there's rooms to improve it or to bring some new elements to life or clarity for the narrative’s sake and it falls within what is best for Sucker Punch, then we'll certainly take a hard look at that for sure.</em></p>



<p>Indeed, Ghost of Tsushima received a DLC called Iki Island, which was released about a year after the base game and was also part of the Director's Cut launch on PS5. In this DLC, protagonist Jin Sakai departs to the titular island to stop a Mongol tribe led by a shaman named Ankhsar Khatun. The expansion is similar in size to Act One of the main game, and players can access it once they have reached Act Two of the main story. Besides the new story, Iki Island also introduced new combat skills, such as the ability to charge at enemies on horseback and new side quests and open-world activities, like visiting animal sanctuaries, where Jin can pet various animals.</p>



<p>If Ghost of Yōtei receives a DLC, it will likely be similar, at least in scope. Of course, much will depend on the reception of the base game, but that's already going pretty well. Sony hasn't shared sales data yet, but we know from Alinea Analytics that the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-sold-over-1-6-million-units-only-slightly-slower-than-tsushima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is selling almost as quickly as its predecessor</a>, which had the advantage of a much larger install base (not to mention being released during COVID-19's lockdowns).</p>



<p>If you're looking for more details about the game, check out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Yōtei review</a>. We have also <a href="https://wccftech.com/discussing-ghost-of-yoteis-lord-saito-with-actor-feodor-chin-he-and-atsu-are-really-two-sides-of-the-same-coin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published an exclusive interview with Feodor Shin</a>, the actor who played the main villain, Lord Saito.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Sims Mobile is Being Shut Down After Seven Years Online]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Electronic Arts has announced that The Sims Mobile will be shut down after more than seven years of operations and updates. The all-mobile product will be closed down from Janaury 20, 2026, and as it’s an online title, it’ll no longer be accessible to any users.</p>



<p>The team revealed a stack of limited-time events coming in the next few weeks to usher in the closure of the game, but today, October 21, The Sims Mobile will be delisted from app stores.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-sims-mobile-is-the-latest-ea-game-to-go">The Sims Mobile is the Latest EA Game to Go</h2>



<p>Electronic Arts has busied itself closing down servers and shutting down games across a range of genres in the last couple of years. The Sims Mobile is the latest title to be hit by that action.</p>



<p>In March 2018, The Sims Mobile was released by Electronic Arts, and by September, it had pulled in almost 50 million users and racked up more than $20 million in revenue.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-mobile/news/final-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent blog post</a>, the team at Electronic Arts confirmed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>(On October 20) the final update for The Sims Mobile will be available to download from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. From this date forward, players will no longer be able to purchase packs or spend real money within TSM. Any existing SimCash, Simoleons, or Tickets can still be used until January 20, 2026.</p>



<p>In the final update, releasing on October 20th, 2025, everyone will receive unlimited energy to help them make the most of this time. This should make it easier to complete projects and enjoy the last few months of play.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There’s now a list of special events that will unravel leading up to when the game is taken offline:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><th>Name</th><th>Type</th><th>Start Time</th><th>End Time</th></tr><tr><td>Eerie Autumn</td><td>Festival Pass</td><td>Oct 20</td><td>Dec 19</td></tr><tr><td>Cozier Home</td><td>Sweet Treat Showdown</td><td>Oct 20</td><td>Nov 2</td></tr><tr><td>Wumple’s Wishlist #1</td><td>Limited Time Quest</td><td>Oct 27</td><td>Nov 3</td></tr><tr><td>Hallways Ready</td><td>Treasure Hunt</td><td>Nov 3</td><td>Nov 16</td></tr><tr><td>Wumple’s Wishlist #2</td><td>Limited Time Quest</td><td>Nov 10</td><td>Nov 17</td></tr><tr><td>Foxbury Institute</td><td>Sweet Treat Showdown</td><td>Nov 17</td><td>Nov 30</td></tr><tr><td>Wumple’s Wishlist #3</td><td>Limited Time Quest</td><td>Nov 24</td><td>Dec 1</td></tr><tr><td>Season’s Greetings</td><td>Treasure Hunt</td><td>Dec 1</td><td>Dec 14</td></tr><tr><td>Wumple’s Wishlist #4</td><td>Limited Time Quest</td><td>Dec 8</td><td>Dec 15</td></tr><tr><td>Sweet Holiday</td><td>Sweet Treat Showdown</td><td>Dec 15</td><td>Dec 28</td></tr><tr><td>Wumple’s Wishlist #5</td><td>Limited Time Quest</td><td>Dec 22</td><td>Dec 29</td></tr><tr><td>New Year’s Dock and Roll</td><td>Treasure Hunt</td><td>Dec 29</td><td>Jan 10</td></tr><tr><td>Wumple’s Wishlist #6</td><td>Limited Time Quest</td><td>Jan 1</td><td>Jan 8</td></tr><tr><td>Wumple’s Wishlist #7</td><td>Limited Time Quest</td><td>Jan 10</td><td>Jan 17</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p>In the FAQs section on the above blog post, it was noted that any remaining in-game currencies, purchased or otherwise, will not be made refundable. If you’ve invested any money in The Sims Mobile and have a wallet with any cash in it, now’s the time to spend it.</p>
