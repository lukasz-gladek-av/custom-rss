Brown as the former security guard to a recently murdered American president. This then jarringly shifts into footage of David Schwimmer in January’s <em>Goosebumps</em> movie, <strong><em>The Vanishing</em></strong>. Then, far more excitingly, we get to see some <strong><em>Alien: Earth</em></strong>, the TV series set in the <em>Alien </em>universe, created by my favorite showrunner, Noah Hawley (<em>Bones</em>, <em>Fargo</em>, <em>Legion</em>).</p><p>There’s a new but extremely brief appearance by Marvel series <strong><em>Ironheart</em></strong>, a few seconds of <strong><em>Daredevil</em></strong>, and then, crikey, <strong><em>Chad Powers</em></strong>. This is a new comedy created and written by, and also starring, everyone’s new favorite beefcake, Glen Powell. It’s based on the Eli Manning character from <em>Eli’s Places</em>, and is about a college quarterback who loses his place on his team due to bad behavior, so creates an alter-ego, Chad Powers, disguises himself, and joins a struggling Southern team. Even weirder is how much the disguised Powell looks like Parker from <em>Gold Rush</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="7d5055061bd65bd6954703e9113b8eb1" data-recommend-id="image://7d5055061bd65bd6954703e9113b8eb1" data-format="jpg" data-width="850" data-height="478" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Chad Powers and Parker from Gold Rush." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Chad Powers and Parker from Gold Rush." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney / Discovery / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7d5055061bd65bd6954703e9113b8eb1" data-recommend-id="image://7d5055061bd65bd6954703e9113b8eb1" data-format="jpg" data-width="850" data-height="478" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Chad Powers and Parker from Gold Rush." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s a moment of a new show that has no online presence called <strong><em>Good American Family</em></strong>, that looks all sorts of weird, and then, finally, the one we’re waiting for, <strong><em>Andor</em></strong><em>.</em></p><p>It’s just 11 seconds, but we get to see once again what makes <em>Andor</em> stand out from so many of Disney’s TV shows—it’s shot on huge sets, and not a Volume stage. There’s big, open spaces! There are Stormtroopers! There are people telling Andor he needs to be a leader now, which he really obviously won’t want to be. There’s very little more to glean from it for an amateur like me, but you know the pros will be poring over this for every hidden detail. Here’s the section clipped out:</p><p>Oh, and after <em>Andor </em>we see some <em><strong>Percy Jackson and the Olympians</strong></em> season two, like anyone was still noticing.</p><p>So, get speculating.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That's an artistic direction by design, as co-developer Studio Gobo explained how everything in the game is made from real Lego bricks--only digitized--and the game can be reconstructed at home, if you have the right pieces and an eye for which bricks were used.

right pieces at home, you could rebuild anything from the world, including the machines, the treasure chests, and Mother’s Heart," Guerrilla's senior community manager Anne van der Zanden explained on

            <p>
Rockstar has at last updated the PC, PlayStation and Xbox versions of its classic GTA Trilogy to receive the same improvements already found in its mobile port. 
</p>
<p>
GTA Trilogy originally launched for PC and consoles exactly three years ago to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-inundated-with-refund-requests-as-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-backlash-intensifies">decidedly negative reception</a> due to its various graphical issues and glitches, prompting a sarcastic response from the port's original development studio and an apology from Rockstar itself. 
</p>
<p>
Now, three years later, improvements already found in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-tested-on-iphone">GTA Trilogy's warmly-received smartphone version</a> - launched via <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> - can finally be found elsewhere. Most notably, this includes the trilogy's Classic Lighting mode, which restores the brighter and more colourful vibes of the games' original versions.

<p>
As <a href="https://rockstarintel.com/gta-trilogy-remasters-get-big-new-update-three-years-after-release/">RockstarIntel</a> notes, you can find the Classic Lighting option now in each games' pause menu - though, somewhat tellingly, the feature has been enabled by default. Other additions include character model improvements, plus visual improvements for heat haze and ambient clouds.
</p><p>
GTA Trilogy's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-inundated-with-refund-requests-as-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-backlash-intensifies">disastrous launch sparked countless refund requests</a> as the game arrived in a buggy state. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-says-it-pulled-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-from-sale-on-pc-to-remove-files-unintentionally-included">Rockstar quickly pulled the game offline</a> for three days, albeit with different concerns - apparently to scrub the inclusion of unlicensed music within the game's files, as well as files with developer comments and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dataminers-discover-hot-coffee-code-in-gta-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition">the infamous Hot Coffee sex mini-game</a>.
</p>
<p>"There are a lot of problems here," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-grand-theft-auto-3-definitive-edition-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly">Digital Foundry wrote of the GTA Trilogy</a> upon the package's original launch, "issues that are so blatant and jarring and ridiculous, it's hard to understand how the game made its way through quality control."</p>
<p>Rockstar <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-apologises-for-gta-trilogy-definitive-editions-unexpected-issues-re-lists-classic-versions-for-pc">apologised</a>, offered a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pc-owners-of-the-gta-trilogy-remaster-can-claim-an-extra-game-for-free">free Rockstar game</a> for PC owners, and began providing patches. But problems persisted - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-trilogy-released-on-steam-in-sorry-state">GTA Trilogy's Steam launch in January 2023 drew similar complaints</a> over its poor quality. Here's hoping now, finally, Rockstar has provided.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>NVIDIA has prepared several announcements for today, starting with the release of a new GeForce Game Ready driver optimized for next week's big releases: STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl and Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024.</p>
<p>The two games will be released on November 20 and November 19, respectively, and both will support NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation. Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 will also include NVIDIA DLAA and ray traced shadows to maximize visual fidelity.</p>
<p>Gamers can also enable DLSS Super Resolution or DLAA in Giants Software's Farming Simulator 25, which launches today. Moreover, the fast-paced multiplayer melee action game Mortal Rite <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1655990/Mortal_Rite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> on Steam Early Access last week with support for DLSS Super Resolution.</p>
<p>NVIDIA had a marketing announcement to make, too. Starting today, users can get the<a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-bundles-indiana-jones-the-great-circle-with-geforce-rtx-40-gpus-full-path-tracing-dlss-3-5-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Indiana Jones and the Great Circle GeForce RTX 40 Series Bundle</a>. They will receive the game's Digital Premium Edition (regularly priced at $99.99 value) with the purchase at select retailers of a qualifying GeForce RTX 4090, 4080 SUPER, 4080, 4070 Ti SUPER, 4070 Ti, 4070 SUPER or 4070 desktop or graphics card, or a laptop with a GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU, RTX 4080 Laptop GPU, RTX 4070 Laptop GPU. On top of that, the Digital Premium Edition will allow early access to Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on December 6, three days before the official release date of December 9.</p>
<p>Circling back to the new GeForce Game Ready driver, it also adds support for one-click optimization of the following games: Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Delta Force, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered, and Red Dead Redemption.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/antstream-net-yaroze-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/retro-streaming-platform-antstream-adds-five-net-yaroze-games-to-its-lineup.1033521/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/antstream-net-yaroze-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Retro arcade streaming platform Antstream has announced that it has added five games from the cult classic PlayStation-era&nbsp;Net Yaroze<em>&nbsp;</em>initiative to its game catalog.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;Net Yaroze, it was essentially an early way of allowing bedroom developers to create games for the original PlayStation without needing to utilize "expensive and complex development kits", as a press release notes.</p>

<p>Those who were interested in&nbsp;Net Yaroze<em>&nbsp;</em>would have to pay a fee in order to receive a special PlayStation console, alongside software designed to help them realize their game creation dreams. They'd also gain access to technical help from Sony and a community of fellow&nbsp;Net Yaroze<em>&nbsp;</em>developers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/net-yaroze-antstream-announcement-arena.jpg?itok=UH5cPff5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/net-yaroze-antstream-announcement-arena.jpg?itok=UPFoQBQb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Net Yaroze allowed bedroom programmers to make their own games, such as the mech shooter&nbsp;<em>Arena</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>As an accompanying Antstream press release notes, these games weren't released commercially, and many of them are now considered to be lost since they haven't been made available in any shape or form since the late 90s.</p>

<p>Now, however, the streaming service has added five Net Yaroze games to its library, and Antstream CEO Steve Cottam says the service will "continue working with these fantastic creators and developers to continue to bring new titles to the Antstream platform", so more may well be on the way.</p>

<p>Here are the five Net Yaroze games that have been made available on Antstream.</p>

<ul><li><em>Time Slip&nbsp;</em>(puzzle-platformer in which you must manipulate time to clear stages)</li>
	<li><i>Pushy IIb&nbsp;</i>(block-pushing puzzler)</li>
	<li><em>Bouncer 2&nbsp;</em>(brick-breaking arcade-style game with "difficult physics-based challenges")</li>
	<li><em>Adventure Game&nbsp;</em>(exploration-heavy action RPG with dungeons, puzzles, and monsters to fight)</li>
	<li><em>Arena&nbsp;</em>(fast-paced mech shooter with a focus on multiplayer)</li>
</ul>


<p>The Net Yaroze initiative is far from the only element of old-school gaming to be threatened by the march of time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In recent years, enthusiastic fans have intervened to preserve the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/viva-pinata-pocket-paradise-prototype-preserved-by-forest-of-illusion" rel="nofollow">a prototype of DS game&nbsp;<em>Viva Pinata: Pocket Paradise</em></a>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/toontown-online-preserved-in-massive-preservation-effort" rel="nofollow">Disney MMO&nbsp;<em>Toowntown Online</em></a>, and even <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/free-wordle-launched-to-preserve-wordle-if-paywall-goes-up" rel="nofollow">the word game&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/free-wordle-launched-to-preserve-wordle-if-paywall-goes-up" rel="nofollow">Wordle</a>&nbsp;</em>(following on from its purchase by the New York Times).</p>

            <p>My strongest and most enduring memory of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> will always be creasing into complete hysterics watching my mate pile into a crumpled police officer with a wooden baseball bat in GTA 3 after school one time. Young’uns these days just don’t appreciate how revolutionary it was to be able to hit a cop with a thing after he’d already fallen over. Suffice it to say I’ve got good memories of the open world series’ nascent forays into 3D, though never enough to tempt me into revisiting them, especially given the poor reception to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-trilogy-definitive-edition">Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition</a>. I can sympathise. I’m annoyed just having to type a semicolon and a dash in the same game name.</p>
<p>If you’re in a similarly non-fussed position (I will never not be annoyed that ‘nonplussed’ doesn’t mean what it sounds like it should mean) I can’t imagine a lighting update that’s been available on the mobile versions for a while is enough to tempt you back. But what is a reporter's job if not pathetically treading water between chunklets of Grand Theft Auto news, upon the publishing of which Graham presses the button to release the nutritious pellets on which we all wholly subsist? I hope he doesn’t read that last sentence. I don’t get my pellet if the syntax becomes too convoluted. Moving swiftly on.</p>

<p>As reported by<a href="https://rockstarintel.com/gta-trilogy-remasters-get-big-new-update-three-years-after-release/"> Rockstar Intel</a>, the ‘Classic Lightning’ mode was a feature added last year when Rockstar released the Definitive Edition games on mobile in partnership with Netflix. The mode - which is now available in all versions as an toggleable graphics menu option - apparently “restores the look and feel of the sky in the original games”.</p><p>I can’t confirm this, but according to <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/gta-trilogy-definitive-edition-has-been-updated-on-pc-and-consoles-with-all-the-improvements-from-the-mobile-versions.1033440/">this Resetera thread</a>, the new update has also removed remaster-ers Grove Street Games from the splash screen, which seems incredibly gross and petty, whatever your thoughts on the quality of the release. Take-Two gonna Take-Two, I guess.</p>
<p>In other news Grandiose, Theftacular, and Automatic, Take Two are currently "highly confident" about a fall 2025 release date. That’s ‘Autumn’, for those of you who don’t break down in histrionic convulsions upon seeing a photograph of some beans on a bit of toasted bread.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what%E2%80%99s-happening-at-bleed-esports-player-payment-scandal-explained.1033512/</guid>

<p>BLEED Esports’ leadership team has come under fire once again for reportedly failing to pay players and staff. It has been claimed that for more than a year, the organisation has been lying to <strong>all of their players</strong> across multiple games, withholding salaries, and refusing to pay out tournament winnings.</p>



<p>In a straw-that-broke-the-camel’s-back move, the BLEED Esports Rainbow Six roster has pulled away from the organisation following a month of negotiation and communications with Ubisoft, and the players are now on an exposé mission.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-if-it-bleeds">If It BLEEDs</h2>



<p>The situation with BLEED Esports reached a tipping point when Patrick ‘MentalistC’ Fan, the R6 squad’s IGL, took to social media to slam BLEED’s leadership:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For the past year, BLEED has been lying to all of their players (Valorant, CS2, R6, OW, MLBB, Dota 2…) about payments, failing to pay salaries, making false promises, and withholding prize pools. They only ever provided us payslips with no proof of actual funds, a tactic they used to fool other organisations into thinking that they paid the buyouts of players.</p>



<p>For the past month, we have been consistently and clearly communicating with Ubisoft, pleading our case. We have clearly communicated with Ubisoft that:</p>



<p>BLEED has been ghosting us, having zero intention to cure their contract breach.</p>



<p>BLEED has been full of lies and false promises, and their words cannot be trusted.</p>



<p>As of the writing of this letter, our contract breach notice to BLEED has taken effect. We can now terminate our contracts with BLEED. We are awaiting Ubisoft’s final decision.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>MentalistC’s Twitter bio now marks him as a player for ‘NOTPAID R6S’, but moving forward, the roster will play under the name ‘BLED’. </p>



<p>He was backed up by other players, such as Taylor ‘Terdsta’ Ching, who claimed BLEED owed him a whopping $35,000. He insisted that he would be unable to pay his bills or even feed himself if it wasn’t for other avenues of income, like streaming.</p>



<p>In the wake of his scandal, seven members of BLEED (including a coach and an analyst) have vacated their Rainbow Six positions. One Counter-Strike coach claimed that BLEED has racked up hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt in the CS world. This allegation came from Aleksandar ‘kassad’ Trifunovic, who claimed that <a href="https://x.com/kassad/status/1856281399617106130" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BLEED’s CEO is actively ghosting</a> the situation and is fully aware of what’s happening.</p>



<p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://escorenews.com/en/r6/news/63631-bleed-r6-players-depart-the-organization-they-only-ever-provided-us-payslips-with-no-proof-of-actual-funds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EscoreNews</a> for the references.</em></p>



<p>The CEO, Mervyn Goh, has been scrutinised by fans and critics for the longest time. The bad press surrounding Goh is often insurmountable. In 2022, he allegedly beat a woman at a nightclub, and in 2023, it was claimed that the Singaporean government struck BLEED Esports from the registry.</p>



<p>If you <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/R6ProLeague/comments/1g297l4/a_deeper_dive_into_the_allegations_about_mervyn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">dive deeper into the topic</a>, you start to uncover references to ‘Mervyn Goh En Wei’ being embroiled in a vast array of legal issues.</p>



<p>Presently, nobody has been able to reach the CEO for a statement.</p>



<p>What do you think about this situation? If you’ve got anything to share, feel free to make a note in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideaki-itsuno-lightspeed-studios<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry 5&nbsp;</em>director Hideaki Itsuno has signed up with the newly-formed Japanese contingent of the Tencent-owned LightSpeed Studios, where he'll be creating "original AAA action game titles".</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.lightspeed-studios.com/news/Japan-Game-Development-Studio.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post on the Lightspeed website</a>, Itsuno will head up the appropriately-named LightSpeed Japan Studio, which marks "a major step in LightSpeed Studios' global expansion".</p>

<p>Itsuno describes his appointment as "an exciting new chapter for me", promising to create "aesthetic and innovative experiences for the global player community" and exhorting talented developers from around the world to "join [his team's] vision".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragons-dogma-2-hideaki-itsuno.jpg?itok=aN4GiMW0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragons-dogma-2-hideaki-itsuno.jpg?itok=yKdR8YhI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hideaki Itsuno is perhaps best-known for his work on&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma</em>&nbsp;and its sequel.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the aforementioned announcement post, LightSpeed Japan Studio will consist of two locations in Tokyo and Osaka, and it "offers a flexible and inclusive work environment".</p>

<p>If you're wondering where you've heard LightSpeed's name before, it's the co-developer of mobile smash hit&nbsp;<em>PUBG Mobile</em>&nbsp;(alongside Krafton, which is apparently also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton" rel="nofollow">currently working on a mobile version of&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em></a>).</p>

<p>Despite LightSpeed's best-known game being a mobile title, the fact Itsuno and Japan Studio will be working on "AAA action game titles" suggests that he'll be primarily working within the PC and console spaces.</p>

<p>Of course, we're still very early on in Itsuno's appointment and the lifespan of Japan Studio, so we'll have to wait and see exactly what he and his team cook up in future.</p>

<p>The BLAST R6 Major Montreal tournament is unfolding as we speak, and this weekend, it’ll wrap as the action moves away from ‘Phase Two’ into ‘Phase Three’. Presently, the sixteen teams that made it into the Swiss System portion of the $750,000 tournament are battling away, but in just a few days, the victor will be crowned.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the tournament isn’t having as strong an impact as the last BLAST R6 Major, which took place in Manchester, England. Per a report published by Esports Charts, Montreal’s opening days pulled in 36% fewer viewers than the May Major, and things are yet to improve.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-weaker-traction">Weaker Traction</h2>



<p>Despite the tournament being days away from ending, the viewer count hasn’t risen all that sharply. On the first day of the tournament, per Esports Charts, the Montreal Major’s viewership peaked at 55,000 users. By today, that number has managed to climb to 78,000, but the Manchester Major’s peak hit 162,000 viewers.</p>



<p>It was the most popular BLAST R6 Major ever – but it was admittedly helped by an intense grand final between Team BDS, the tournament’s favourite to win, and beastcoast, an underdog side on a tenacious streak.</p>



<p>In the report published <a href="https://escharts.com/news/r6-montreal-major-day-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Esports Charts</a>, it was mentioned that fewer co-casters were covering the action at Montreal, which might go some way towards explaining the lower viewership, but we’re talking a single-digit difference. There’s still a solid spread of teams present at the event, from FaZe Clan to Team Liquid, so the fans <strong>should </strong>be eagerly tuning into the action.</p>



<p>It’ll be interesting to see how things pick up going into the weekend. The grand final for the BLAST R6 Major Montreal is set to take place this Sunday, and it’ll hopefully be the biggest and most popular match of the event.</p>

<p>A God Pack is a set of opened cards that almost have to be seen to be believed in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket. Every man and his Growlithe are desperate to secure this most sacred of packs, and if you’re a regular Pokémon&nbsp;Pocket player with no idea what I’m talking about, here’s some quick background on a God Pack.</p>



<p>The Genetic Apex set kicked off Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket at launch. The collection features an array of super-special pulls, and the contents of each Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket pack boil down to pure luck and RNG—there are no <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-the-bent-pack-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bent Pack Tricks</a> or secret <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wonder-pick-exploit-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wonder Pick exploits</a> here.</p>



<p>This being said, if luck is on your side, there’s a slim chance you can pull a God Pack—and immortalize yourself in the annals of Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket history.</p>

<figure><figcaption>We can all dream. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>A God Pack is when every card in a Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket pack is either a Holographic, EX, Full Art, or Gold Crown</strong> <strong>card</strong>.</p>



<p>Ordinarily, you’re hoping for at least one of the above in each pack: Or two at a push! As of writing, the closest I’ve come to a God Pack is two occasions where I’ve had two different Full Art cards in the same pack.</p>



<p>Now, there’s a chance you dear reader haven’t even had two in a pack (don’t envy me, I’ve had plenty of stinkers too), but this is nothing compared to some of the obscene Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket pulls out there. Trickery and clever photo and video editing are part and parcel of the modern age, so not all “God Packs” are to be believed. However, a quick search of “God Pack” on either X or the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/hot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TCG Pocket subreddit</a> is guaranteed to leave your jaw on the floor.</p>



<p>I’ve seen multiple packs featuring <strong>five Full Arts</strong>, and it’s absurd. The lowest pull percentage for a Full Art is <strong>5.263%</strong>—according to Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket’s Offering Rates—and it boggles the mind how it’s possible to get two, let alone <em>five</em>.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-a-god-pack-in-pokemon-nbsp-tcg-pocket">How to get a God Pack in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket</h2>



<p><strong>You must get extremely lucky to get a God Pack in Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket as it’s a completely luck-based process.</strong></p>



<p>There are no special items to use, no one-time-use percentage boosters, and no superstitions in the world that can boost your odds of getting a God Pack. Like any gacha-based system, Pokémon&nbsp;TCG Pocket’s packs harness the concept of chance, inevitably leading to a ton of duplicates and disappointments once you begin to fill your compendium of creatures.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/meet-the-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-pacifist-whos-already-hit-prestige-without-killing-anyone<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> is a game all about shooting guns and killing other players. At least, that’s how it’s meant to be played. Not for one determined pacifist, however, who has managed to Prestige without killing a single player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Redditor Pilgore revealed his in-game stats after reaching Prestige 1, confirming a remarkable 0.00 K/D after 111 games, or 19 hours and 26 minutes of Multiplayer. That means he managed to gain enough experience to level up past 55 and trigger Prestige despite having zero kills. Perhaps even more remarkable, Pilgore achieved the feat with a 1.92 win ratio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How did Pilgore manage it? Why do this in the first place? And where does he go from here? IGN interviewed Pilgore, real name John, to find out, and obtained permission to publish one of his matches on the Nuketown map to show off his impressive pacifist tactics. Check it out in the video below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In short, Pilgore employs a combination of playing the objective (I know, rare for Call of Duty!), and using the Spy Cam Tactical equipment and Scrambler Field Upgrade to gain score during the match, then calls in the UAV, CUAV, and HARP scorestreaks as they become available. Pilgore also shoots down any enemy scorestreaks as soon as they come in. Pilgore does not shoot at enemy players at any point; rather, he plays Call of Duty like the most useful support class you could ever want.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you'd expect, Pilgore has many more victories in objective-based modes such as Hardpoint and Domination than K/D-focused modes such as Team Deathmatch and Kill Confirmed. And if you’re interested in Pilgore1’s Perks, he uses Flak Jacket, Gearhead, and Dispatcher to trigger Strategist, with the Tactical Expert wildcard granting an extra Tactical. "Four Spy Cams can genuinely get you UAV/CUAV on its own," he said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, why bother playing Call of Duty as a pacifist? It turns out Pilgore has done this before with previous Call of Duty games, joking with a friend that he could Prestige before him even if he got zero kills on Black Ops Cold War. “I enjoyed playing that way so I just kept on going,” Pilgore said. He managed to hit Prestige 15 on Cold War, 10 on Vanguard and Modern Warfare 2, and 15 on last year’s Modern Warfare 3 playing this way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s one hell of an achievement and shows incredible focus and discipline, but one thing that bothers me about all this is how Pilgore was able to avoid killing an enemy player just once, even accidentally. I play a lot of Call of Duty and I’ve often killed enemy players by mistake, simply by either pressing the wrong button at the wrong time, or having a rocket intended for a scorestreak blow up an enemy player who just happened to get in my way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was definitely risky at the start (previous games) and I got lucky a few times,” Pilgore explained. “I'd throw a Decoy grenade and it would sometimes hit somebody, luckily, it never got me a kill (yet). I've gotten much better at being careful after doing this for 51 Prestiges now. There's almost no worry of it happening this game as the Spy Cam has replaced Decoys for me.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pilgore added that he’s been lucky enough not to have an enemy player jump in his crosshairs while he’s shooting down scorestreaks. And it’s worth noting that the player who calls in a scorestreak gets the kills if it crashes down on other players, so there's no danger of an accidental kill there.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/12/ss-ac03caa8430a111c836669ad53651613069a0c67-1920x1080-1731411855835.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pilgore spends a lot of time shooting scorestreaks out of the sky. Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I also assumed that it would take an excruciatingly long time to gain enough XP to Prestige while playing as a pacifist, but Pilgore insisted his method is “actually a pretty decent way to get score/XP.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I consistently get at least 7,000 score a match,” he went on. “My tactics haven't really changed over the years. Experimented with different loadouts but the main gameplay has been the same. Earning XP doing this is much better than you'd think.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Keep going until I get a kill or get bored. I have a buttload of patience.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The inevitable next question is what’s next for Pilgore? Perhaps unsurprisingly, given his history playing Call of Duty as a pacifist, there’s no turning back now. “Keep going until I get a kill or get bored,” he vowed. “I have a buttload of patience.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking on Zombies mode?

			<p>The controversial GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition, which includes the first three 3D entries in the series, was patched today on PC and consoles to bring over a highly requested change and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://rockstarintel.com/gta-trilogy-remasters-get-big-new-update-three-years-after-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The patch</a>, which is now live on all PC storefronts, Xbox, and PlayStation, introduces the Classic Lighting Mode introduced in the mobile version of the collection last year. This mode restores the look and feel of the sky of the original games. To better highlight the differences between the vanilla lighting and the Classic Lighting Mode, Rockstar Games shared some comparison screenshots taken from the PC versions of all three games at maxed-out settings. You can check them out below.</p>

<p>Having not been updated in a long time, it seemed like Rockstar Games was done with the GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition patches, but thankfully, that was not the case, as the new Lighting Mode is a considerable improvement over the vanilla lighting. Some lingering issues still remain, but there's no doubt the remasters are in a much better state now than they were at release. You can learn more about these issues by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition/">launch review.</a></p>
<p>GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, iOS and Android devices.</p>

The system also features a high-velocity fan, silicone thermal pad, and alloy cooling fins to enhance heat dissipation.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The system can reduce charging temperatures by up to 20°C (68°F), providing a safer, more stable charging environment. This innovative feature is particularly beneficial during extended smartphone use, especially mobile gaming. By lowering the temperature, the device not only prevents overheating but also avoids performance drops and lag caused by high temperatures. As a result, gamers can enjoy a smooth, uninterrupted experience with a cool, comfortable feel. Additionally, the charger’s IML temperature display allows users to monitor temperature changes at a glance in real-time.</p>
<p>According to data from AUKEY Lab, the MagFusion GameFrost can charge an iPhone 16 Pro to 50% in an impressive 35 minutes. This efficiency not only minimizes downtime for users but also supports battery health by maintaining cooler charging temperatures, which helps to reduce battery wear over time.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>In addition to the Omnia-Frez cooling system, the MagFusion GameFrost innovatively offers a personalized experience that sets it apart from traditional wireless chargers, reflecting AUKEY's user-centric design philosophy. The device features dedicated buttons for wireless charging, cooling, and lighting control. When the battery is sufficiently charged, users can disable wireless charging and use the device solely as a cooling solution. Users can also switch between three cooling modes for optimal thermal management, and two LED lighting modes for a personalized atmosphere, enhancing the overall user experience.</p>
<p>Lastly, the MagFusion GameFrost is intuitive and easy to use. Users can simply snap their phone onto the charger’s strong magnetic holder to activate wireless charging and cooling with immediate effect. The charging pad’s smooth glass surface ensures a perfect scratch-free fit with the iPhone, while the back panel's curves and angles accommodate various hand shapes and grips.</p>
<p>MagFusion GameFrost retails at <strong>$42.99</strong> and is available for sale on <a href="https://www.aukey.com/discount/GAMEFROST10?redirect=%2Fproducts%2Flc-g10-magfusion-gamefrost-magnetic-wireless-charger-with-active-cooling-system" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener">AUKEY’s official website</a>.</p>

<p>On November 20, Stellar Blade will receive its first major expansion in the form of a Nier Automata crossover. This will bring new characters and missions to the game, and it’ll come hand-in-hand with photomode and several new outfits. In this snapshot guide, we’re walking through all the new Stellar Blade outfits being added alongside the Nier Automata DLC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-eve-s-new-outfits-in-stellar-blade">Eve’s New Outfits in Stellar Blade</h2>



<p>To usher in Stellar Blade’s first major expansion, Eve will get four new outfits:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>FourSeconds Black</strong></li>



<li><strong>FourSeconds Everyday Wear</strong></li>



<li><strong>War Dress</strong></li>



<li><strong>Neurolink Skin</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>That’s in addition to the four outfits introduced with the Nier Automata crossover: 2B, A2, YoRHa, and 2B Black. Eve will also pick up a stylish new accessory – the Symbol of Legacy. When you use this item, it’ll change how Tachy Mode appears in the game. </p>



<p>Here’s a glance at the new Stellar Blade outfits coming with the Nier Automata DLC:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It hasn’t yet been revealed how to unlock the Nier Automata outfits in Stellar Blade, but that will inevitably be confirmed when the DLC is released on November 20. Most likely, users will be able to purchase the new skins from ‘Emil’s Shop’, a fresh trader interface introduced with the Nier Automata DLC. </p>



<p>The most exciting element of the update is the arrival of photomode, which fans have been eagerly waiting for since the game was released in April. The team at Shift Up has also added further lip-synching support for additional languages, better options for customisation (such as Eve’s hair), and various quality-of-life improvements.</p>

			<p>Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi <a href="https://wccftech.com/yakuza-series-creator-reportedly-going-to-netease-while-tencent-is-rumored-to-be-acquiring-a-japanese-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left</a> SEGA three years ago to join NetEase, where he <a href="https://wccftech.com/nagoshi-studio-unveiled-by-netease-focused-on-global-console-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> his own Tokyo-based studio to make global console games.</p>
<p>The game designer was featured in a lengthy interview with Japanese magazine Famitsu <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202411/23768" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> yesterday. Nagoshi talked about various topics, but the most interesting tidbit is arguably that he believes the era where game size is the selling point will soon pass.</p>
<p><em>What I'm making now is an action adventure. After the experimental phase and the phase where the experiments are exhausted, we will move on to the phase of mass-producing assets, but I think it would be good if you thought of it as being on the eve of the mass-production phase. In that sense, it's going well, but in many ways, it's a bit large in scale. In addition, at first glance, the game system is complicated. But I don't want to make it a troublesome game... Well, it's difficult to talk about what I can't say at this point.</em></p>
<p><em>Anyway, I want to make it a game that is satisfying to play, but I don't want it to be a hassle. Even though there aren't many completely new games out there, there are so many titles out there that you can't play them all, including overseas. Looking at the situation, I think the volume of console games in the lives of average game fans may be a bit excessive. There are still many titles out there, but I feel that the era of games where volume is the selling point is about to pass.</em></p>
<p>The interesting thing is that he admits his next game is also going to be large in scale, which isn't surprising given that his last game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/yakuza-like-a-dragon-quest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Yakuza: Like a Dragon</a>, required 45.5 hours just for the main quest, while a completionist playthrough can take an average of 103 hours, according to How Long To Beat.</p>
<p>Anyway, Nagoshi said his team is currently assessing the proper size for this game, though the map they've created is already large - maybe too much.</p>
<p><em>One characteristic that is particularly relevant in overseas markets is that a certain amount of volume is necessary, and although there is a sense that "it has to be at least this much," I think that this is also a kind of fixed idea. So we continue to discuss, "What is the appropriate volume at the time of releasing the game?" I'm currently thinking hard about how to predict or measure that volume and how to arrange the game's density to suit the appropriate volume and size.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>We will soon have to enter the mass production phase of assets, so it will soon be time to decide on the final volume estimate, but we are currently thinking about whether this is really good enough. Of course, we have a map, but the one at the current stage is too large. I started by studying existing games and creating a fairly large map. I had already created roads and highways. Now, I'm shrinking it little by little and looking for a good balance for the game.</em></p>
<p>The Yakuza creator also revealed that the team size is around 80. He'd like to share more about the project in the near future, too. Until then, stay tuned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-god-of-war-ragnarok-pssr-framerate-down/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The God of War Ragnarok PlayStation 5 Pro patch is among the best ones to date, introducing new options that provide a deeper insight into the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler alongside great visual and performance improvements.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at Digital Foundry analyzed the game's PS5 Pro patch, highlighting the new features that it introduces and how it takes advantage of the console's power and features. The patch replaces the standard Performance Mode with a PS5 Pro Enhanced mode that uncaps the framerate so that those with a 120Hz screen with VRR can enjoy a high framerate experience that consistently runs at above 60 FPS, hitting the 100 FPS range rather often.</p>
<p>The most interesting feature of the God of War Ragnarok PlayStation 5 Pro patch, however, is the new Scaling options, which include PSSR anti-aliasing and the TAA option the game has featured since launch. These options, which can be switched on the fly, provide a great insight into the performance cost of the PSSR upscaler, which does a great job enhancing the image quality and the perception of distant detail using the same 1440p base resolution as TAA but does impact performance. In one of the game's most CPU-intensive scenarios, using PSSR over TAA made the game run at 10 frames per second less or more. As such, this essentially confirms the PSSR cost on performance of 2ms every frame that was revealed in the internal documents leaked a few months ago.</p>
<p>Rounding out the improvements the God of War Ragnarok PlayStation 5 Pro patch brings in its new enhanced mode is the presence of all the image quality features seen in the base game's Quality Mode, including the light ray tracing for the scene-aligned cube maps, which is still not available in the PC version of the game. All of these features make the patch one of the best released to date, enhancing the experience considerably in both image quality and performance over the base model.</p>

<p>Hideaki Itsuno, the name behind the Devil May Cry and Dragon’s Dogma franchises, has a new home. The director has taken up a leadership position at <strong>LightSpeed Studios Japan</strong>, a subsidiary of the giant Tencent.</p>



<p>Itsuno will use all his expertise to develop new AAA action games. Hideaki spoke about his new challenge in a <a href="https://www.lightspeed-studios.com/news/Japan-Game-Development-Studio.html">statement to the press</a>.</p>



<p>“<em>Joining LIGHTSPEED STUDIOS is an exciting new chapter for me.</em> <em>With LightSpeed’s strong development capabilities and global network, I’m looking forward to creating original AAA action games together with the amazing team and building innovative and beautiful experiences for the global community of gamers.</em> <em>We welcome all talented and passionate game developers from around the world to join our vision</em>.”</p>



<p>Based in Osaka and Tokyo, the studio’s idea is to build experiences that reach global audiences. Jerry Chen, president of LightSpeed Studios, had this to say:</p>



<p>“<em>The creation of LightSpeed Japan Studio is a significant step in the expansion of LIGHTSPEED STUDIOS and demonstrates our commitment to bringing the best possible games to our players.</em>”</p>



<p>There’s no doubt that the initiative isn’t messing around, signing one of Japan’s leading game developers. Obviously, we don’t have any more details about Hideaki Itsuno’s next adventure. Knowing the director’s style, we can at least hope for addictive combat.</p>

            <p>
In The Valley of the Gods, the promising but now permanently "on hold" adventure from the team behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/firewatch">Firewatch</a>, had some eye-popping water technology. 
</p>
<p>
Matthew Wilde, who worked on Firewatch at Campo Santo before the team was absorbed into Valve six years ago, has now <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/skilful.bsky.social/post/3lakopz32k22x">shared</a> a fresh look at In The Valley of the Gods on social media, showing what could have been. 
</p>
<p>
"I do often tend to work on liquidy things," Wilde wrote. "This was the water test we did at Campo Santo pre Valve move." 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Matthew Wilde, the Valve developer behind the water shader for Counter-Strike 2, has shared a rare gameplay footage. It shows the water technology that was tested for In The Valley of Gods before Valve acquired the company Campo Santo. Team shelved the game not so long after… <a href="https://t.co/wIs6Im8KYx">pic.twitter.com/wIs6Im8KYx</a></p>— ‎Gabe Follower (@gabefollower) <a href="https://twitter.com/gabefollower/status/1855941378301141312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 11, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
There is, sadly, absolutely no suggestion we'll see In the Valley of the Gods anytime soon. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firewatch-review">Firewatch was excellent</a>, and Campo Santo's follow-up - which would have followed a budding filmmaker as she explored 1920s Egypt in search of archeological secrets - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firewatch-developer-reveals-next-game-in-the-valley-of-the-gods">looked hugely promising</a>. 
</p>
<p>
But, in 2019, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-acquires-firewatch-developer-campo-santo">Valve and the potential to work on Half-Life: Alyx came calling</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firewatch-devs-egyptian-adventure-in-the-valley-of-gods-officially-on-hold-at-valve">In The Valley of the Gods was later confirmed to have been shelved indefinitely</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Wilde's reference to working on "liquidy things" is a reference to some of his other work since, such as the impressive water shader technology in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-alyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a> that lets you slosh around bottles of beer, as well as the water technology in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter-Strike 2</a>. 
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Spent a good chunk of lock-down doing this important work. Boozy liquid shader, now available in the latest update for Half-Life: Alyx <a href="https://t.co/Iw9h98pmEg">pic.twitter.com/Iw9h98pmEg</a></p>— Matthew Wilde (@skilful) <a href="https://twitter.com/skilful/status/1265875309980643329?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2020</a></blockquote></div>

What's next for Wilde and his former Campo Santo colleagues? Well, there's rumblings that there's more from Valve's most famous series on the horizon. Is it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-evidence-of-fully-fledged-half-life-game-revealed-by-valve-dataminer">finally time for Half-Life 3</a>?
