<p>Civilization 7 is getting its latest update that aims to solve a number of issues players have had with the latest game in the legendary series. In a new post on Steam, along with a subsequent explainer video, developer Firaxis listed some of the improvements and additions coming in Civilization 7’s Update 1.1.1.</p>



<p>Some of those updates include the addition of Quick Move as a toggle option, Mount Everest as a new natural wonder, the ability to rename Settlements and commanders, and various UI updates.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In the developer update video on the patch, creative director Ed Beach also touched on a new “Start Position” option in relation to map generation. Beach says the default setting called “Standard” will feel “a lot like Civ 6 where the continents are move varied and less predictable.” There is also a “Balanced” option that “puts everyone on an even playing field”.</p>



<p>There’s even a restart button to allow players to quickly restart a match with the same settings and Civilizations if they don’t like their starting position. </p>



<p>Regarding the game’s UI, there are new notifications for when you are under attack as well as new indicators for crises in the status bar. The rest of the patch notes for Civilization 7 Update 1.1.1 can be found in the dropdown below or via their <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-map-size-explained-how-big-is-the-map/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Atomfall map is split up into several key areas you’ll backtrack through. It’s a dense, detailed world, and well worth exploring. But if you want to know how big the map is and what it holds, we’ve got answers. </p>



<p>An RPG’s map size is an unavoidable question at this point. I’d say the sandbox stylings of GTA kickstarted the topic many years ago. Ubisoft popularized the construction of gigantic maps, and now it’s commonplace. We have reached a point where maps are getting too big, and it’s nice when an RPG cuts back on the square-feet of land.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-review-rebellion-curveball/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall</a> promises an adventure through an alternate-history Cumbria. The area is quite a decent part of England, but has Rebellion brought Cumbria to life, to scale?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-atomfall-open-world">Is Atomfall Open World?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A wicked Wicker Man. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Atomfall is not a bona fide open-world title and is akin to a semi-open-world title featuring several interconnected biomes.</strong></p>



<p>The best way to describe <a href="https://atomfall.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Atomfall</a>‘s map is like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands</a>. It has a ton of large-scale areas, but you need to go through a loading screen to get to them, so it’s not a completely open world. I prefer this kind of map in many ways as it allows the developer to concentrate their efforts on creating unique, focused biomes.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-big-is-atomfall-s-map-all-areas-explained">How Big is Atomfall’s Map? All Areas Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Collectively, Atomfall’s map is comparable to a medium-sized open world game and consists of six large areas.</strong></p>



<p>Atomfall is made up of six main biomes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Casterfell Woods</li>



<li>The Interchange</li>



<li>Sewer Tunnels</li>



<li>Slatten Dale</li>



<li>Skethermoor</li>



<li>Wyndham Village</li>
</ul>



<p>Outside of The Interchange and Sewer Tunnels, the remaining four areas are all outdoors. They feature an assortment of POIs, NPCs, enemies, hidden bunkers and underground areas, and mines. To explore one of the biomes inside out, you’re looking at several hours each, quite easily.</p>



<p>The Interchange is the basis of the story, whereas the Sewer Tunnels are an efficient way of getting from area to area.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-atomfall-area-pois">All Atomfall Area POIs</h2>



<p>Each main biome is split into several locations of interest. If you need reference points or reminders, we’ve put together a handy table showing you every key area and where they are.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/steel-hunters-the-final-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The World of Tanks studio is taking its fight into the future.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">On paper, Steel Hunters is a serious left turn for World of Tanks developer Wargaming. But just because the developer’s next project is rooted in a sci-fi, futuristic setting with larger-than-life mechs doesn’t mean they’re not tapping into their 27 years of multiplayer expertise for this mech hero shooter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I spent about 45 minutes racing other mechs to an extraction point in Steel Hunters’ battle royale-lite extraction mode, trying out half of its seven-character launch roster. Although I hit a few snags as I got myself used to controlling a building-size robot shaped like a spider, I could see Wargaming’s multiplayer pedigree on full display.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Steel Hunters - March 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from a short tutorial, which introduced me to Steel Hunters’ movement and controls, I spent all of my time in one mode. This extraction-based mode was kind of like a scaled-down battle royale: a few squads of two are dropped onto a map and sent toward points of interest, picking up helpful stuff along the way. Each mech is fully loaded out with weapons and abilities, so instead of guns or armor like in Fortnite, you’ll pick up various upgrades for your mech’s stats, healing items, and experience points.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you can find some loot in the wild, most of the upgrades and loot you’ll find in-match come from downing nearby NPC drones. These weaker enemies are scattered all over each map and put up just enough of a fight that they’re a pain to deal with if another squad is attacking you as well.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Different points of interest pop up during the match, giving you and your non-AI opponents something to race toward against each other, creating random chokepoints around helpful supply drops. Eventually, an extraction point gets marked on the map, beckoning all remaining squads towards the final objective. Once you get there, you’ll need to defend the extraction point (or attack it if someone beats you there) for a little while before the match ends.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Players descending on the chokepoint trying to outflank each other using their mechs’ various toolkits to their advantage was always the best part of the matches I played.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This was always the best part of the matches I played, as players descended on the chokepoint trying to outflank each other using their mechs’ various toolkits to their advantage. Maybe the agile Fenris uses their speed to flank an unsuspecting duo as they try to maintain control over the extraction point while the self-healing Razorside draws cover, ducking behind cover to patch themself up. Or maybe the sniper, Heartbreaker, might post up behind the defensive, map-controlling Weaver as they set up defensive barriers to protect their glass cannon teammate.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I played all four of those mechs in different matches, favoring Heartbreaker and Weaver the most. Weaver has this extremely satisfying Gatling gun that just melts enemy health and shields and their movement felt the best. Aiming down sights with Heartbreaker reveals weak points in every enemy, delivering extra reward for patient, precise play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If there was any problem with the demo I played, it was the in-between stuff. While it was fun to pick off weaker enemies, grab their loot, and find other players, the maps all felt a little too big up until the end. I’m certain some of this came from the fact that I was playing against AI-controlled bots in an early build of the game, but that inconsistent pace felt at odds with the relatively quick match times.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To give the team at Wargaming the benefit of the doubt, the studio is a well-oiled multiplayer machine at this point. Just because Steel Hunters trades historical context for futuristic fiction doesn’t mean the studio’s throwing the baby out with the bath water. It’s clear that Wargaming has been through a few multiplayer game launches in the past based on its launch plans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starting out with a manageable scale for its upcoming early access launch on April 2nd, Steel Hunters is going to launch with 7 playable characters, one mode, and only a few maps to start out—and no monetization. This calculated approach to launch, with the promise of new content every 5-6 weeks, shows this team’s pedigree and tact when it comes to multiplayer games. This approach gives me a lot of faith in Wargaming’s ability to listen to its player base and take feedback as it moves toward an eventual 1.0 release. Wargaming even teased the first new character coming to Steel Hunters post-launch, reiterating its commitment to three-month seasons.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re hoping to hop into Steel Hunters, you won’t have to wait long, as it launches into early access on April 2nd.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Just a week after launch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" data-ref-id="5000-571922">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> appears to be the success story that Ubisoft is in need of right now. Just hours after it arrived, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-reaches-impressive-milestone-in-just-one-day/1100-6530275/">Ubisoft confirmed that 1 million people were playing the game</a>, and after the crucial first weekend, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-recruits-2-million-players-to-the-brotherhood-in-its-first-weekend/1100-6530301/">that figure jumped to 2 million players</a>. One of the big metrics that the game has been judged by is its concurrent players on Steam, and while it hasn't yet surpassed the numbers set by 2020's Assassin's Creed Valhalla, that might be an unfair comparison to make.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-compare-assassins-creed-shadows-launch-to-the-perfect-storm-valhalla-benefitted-from-ubisoft-internal-email-says-compare-it-to-origins-odyssey-and-mirage" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, a Ubisoft source revealed that Shadows was responsible for the second-highest day-one sales revenue in the Assassin's Creed franchise, while Valhalla held onto its top spot. According to the internal email shown to IGN, 27% of Shadows' total "activations" were on PC--covering various distribution channels on that platform--with Steam playing a major role as this was the first Assassin's Creed game in several years to launch day-one through that storefront.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1679543929" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

Ubisoft also noted that player engagement is at "record levels" and feedback across "moderated, verified platforms" remains very positive.</p><p>Overall, Shadows is off to a good start, and while it doesn't match or exceed several records set by Valhalla, Ubisoft did note that the 2020 Assassin's Creed game benefitted from a "perfect storm" of conditions. This was during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic when people were forced to stay and work from home, and with the launch of the Xbox Series X|S and PS5 consoles, more people turned to video games for entertainment.</p><p>Other crucial factors here include Shadows launching in March--several previous entries were released during the lucrative Q4 period--the lack of an early access period as a selling point, and the premium tier of Ubisoft's monthly subscription service offering Shadows as part of its gaming library. Ubisoft+ is also available directly on Xbox consoles, which makes it more challenging to properly compare the sales of Shadows to other recent games in the franchise.</p><p>"Valhalla launched under extraordinary conditions--in the middle of a global pandemic, with widespread lockdowns and brand-new console hardware," the internal memo read. "It was a perfect storm we may never see again. That's why it's more meaningful to compare Shadows to entries like Origins, Odyssey, and Mirage--games released in more typical cycles. And in that frame, Shadows is already setting a new bar as illustrated above."</p><p>The reported success of Shadows arrives at a crucial time for Ubisoft, as last year's Star Wars Outlaws underperformed and saw <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-stock-sinks-to-10-year-low-as-star-wars-outlaws-underperforms/1100-6526262/">company stock sink to its worst figure in a decade</a>. Recently, there have also been reports that Ubisoft and its individual franchises might be up for sale, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-refuses-to-comment-on-tencent-rumors-but-says-its-exploring-options-to-maximize-value/1100-6528718/">Tencent</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-horribly-managed-investor-says-report-claims-ea-and-microsoft-might-buy-franchises/1100-6530071/">Microsoft, and EA</a> possibly preparing to make a deal.</p>

                <p>Over five years ago, Paradox Interactive announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-a-revival-o/1100-6465762/" data-ref-id="1100-6465762">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>, the long-awaited sequel to 2004's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-review/1900-6113468/" data-ref-id="1900-6113468">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines</a>. As the game faced multiple delays and switched developers, fans had to wait even longer. But now, the World of Darkness looks a little brighter and Bloodlines 2 may be arriving soon.</p><p>The Entertainment Software Rating Board <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40336/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has given Bloodlines 2 an M rating</a>, which could mean that a release date announcement will come soon. The only details about the story from the ESRB's description are that players will be tasked with helping two vampires regain their memories and lost powers while facing an uprising among the undead.</p><p>Bloodlines 2's Mature rating appears to largely be due to the game's combat, which allows players to violently dispatch enemies using physical and vampiric powers. Beheadings, claw-slashing, and snapping necks are all options, and player-characters will be able to feed on human NPCs to sustain themselves. Somewhat humorously, the ESRB also shared a few samples of the game's sexually suggestive dialogue.</p><p>The game will put players in control of an elder vampire whom they can customize to determine the character's gender and appearance, as well as their vampire clan and special abilities. Bloodlines 2's developer, The Chinese Room, previously disclosed that players will also be able to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-bloodlines-2-will-make-you-a-pain-in-the-neck/1100-6527046/" data-ref-id="1100-6527046">find human NPCs whom they can romance</a>. But even if fans choose to play their vampires as lovers, they still need to drink blood to survive.</p><p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will be available on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> will return to the world of The Walking Dead by offering up a cache of assets for players and developers to go build themed mini-games with.
</p>
<p>
Characters from The Walking Dead TV show such as Rick, Michonne and Daryl previously popped up in Fortnite as player skins. This latest crossover with Robert Kirkman's zombie franchise will add antihero Negan - responsible for perhaps the series' most grisly moment - as a skin next. 
</p>
<p>
Negan's baseball bat Lucille is among the items from the franchise being added as props to Fortnite. A selection of comic book-inspired walkers (zombies) will also be included. Additionally, you'll be able to switch on a post-processing effect to make in-game experiences have more of a comic book-style effect.

<p>
In a press release, Epic Games said it hoped the assets would inspire The Walking Dead "role-playing survival RPGs, prison escape roguelikes, and chaotic free–for-all shoot 'em ups" to be made in Fortnite.
</p>
<p>
As with previous licenses, such as Lego, creators of user-made experiences agree to share 12 percent of Fortnite's engagement payout with the owner of the property - in this case, Skybound.
</p>
<p>
In other Fortnite news, today's latest update to the game has included files relating to Sabrina Carpenter (as spotted by <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1904507845845885343">prolific Fortnite leaker ShiinaBR</a>), all but confirming the Espresso-loving popstar as the next icon set to take centre stage in the game's Guitar Hero-esque Fortnite Festival mode.

<p>
Previous stars such as Lady Gaga, Billie Eilish and Snoop Dogg have become available as skins in-game alongside their arrival as the next Fortnite Festival headliner, with a season pass for the mode that includes a selection of digital instrument cosmetics and music tracks by the artist. 
</p>
<p>
And finally, today brings the launch of Fortnite OG Season 3. This takes the classic version of Fortnite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-are-scrambling-to-solve-the-mystery-of-fortnites-looming-meteor">into the era of the meteor</a> - now, incredibly, seven years ago.

            <p>Sony has released system software updates for both the PlayStation 4 and PS5.</p>
<p>Kicking things off with the PS5, we have Version: 25.02-11.00.00. This version has made it "simpler to view details about activities", Sony said in the update notes.</p>
<p>Unicode 16.0 emojis are now also supported on PS5, meaning they can now be used in messages.</p>

<p>You can check out the full PS5 changelog below, as <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/hardware/ps5/system-software-info/">laid out by Sony</a> itself.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, while we may now be in the PS5 generation, Sony is still issuing updates for PS4.</p>
<p>The latest PS4 update, system software update 12.50, is more typical of the stability updates Sony likes releasing to patch various exploits used to modify or jailbreak consoles. The patch notes are short and very to the point.</p>
<p>"We've improved the messages and usability on some screens," reads a post on PlayStation.com.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-ps3-gets-new-system-software-update-19-years-after-release">Sony also released an update for its PS3</a>, a console which is now old enough to buy itself a pint down at the pub here in the UK.</p>

		<p>Taking a break from all the real world war machines and historical battling, Wargaming’s next foray is a full-on sci-fi mech battler. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/steel-hunters">Steel Hunters</a> is launching into Early Access on 2nd April, with Wargaming aiming to push ahead for a full 1.0 launch in relatively short order. We’ve been hands on with the game ahead of time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Steel Hunters Early Access Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fEr0Sd4iNSE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Steel Hunters is a pretty fun time. Sure, my opinion might be coloured by going completely undefeated while visiting Wargaming’s team, DPS Games in Guildford, and that fact would have been skewed by largely playing against bots while being paired up with very experienced play testers, but I can only imagine that it would still be fun even if I’d lost a few times?</p>


<p>A huge part of that enjoyment is found in the Hunters themselves. There’s a broad variety of designs, from fairly standard bipedal soldier-y types, to lithe snipers and hovering drone-summoning support, but the stars of the show are the animalistic designs, with spiders, bears and dogs all represented in the initial line up of styles. They feel like legally distinct Zoids, since the narrative is that these towering robots have been implanted with human consciousness, rather than having pilots or being AI. Not that it really matters once you start to smash them together like robot action figures – actually a rather apt comparison, when seeing how the models have been constructed out of dozens, if not hundreds of individual parts.</p>
<p>There’s good, strong contrast between each character and their roles. Razorside is one of two basic all-rounders with a standard assault rifle, while Heartbreaker is the sniper, with stealth abilities to improve their escapability. It really is the animal designs that shine, though. Ursus is the bear-like bot, with a close range shotgun and tough ice armour ability to reward you with getting in close, while Fenris is speedier, comes with energy abilities to quickly close range and drop a ball of damaging energy –&nbsp;this quickly became my favourite character for chasing down fleeing opponents after knocking their shields, and then finishing them at close range.</p>


<p>Each Hunter has both a fairly lengthy skill tree of unlocks to boost power a few percentage points and tweak their abilities, as well as a suite of Mods and Gear to unlock and choose between. Razorside can mod his Assault Rifle, for example, to switch between a fully automatic and burst firing modes.</p>
<p>Taking them into battle, DPS Games has struck a fine balance between size, heft and speed. Coming in at around 8 meters tall, you’re the size of a mature tree, big enough to smash through buildings with ease – literally just walk at them fast enough and they’ll get out the way – and the three maps in the game so far do a great job of selling that sense of scale. There’s a real feel of being a big and heavy machine with the default walking speeds, but you’re much more mobile than that, really. There’s perfect responsiveness to quick looking around with mouse &amp; keyboard, and sprinting just tips the pace from the “realistically stompy” end of the scale to the “fast, but more fun” side. That contrasts strongly with the slow rate of weapon reloading, which forces you to play tactically, even at full speed.</p>
<p>Steel Hunters will launch into Early Access with one game mode called Last Stand, a light riff on ideas from the battle royale and extraction shooter genres. You drop in at the start of the match with six pairs of Hunters spaced evenly around the map, with the early goal being to quickly find and harvest resources from fairly mindless drones nearby. Given the initial spacing and nearby points of interest, it’s pretty likely that you’ll run into one of the neighbouring duos quite quickly, giving that early game combat to help whittle down the field.</p>
<p>You’re fairly underpowered at this point with just the base abilities of your character and without having ramped up your stats with the ultra-simplistic looting. In addition to ammo and repair kits, Drones and caches will drop triangular, diamond and circular stat boosts to increase your structural health, shields and damage output. They come in the standard looting colours – white, green, blue and purple –&nbsp;and I appreciate just how straightforward grabbing them is. You can have two of each type, and you can see what your partner has equipped in the UI, making the judgement calls on what to grab or what to share as simple as glancing at the bottom corner of the screen.</p>

<p>After the first few minutes, a simple objective pops up, typically heading to a zone where high value and more aggressive drones are about to spawn in. The potential rewards are increased here, but so too is the chance of bumping into other teams as the objective draws players together. Eventually, it’s all brought to a head by a timed extraction, tasking you with reaching the point on the map and capturing and holding out for two minutes. It’s that last ditch chance for any surviving teams to butt heads, leading either to a successful extraction or a team winning by being the last ones standing.</p>
<p>It’s short, it’s pithy, it’s effective. Last Stand matches doesn’t last all that long –&nbsp;maybe 20 minutes or so –&nbsp;and the pace is kept up by the straightforward goals of quickly levelling, grabbing power boosts and then facing off in that final stage. DPS is working on further game modes that will layer in further ideas on this format –&nbsp;Starfall Harvest is a mode that was originally meant for launch, but needs a little more time to be refined –&nbsp;and down the line there could easily be modes that mix up team sizes, objectives and everything else.</p>

<p>Looking to hit the ground and get stomping, Steel Hunters will start off with no monetisation in Early Access. Only once Wargaming and DPS are happy with the game’s progress and potential will they start to introduce monetisation and push for a 1.0 launch, but there’s already a planned rollout of content through the first couple of months. April will be Season 0 with Season 1 coming in May and bringing new hunters to the table. There’s also plans to adjust the UI, HUD, the overarching Hunter progression and more in tandem with early player feedback.</p>
<p>The most important thing is that the core of the game already feels solid, and that there’s some great Hunter designs with really strong contrasts in their gameplay and tactical combat potential. Now, the only question is, do I risk my 100% record when the game is opened to the masses?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-upscaler-better-image-quality-taa/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro AI-powered PSSR upscaler has made some nice progress lately, so much so that it now reportedly always delivers better image quality than TAA, temporal anti-aliasing.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-assassins-creed-shadows-tech-qa-rtgi-shader-compilation-taa-and-more" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> regarding the revamped version of the Anvil Engine that powers Assassin's Creed Shadows, Engine Technical architects Nicolas Lopez and Pierre Fortin and Project Lead Programmer Rendering Sébastien Daigneault commented on why the PlayStation 5 Pro version of the game currently doesn't support the PSSR upscaler, saying that, at the time of shipping the game, they found better results with TAA.</p>
<p>However, after an in-depth collaboration with Sony over the past few months, many issues have been addressed, especially regarding moving vegetation and water, issues that have been found in other games as well. As such, PSSR now always delivers better image quality than TAA, and support will be added in the future. Alongside PSSR support, the PlayStation 5 Pro version of Assassin's Creed Shadows will also get ray-traced reflections in Balanced Mode, providing better visuals at a higher framerate than Quality Mode.</p>
<p>While Assassin's Creed Shadows undoubtedly looks great on PlayStation 5 Pro, the game's visuals truly shine on PC, especially on system configurations that can handle all the ray tracing features the game has to offer. Even without all the bells and whistles, the latest entry in the series is definitely worth playing for fans of the franchise's open-world RPG approach, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">review</a>.</p>

            <p>Game development can be stressful, I'm sure you've heard. The director of fighting game series <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken">Tekken</a> yesterday shared an anecdote about how wild that stress can get. Speaking about the release of Tekken 4 in 2001, director Katsuhiro Harada remembered it didn't perform as well as previous games. And the game's relatively weak reception (alongside a lack of support at Bandai Namco) sent his body into a spiral of ill-health from anxiety. </p>
<p>"I was under so much stress at the time that I developed a mysterious condition where all the hair on the right side of my body fell out - just the right side," said the director in <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1904208862754038011">a post on Xitter</a>. "Even the hair on my arms, eyebrows, and eyelashes disappeared."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>If it sounds unusual that hair loss might affect only one side of the body, it's not actually that uncommon for balding to occur on one side before the other. Conditions like <a href="https://www.bad.org.uk/pils/alopecia-areata/">alopecia areata</a> can be activated from stress and cause hair loss from eyebrows, eyelashes, and facial hair. It's basically an immune system response - your body feels under threat and goes into overdrive, attacking and inflaming even its own hair follicles. Of course, I don't know if this is what was going on with Harada's body at the time - I was in school, ignoring the maths teacher. But the developer is convinced that work pressures definitely caused the problem.</p>
<p>"Actually, there was a period - just for about a year before development on Tekken 5 began - when I left Namco due to the stress and shock. It’s not a widely known fact, though," continued Harada in the post, as spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/tekken-producer-katsuhiro-harada-opens-up-about-the-severe-side-effects-of-stress-he-experienced-while-developing-tekken-4/">Automaton</a>.</p>
<p>The developer made the comments after a random follower praised Tekken 4 for being "the most authentic and adult Tekken ever released". Praise which Harada notes is only offered with hindsight.</p>
<p>"But back then, I was absolutely bombarded with criticism," he said. "I didn’t have a single ally. Not one. That’s a well-known story inside the company.</p>
<p>"Now, in the present day, the critics have all forgotten their complaints, and only those who want to praise the game remain. That’s the only reason it's being treated like a masterpiece. For me, whether good or bad, this title remains a constant reminder and lesson to myself."</p>
<p>Years later, we're now sitting pretty on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a>, and Harada remains the director of the series. Did you know he once <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-tekken-director-failed-to-get-kfcs-colonel-sanders-in-the-fighting-game-but-here-are-10-other-corporate-mascots-he-could-try">tried to convince KFC to let him put Colonel Sanders in the fighting game</a>? Anyway, the latest entry is pretty swell according to our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tekken-8-review">Tekken 8 review</a>, although I'm still waiting for my favourite characters to join the party. Most recently we've <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/annoying-little-sister-anna-williams-is-coming-to-tekken-8-in-second-season-of-dlc">seen Anna Williams appear</a>, alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tekken-8s-next-fighter-is-clive-actually">guest character Clive</a> from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a>. Every time Lei Wulong is left on the bench, I weep a single tear. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fortnite’s early access FPS game mode, Ballistic, is finally getting a new map, Hammer Fall, three months after it launched.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite’s Ballistic game mode was released in early access on December 11, 2024, and since that day, players have been messing about in just one map, Skyline 10. However, Fortnite has just announced v.34.20, which will introduce Ballistic’s first new map since launch, along with balancing changes, economy adjustments and bug fixes.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-hammer-fall-gets-added-to-fortnite-ballistic">Hammer Fall Gets Added to Fortnite Ballistic</h2>



<p>Hammer Fall is the latest castle-themed map introduced for Fortnite Ballistic, adding a medieval theme to the game mode. The “castle’s verticality” will differentiate this map from Skyline 10, providing “comfortable cover, angles to hold, and corners to play.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hammer Fall will first be released as a shell map, meaning it will arrive without any environmental art. This will allow the devs to quickly change the map’s layout if there’s any feedback. The final art and finishing touches will be added to Hammer Fall once Fortnite Ballistic players thoroughly test it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-ballistic-balancing-and-economy-changes">Fortnite Ballistic Balancing and Economy Changes</h2>



<p>The new Fortnite Ballistic v34.20 update will add buffs to weapons like Hammer Pump Shotgun, Frenzy Auto Shotgun, Thunder Burst SMG and Striker AR. Some weapon prices have been adjusted, too.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-weapon-buffs">Weapon Buffs</h3>



<ul>
<li>Hammer Pump Shotgun’s fire rate has slightly increased, and its point-blank damage has increased significantly.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Frenzy Auto Shotgun’s point-blank and mid-range damage have increased.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Thunder Burst SMG’s damage and fire rate have slightly increased.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The range at which damage falloff begins has been reduced for the Striker AR.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-economy-adjustments">Economy Adjustments</h3>



<ul>
<li>Reaper Sniper Rife: Price decreased from 4700 to 4500 Credits.</li>



<li>Striker AR: Prince increased from 2500 to 2700 Credits.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Nemesis AR: Price increased from 2500 to 2700 Credits.</li>



<li>Drum Gun: Price decreased from 3500 to 3200 Credits.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-upcoming-changes-to-fortnite-ballistic-nbsp">Upcoming Changes to Fortnite Ballistic&nbsp;</h2>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/ballistic-34-20-balance-changes-and-more" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> for the Fortnite Ballistic v34.20 update, the developers addressed all the feedback they have received so far. Players want new maps, weapons, gadgets, additional starter pistols, better ways to deal with AFK players, new additions to the HUD, and efficient inventory management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers have stated that adding new weapons and gadgets to Ballistic is one of their main priorities, and they will arrive soon. New pistol options will also come. They are currently figuring out how to deal with AFK players. However, they have confirmed that an “option to surrender” is in development and will likely arrive in summer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The devs have discussed new crosshair options and ways to improve inventory management regarding HUD additions. However, they don’t have concrete plans to share right now. They are working on a change to show which player on your team has the Rift Point device better.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, their other major priority is “dialing in the first-person feel and improving the core of how the game handles first-person weapons.” These are being worked on and will be revealed in the “improvements and fixes” sections of upcoming blog posts.&nbsp;</p>

Ubisoft is telling employees that Steam “played a major role” in Shadows’ performance on PC, without revealing exact sell-through numbers. It says early results “are a strong validation of our decision to return to the platform.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Generally, Ubisoft is talking up player engagement, which is at “record levels,” and “feedback across moderated, verified platforms — those less affected by review bombing — remains incredibly positive.” Shadows was also the most-wishlisted Ubisoft game of all time, and it’s doing better than any other Assassin’s Creed game on Twitch, even Valhalla.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s here that Ubisoft’s internal communication provides context on comparisons between Shadows’ launch and other games in the franchise. What’s clear is that Shadows is not doing as well as Valhalla did at launch, but Ubisoft is saying it’s not fair to compare the two, because Valhalla benefitted from the “perfect storm” of pandemic-fueled stay-at-home gaming and the launch of the Xbox Series X and S and PlayStation 5 in 2020.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Valhalla launched under extraordinary conditions — in the middle of a global pandemic, with widespread lockdowns and brand-new console hardware,” the internal communication reads. “It was a perfect storm we may never see again. That’s why it’s more meaningful to compare Shadows to entries like Origins, Odyssey, and Mirage — games released in more typical cycles. And in that frame, Shadows is already setting a new bar as illustrated above.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft also pointed out that Shadows released in March. Historically, Assassin’s Creed games launch just ahead of the U.S. Thanksgiving window, which typically boosts sales. Meanwhile, Ubisoft ditched the early access period it normally charges extra for with its games. It’s also worth noting that Ubisoft’s own subscription offering is now available directly on Xbox, which affects sales on Microsoft’s console and muddies sales comparisons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Money talks, of course, and irrespective of player numbers and engagement, it will be revenue brought in by Assassin’s Creed Shadows that determines the fate of not just the game, but Ubisoft itself. We may not get a clear picture of that until Ubisoft's next financial report in the coming months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Adventuring across feudal Japan?

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/canabalt">Canabalt</a> developer and Tunic publisher Adam “Atomic” Saltsman has released a free “mash-up” of Wolfenstein and the original Prince Of Persia. It runs on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pico-8">PICO-8</a>, the sprinkle-covered fairy cake of game engines, and comprises 15 levels of jumping over gaps and murdering Nazis. 
</p>
<p>
Unlike in the original Prince Of Persia, each screen shows you the full level with a fog of war effect. This pleases me, because the act of moving between screens in OG POP used to fill me with terror, at least till I memorised the map. Remember the first time you felt the ground give way and fell on some spikes in Prince Of Persia? At least when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> ran out of air you got a countdown. Eesh.
</p>
<p>
You can find Prince Of Prussia – not bad as puns go, but I feel like there's an absolute banger here waiting to be discovered - on <a href="https://adamatomic.itch.io/prince">Itch.io</a>. There are at least 60 Nazis to slaughter. Both the PICO-8 action buttons are used for jumping. Rather than engaging in a clash of scimitars, you kill the Nazis simply by walking into them from behind once you’ve found yourself a knife. 
</p>
<p>
Saltsman has <a href="https://adamatomic.itch.io/">made a few things for Itch</a>, ranging from free tilesets to moderately leftfield sokobans and “bandit accountancy” games. All good stuff, but nothing rivals leaping through that window in Canabalt.

            <p>
A Japanese shrine famous to video game fans has announced a ban on visits by tourists, following an "unforgivable act of disrespect".
</p>
<p>
In 2021, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-fans-crowdfund-repairs-to-typhoon-hit-island">Ghost of Tsushima players helped the Tsushima Watatzumi Shrine shrine raise 27m yen (£192k)</a> to repair its Torii gate, after it was destroyed in a typhoon. The crowdfunding campaign ultimately raised 500 per cent of its original target.
</p>
<p>
Now, however, the Watazumi Shrine has announced a total ban on tourist visits, after an incident occured earlier this week on 23rd March described only as "a grave and unforgivable act of disrespect committed by foreigner(s)".

<p>
Further details of the incident have not been released, though a message on the Watazumi Shrine's social media accounts states that, going forward, only worshippers will be allowed entrance.
</p>
<p>
Unacceptable behaviour by tourists at the Watazumi Shrine is nothing new, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/japanese-shrine-once-repaired-thanks-to-ghost-of-tsushima-fans-bans-all-tourists-after-unforgivable-act-of-disrespect/">Automaton reports</a>, and a previous, controversial ban had seen South Korean visitors barred, after incidents of vandalism and abuse directed towards staff.
</p>
<p>
Now, all tourists - domestic and foreign - are banned.
</p>
<p>
"Inbound tourism's destruction of places, things, and people cherished by the Japanese is nothing less than the destruction of Japanese culture," the shrine's message states. 
</p>
<p>
"Those who consider this place a theme park or simply a photogenic location are not worshippers."
</p>
<p>
Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-day-one-patch-detailed-includes-destructible-shrine-changes-after-concern-over-copycats">Assassin's Creed Shadows quietly released an update that reduced the amount of destruction possible by players in the game's version of shrines</a>, after pre-release footage of a player causing damage sparked concern.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/half-life-3-may-be-getting-close-to-release-as-the-game-is-reportedly-in-the-optimization-phase-%E2%80%93-rumor.1143921/</guid>

			<p>The development of Half-Life 3 may be close to completion, as the unannounced game suspected to be the third main entry in the series has entered the optimization phase.</p>
<p>The latest news of the game known by its HLX codename, which was discovered in recent updates for other Valve games like Dota 2 and Counter-Strike 2, have been shared in a new video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gabe.follower">Gabe Follower</a>, who detailed plenty of other recent discoveries, such as groups named hlx, hlxaudio and hlxartists having been found in Valve's internal systems, the introduction to the code of console commands related to optimization and NPC behavior adjustments, dynamic navigation mesh, deformable props, improved dynamic hair systems and more. All of this suggests not only how this HLX game is nearing completion but also how it is going to be a complex game, which is making people believe it could indeed be the long-anticipated conclusion to Gordon Freeman's story.</p>
<p><iframe title="New Half-Life 3 is Almost Ready? - HLX News" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zTzIwXj0170?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As Valve stated multiple times in the past it is not working on <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-steam-deck-software/">Half-Life 3</a>, this HLX game may not be Half-Life 3, so we shouldn't get our hopes up too much. For all we know, it could be another spin-off in the vein of Half-Life Alyx, which was released back in 2020 and took some time to become playable even without a VR headset with the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-alyx-8k-ultra-settings-rtx-4080/">mods</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the silence from Valve regarding Half-Life 3, fans of the series still got something new to try out this week with the release of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477290/HalfLife_2_RTX/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Half-Life 2 RTX demo</a>. You can learn more about how ray tracing changes the classic game by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-half-life-2-rtx-demo-is-an-excellent-showcase-of-rtx-remixs-possibilities/">piece.</a></p>

            <p>If there's one thing I know about you sickos it's that you love a good city builder. No, don't try to deny it. I have the site traffic data right here and the numbers do not lie (unless they make me look bad to people who outrank me). You people are never happier than when you're wallowing in a bathtub full of upgradeable cottages, taxation sliders and pop satisfaction metrics. It's a disgraceful habit, but I'm not here to judge - not when there's a Steam City Builder &amp; Colony Sim Fest underway.</p><!--more-->

It's called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2521550/Shroomchitect/">Shroomchitect</a> and it's currently roundabouts the price of two, maybe three high street sausage rolls. What a time to be alive.</p>
<p>In terms of discounts on well-received games, you can get Klei's banging asteroid colony builder <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/oxygen-not-included">Oxygen Not Included</a>, coal-fired dystopia-me-do <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> and cutaway 2D skyscraper management sim <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/project-highrise">Project Highrise</a> for less than a tenner each.

<p>Let me know if you spot any gems going for the price of two, possibly three high street sausage rolls. I confess, I like building cities myself, though it's a genre I seldom find time for because my attention span has been smashed to pieces by daily newswriting. If you know of any building sims that are especially easy to resume playing after long absences, I'd appreciate a recommendation.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you are hoping to see <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> move over to Nintendo's consoles on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a>'s release, well developer Pocketpair would absolutely consider it. That's even despite the studio's legal dispute with Nintendo.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-says-nintendo-switch-2-version-100-worth-considering-if-the-console-is-beefy-enough">IGN</a> at GDC, Pocketpair's communications director John 'Bucky' Buckley revealed the team would have happily seen its monster-catching survival game on the OG Switch as well, but due to how "beefy" Palworld is, it wasn't able to find a home on Nintendo's console.</p>
<p>This may change for Switch 2, though, providing the next generation of Nintendo's consoles has the ability to handle the chonky game.</p>

<p>When asked about Palworld releasing on Switch 2, Bucky said the developer doesn't know the hardware specs yet. "Like everyone else, we're waiting. I'm walking around GDC hoping someone will tell me them, but everyone I've spoken to says they haven't even seen them," Bucky said.</p>
<p>He added that should the specs be "beefy enough" for Palworld, then "it's 100 percent worth considering" a Switch 2 release.</p>
<p>"We did a lot of optimisation for Steam Deck, which we were really happy with," Pocketpair's communications director continued. "Still work to do, but we're really happy with how it turned out. So we would like to get it on more handhelds if possible."</p>
<p>So, stay tuned! As for when we may hear more about those mysterious Switch 2 specs, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-timing-of-its-dedicated-switch-2-direct">Nintendo has a dedicated showcase for its upcoming console scheduled for next week</a>.</p>

<p>Ever since Palworld was first revealed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-fans-hit-back-at-palworlds-lazy-pal-designs">comparisons were made between Pocketpair's own monster-catching title and Pokémon</a>. In fact, Palworld was dubbed  'Pokémon with guns' ahead of its early access release last year, and soon after its debut <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemons-former-chief-legal-officer-surprised-palworld-managed-to-get-this-far">The Pokémon Company's former chief legal officer Don McGowan said he was "surprised" the game had "got this far"</a>.</p>
<p>In September, Nintendo announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">suing Pocketpair for infringement of "multiple" patents</a>, and it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-seek-injunction-against-palworld-plus-fine-and-damages-developer-says">later confirmed</a> the lawsuit was targeting three patents in particular. As part of an update in December, Pocketpair subsequently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-ditches-pokeball-style-summoning-mechanic-amid-nintendo-legal-battle">removed the ability to summon creatures by throwing Pokéball-style Pal Spheres</a>.</p>
<p>Despite this, Pocketpair has released a game on Nintendo Switch. In January of this year, the <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/palworld-developer-pocketpair-releases-overdungeon-on-nintendo-switch/">developer's real-time roguelike deck builder Overdungeon arrived on the Switch store in Japan</a>, having previously been available via Steam.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
