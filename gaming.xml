            <p>
The eternal problem with online <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a> of any flavour that has some variation on a levelling system, is that eventually you run out of room, and can't progress any more. That's why so many of them essentially allow you to reset your levels, or to prestige as it's often colloquially known. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> is one such game that will feature such a system, and in a new blog post, developer Embark have outlined what you get when you prestige.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/the-expedition-project-is-departing-soon">blog post</a> discusses the game's Expedition Project, its version of prestiging, explaining that it will kick off on December 17th, running for a six-day period until the 22nd. Within this period, you can choose to leave The Rust Belt for good, as long as you've reached level 20, and you'll start from a new character with some buffs and advantages.
</p>
<p>
Here's how it works: once an Expedition has departed, any items you have in your stash are put towards it. Every one million coins worth of value nets you an extra skill point you can use on your new raider, with the ability to earn five skill points total. Restarting with a new raider does mean that your skill tree, level, stash, workshop, crafting abilities, and blueprints will be completely reset, but you won't have to do the initial onboarding again.
</p>
<p>
In turns of some permanently unlocked bonuses, carrying out an Expedition nets you the Patchwork Raider outfit, Scrappy Janitor Cap, Expeditions Indicator icon, and +12 stash space. You also get some temporary buffs, like a 10% repair buff, 5% xp boost, and 6% more materials from Scrappy. One point to note though is that "the account buffs will expire if you choose not to depart with the subsequent expedition. Bear in mind, buffs will increase in power for your next three expeditions (but only one departure allowed per Expedition Window!)."
</p><p>
Explaining why they're handling a progression wipe like this, Embark said that making the Expedition Project optional is their "solution to some of the problems that inevitably arise with mandatory wipes - specifically, by respecting your time investment in the game." They want to offer people a choice between accomplishing more if there's things they're yet to do, but if they're ready to move on, they can do so. Basically, start planning for what you want to do come December 17th! Happy Arc Raiding!

Video games have a tendency to be very impatient in a way that I think often makes for a worse experience. Constant rewards of many flavours push us to chase after the next challenge, there's not nearly enough games that ask us to slow down. That's why I love a fishing minigame. It is a test of patience that you cannot win by brute forcing anything, the fish must come to you, and you must wait for the right time. About Fishing, the next release from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arctic-eggs">Arctic Eggs</a> developer The Water Museum, does ask for your patience… as well as for your willingness to embark into strange, murky waters.
</p>
<p>
Quickly into the game's demo (or playtest, as it's listed as on Steam), you are shown how to fish in a tutorial that perhaps needs a smidge more of a nudge in the right direction, but I did work it out in the end. Like in any <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a>, the fish you're trying to nab will prod your bait, inviting your twitching finger to pull the trigger. The main difference is that the camera follows your hook into the water, and if you successfully fool a fish into taking the bait, you must reel it in, moving your mouse or WASD keys as you do so to point the fish towards your corporeal form for a successful catch.

<p>
This is a game about fishing, not a game with fishing in it, so it's much more involved than a minigame, and appropriately tactile. After catching your prey, you bring it back to a man who I think is your grandpa, who is also kind of a weird asshole. There are curly fries to be hand, it is raining, yet according to him you must fill the tacklebox.
</p><p>
So, you do your best to do so, catching everything you can until your maybe grandpa teaches you a new trick: attaching a fish you caught to your hook lets you puppeteer its dead body. And you do that too, going deep into a hole, where you find a Laura Palmer-esque dead body… and a mermaid.
</p>
<p>
This is simply the opening section to About Fishing, the first chapter of a larger game that takes its cues from both Sega Bass fishing and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shenmue">Shenmue</a>, a delightful combination. There is clearly a mystery to be solved, fish to be caught, and based on the game's trailer and Steam page, townspeople to meet.
</p>
<p>
Arctic Eggs was equally as odd and concentrated in the thing it was trying to be, and About Fishing is seemingly no different in the tiny bit of time I've spent with it. You've caught me hook, line and sinker, The Water Museum. I'll be keeping an eye out on the full release, but for now you can join me in wishlisting it on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3856530/About_Fishing/">here</a>.

The popular series, based on the novels by Rick Riordan and now streaming on Disney+, was just announced to be getting its very own Fortnite Island on December 9. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Revealed on stage at CCXP25 in Brazil, Percy Jackson: Siege of Monsters will allow players to “embark on an authentic Percy Jackson adventure across an island map inspired by Camp Half-Blood – the earthly sanctuary and training facility for the children of mortals and Greek gods. As newly arrived demigods, players must discover the identity of their godly parent, gain new divine powers, and ally with their fellow demigods for a climactic battle against Scylla and Charybdis on the Sea of Monsters.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players will be able to meet various characters from the popular stories, rendered in the likenesses of the actors from the streaming series, including Percy Jackson, Annabeth Chase, and Grover Underwood, and “complete multiple side quests” and other activities “inspired by the first two seasons of the show.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/06/islandthumbnailimage-percyjackson-landscape-1920x1080-v1-legaltext-1765035026327.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I recently spoke with the stars and producers of the show about bringing some fan-favorite storylines to Fortnite. Walker Scobell, who plays Percy on the series, and co-star Aryan Simhadri (Grover) had been begging producers to get their characters into Fortnite “since day one.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm just excited to be the guy from Fortnite,” says Scobell. “That's what I want people to call me. If that's the only thing I'm ever remembered for, I'm fine with that. Percy Jackson? No, he's the guy from Fortnite.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Series Executive Producer and Co-showrunner Dan Shotz, who presented a sneak peak of the Fortnite island at CCXP, says bringing Percy Jackson to the game involved a lot of moving pieces. “We have worked directly with Disney to build an entire world within Fortnite,” Shotz says. “You're going to get to see incredible monsters. You get to fight the Minotaur, you get to have a boss battle with Scylla and Charybdis, and you also just get to hang out with the gang from Percy Jackson. It's pretty epic.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Percy Jackson: Siege of Monsters</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dior Goodjohn, who plays Clarisse on the show, agrees: “It's really, really sick. You kind of know the magnitude of what you're doing when they put you in a video game or when you get a doll made of you. This is insane that this is real life for all of us right now. It's crazy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Percy Jackson Creator Rick Riordan says it was important to adapt his stories for a younger, modern audience. “I cannot tell you how many years the fans have been asking me, ‘When are we going to get a Percy Jackson immersive game?’” Riordan says. “I (played) my share of World of Warcraft when I was younger, (so) I get it. I totally get it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leah Sava Jeffries, who portrays Annabeth, says she used to play Fortnite but intends to jump back in now that she and her co-stars are featured in the game. “This is making me want to go back and play it again,” Jeffries says. “I have been waiting for this for so long, and now I really feel like this is our moment.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Season 2 of Percy Jackson and the Olympians hits Disney+ December 10. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Michael Peyton is the Senior Editorial Director of Events &amp; Entertainment at IGN, leading entertainment content and coverage of tentpole events including IGN Live, San Diego Comic Con, gamescom, and IGN Fan Fest.

			<p>The final triple-A game release of the year, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, was just released. Our Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metroid-prime-4-beyond-scanning-wider-horizons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reviewed the game for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, but the game is also available for the original Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>Indeed, as you might remember, it was initially <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-announced-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> for the previous Switch during Nintendo's E3 2017 Spotlight, just a few months after that console's debut. It famously had a troubled development phase, as Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-indeed-developed-bandai-namco-according-multiple-sources/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had originally picked Bandai Namco</a> instead of Retro Studios to make the game. </p>



<p>The project wasn't going well, which led to Metroid Prime 4: Beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-retro-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being rebooted and handed back to Retro Studios</a>, resulting in an inevitable significant delay. Even though the Austin-based studio eventually launched the game well after the debut of the Switch 2, Nintendo still kept its promise to release the game on the original Switch, too.</p>



<p>That's great news even for PC gamers because, while there are no Switch 2 emulators yet, there are plenty of Switch emulators. Sure, Nintendo cracked down hard on the scene and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-shut-down-nintendo-gets-paid-2-4-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forced the closure of Yuzu</a> (and its fork<span>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/suyu-yuzus-emulator-fork-gets-taken-down-just-hours-after-the-first-build-release/" target="_blank">Suzu</a>), but many alternatives are still active, including <a href="https://ryujinx.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryubing</a>, an open-source fork based on</span> the historic Ryujinx emulator, as well as newer emulators like <a href="https://eden-emu.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eden</a> and <a href="https://citron-emu.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Citron</a>. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Metroid prime 4: Beyond - Eden vs Citron" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bxSycDP8e3w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>All of these are running Metroid Prime 4 well, as you can see from the embedded video. But the real kicker is that with ReShade, it's even possible to render the game (and other Switch titles) in stereoscopic 3D and play it on a giant screen through the <a href="https://www.vrdesktop.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Virtual Desktop software</a>. To begin, you will need to <a href="https://reshade.me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">download ReShade</a> 6.6.2 with full add‑on support and the Rendepth shader to convert the game’s depth buffer into a side‑by‑side 3D image that Virtual Desktop can interpret as stereoscopic video.</p>



<p>After installing ReShade (select the Vulkan option), enable the Rendepth shader and set the output to side-by-side with stereo strength at 100%, Z-buffer scaling at around 30, and parallax/overlap adjusted to your preference. To verify that depth is being captured correctly, ensure that the Show depth buffer setting is toggled on and use the AdjustDepth/DisplayDepth add-on to cycle through Vulkan depth sources until the buffer displays a proper gradient from black to white, rather than a flat white image.</p>



<p>If the depth preview is inverted, upside‑down, or flat, simply edit ReShade's global preprocessor definitions, toggling flags such as “depth input is reversed” or “depth input is upside down” from 0 to 1, until the depth image looks correct. Once the right Vulkan depth source is selected (it'll be the one with the most vertices) and the image is oriented correctly, disable the debug view, enable performance mode, and keep Rendepth active to generate the 3D image in normal gameplay.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Using Rendepth and ReShade to play stereoscopic 3D Metroid Prime 4 and Switch games." width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VoCFGIvgiA4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Now, in Virtual Desktop, set the 3D mode to half side‑by‑side or over‑under so that the double image from Rendepth fuses into a stereoscopic view on the virtual big screen. The creator of the video, lionellion, describes the result as a “Nintendo 3DS pop‑out” visor effect with a presentation akin to having a giant curved screen in front of you. Of course, to replicate this effect, you will need a Virtual Reality/XR headset or glasses or a glassless 3D display <a href="https://wccftech.com/samsung-2d-3d-gaming-monitor-concept-supports-glassless-3d-and-vr-gaming-wins-ces-2024-innovation-award/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like this one</a>. </p>



<p>Needless to say, playing Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on PC can only be legally done if you purchased an original copy for the Nintendo Switch and then dumped it for your own use. </p>

            <p>
A new trailer for the next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/path-of-exile-2">Path of Exile 2</a> update, The Last of the Druids, was shared earlier this week, showing off all the cool things you can do in it! Which are mostly relegated to turning into animals, but in my eyes that is eternally a cool thing to be able to do, in a game or not. And with that trailer also came a release date for the update.
</p>
<p>
It's less than a week out now, due to be released on December 12th, just in time for the next weekend. As part of the new druid class that comes with the new update, when in human form you can wield "magical staves to channel the powers of the earth and the natural world," including summoning volcanoes, getting trees to use their roots to trap enemies, you know, druid stuff. 
</p>

<p>
Then, there's the three forms you can take, that of a wolf, a bear, or a fire-breathing wyvern. Looks pretty neat honestly! Druid also comes with a couple of ascendancy classes, one being the Shaman, who "channels nature’s fury, harnessing rage to empower his spells and becoming a walking natural disaster raining down meteors, lightning, and ice," and the Oracle, who has "perfected the power of Foresight, using it in combat to gain a massive advantage by peering into the future to predict a monster's movements and even allocate passives from alternate timelines!"
</p><p>
Here's the rub, however: Path of Exile 2's 1.0 release date most likely won't be March 2026 like it was previously planned for. "I'm fairly confident that we won't be out of 2026," game director Jonathon Rogers told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-release-date-slips-again">Eurogamer</a> in a recent interview, continuing, "but as I said, I never want to really completely promise anything. But I don't think it'll end up being March; we'll have to see."
</p>
<p>
While there was no specific updated timeline shared, Rogers said he "certainly wouldn't want to be any later than the end of next year. Obviously we're trying to get there as fast as we can, but I certainly wouldn't want to slip into 2027." I'm sure this won't be welcome news to some, but hey ho, this is just how early access is sometimes. Have patience, friend, the 1.0 will come.

            <p>
Imagine a second, alternate version of our world. Everything is the same, on the surface. The sky is blue, the economy is in shambles; it's the unnatural order of things. And yet, you cannot help but feel something is different. Like there's something missing, or perhaps replaced. Ah, there it is - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire-2">Slay the Spire 2</a> is not a game that even remotely exists. As it turns out, this world, our world, where the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-spire">Slay the Spire</a> 2 does, or rather will, exist, is only the world we exist in thanks to the flip of a coin.
</p>
<p>
This, I would like to be clear, is not a joke. "We had been working on a bunch of tiny projects, little prototypes, and were having fun but said 'okay, let's get together again,'" explained Mega Crit co-founder Anthony Giovannetti told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/card-games/we-ended-up-flipping-a-coin-slay-the-spire-devs-left-it-up-to-pure-chance-whether-theyd-make-a-sequel-or-something-else/">PC Gamer</a> in a recent interview. Apparently this was during Covid, and both Giovannetti and Casey Yano were looking for their next proper project.
</p>
<p>
According to Giovannetti, a Slay the Spire sequel wasn't the only idea they had. "We had different paths we could work on," he explained. "One was a completely different project, and one was the sequel. I thought there were some interesting design challenges to work on a sequel with. We ended up flipping a coin, actually, and Slay the Spire 2 won out. So we started working on it, and the rest is history."
</p>
<p>
The coin flip itself isn't something Giovannetti witnessed first hand, it was Yano that did it over a Discord call, which the former notes was "maybe questionable," but he still believes he was told "true result. I think Casey would've massively preferred the coin went the other way, because I was always the card game person, and he was the action game person."
</p><p>
There is nothing more joyful, to me, than seeing the creator of a thing engage in an exercise that is so directly tied to the kind of thing that they make. In this case, it is Mega Crit playing with that fickle game called chance, in the hopes that it will work out, that they will, if they're lucky enough, slay the spire. But maybe don't do this if you aren't literally the folks who made Slay the Spire, this isn't a point in history to be taking unnecessary risks.
</p>
<p>
Slay the Spire 2 is currently slated for release on a "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/slay-the-spire-2s-early-access-release-delayed-to-a-secret-thursday-in-march-2026-alternate-acts-teased">secret Thursday</a>" in March 2026, where you'll be able to play it in early access. You can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2868840/Slay_the_Spire_2/">here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has delayed the upcoming next part of the ARC Raiders’ Expedition Project. The Expedition, which now opens a few days later, will give you new items but practically wipe out your progress.</p>



<p>One of 2025’s hottest games has been the extraction shooter ARC Raiders. Made by Embark Studios (The Finals), the shooter has been quite popular with players and streamers. From peace pacts to all-out war, the title has already topped <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-most-searched-game-2025-drop-october/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the most-searched games</a> on Google and has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-new-map-visit-25-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">consistently broken player records</a> on Steam. On the roadmap, it was teased that the next expedition departure would be announced. Now, Embark Studios has revealed more info on the next Expedition, including a two-day delay.</p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-expedition-project-now-starts-december-17th-launching-december-22nd">ARC Raiders Expedition Project Now Starts December 17th, Launching December 22nd.</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">📡 Attention, Raiders!<br>After a minor delay in the tunnels, the Expedition departure window will open on Dec 17; this is your Raider’s chance to roll out in the Caravan you’ve built and leave the Rust Belt behind.<br>Prepare to start a fresh new adventure with a brand new Raider, and…</p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1997350326311989689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 6, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/the-expedition-project-is-departing-soon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a new blog</a> on the ARC Raiders site, Embark Studios revealed that <strong>the next Expedition won’t start its window on December 15th</strong> as planned. Instead, <strong>the Expedition window will last from December 17th to the 22nd</strong>. Now, instead of players leaving on December 20th, the 22nd is now when those who signed up will depart The Rust Belt on their Caravan.</p>



<p>While the details of the Expedition <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-will-have-optional-progression-wipes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are known</a>, the blog mentions some information regarding it. For one, player progress will be wiped, which includes blueprints, skill tree, level, stash, workshop, and crafting abilities. However, permanent upgrades like more inventory slots, XP boosts, and skill points will be included. It is a big choice to go on the Expedition, but seeing how ARC Raiders has shaped up to be since release, it does seem like a risk worth taking.</p>

            <p>Mob Entertainment has dropped another new cinematic trailer to whet our collective appetites for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/poppy-playtime">Poppy Playtime</a> Chapter 5.</p>
<p>It's one of those blink-and-you-miss-it affairs - it's not even a minute long - but it does give a flavour of what we can expect from Mob Entertainment's gargantuan mascot horror series, including another shadowy glimpse of the mysterious Prototype and our first look at an all-new character that may or may not be a new villain that some fans are calling Lilly Lovebraids.</p>

<p>Sadly, there's no release date accompanying this teaser - just a request to wishlist it on Steam and Epic Games Store - but the speed at which Mob is churning out teasers suggests it could be here sooner rather than later.</p><p>The prior chapter, called Poppy Playtime Chapter 4, predictably enough, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-chapter-4-release-announced-for-pc">arrived on PC back in January of this year</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-chapter-4-coming-to-consoles-this-month">on consoles in the summer</a>, which also makes January 2026 a timely opportunity to drop its successor. Watch this space.</p>
<p>In May of last year, the studio announced that a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-the-cult-horror-game-is-getting-a-film-adaptation">Poppy Playtime film adaptation was in the works</a> with Legendary Entertainment and Angry Films.</p>
<p>"When we first started this journey, we followed our passion and created a series of games and brands with the purpose of inspiring and entertaining. We've always dreamed big and are thrilled to have created something that has captured the hearts of tens of millions around the world," Mob Entertainment co-founders Zach Belanger and Seth Belanger said at the time. "This movie deal is a great logical next step in the growth of our transmedia entertainment company."</p>

            <p>Former PlayStation boss Shuhei Yoshida has suggested that Japanese studios "can't replicate" the speed at which games are produced in China, suggesting Chinese studios can hire more people "who can work long hours".</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/966/G096641/20251205009/">4Gamer</a>, as translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/playstation-veteran-shuhei-yoshida-says-japanese-studios-are-unlikely-to-replicate-the-production-scale-and-speed-of-chinese-games-like-genshin-or-honkai-star-rail/">Automaton</a>, Yoshida shared his impressions of the Chinese industry, saying: "the development speed in China is amazing [and] they’re also quick at changing personnel, and all of the game development work itself unfolds rapidly".</p>

<p>"Back when I talked to representatives of miHoYo, we discussed how it would be quite difficult for Japanese developers to make games in the same way miHoYo does. Not to mention the legal problems that would come with it," Yoshida said.</p><p>"I wonder if there are some aspects [of the development process] that Japanese game developers just can't replicate. One reason why games in China are so strong is because they are made in an environment which allows for hiring a large number of personnel who can work long hours.</p>
<p>"Of course, you never know what might happen in the near future, but looking at the current state of things, I think that's the biggest factor."</p>
<p>Last month, a number of Japanese publishers, including Bandai Namco, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, and others came together as part of CODA (Content Overseas Distribution Association) to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/japanese-publishers-like-bandai-namco-and-square-enix-are-requesting-sora-2-is-no-longer-trained-on-their-creative-works">request Open AI cease training AI video generation tool Sora 2 on their collective creative works</a>.</p>
<p>The statement to Open AI, <a href="https://coda-cj.jp/en/news/817/">made public via a statement published on the CODA website</a>, requests that CODA members' works are not used for machine learning without prior permission.</p>

            <p>
I can see it now… in the near future, the review embargo for Suda51's next game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/romeo-is-a-dead-man">Romeo is a Dead Man</a>, and as far as the eye can see the digital realm is scorched with 7/10s. Its maximalist shenanigans, techno-blasting soundtrack, and ridiculous premise puts it in a position where it couldn't possibly be for everyone, even if such a score is actually ideal for such a game, but when has that ever been the case for a Suda51 game? However, as I said, this vision I have is in the near future, because the hyper-violent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game now has a release date.
</p>
<p>
This release date comes as part of an as always over-the-top new trailer, locking it for launching February 11, 2026 (as locked in as any game can be these days). There's a line in said trailer that I think perfectly encapsulates my feelings of everything I've seen of Romeo is a Dead Man so far, from the titular character himself: "Am I supposed to understand what you're talking about?" I pose this question in return to Grasshopper Manufacture, though to be honest I don't particularly need a response.

<p>
There's enough in the trailer that intrigues me enough to pull me towards that February release date; stylish as hell combat with so many particle effects you'll probably start to feel dizzy, bombastic special attacks that transport you to another dimension, a blank, empty, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a>-as-hell room, a zombie woman for some reason, an unexplained fusion between a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear">Metal Gear</a> and a Gundam, it has it all and more.
</p><p>
It's entirely possible that this all ends up being style over substance, the substance in question being the combat more than the story, I don't need the story in a game like this to sing the highest of emotional peaks. I need it to commit to its outlandishness, and deliver on its crunchy melee swings and punchy gunshots. I'll find out if it manages to do that in a couple of months!

            <p>Goichi "Suda51" Suda would love to bring back the found-footage survival-horror game Michigan: Report from Hell, either as a sequel or a remake.</p>
<p>The original, released in Japan in 2004 as Michigan, was not released in the US, although a dubbed version was released in Europe the following year, with the "Report from Hell" added to the PAL title.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/suda51-says-he-wants-to-bring-back-this-forgotten-ps2-game-hopefully-sooner-rather-than-later/">VGC</a>, Suda was asked if the age of social media had ever given the producer pause to reconsider bringing Michigan to a new audience, to which he replied, "hopefully sooner rather than later".</p>

<p>"As far as Michigan goes, that's something that I would definitely like to revisit or bring back in some form at some time," Suda said, who was reportedly inspired by Stephen King's The Mist.</p>
<p>"And so if possible, I hope I'll be able to speak with Spike Chunsoft and make it a reality somehow, hopefully sooner rather than later. But yeah, that's something that I've been wanting to go back to for a while."</p><p>Hotel Barcelona, the side-scrolling slasher movie parody from Suda51 and Hidetaka "Swery" Suehiro, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suda51-and-swerys-25d-slasher-parody-hotel-barcelona-delayed-into-next-year">delayed from 2024 to September 2025</a> so developer White Owls could "keep polishing it and making it better". It's currently sitting on a 'Mixed' Steam user score.</p>

<figure><a title="Simogo Legacy Collection - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160993/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>I had a moment of realisation while flipping my Switch 2 around in my hand and tapping at the screen in an effort to solve yet another clever-but-abstract puzzle. I realised that the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/simogo-legacy-collection-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Simogo Legacy Collection</a> was one of the most unabashedly original sets of experiences I had encountered in a long time.</p>
<p>The funny thing was that I had already played every game in this collection years before. It had been so long that the zenith of mobile gaming had slipped into the realm of half-forgotten memories.</p>
<p>Simogo Games is perhaps better known for two stylised and mechanically unique titles from recent years: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sayonara_wild_hearts">Sayonara Wild Hearts</a> (2019) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lorelei_and_the_laser_eyes">Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</a> (2024). It <em>may</em> surprise some that it is actually a storied studio with 15 years of history, recognised for fiercely original titles built for mobile devices. Those are the games that the Simogo Legacy Collection brings together. It features seven titles that both exemplify the early heyday of mobile games and manage to transcend that format.</p>
<figure><a title="Simogo Legacy Collection - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160986/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This is as lovingly curated a collection as you are likely to get, rivalling Digital Eclipse’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/browse?title=series%3Agold-master-series">Gold Master Series</a> for presentation and additional extras. The stylish menu is fashioned as a mobile phone screen, with tiles that take you to games, settings, and a wealth of bonus material. You are free to cycle between a vast collection of music as you wander the digital halls of this studio's archives.</p>
<p>The games themselves range from fun time sinks to rich artistic endeavours. All of them need equal attention, so it is best to tackle them one by one.</p>
<p>First up is <strong>Kosmo Spin</strong>, which is perhaps the most mobile-game-like experience here and a sign of a studio taking its first steps in the industry. It is a cute collectathon that plays with perspective by having you rotate the screen to guide a robot around a planetoid. You rescue robot buddies and avoid an enemy UFO that hurls projectiles and tries to hoover you up.</p>
<p>Next is <strong>Bumpy Road</strong>, a deceptively simple exercise in hand-eye coordination. Your task is to guide a car across the screen, although the hook is that you move the vehicle by deforming the road underneath it with your finger. I had a lot of fun with this one, mostly failing.</p>

<p><strong>Beat Sneak Bandit</strong> is an odd but addictive combination of stealth and rhythm action. You control a thief who sneaks through Donkey Kong-style multi-level areas, and you can only move by tapping the screen to the beat.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu-eshop/year_walk">Year Walk</a> is perhaps the developer's most beloved mobile title and much more of a purely artistic experience than the previous three. Previously available on the Wii U eShop until Nintendo shut up shop <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/countdown-wii-u-eshop-spotlight-year-walk">in March 2023</a>, it explores Scandinavian folklore with an atmospheric walking (swiping?) simulator of sorts, in which you transition through screens, interact with the environment and uncover mysteries. It remains richly atmospheric to this day.</p>
<p><strong>Device 6</strong> and <strong>The Sailor’s Dream</strong> are mechanically similar puzzle mysteries that rely on your exploration skills. Device 6 has you traverse prose and interact with images in a book to help protagonist Anna figure out where she is. The Sailor’s Dream expands the concept of exploration by having you sail across the ocean and visit experiential locations.</p>
<figure><a title="Simogo Legacy Collection - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160995/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, there is <strong>SPL-T</strong>, an ostensibly simple puzzle game where you tap on a wireframe grid to create ever smaller divisions. This one is a compulsive experience that hides neat little easter eggs tied to screen interaction.</p>
<p>All of these games are sharply updated to look great on the Switch display. Since they were developed for small touchscreens, they feel most comfortable when played undocked. Simogo has added all kinds of quality-of-life features to make the games more playable on both screens, including open orientation switching and simultaneous touch and stick controls.</p>
<p>The one caveat is that most of the games feel a bit clunky on a large display. Even with accessible controls, these titles were made specifically for a small screen. That said, the Switch 2 version fully supports mouse controls, which helps a great deal when playing docked. Being able to move the screen and control the game with smooth mouse movement is a real boon.</p>

<p>Simogo Legacy Collection feels like the developer has considered <em>everything</em> in translating these games to consoles. It adapts mobile-first experiences into versatile ports that account for the player's needs. Outside of the porting work, these games offer seven distinct and captivating experiences that still feel fresh years after their release. Simogo plays around with the form and function of well-worn templates to create something surprising and new.</p>
<p>Even Year Walk, the most purely narrative experience here, is a unique take on the storytelling style of classics like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/myst">Myst</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/room">The Room</a>. SPL-T, on the other hand, is so subtle in its execution that you might spend hours tapping the screen before realising you are playing a postmodern twist on endless arcade puzzlers.</p>
<p>If you enjoy puzzle-driven narratives and experimental design, this bundle is nothing less than essential.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Polishing and repackaging its mobile output, Simogo have created an essential collection of classics, where every game is worth your time. Despite their mobile origins, these titles feel tailor-made for Switch and the devs have fully embraced the console's feature set.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="overview">
			
<p>Where Winds Meet immediately caught our attention when Everstone Studio, a new internal NetEase development studio based in Hangzhou and specifically created to develop this game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-is-a-wuxia-open-world-sandbox-rpg-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled its first trailer at Gamescom 2022</a>. We were the first to <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-qa-devs-reveal-tons-of-info-on-this-exciting-wuxia-sandbox-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publish an exclusive interview with the development team</a> just around a month later, where we learned various details, including the studio's revelation on the title choice: they envisioned wind as a symbol of freedom, and with multiple winds gathering, it is akin to a meeting of people with different ideas. Exploration and freedom, civilization and harmony are the themes behind Where Winds Meet's original concept.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-platforms-pricing">Release Date, Platforms, Pricing</h2>



<p>Everstone Studio tested Where Winds Meet extensively before its launch. The first Closed Beta Test <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuxia-open-world-game-where-winds-meet-starts-first-closed-beta-test-in-two-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took place in April 2024</a>; a month later, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that the game would be released on PlayStation 5 in addition to the previosly announced PC version. The game was launched in China in December 2024. </p>



<p>Everstone conducted two additional testing rounds this year in <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-new-cbt-set-for-may-16-19-on-pc-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">May</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-minds-meet-final-test-july-24-31/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">July</a>, followed by the final global release <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-ps5-pc-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on November 14, 2025</a>. The game is available on PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, as well as on PlayStation 5 as a timed console exclusive. A mobile version <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-mobile-release-date-9-million-downloads-pc-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is scheduled to follow on December 12, 2025</a>.</p>



<p>The title employs a free‑to‑play business model with cross‑progression between supported platforms. Monetization revolves around cosmetics, battle‑pass style rewards, and gacha systems for visual items, with both the developer and the publisher emphasizing that there are no pay‑to‑win stat advantages attached to paid content.</p>



<h2 id="genre-setting-and-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>Where Winds Meet positions itself between <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima-duty-heavier-than-a-mountain-death-lighter-than-a-feather/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ghost of Tsushima</a>‑style prestige action‑adventure and a more systemic game, describing its core as an “open‑world wuxia ARPG” with strong narrative, social, and multiplayer layers. Wuxia here means gravity‑defying martial arts, chivalric codes, and tangled sect politics, with Everstone leaning into romanticized Jianghu folklore rather than strict historical simulation.​</p>



<p>The story unfolds in China during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms, a chaotic 10th-century interregnum between the Tang and Song dynasties marked by short‑lived regimes and constant warfare. Cities like Kaifeng serve as political and economic hubs, while borderlands, bamboo forests, deserts, and mountain monasteries highlight the fractures between imperial authority and the martial underworld. The protagonist is a nameless swordsman (or swordswoman) with a hidden past, drawn into conspiracies involving rival kingdoms, ancient martial sects, and supernatural‑tinged relics. The player character can join one of eleven sects (or remain sectless and 'steal' specific martial skills without joining), each with a unique philosophy, rules, signature martial arts and/or features. Here's the list of the sects:</p>



<ul>
<li>Well of Heaven</li>



<li>Silver Needle</li>



<li>Midnight Blades</li>



<li>Nine Mortal Ways</li>



<li>Velvet Shade</li>



<li>Raging Tides</li>



<li>The Masked Troupe</li>



<li>Lone Cloud</li>



<li>Hollow Vale</li>



<li>Inkbound Order</li>



<li>Mohist Hill</li>
</ul>



<p>The developers stressed that the narrative is not purely linear: branching dialogue, optional “Lost Chapter” storylines, and faction questlines can reframe how key conflicts are resolved and which NPCs become allies or enemies. Jianghu reputation systems track how different sects and regions perceive the player, unlocking unique skills, outfits, or story beats if you side with, infiltrate, or betray particular groups.​</p>



<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>The game's core combat combines Souls-style commitment with character-action spectacle, albeit leaning more toward the latter. Players can lock onto targets, manage stamina‑like resources, and use a universal guard/parry system that can deflect most strikes if timed well. Once enemies are staggered, the game encourages launching them into juggles, air‑dashes, and cinematic finishers. Accessibility options include auto-parry, auto-dodge, and timing assists, allowing less technical players to enjoy the wuxia spectacle. On the other hand, action genre fans will want to keep these assists disabled to enjoy a more challenging reaction-based experience.​</p>



<p>In Where Winds Meet, weapons define broad playstyles rather than rigid classes. For example, straight swords favor precise counters and ripostes; spears grant reach and crowd control; dual blades focus on aggressive, stance‑dancing DPS; bows and crossbows support ranged pressure; and umbrellas, fans, or Taichi techniques introduce hybrid defensive or support options. Skill trees and “Inner Power” cultivation allow you to slot martial arts manuals and passive meridian bonuses, encouraging experimentation across weapon types and sect styles instead of locking into a single build.​</p>



<p>Traversal is designed to sell the fantasy of a roaming wuxia hero. Players can triple‑jump, sprint up walls, dash across water for short distances, and glide using cloaks or swords, with many side activities—hidden shrines, vista points, legendary beasts—placed in hard‑to‑reach locations to reward mastery of movement. Mounts, boats, and fast‑travel nodes support large‑scale exploration, while “free interaction” systems let you play instruments, practice calligraphy, or interact with wildlife and villagers, adding low‑intensity downtime between major fights.​ There are indeed a lot of 'life skills' or secondary activities, such as being a healer or a scholar, cooking, fishing, and various mini-games and events.</p>



<p>Structurally, Where Winds Meet occupies a rather unique middle ground between solo RPG and MMO. Main and side quests can be completed alone, but world events, boss hunts, sect wars, and competitive arenas encourage grouping with other players in shared hubs and open zones. Seasonal updates are planned to add new regions, sects, and storylines. The developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-winds-meet-final-test-qa-everstone-unveils-its-living-world-wuxia-action-rpg-offering-single-player-and-mmo-like-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">framed the game as a 'living world' title</a> with a long-term live service plan, where Jianghu politics, world bosses, and social features evolve over time without abandoning the strong core narrative available to solo-focused players.​ </p>



<h2 id="h-tech-and-specs">Tech and Specs</h2>



<p>Where Winds Meet is powered by NetEase's in-house Messiah engine. The game shows modern graphics features such as detailed vegetation, reflective water and surfaces, dynamic lighting, and cinematic, polished martial‑arts animations. </p>



<p>On PC, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-fe-arc-raiders-giveaway-free-new-dlss-rtx-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supports NVIDIA DLSS 4/DLAA/Reflex with Super Resolution</a>, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation options available on GeForce RTX graphics cards, where the game can be boosted by up to 3.9x at 4K, reaching up to 500 frames per second on the most powerful graphics cards available on the market, the GeForce RTX 5090.</p>



<p>Where Winds Meet also supports AMD FSR 3.1 and Intel XeSS 2, as well as FSR Frame Generation. However, the latter is not compatible with the XeSS upscaling option or with High Dynamic Range (HDR) displays, which are otherwise supported.</p>



<p>Below you can find the game's official system requirements. If you don't meet the requirements, the game can also be played through the cloud, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-where-winds-meet-possessors-nvidia-geforce-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thanks to NVIDIA's GeForce NOW</a>.</p>

<p>The PlayStation 5 version of Where Winds Meet targets 60 frames per second (though it often drops to 40 or even 30FPS in busy scenes) with an internal resolution well below 4K that is then reconstructed. The PS5 Pro version offers users equipped with the more expensive console two options: a higher-resolution standard mode and a ray traced mode that adds RT reflections. The frame rate remains highly variable in both cases.</p>



<p>Both the PS5 and PC versions support the DualSense controller's adaptive triggers feature.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/echo-dot-goes-for-peanuts-amazon-sells-alexa-speakers-cheap-enough-for-every-home-to-own-one-2000651143</link>
            <guid>1375201</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon keeps its prices low on Alexa-enabled speakers all year long and the <strong>Echo Dot is a great choice because it is in the middle of the lineup</strong> between basic and premium options. This model is the best-selling one in the Echo family <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/">right now, and it’s only $31 instead of the usual $49 for early December</a>. The small speaker has surprisingly rich sound that fills bedrooms, offices, or dining rooms without taking up too much counter space or needing a lot of setup.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Echo Dot Sounds Better Than You Thought</h2>
<p>The speaker design is all about making the sound fuller and giving it more bass than previous Echo Dot models could do with their small enclosures. Amazon changed the way the internal drivers are set up so that they can comfortably fill small to medium-sized rooms with sound while playing music, listening to podcasts, or reading audiobooks. The sound quality isn’t good enough to replace dedicated speakers for critical listening, but it does a good job with background music, news briefings, and alarm sounds, making the Echo Dot useful for more than just voice commands.</p>



<p><strong>Alexa integration lets you control thousands of smart home devices</strong>, streaming services, and information queries with your voice, so you don’t have to keep taking out your phone: You can change smart lights, thermostats, and plugs by speaking commands naturally. You can also check the weather, set multiple timers while you cook, or ask for unit conversions while you prepare a recipe. The microphone array uses far-field voice recognition technology to filter out background noise and make your voice clear even when music is playing at a moderate volume.</p>
<p>The small size is about the size of a tennis ball, so it doesn’t take up much space on nightstands or desk corners where bigger Echo devices would take up too much space. This size is perfect for bedrooms because it wakes you up with music, news, or soft sounds instead of loud beeps. While you’re getting ready, you can ask Alexa for the time, the weather, or your calendar appointments without touching any devices. The <strong>top surface has physical buttons for turning up the volume</strong>, muting the microphone, and turning on Alexa.</p>



<p>Smart home routines let you set up morning routines that gradually brighten the lights, start your coffee maker, and read your calendar. You can do all of these things with just one command or a scheduled trigger. Evening routines can lock smart locks, change the temperature, turn off all the lights in the house, and play relaxing sounds to help you sleep. You set up these automation sequences in the Alexa app, and they work every time after that.</p>
<p><strong>A physical microphone mute button is part of the privacy controls</strong>: When the button is pressed, the microphones are electronically disconnected. A red light ring shows when the device isn’t listening. The speaker also has options to limit how long data is kept or stop people from listening to recordings</p>
<p>This $18 off makes full Alexa functionality and better sound quality affordable enough to buy Echo Dots for more than one room. If you want to start building a smart home or just need hands-free voice control in important areas, this is a great deal because you get Amazon’s smart assistant platform with room-filling sound for less than the cost of basic Bluetooth speakers.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/839464/horses-review-santa-ragione-steam-epic-bans</link>
            <guid>1375195</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/837278/horses-banned-steam-epic-games-store"><em>Horses</em></a> has become the current face of the fight against video game censorship and what gets to be art. After getting banned from Steam and the Epic Game Store, the narrative horror game has become a bestseller on GOG.com, and has brought gamers of all stripes together in support of it. But as a game, <em>Horses</em> doesn’t deserve all this — neither its bans nor, after playing it myself, all the glowing praise.</p><p><em>Horses </em>is a collaboration between indie studio <a href="https://www.santaragione.com/">Santa Ragione</a> and Italian filmmaker Andrea Lucco Bolera. Bolera wrote the game and acted in and directed the FMV cutscenes that are interspersed throughout, while the developers at Santa Ragione worked on the technical aspects. It’s a brief experience, taking roughly three to four hours to complete. But though it’s mercifully short, by the end I was desperate to be done with it.</p><p>In<em> Horses</em>, you play as Anselmo, a 20-year-old layabout sent to a farm for two weeks by his father to learn the value of good old-fashioned hard work. Guided by the farm’s overbearing owner, Anslemo is tasked with a number of chores that you complete with the simple click of a mouse. Watering the garden, feeding the dog, and tending to a herd of the titular horses — naked humans with horse masks permanently affixed to their faces with a collar. Over the course of 14 days, Anselmo gets to know the horses, their master, and just how much suffering he – and by extension the player — can take.</p><p>In all the conversations about this game, from how its ban from Steam and Epic is ruinous for art and gaming, to <em>Horses</em>’ merits as a narrative horror experience, I haven’t seen much talk about how funny it is. Having read the extensive content warning and knowing some of the nasty surprises the narrative had in store, my first visceral reaction to the game was laughing out loud.</p><p>Examining the graveyard revealed dead equines named Bojack and Artax. After the farmer, the next character you meet is a dog and, naturally, you can try to pet him. I thought it was uproariously funny that the developers of something as bleak and upsetting as <em>Horses</em> still felt beholden to the unwritten game development rule of “if dog, must pet.” Although this one growls at you if you try, and well… he’s <em>also</em> a human in an animal mask.</p><p>The first seven days passed in hilariousness enhanced by the FMV action and the lofi graphics, animations, and interactions all of which I found charming. Whenever the farmer talks, the game zooms in on his face as his lips conform around teeth that don’t move. When Anselmo wants to express an opinion or make a choice, you have to pick between a thumbs up or down button or smiley faces that resemble <a href="https://specialistshospitalshreveport.com/patient-resources/using-the-pain-scale/">the pain charts you see in hospitals</a> while his unblinking face bobs or shakes with your choice. In a horse race against the farmer, using the WASD keys to move created a leaning motion as though the human under me was realistically responding to a grown man’s weight on his shoulders.</p><p>I even found the explicit stuff funny. And because of some of the game’s design choices, these moments aren’t graphic at all. Sex between horses looks like two mannequins ragdolling their pixelated junk against each other while barely making a sound. When you catch the farmer late one night watching his dog and a horse go at it, his jerky motions clearly indicate he’s supposed to be masturbating. But because of the limitations of the animation (and his chastity cage), his hands just wildly clip through his abdomen. This is the game proscribed from Steam while the available <em>Sex Standing</em> features uncensored closeups of full penetration, moaning and all.</p><p>But as much as the unintentional hilariousness of <em>Horses</em> disarmed me, it brutally undercut the message of the game. Horses randomly going at it are supposed to reinforce how the thoroughness of their dehumanization has reduced them to their basest, most animalistic instincts. But the use of animations and graphics that were revolutionary when the Dreamcast was new transformed those moments of horror to comedy. That’s not to say we as humans don’t often laugh when we’re supposed to be horrified, or that a more serious, realistic design would be better (good lord, <em>no</em>). But frontloading the funny created an ironic distance between me and the more appropriate emotions the rest of the experience is trying to evoke.</p><p>As every new day ticked by, moments of escalating brutality started to appear like jump scares. Rather than disturb me, it felt like watching a comic wear the same bit into the ground. One of the least effective narrative devices is shock for shock’s sake and though I’m confident that was not the intention, that’s what it feels like.</p><p>I got bored quickly. That might be exactly what the director was going for, highlighting that when there’s so much ugliness around you, you can’t help but relegate it to background noise. But that only happens when you have no choice (or choose to do nothing) and this game was designed to give the player very little choice. In some of the moments when Anselmo actually gets to say “no,” he’s made to do whatever anyway. How am I supposed to sit in the uncomfortable tension of what my action or inaction has caused, if my participation was pre-determined by the game’s code? A more interesting game would have let me make my own decisions and forced me to live with the consequences. But as the game is, I’m forced to live with the consequences of playing it.</p><p>Steam banning<em> Horses, </em>though it’s resulted in all this positive attention, is still a tragedy. Eventually the attention will fade and the gaming community will move on to a new cause du jour, leaving <em>Horses</em> on platforms that have much less reach than Steam. I’m glad I played it. <em>Horses</em> deserves to be played — if for nothing else, than to appreciate the games that do better what <em>Horses</em> failed to do.</p><p><sup>Horses<em> is out now on GOG.com, Humble, and itch.io.</em></sup></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/839464/horses-review-santa-ragione-steam-epic-bans]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[One Week After Black Friday, Dyson V11 Quietly Hits New Record Low on Amazon]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/one-week-after-black-friday-dyson-v11-quietly-hits-new-record-low-on-amazon-2000651139</link>
            <guid>1375189</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday came and went, but Amazon continues pushing deals on premium brands throughout December which happens to be its biggest sales month of the year. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">Dyson V11 Origin currently sits at $399 instead of its usual $629 which is a record low on this cordless vacuum</a> that brings serious suction power to your cleaning routine.</p>
<p>This <strong>model delivers 185 air watts of power across three modes</strong>, and handles both quick daily cleanups and deep weekend cleaning sessions. Over 40,000 units sold in the past month as people realize Dyson’s engineering justifies the premium over budget stick vacuums that die after six months. The combination of 60-minute runtime, detangling brush head, and HEPA filtration creates a cleaning tool that handles pet hair, allergens, and debris across all floor types.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>What 185 Air Watts Does to Change Your Cleaning Experience</h2>
<p>The suction power measured in air watts represents actual cleaning capability rather than motor wattage marketing numbers that don’t correlate with performance. This <strong>V11 Origin pulls 60% more power than previous Dyson V-series models</strong>, and creates enough airflow to lift embedded dirt from carpet fibers and pull debris from grout lines in hard flooring. You can feel the difference immediately when vacuuming high-traffic areas where foot traffic grinds dirt deep into carpet pile, as the motorbar cleaner head actually extracts material that cheaper vacuums just push around.</p>



<p><strong>Three power modes</strong> let you clean in different ways without wasting battery on tasks that don’t need full power. Auto mode automatically changes the suction power based on the type of floor and the amount of dirt, balancing cleaning performance with battery life to make it last for years. Eco mode lets you clean your whole house or a large area <strong>for up to 60 minutes at a time</strong>, which is great for when you need to run the device for a long time between charges. Boost mode gives you the most suction for tough spots, dirt that has been ground in, or thick carpets that need more power. The LCD screen shows how much time is left for cleaning, down to the second, as well as power mode and maintenance alerts. This way, you always know how much time you have left.</p>
<p>The <strong>Motorbar cleaner head has a design that keeps long hair and pet fur from getting stuck</strong> in the brush bar: This fixes one of the most annoying things about owning a vacuum. With traditional brush rolls, you have to cut and unwind hair that builds up while you clean. This design, on the other hand, sends hair straight to the dustbin as you vacuum. You can clean rooms with long-haired people or pets that shed without having to stop every few minutes to untangle hair from the brush.</p>



<p>Advanced<strong> whole-machine HEPA filtration catches 99.99% of particles as small as 0.3 microns</strong> including allergens, dust mites, and fine particulate matter that can cause breathing problems. The sealed filtration system keeps particles that have been caught from getting back into your air through cracks or exhaust. This is very important for people with allergies or respiratory issues.</p>
<p>You can <strong>switch to handheld mode in seconds</strong> by taking off the wand and attaching tools directly to the main body and because of this flexibility, you don’t have to get out a separate handheld vacuum for quick cleanups in the car, on the couch, or on the ceiling. The weight and balance are good for handheld use, so you can use it for a long time on stairs or furniture without getting tired in your arms.</p>
<p>This $230 discount makes Dyson’s engineering and build quality comparable to mid-range cordless vacuums that don’t have the same suction power, runtime, or filtration as this model. You’re getting a cleaning tool that will last for years instead of months, and the materials and construction are worth the extra cost compared to disposable-grade options.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lenovo-has-no-sale-on-its-site-goes-nearly-80-off-on-this-32gb-1tb-model-quietly-via-amazon-2000651129</link>
            <guid>1375180</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday was weeks ago, but December is still Amazon’s busiest month for sales with new deals coming out every day. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6256/">Lenovo V15 G2 laptop is on sale for a record low of $599 instead of its usual price of $2,599</a> and you won’t find any discounts even close to this on Lenovo’s official site. This laptop has <strong>32GB of DDR4 RAM and a 1TB PCIe SSD</strong> which makes it a useful everyday machine that can handle work and entertainment without costing a lot of money.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6256/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Memory Setup Makes a Big Difference</h2>
<p>In the budget laptop market where 8GB is still common and 16GB is a nice upgrade, the 32GB RAM capacity really stands out: This extra memory space lets you keep a lot of browser tabs open at the same time as Office apps, video conferencing software, photo editing tools, and background processes without them slowing down.</p>



<p>The 1TB PCIe SSD has enough space for large document libraries, photo collections, downloaded courses, and application installations without needing external drives or heavy cloud management.<strong> PCIe interface technology makes reading and writing much faster than older SATA SSDs</strong> which means that Windows boots up in seconds and apps start right away when you click on them. This storage capacity matters for students storing lecture recordings and project files, professionals managing client documents and presentations, or families sharing one laptop across multiple users with different needs.</p>
<p>The <strong>Intel Celeron N4500 processor is good enough for everyday computing tasks</strong> and uses little power, which is good for battery life when you’re in class or working away from an outlet. This dual-core chip has a 4MB cache and can boost speeds up to 2.8GHz and it has enough power for web browsing, editing documents, working with spreadsheets, streaming video, and making calls. The processor can’t handle video editing, 3D rendering, or modern gaming beyond simple games, but it can handle regular school and office tasks without too many delays.</p>
<p>The 15.6-inch FHD display at 1920×1080 resolution shows text crisply enough for extended document work without causing eye strain, and the anti-glare coating reduces reflections from overhead lighting or windows. The thin bezels make the most of the screen space in the chassis and gives it a modern look that doesn’t look cheap even though it is. Dolby Audio processing through two speakers makes video calls sound clear and YouTube and Netflix sound good enough.</p>



<p>Wi-Fi 6 support makes wireless connections faster and works better in networks that are crowded with a lot of devices trying to use the same bandwidth at the same time. This new standard makes it easier for multiple people to stream content, play games, and make video calls at the same time in dorms, offices, or homes. Bluetooth 5.2 works better with wireless devices like mice, keyboards, and headphones than older Bluetooth versions as it has a longer range and more stable connections. The selection of connections meets real-world needs with <strong>USB-A ports for older devices, USB-C ports for newer accessories, HDMI ports for external monitors</strong> or projectors, and an ethernet jack for wired connections when Wi-Fi isn’t available or reliable.</p>
<p>This huge discount off the normal listing price makes a well-configured laptop with lots of RAM and storage affordable while still keeping specs that would normally cost $800–900 elsewhere. You’re getting twice as much memory and storage as most other budget laptops, and the machine’s useful life will be longer than that of cheaper options because it has modern connectivity standards.</p>

Yes, it's GOTY time.</p>
<p>2025 has been a bumper one across the board, with brilliant games big and small — indie, are-they-indie?, and absolutely-definitely-not-indie — launching every single month. This is the year that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Silksong</a> <em>finally</em> came out, for heaven's sake!

Just looking at the software, the quality in 2025 has been top-shelf.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ulstxi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>If you've joined us only recently, we here at Nintendo Life have our own staff GOTY list encompassing all of our personal top fives, but top GOTY billing goes to our community-ranked Top 50 Switch games of the year - this year featuring Switch 2, too.</p>
<p>We've got one for every year of the Switch's life so far, each ordered according to the corresponding games' User Rating in our database.</p>
<p>These real-time lists, based on the User Ratings in our database, are a living ranking of each year's finest video games. Looking back over the Switch generation, here are the winners from the previous eight(!) years:</p>

</ul>
<p>Not a bad octet, is it? So, it's time to start looking through the gems we've played in the last 12 months.</p>
<p>Below you'll find <strong>every Switch game we've reviewed in 2025 awarded a 6/10 or higher.</strong> To rate any games you've played, registered users can click the star next to the corresponding title and give them a score out of 10. <strong>We encourage you to use the search bar</strong>, but otherwise you can browse at your leisure.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT: All Switch 1 and 2 games released in 2025 are eligible and available to rate in our database.</strong> We've limited the ones shown below to cull endless pages of shovelware, but if there's something we didn't review (or just didn't enjoy as much as you), find it by heading to the search bar at the very top of the page and going directly to that game's page.</p>
<p>We'll go live with the results later in the month, and due to the real-time nature of the list, games launched between now and the end of the year still have every chance of showing up in the Top 50, too. No one's left behind!</p>

<p><em>Thanks for 'voting'! Our database should contain every game released in 2025, but please let us know below if anything is missing and we'll get it added. Happy rating!</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/community-its-time-to-rate-your-switch-1-and-2-games-of-the-year]]></content:encoded>
