            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-aetheryte-london<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has unveiled a real-life Aetheryte Crystal landmark at London's King's Cross St. Pancras train station to celebrate the upcoming launch of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail</em>.</p>
<p>The newest expansion for the critically-acclaimed MMO is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-expansion-release-date-collectors-edition">launching on July 2nd</a>, and to commemorate its impending release, a life-size Aetheryte Crystal has been placed outside one of central London's busiest train stations.</p>
<p>If you're in the area, you'll be able to visit the crystal until 11pm tonight, after which point it'll be removed. Make sure you don't try to teleport to it after that, and don't set it as your free return location; who knows where you might end up?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-real-life-aetheryte.jpg?itok=26dHDl4n 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-real-life-aetheryte.jpg?itok=Ir8e0oSU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It'd be pretty convenient if you could just teleport to this thing, eh?</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, this Aetheryte doesn't have the same properties as the ones in&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, so you won't just be able to teleport to it by paying a nominal fee (or, indeed, for free if it's set as your return point).</p>
<p>At least, I assume that's the case. It may be that this crystal does indeed contain the secrets of teleportation, and that our lowly species has yet to discover the way to unlock those secrets. For now, though, I'd stick to taking the trains.</p>
<p>This crystal business is all in aid of publicizing the release of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail</em>, the latest expansion for Square Enix's much-loved MMORPG&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>.</p>
<p><em>Dawntrail&nbsp;</em>is set to be the start of a new saga for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>after 2021's&nbsp;<em>Endwalker&nbsp;</em>concluded a ten-year saga with a suitably emotional bang, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-update-655-screenshots-tease-dawntrail-story-with-pictomancer-krile">the story for this one</a> seems like it'll be decidedly more light-hearted and adventure-filled.</p>

<p>As well as telling a new story,&nbsp;<em>Dawntrail&nbsp;</em>will also raise&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>'s level cap to 100, and it'll introduce two new DPS jobs: the magical <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-expansion-dawntrail-reveals-new-job-pictomancer-withg-spectacular">Pictomancer</a> and the melee-focused <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-reveal-recap-new-viper-job-ffxi-crossover-tons-of-content">Viper</a>.</p>
<p><em>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail&nbsp;</em>launches on July 2nd across PC, PlayStation, and Xbox Series X|S. If you tune into Twitch streams marked with the Viewer Rewards tag between then and July 29th, you <a href="https://x.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1805171513626329329" rel="noopener" target="_blank">could earn an adorable Chocorpokkur mount</a>, so make sure to keep your eye out for that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/marvel-crisis-protocol-black-panther-shang-chi-and-more-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We're back with another new set review for the fast-paced, kinetic&nbsp;<em>Marvel: Crisis Protocol</em>, a tabletop miniatures skirmish game from Atomic Mass Games featuring your favorite characters from across the Marvel universe. We most recently covered <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/marvel-crisis-protocol-professor-x-nightcrawler-and-more-review">a large batch releases, including Professor X, Nightcrawler, and more</a>. Now we're checking out two new releases: first up is Black Panther, Chosen of Bast &amp; Namor, The Sub-Mariner, and from there we move onto Shang-Chi &amp; Silver Sable -- read on for our review!</p>
<h2><em>Marvel: Crisis Protocol&nbsp;</em>- Black Panther, Chosen of Bast &amp; Namor, The Sub-Mariner</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-black-panther-and-namor.jpg?itok=y1eUYLWr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-black-panther-and-namor.jpg?itok=MvV9f3FS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>From Wakanda to Atlantis, heroes come together!</figcaption></figure><p>First let's look Black Panther, Chosen of Bast - who brings his hand-to-hand combat skills to the table in a new version of the character (the game has previously released the character as: <a href="https://www.atomicmassgames.com/character/black-panther-killmonger/">Black Panther</a>, this new "Chosen of Bast" moniker makes this an entirely different version of the character).</p>
<h3>Black Panther, Chosen of Bast</h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-black-panther-chosen-of-bast.jpg?itok=x3qW7V7l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-black-panther-chosen-of-bast.jpg?itok=9YBoQxin 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The addition of Wallcrawler really emphasizes his mobility!</figcaption></figure><p>As we can see from the above stat card, this version of the character is a 3 Threat character (the previous incarnation is 4 threat) and features a balanced defense. Retaining the very fun "Pounce" ability the former version of the card also had, he's now kitted out with the very powerful Spirit Predator ability.</p>
<p>I found myself immediately drawn to that big, nasty attack - where you're rolling 7 dice and (with a little luck) then able to unleash your Builder for free. In one of my games, this lead to him almost one-shotting Mysterio. It's these kinds of interactions that make me fall more in love with&nbsp;<em>Marvel: Crisis Protocol</em>&nbsp;every day -- it truly is just a chance to play What If? on a grand scale.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-black-panther.jpg?itok=REaiw9pI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-black-panther.jpg?itok=jZILFF4s 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ready to strike!</figcaption></figure><p>Playing with Black Panther, I was impressed with his ability to navigate the battlefield now that he has Wallcrawler. With a larger base, in my playthrough I had him constantly moving around the board, throwing himself with Pounce, and getting the jump on objectives with Insight of the Ancients.</p>
<p>Statistics-wise I feel like he's fairly middle-of-the-road for a 3 cost character (though I do like that all of his attacks are Mystic-based), but that doesn't mean he's not an incredibly useful addition to your crew. Use him (obviously) with other Wakanda affiliated characters to great effectiveness, or throw him in an Avengers lineup and just lean on him to get stuck in and deal serious damage.</p>
<h3>Namor, the Sub-Mariner</h3>
<p>Next up in the pack, making his&nbsp;<em>Marvel: Crisis Protocol&nbsp;</em>debut, is the isolationist king himself Namor, the Sub-Mariner. Let's go ahead and take the plunge (sorry) and check out his stat card.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-namor-the-sub-mariner.jpg?itok=wui7s9tZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-namor-the-sub-mariner.jpg?itok=0qRnidWD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Who knew Namor was a Gem Bearer!?</figcaption></figure><p>As his 5-threat power level suggests, Namor, the Sub-Mariner is a seriously powerful character. While play testing Namor, the number one thing that was immediately obvious was how shockingly fast this character is. He's on a large base, has flight, and he's got a Move Long, which means he was absolutely zipping across the battlefield the entire game.</p>
<p>With 7 Health on both sides of his card, he's also incredibly sturdy, allows nearby allies (and himself) to reroll 1 die in their attack and defense rolls, gains extra Power,&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em>his attacks and effects can't be reduced or prevented by superpowers or Team Tactic Cards. So why does all of that matter? Because that's all passive bonuses that don't require an energy spend.</p>
<p>This means that - even setting aside his attacks for a moment (which we'll get to shortly) - he's a highly mobile, <em>extremely</em>&nbsp;hard-hitting model who can even slightly, passively buff his teammates.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-namor.jpg?itok=7py5bkAq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-namor.jpg?itok=8x_37JxV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Prince Namor looking extremely ripped bursting out of the sea!</figcaption></figure><p>But it's his two attacks that were most impressive in my playtesting. His builder attack allows him to Advance toward his target distance Small, but his Armies of the Deep attack is the real stunner here. As you can see from the card above, he either calls a swarm of crabs, an octopus, or a wave of turtles to crush the foe. That's... hilarious? In my playtesting, he sent a devastating Wave of Turtles crashing into Doc Ock (missed opportunity not sending the octopus after him, but I had a game to win here).</p>
<p>All in all, for sheer maneuverability,&nbsp;I think Namor deserves some serious consideration for your list. He hits hard, is a sturdy fighter, and has multiple abilities that allow him to either stay on his opponents or do a bit of zone control by pushing them away.</p>
<h2><em>Marvel: Crisis Protocol&nbsp;</em>- Shang-Chi &amp; Silver Sable</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-shang-chi-and-silver-sable.jpg?itok=GlVlMX02 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-shang-chi-and-silver-sable.jpg?itok=lCxwdSis 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Up next is everyone's favorite martial artist, Shang-Chi, and the famous mercenary known as Silver Sable!</p>
<p>I'm&nbsp;<em>always</em>&nbsp;a big fan of more on-the-ground heroes and villains, so I knew this character pack would be right in my wheelhouse. Let's start with Shang-Chi!</p>
<h3>Shang-Chi</h3>
<figure role="group"><figcaption>We're showing both sides of Shang-Chi's card here because of how his attacks subtly change between his healthy and injured side.</figcaption></figure><p>He's exactly what you'd expect from a character who's main form of super-heroism comes from on-the-ground, fist-to-fist combat, though the Range 3 on his Rising Phoenix Kick has a much nicer range than I could have hoped for with this martial artist. His "Supreme Martial Artist" ability, where he counts blanks as successes when defending a close-combat fight, is super thematic.</p>
<p>And while all of his attacks, on both sides of his card (we love new attacks opening up on an Injured card side), are potent and powerful - I think the main takeaway for how to play Shang-Chi is to use him to really manage hot objective areas.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-shang-chi.jpg?itok=N59-KHP5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-shang-chi.jpg?itok=nQ30_lHv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Shang-Chi doesn't even need the rings to lay a hurt on his opponents.</figcaption></figure><p>I wouldn't necessarily lean on him to hold objectives, but he should constantly be pushing enemies out of range with moves like "Dragon Chases Its Tail" and "One Inch Punch." With his ability to sneak in little small moves, and push enemies around the board, it'll be hard to face off against him and stay put in one spot.</p>
<p>In other words, Shang-Chi is great at letting someone else hold objects while he ensures high-danger enemies aren't allowed to stick in and cause problems.</p>
<h3>Silver Sable</h3>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-silver-sable-card.jpg?itok=Sj-Ewf0W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-silver-sable-card.jpg?itok=RGId5wJ0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Get comfy in your Sniper Nest and pick off your enemies.</figcaption></figure><p>For Silvija Sablinova, there are no radioactive spider bites to nurse, no exposure to gamma rays... nothing but a big, terrifying looking sniper rifle! And it's for this reason that this character is such a fun welcome to the game. I have to admit, I'm a sucker for long-range characters in&nbsp;<em>Marvel: Crisis Protocol</em>, and there aren't many out there with a Range 5.</p>
<p>Of all her special abilities here, for me - in my playtesting at least - it was all about the Sniper Nest and Headshot. Just build up her power, get her high up, and start cracking at enemies out in the open. Easy to pilot as a character, there's not a ton of complexity to Silver Sable, but she's so much fun to play.</p>
<p>I do wonder if she's worth the 4 threat, as Silver Sable feels like more of a 3 threat character, but with Shot Caller, and some of her tactics cards (which you should check out in depth on <a href="https://www.atomicmassgames.com/transmission/from-panel-to-play-silver-sable/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Atomic Mass site</a>), she can be a really potent addition to your team.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-silver-sable.jpg?itok=L3zUT8CR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-crisis-protocol-silver-sable.jpg?itok=xu9RlPEu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Marvel: Crisis Protocol - New Character Packs Final Thoughts</em></h2>
<p>I think that both of these new character packs are really strong additions to the game. The new Black Panther is a very powerful striker, and Namor is so slippery on the battlefield he's a must-add for anyone running a S.H.I.E.L.D. list. And both Shang-Chi and Silver Sable are fun characters who do very different things.</p>
<p>It's always hard for me to give a sort of final thought roundup on miniatures when we're dealing with a collection of different ones, so what I really want to say in this space is: do these characters interest you? Do they feel like they'd be a good fit in your lists? Overall, for me, the most important thing about each of these four miniatures is that none of them feel boring.</p>
<p>Instead, each of these characters are rendered onto the tabletop in ways that feel true to their roots, the miniature designs look absolutely amazing, and each has the ability to create a fun, engrossing moment. I've always felt that you get the most interesting moments from non-core characters with&nbsp;<em>MCP</em>&nbsp;- Iron Man's great and all, but isn't it more interesting to lumber around the field as Arnim Zola?</p>
<p>That's how I feel about fielding Namor or Silver Sable, these are characters that are well-loved, but they haven't been MCU-ified to death (not that there's anything wrong with MCU, but it takes some of the mystique away from a character when we've lived with them in live action for years). So that's why I really love these packs - the characters are powerful, and shake up the world of the game a bit!</p>

  <p id="T4eTkV"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/22381941/beginners-job-subscription-teleport-mount-shadowbringers-endwalker"><em>Final Fantasy 14</em></a>’s <em>Dawntrail </em>expansion is upon us, with the game going down for a <strong>48-hour maintenance</strong> ahead of its early access period.</p>
<p id="5wVwvm">While <em>Dawntrail </em>itself launches fully on July 2, players who pre-ordered the new expansion will be able to play it early on June 28 after the lengthy maintenance.</p>
<p id="OaI2sb">Below, we explain when <em>FFXIV Dawntrail</em> maintenance begins and what last-minute things you can do to ensure you’re all set for the expansion’s launch.</p>
<hr id="qsgp2D">
<h2 id="n3Ji6Z">
<strong>What time does </strong><em><strong>FFXIV </strong></em><strong>go down for maintenance?</strong>
</h2>
<p id="lNoIYf"><em>Final Fantasy 14</em> will go down for maintenance on <strong>Wednesday, June 26, </strong>at the following times and will be unavailable for 48 hours:</p>
<ul>
<li id="hRirtL">
<strong>2 a.m. PDT</strong> for the west coast of North America</li>
<li id="Prdg5A">
<strong>5 a.m. EDT</strong> for the east coast of North America</li>
<li id="ifpyl6">
<strong>10 a.m. BST </strong>for the U.K.</li>
<li id="XaeSfj">
<strong>11 a.m. CEST</strong> for western Europe/Paris</li>
<li id="TI0AFn">
<strong>6 p.m. JST</strong> for Japan/Tokyo</li>
<li id="GliPUK">
<strong>7 p.m. AEDT</strong> for Australia/Sydney</li>
</ul>
<p id="6uHLB9">That said, the game will come back up at the same time, but on <strong>Friday, June 28</strong>. You will only have access to <em>Dawntrail</em> content if you pre-ordered the expansion. </p>
<hr id="NWnzlD">
<h2 id="iRht83"><strong>What should I do before FFXIV Dawntrail maintenance?</strong></h2>
<p id="IDt6i0">Ahead of maintenance, there’s plenty of things you can do to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/24167088/dawntrail-prepare-how-to-get-ready">prepare for <em>Dawntrail</em></a>. Outside of stuff we list in our guide, you should also make sure to <strong>put any gardening plots away</strong> so that your crops don’t wither — the timer for the crops will keep going, even during maintenance. You should also <strong>refresh your </strong><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24115574/how-to-get-a-house-apartment-lottery-wards-plots"><strong>housing timer</strong></a>, if you have a house. During <em>Endwalker</em>’s launch, you couldn’t enter your house due to extreme server congestion, so it’s best to reset that timer now before congestion possibly occurs.</p>
<p id="vrOOnL">If you plan on using a Fantasia to change into the newly added female Hrothgar, you should <strong>use you Fantasia before maintenance</strong>. You’ll also need to <strong>unequip everything</strong> before being able to Fantasia. Since you have to relog to actually change races, you’ll be able to change right away upon your first login after maintenance. (If the login queues and aforementioned congestion are as bad as they were during <em>Endwalker</em>, you will not want to relog for that Fantasia, as you may end up stuck in a login queue for hours.)</p>
<p id="ORAoAM">Last but not least, you should make sure to <strong>log off in a sanctuary</strong> (in a town or near an Aetheryte) to make sure you accumulate <strong>rested EXP</strong> — which is a 50% EXP bonus up until a certain amount.</p>

  <p id="ooDeLN">Horror comic fans will get a windfall this October with <em>Through Red Windows</em>, a new series from the combined and formidable talents of writer Ram V (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2022/12/6/23488554/best-comics-2022-graphic-novels"><em>The Many Deaths of Laila Starr</em></a>, <em>Detective Comics</em>) and artist Joëlle Jones (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/2021/2/3/22244520/yara-flor-wonder-girl-woman-cw-brazilian"><em>Wonder Girl</em></a>, <em>Lady Killer</em>), published by Dstlry. </p>
<p id="uLK8LQ">“<em>Through Red Windows</em> has been an exercise in [sowing] discomfort,” Jones told Polygon via email.</p>
<p id="eQjlJ6">The series follows up-and-coming financier Athul Laal, who accepts an invitation to live in his plutocratic mentor’s 73-story Manhattan residence and office building. Then, as Jones put it, “chaos and viscera” ensue.</p>

<p id="90fm6i">Ram V said the series grew from his love of Edgar Allan Poe, and from making a lot of friends in the architecture department during college, which instilled in him a fascination for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7n7ylXPueYE">altered reality within highly designed spaces</a>. </p>
<p id="ycK7ge">“Psycho-geography has also been an ongoing obsession of my work,” Ram told Polygon via email. “The high-rise element of this story comes from there. I’d also been interested in telling a story that looked at wealth, old wealth as a sort of Eldritch Entity with eternal self-perpetuation as a motive. And I’d wanted to tell a story of the dehumanizing nature of modern day ambition, especially as I see it in the nouveau riche, Indian entrepreneur.”</p>
<p id="SM5r1i">“The business aesthetic is inherently harsh and desaturated; greys, whites, blacks, and navy blues set around right angles,” Jones said of her work on the series. “It’s incredibly austere. Having that contrast against the eldritch and supernatural has been a fantastic challenge and a lot of fun—it’s injecting chaos and viscera into a design that relies on uniformity and perfection. Hopefully you’ll never read another comic like it.”</p>
<p id="xBtv13">Jones shared two pages of strikingly colored interior art from the upcoming first issue. [<strong>Ed. note:</strong> The pages contain a depiction of suicide.]</p>

<p id="3bQcpe"><em>Through Red Windows </em>will be told in longer than usual 48-page installments, starting with <em>Through Red Windows</em> #1 this October, available for preorder or digital purchase <a href="https://dstlry.co/products/through-red-windows-1-jones-cover-a?_pos=1&amp;_sid=8d8ce118f&amp;_ss=r">direct from Dstlry</a>. Keep reading for the official summary of the first issue, and a look at the main and variant covers by Jones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="qHTRdl">When ailing Plutocrat, Harlan Roderick, invites his young protégé Athul Laal to live at Roderick Place in downtown Manhattan, what Athul believes this to be his first step into the inner circle of the world’s elite, soon turns into a living nightmare. Athul discovers that Harlan and his illness are inextricably connected to the 73-story building, in which, behind each door, lie secrets and monsters from both Harlan and Athul’s own lives.</p>
<p id="seWB3b">Laal’s ambition gets the better of him and the higher he climbs in the company (and the building!) the deeper and darker becomes the danger to his life….and maybe his soul.</p>

To get it, you’re going to need to begin by upgrading your Crafting Bench to Uncommon, because what we’re after here is actually the “Uncommon Cool-Headed Charm.” For that you’ll need eight Planks and three Shells. After that, you’re going to want these materials:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>3 Silk Thread</li><li>1 Marble</li><li>3 Sand Shell</li></ul><p>To get the Marble, you’ll also need an Uncommon level Pickaxe, and go mining in caves.

A more temporary measure is to stack Snowberries or Snowberry Shakes, which boost your heat resistance, the fruit found in the Frostlands. But you can take it to the next level with the Rare Cool-Headed Charm. For that, you’ll need to upgrade your Bench once more, this time to the Rare tier, which is a whole thing. To do it, you’ll need to gather:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>12 Knotroot Rods</li><li>15 Marble Slabs</li><li>6 Sand Claws</li><li>3 Sand Shells</li></ul><p>That done, you can upgrade your Uncommon Cool-Headed Charm to Rare with the following ingredients:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>3 Heavy Wool Thread.</li><li>5 Frost Shell.</li><li>1 Sand Brute Scale.</li><li>3 Malachite Slabs.</li></ul><p>Now you can go stand on the surface of the sun itself.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Palworld Sakurajima Update | Summer Game Fest 2024</p>
      </div>
<h2>Finding the Sakurajima Island in Palworld</h2><p>As you might expect, a majority of the new content in the DLC resides on the new Sakurajima Island. This island isn't on a separate map from the original island, but you won't be able to see it right when you load up an old or new save. Instead, you need to discover the island and uncover its surroundings like you did with the original Palpagos Islands map.</p><p>Sakurajima Island is located on the northwestern side of the existing map. The island is situated just north of Icy Wind Island and Forgotten Island and to the southwest of the Astral Mountains. When you first load in after downloading the Sakurajima DLC, you'll just see a sea of blacked-out map. If you keep traveling into the blacked-out part of the map, Sakurajima Island makes itself visible quickly.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322214-palworldscreenshot2024.06.17-16.01.19.56.png" data-ref-id="1300-4322214" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322214-palworldscreenshot2024.06.17-16.01.19.56.png" data-ref-id="1300-4322214"></a><figcaption>The location of Sakurajima Island. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322214-palworldscreenshot2024.06.17-16.01.19.56.png"></figure><h2>Level Requirement for the Sakurajima DLC</h2><p>Of course, just because you can visit the new island whenever you want doesn't necessarily mean you should. The developers at PocketPair have made a conscious decision to make the Sakurajima DLC a part of the endgame content in Palworld. This means lower-level players won't be able to visit the island without being severely overmatched by the Pals that call the location home.</p><p>In my experience, the lowest levels Pals on Sakurajima Island are roughly level 42-43. There aren't too many Pals in the lower 40s, though, as most of them are in the mid-upper 40s in the early parts of the island. As you continue and explore deeper and deeper, the Pals' levels increase to 50 and above. While many of the Pals on Sakurajima Island don't pose a massive threat, they are definitely strong enough to wipe out your entire party if you're not at the right level.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322373-palworldscreenshot2024.06.17-15.53.09.93.png" data-ref-id="1300-4322373" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322373-palworldscreenshot2024.06.17-15.53.09.93.png" data-ref-id="1300-4322373"></a><figcaption>The new region in Palworld is not friendly to new players.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4322373-palworldscreenshot2024.06.17-15.53.09.93.png"></figure><p>The real trouble you'll face on Sakurajima Island is human NPCs. A new group inhabits the island, which consists of level 45 NPCs, and they quickly eliminated a level 51 Jettragon, Blazamut, and Orserk in a matter of seconds. While some Pals can certainly cause you issues, these new NPCs are what you truly need to look out for, especially if you're not level 50 yet.</p><p>Once you've reached the right level and you're ready to explore Sakurajima Island, just head to the northwest side of the map and begin uncovering the new map. It's not nearly as large as the Palpagos Islands, but there are several different biomes, bosses, and other secrets to find.</p>

        <p>Studio discusses its transmedia ambitions and the challenges of launching a new IP into a crowded market</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Earlier this year, UK developer Playfusion unveiled its newest game Ascendant Infinity, which aims to shake up the online multiplayer space with matches that change every time.</p>
<p>The title goes beyond just changing what equipment is available, or where the point-scoring items needed to win are located; it also triggers random events such as air strikes or monster spawns that can disrupt players' strategies.</p>
<p>The studio's founder Mark Gerhard tells <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> that, after a long time in stealth mode, the team was relieved the initial reveal went down well: "People are looking for fresh content, stuff that's innovative. I think there's a fatigue around sequels, the next battle royale, and things like that. People are happy to see we've taken the risk to innovate, to create this 'adaption shooter' and event-driven gameplay mechanic."</p>
<p>Players, influencers, and press all loved the game, Gerhard tells us. The studio boss tells us that several media outlets criticised the name heavily, but that seemed to be the only sticking point (easily solved by dropping the 'Infinity' and re-revealing the game under the simplified title Ascendant during this month's Future Games Show). Now the team is focused on making a title that delivers on the initial hype.</p>
<p>"The team and I are super pumped – we really think we've got something special here," says Gerhard. "But the game is the tip of the iceberg. There's a crazy transmedia vision that we've been working on for nine years that we're hoping to realise, but it doesn't matter until the game works."</p>

<p>Details of this transmedia vision haven't been fully announced yet, but Gerhard does tell us that a pilot for a TV show has been written by the creative minds behind Arcane, the animated Netflix show based on Riot Games' League of Legends. Playfusion also holds patents for tech that Gerhard describes as "Shazam for video" that will help link the show to the game, as well as plans to put players' characters in the TV show.</p>
<p>If this sounds ambitious for an independent studio, and perhaps a little random, it's worth noting that Playfusion's debut title Lightseekers was also built around transmedia. In addition to the digital collectible card game at its heart, Lightseekers encompassed a range of toys-to-life products, with plans for comics, TV series, board games and more – but it was scuppered by the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/toys-r-us-enters-administration">collapse of a crucial partner, Toys R US</a>, just a few weeks after launch.</p>
<p>"The genesis of PlayFusion in 2015 was [that] we wanted to build this transmedia universe," Gerhard explains. "No one has delivered on transmedia – I think we need better words to describe it.</p>
<p>"Lightseekers was the start. That ended for us with tremendous sadness, of course, because we had just launched it and four weeks later, Toys R Us went bankrupt. They had everything – all our products, all our cards. And the game was free because it was there to support the ecosystem."</p>
<p>A multiplayer shooter seems like a dramatic pivot from a collectible card game for the studio, we note. But Gerhard says that the studio does have some heritage in this field.</p>
<p>While most of the team are former staff from Runescape developer Jagex, where Gerhard was once CEO, others were brought on board from Eurocom after that studio was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/eurocom-ceases-trading-all-jobs-lost">closed at the end of 2012</a>. With them, they brought the talent behind the last three James Bond games: the 2010 Goldeneye reimagining for Wii, 2011's expanded Goldeneye Reloaded for Xbox and PlayStation, and 2012's 007 Legends.</p>
<p>"The team's expertise and passion really is to make the game we've made now," he says. "Lightseekers was a stepping stone or a proof point for doing this. After all of that, we recapitalised the business ourselves and just said, 'Let's just follow our dream. Let's just make our game, not a game to support toys or whatever else' – and that is Ascendant. If this works, this will be an overnight success that only took ten years to make."</p>
<p>Building a new games IP at the heart of a transmedia empire is hardly a new venture. Scores of companies, even AAA publishers, have attempted to bring their brands into other forms of entertainment in a connected way, but very few have succeeded. There are a myriad reasons why these firms have struggled and two in particular come to mind. Firstly, each transmedia product needs to stand out as best-in-class in its field, and secondly, the price of entry can be high if fans are expected to buy a range of comics, books, and more, alongside the central game.</p>
<p>"I know what you mean: if bigger companies with bigger resources, better IP, and bigger communities have not been able to be successful, why could we?" Gerhard says. "It is hard without doubt. If it was easy, it would have been done. I'm convinced this is the future of our art form, and it will evolve to this."</p>
<p>The Playfusion founder asserts that transmedia games brands have yet to truly take off because "there hasn't been the world-class example of it." But he believes that once there is – "and I'm hoping that it's us" – it will be akin to the advances Dolby made in music: once stereo became available, fewer people wanted mono experiences.</p>
<p>That said, he acknowledges that managing multiple products in different forms of entertainment increases the risk a company faces: "If any one of these legs in your three-legged chair are knocked out, you fall over. Bigger institutions like us have tried and at the first sign of failure, that's probably when they withdraw."</p>
<p>He quotes Arnold Schwarzenegger, who<a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=860403125819697"> said in an interview last year</a> that: "Losers stay down but winners always get up, dust themselves off and keep going.” Gerhard says the same is true of Lightseekers and Playfusion's transmedia vision: "If you accept defeat of your first failure, you're right."</p>
<p>For now, the primary focus is the Ascendant game. Gerhard reveals the development process has actually been very different to any game he and the team has worked on before.</p>
<p>"We grey-boxed everything and just used placeholder art [for a long time]," he explains, "because we really wanted to find the fun and build the systems and the mechanics. We knew we could [make] art [for] our game.</p>
<p>"I've been on a lot of projects where art runs first and foremost because it's the most satisfying, the most visual, and because if you see awesome stuff, you think you've got an awesome game, and then you actually find that that last bit is really hard. For us, it was the inverse; we didn't even worry about art, we just said 'Let's find the fun' and hopefully build something that will be a game for the next two decades."</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>Ascendant spawns monsters, air strikes and other events mid-match so no session is the same</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Gerhard adds with a laugh that once the art was put in, it caused crashes and issues with performance and framerate, so the team has been focused on addressing these ahead of the upcoming beta.</p>
<p>"Obviously, on super high-end stuff it's fine, but we want to make sure we can get as many players as possible and sort of trying to low-mid spec, but at the same time not compromise the creative vision."</p>
<p>As for expectations, Gerhard recognises that – even with its 'adaption shooter' angle – Ascendant is launching into one of the most competitive spaces on the market: live service online multiplayer shooters. But the studio's chief marketing officer Murray Pannell (formerly of PlayStation, Ubisoft, EA, 2K Games and more) remains confident about the title's chances.</p>
<blockquote>"One of our biggest challenges is the awareness and the cold start scenario"<cite>Murray Pannell</cite></blockquote>
<p>"This was so much more advanced than many other games I've been working on at the same time frame," he says. "One of our biggest challenges, particularly from a marketing point of view, is the awareness and the cold start scenario. How do you break through in a complex and crowded marketplace where there's an awful lot of institutional games that people are already embedded in and wedded to?</p>
<p>"We don't need to be as big as Fortnite or Call of Duty to be successful. We'd love to be, but that's not our initial ambition. I think we will find a really good game for a good audience who will love this and play it a lot, and we'll grow from there."</p>
<p>Gerhard concludes: "Players won't believe what they're playing came from an independent studio. People will perceive this as a big AAA production. That's where we're all hoping to put a little dent in the universe and defy convention. I think we're close to that. We've still got to breakthrough in a crowded space, but I think we can do that."</p>

            <p>FIFA may not have released a licensed football game recently, but it's ready to team up with Rocket League to introduce an all-new category to its FIFA Esports World Cup.</p>
<p>In a "groundbreaking partnership", FIFAe – that's FIFA's esports arm – <a href="https://www.fifa.gg/news/fifae-introduces-national-team-competition-featuring-rocket-league">says</a> Rocket League will feature in the upcoming FIFAe World Cup, "signif[ying] a major step in FIFA's commitment to embrace the entire ecosystem and drive the global growth of football esports globally".</p>

<p>The competition invites the 16 participating nations to submit three players and one substitute, with the nations themselves selected "based on the number of representatives from each country in previous Rocket League Majors".</p>
<p>It's not clear what cash prize participants will be fighting for, but more information about the "final event" is promised at "a later stage".</p>
<p>"The FIFAe World Cup featuring Rocket League marks a new era for FIFAe, providing a groundbreaking platform for FIFA's member assocations to compete on one of the most relevant esports titles," said Christian Volk, FIFA's director of eFootball and gaming.</p>

<p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2k-will-develop-the-next-fifa-game-leaker-claims">2K is rumoured to have secured the official FIFA license to develop the next FIFA game</a>.</p>
<p>That's according to unverified claims from a retailer which allege that "the partnership is confirmed, and 2K will be developing a new football game series", albeit without sharing their source.</p>
<p>Whilst not confirmed in any official capacity at all – which means we can only take this news as a hefty rumour for now – it does back up prior claims from <a href="https://x.com/Kurakasis/status/1756869003518042403">earlier this year</a> that 2K and FIFA may have been in talks for the former to succeed development of the FIFA series <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-almost-30-years-ea-is-officially-ditching-the-fifa-brand-1">after EA announced</a> it would be taking its football franchise forward without FIFA branding.</p>
<p>Not that that seems to have done EA any harm; EA's long-running football series might have jettisoned the FIFA license, but the publisher was keen to let everyone know it's doing just fine without it, announcing that this year's iteration, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-fc-24-trumpets-11m-players-in-first-week-1m-more-than-fifa-23">EA Sports FC 24, reached 11.3m players in its first week of release</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/umamusume-pretty-derby-western-release<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Cygames has announced that horse girl gacha game&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby&nbsp;</em>is officially making its way to the West at some point in the future.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/umamusume_eng/status/1805222758063988963" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on a newly-created X (formerly Twitter) account for the game's Western release,&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em>'s Western launch is "on the way", although sadly, we don't have a release date or even a window for it yet.</p>
<p>As the game's official website notes, however, it will be a free-to-play game that'll launch on both iOS and Android. In Japan, the game is also available on PC, but sadly, the PC version doesn't seem to be coming West. Still, there's always <a href="https://www.bluestacks.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BlueStacks</a>, eh?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/umamusume-pretty-derby-western-release-girls.jpg?itok=DP4hYkYY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/umamusume-pretty-derby-western-release-girls.jpg?itok=9xvojQY1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby&nbsp;</em>is finally on its way to the West.</figcaption></figure><p>Along with announcing the Western release of&nbsp;<em>Pretty Derby</em>, developer and publisher Cygames has also revealed the opening movie for the game, titled "Girls' Legend U".</p>
<p>It's a 3D-rendered sequence that effectively serves as a tone-setter for&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em>, and it's soundtracked by a very upbeat song with cutesy lyrics.</p>
<p>You can check out "Girls' Legend U" right here. It should get you hyped to play the English version of this deeply strange but rather endearing-looking gacha game.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em>, it's...well, it's a gacha game in which famous racehorses from history have been transformed into anime girls.</p>
<p>These horse girls compete for the chance to earn fame and fortune at Tracen Academy in Tokyo. They're based on real horses, too; horses like Special Week, Meijiro McQueen, and Cesario appear in the manga and its various spinoff media (including the game).</p>
<p>This technically isn't the first&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby&nbsp;</em>announcement for the West, either. Back <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/umamusume-pretty-derby-finally-coming-west-with-party-game-for-ps4-switch-pc">in June last year</a>, Cygames announced that party game&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby - Party Dash&nbsp;</em>would be coming West sometime in 2024, and in April, a new trailer announced a release date of August 30th.</p>

<p>We don't have a release window for&nbsp;<em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby&nbsp;</em>in the West yet. Stay tuned for more info on this one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-inspired-elden-ring-graceborne-mod/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Elden Ring and Bloodborne fans unite as the new Elden Ring Graceborne mod aims to make FromSoftware's 2022 hit title more menacing and wicked.</p>
<p>Created by modder 'Noctis', this Graceborne mod is heavily inspired by 2015's PlayStation&nbsp; 4 exclusive BloodBorne. According to the the modder, the project is still work-in-progress, and there are still plenty of issues with balancing, sound, weapon scaling, and more. It's also worth nothing that the mod won't work with the most recent version of Elden Ring. As such, you'll need to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5207?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">downgrade</a> to version 1.10 or lower. At the moment of writing, 'Noctis' isn't sure when the mod will be working again following last week's release of the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-1-12-patch-ray-tracing-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most recent update</a>.</p>
<p><em>"Graceborne is a mod overhaul still in its infancy. Heavily inspired by Bloodborne, its main goal&nbsp;is to turn Elden Ring's base game into a more grim and sinister experience through multiple means", </em>the modder writes. <em>"In terms of content, the alpha adds a total of 22 armor sets, 35 weapons, 17 trick weapons and 5 firearms. Followed by gameplay additions such as gun parrying, no equip load, quicksteps when locked on, perma-night, Bloodborne-style healing, etc."</em></p>
<p>We've included the alpha release trailer of this interesting new overhaul mod below:</p>
<p><iframe title="GRACEBORNE - Alpha Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/he3dqe_6ZjY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Elden Ring Graceborne mod can be downloaded <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5207?tab=files" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Nexusmods her</a>e. As expected, this mod is only available for the PC version.</p>
<p>Elden Ring and the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion are available worldwide now for PC and consoles. Here's what we wrote about the 2022 hit title in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch review back</a> then:</p>
<p><em>Right from the intro, it is clear that the Elden Ring's lore is incredibly deep. The game takes place in the Lands Between, lands that were once prosperous thanks to the rule of Queen Marika The Eternal and her children, the Demigods. The people of the lands were blessed by the Erdtree and the Elden Ring that was generated from it, which kept the Golden Order of the land in place. The Elden Ring itself was maintained by the balance between the different Runes it housed. The history of the Lands Between took a turn for the worse, however, when some mysterious figures stole the Death Rune and killed one of Marika's children, the Demigod Godwyn. This event brought the end of the Golden Order and turned the Lands Between into the state they are in at the start of the game. The player is only one of the Tarnished, whose goal is to recover every Great Rune and restore the Elden Ring to become the Elden Lord. The Tarnished were all blessed by the Erdtree and the Elden Ring, but now only some of them retain the benevolence of Grace, which also guides them toward their destiny.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[GAME Denies Report It’ll Stop Selling Games and Hardware]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/game-uk-stop-selling-physical/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/game-denies-report-it%E2%80%99ll-stop-selling-games-and-hardware.909651/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/game-uk-stop-selling-physical/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Recently, a report surfaced claiming that GAME will cease selling physical games and hardware in the ‘stores’ it operates across the United Kingdom. For a while, GAME has been seemingly ramping down operations by issuing redundancies and zero-hour contracts, shutting down stores, and pulling back to ‘concessions’ inside Sports Direct and House of Fraser units across the nation.</p>



<p>However, following the emergence of the report, GAME’s representatives quickly rushed to set the story straight, stating that the claim is ‘categorically untrue’ and that the firm will ‘continue to support the physical gaming market’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-long-way-down">Long Way Down</h2>



<p>GAME was a shining gem of the British town centre, with everyone using the label as the go-to spot for consoles, video games, peripherals, and even advice on the latest games. Now, it’s a shadow of its former self, resigned to selling mostly toys and gadgets to an ever-shrinking customer base. Most recently, the firm stopped buying and selling used games and hardware, which for several years had been a staple of the business.</p>



<p>Then, in another downturn, it was announced that GAME was ceasing operations of its reward card-based system, which had been running for almost two decades. Along with that came the shutdown of GAME Elite, the ‘boosted’ reward card experience that offered customers several key benefits.</p>



<p>The latest claim to surface was that GAME was preparing to stop selling boxed games and brand-new hardware in-store, but this report was deleted by the company almost as soon as it appeared. It doesn’t seem like that’s too far away from becoming the reality, though.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1805230089728069783" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on X, frequent leaker @SamLeakss and @ImPeQu both showcased a UI overhaul and modes potentially coming to Rocket Racing.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://x.com/ImPeQu/status/1804416745890828711" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original leak</a> from @ImPeQu includes an image of the new UI. It teases that “Inferno Island” may be the title for Season 2. </p>



<p>@SamLeakss reposted the accompanying image of Rocket Racing’s updated UI. This features a tidy menu and some modes that could arrive in Rocket Racing soon. </p>



<p>The leak shows off a Casual playlist, a Featured Track option, as well as a training mode. Further, @SamLeakss points out that Lockjaw appears in the image, implying it may be “coming as a customizable car in the future.”</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Upcoming Rocket Racing UI Overhaul for Season 2: "Inferno Island" 🔥</p><p>This confirms:<br>– Lockjaw is coming as a customizable car in the future.

</div></figure>



<p>Rocket Racing most recently added a Neon Rush update in April 2024. It got a boost from creator-made tracks built with UEFN, and a variety of fixes. The devs <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/rocket-racing-neon-rush-light-up-the-night" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also stated</a> that “we decided not to approach major updates as typical Seasons.”</p>



<p>@SamLeakss frequently posts about Fortnite-related content. That includes claims about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-rocket-league-getting-new-mandalorian-crossover-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Mandalorian crossover</a> with Fortnite last March.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/BeastFNCreative/status/1805175755917164876" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> today, leaker @BeastFNCreative also claimed that the new Rocket Racing season will be Inferno Island. @BeastFNCreative previously posted about UEFN getting the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-rocket-racing-editor-details-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rocket Racing editor</a>.</p>



<p>At this time, Epic Games has not confirmed any of the above claims about Inferno Island or Rocket Racing’s UI overhaul. The final UI and modes are possibly still subject to change.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/24/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-review.909630/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/24/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>It’s best not to think about the animal welfare questions that series like Super Monkey Ball and Pokémon raise. Do these animals like being in their balls? Have they chosen to be in balls? How do they eat and…. well, you know, in the balls? OK, that last one is a wild musing of my addled mind,&nbsp;but ever since the GameCube original, Super Monkey Ball has been putting simians in spheres and people have been loving it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble - Adventure Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DDRM6ftrro8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble starts, as many of these games have before, with letting you choose which ape to trap in an oversized hamster ball, before setting forth across a series of nefarious courses designed to send your furry friend hurtling to their doom. Fortunately, any missteps here only result in a return to the start, rather than a visit from animal protection.</p>


<p>Banana Rumble is just as joyously happy as its forebears, and the core formula remains as tricky and teeth-gnashingly frustrating as ever, while retaining that essential ‘one-more-go’ flavour to keep you coming back. This time you’re off to Juicy Island in search of the Legendary Banana. Now, this isn’t an island populated by ladies’ leggings, and there’s a smattering of Chaos Emerald about the Legendary Banana, but you can probably forget all about this narrative as you’ll be too busy trying not to fall off things.</p>


<p>The cast here, led by the indomitable AiAi, are as adorable as ever, but there’s a batch of newcomers to keep an eye on, both in single and multiplayer modes. Alongside borrowing the Chaos Emeralds, Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble also steals Sonic’s Spin Dash, allowing your monkeys to hurtle across the screen even faster, more easily overcoming small walls and ramps. They’re definitely falling off the level even more too.</p>
<p>Adventure mode has a narrative woven into it, though the adorable cutscenes are strangely low resolution, and if you’re looking for meaningful simian drama you’re probably better off with Planet of the Apes. A young female monkey Palette is looking for her father, and the Gala Family appear – a group of treasure hunters who have some unkind, banana-related putdowns to hand out to our beloved apes – but it’s safe to say that their nefarious deeds don’t really make any difference to the banana-collecting, goal-reaching action. Still, it’s all very cute.</p>
<p>There’s a clear emphasis on enjoying Monkey Ball Banana Rush with your friends, and every mode here can be played online or locally. Four players can team up for the adventure, with optional collisions to add a little more chaos, while the multiplayer Battle modes can have up to sixteen players, with AI bots able to fill out the room if you’re playing with the local limit of four. If you’re playing online, there’s either open lobbies or a simple six-character password to connect to a friend’s custom lobby, and everything runs surprisingly seamlessly, even if the Nintendo Switch isn’t able to keep as smooth a frame rate as you’d like during this.</p>

<p>Battle mode sees Monkey Ball Banana Rush go all Fall Guys, and turns in a series of different events where you’re aiming to come first or be on the better team. There’s five game modes, made up of Race, Banana Hunt, Ba-BOOM!, Goal Rush and Robot Smash! and they’re all pretty much as chaotic as you’d expect, with sixteen monkeys flying around the screen and bashing into each other as they try to collect another banana. There’s a lot of fun to be had here, whether playing with friends or strangers on the internet, though whether there’s going to be enough long-term appeal to keep coming back is questionable.</p>
<p>There is also an in-game season pass, though you only earn points by battling random people. Working through it unlocks new cosmetics and characters to use in the different modes. It’s appealing enough to deck out your monkey in cool sneakers and a wicked pair of shades, but it doesn’t feel hugely essential, particularly when you mostly see them from behind and inside a ball. Still, it adds a new tone to proceedings, and Goal Rush, in particular, got under my skin, as you race down hill and try to capture each goal for your team, while also trying to earn extra points with bonus goals while stopping your opponents from doing the same.</p>

<p>Besides fun with friends, repeat play hinges on you wanting to come back to Adventure Mode to better your times, collect more bananas, or achieve the different challenges that you’ll find in each level. This would probably be more compelling if you were told what these missions were the first time that you arrived at each level, but they’re all centred around collecting the golden banana, or picking up a specific number of bananas, so you do have some idea of what you’re supposed to be doing. In some cases, these goals are really tight with their timings, and in turn you can push the difficulty level up for yourself as you become ever more skillful. Time Attack mode also benefits from having online leaderboards, so you can see what insane times other people have posted.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/war-thunder-devs-apologize-for-using-challenger-explosion-in-key-art.909627/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/war-thunder-challenger-explosion-art<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>War Thunder&nbsp;</em>developer Gaijin Entertainment has apologized after players spotted that the studio had used a shot of the explosion from the Challenger disaster in a piece of artwork for the free-to-play military combat sim.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/1dm7e77/what_did_gaijin_mean_by_this/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">abacs21 noticed</a> that an explosion in artwork for the game's new "Seek &amp; Destroy" expansion looked markedly similar to a shot of the Challenger spacecraft exploding.</p>
<p>Following that, Reddit user HarryTheOwlcat <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/1dm9oao/challenger_disaster_and_seek_destroy_wallpaper/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posted a shot</a> of the Challenger explosion superimposed over the&nbsp;<em>War Thunder&nbsp;</em>artwork in question, and it's pretty difficult to deny the obvious similarities between the two.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/war-thunder-challenger-disaster-key-art.jpg?itok=OCyd-4EW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/war-thunder-challenger-disaster-key-art.jpg?itok=seG41pKs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The explosion in the bottom-left corner of this image was taken from a photo of the Challenger disaster.</figcaption></figure><p>In <a href="https://forum.warthunder.com/t/noticed-a-little-something/119652/22" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a thread</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>War Thunder&nbsp;</em>forums, community manager magazine2 <a href="https://forum.warthunder.com/t/noticed-a-little-something/119652/26" rel="noopener" target="_blank">admits</a> that the Challenger disaster explosion was indeed used in Seek &amp; Destroy artwork.</p>
<p>They say the shot was used "accidentally", and that it was "part of an aerial explosion reference pack" used by Gaijin's artists. As such, the "context" of the explosion being from the Challenger disaster "was lost".</p>
<p>The community manager goes on to say that the team will alter the artwork "as soon as we can" and will take measures to ensure that something like this doesn't happen again in future.</p>
<p>If you're not from the US, the historical significance of the Challenger disaster, in which seven crew members died when the Challenger shuttle exploded just 73 seconds after its liftoff, may not be as apparent to you as it would to a US citizen.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, though, that this event is still reverberating throughout the US space industry, and <a href="https://www.space.com/18084-space-shuttle-challenger.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">specifically throughout NASA</a>. It led to the shelving of civilian spaceflight plans for over two decades and also changed other key parts of NASA policy.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/war-thunder-challenger-disaster-key-art-plane.jpg?itok=PYEz_-Wt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/war-thunder-challenger-disaster-key-art-plane.jpg?itok=h76ycZlV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>War Thunder&nbsp;</em>developer Gaijin has apologized for using a photo from the Challenger disaster in its artwork.</figcaption></figure><p>Although Gaijin says its artists mistakenly used the shot as part of a "reference pack", it's not entirely clear what a shot of a spacecraft exploding is doing in a reference pack for a military game that focuses on air, land, and sea vehicles.</p>
<p>Still, this makes a nice break from the stuff Gaijin and&nbsp;<em>War Thunder&nbsp;</em>usually get in trouble for, which is to say the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/war-thunder-forums-allegedly-leak-classified-leclerc-tank-specs">leaking of confidential military secrets</a>. It happens <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/war-thunder-player-allegedly-shared-classified-tank-specs-on-forums">far more frequently than you might think</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">Open-world</a> zombie adventure <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> might not technically feature any zombies, but at least the discourse around a potential sequel is constantly reanimating. Via <a href="https://x.com/John_Garvin/status/1805079089109467322">Xitter</a>, the original game’s creative director John Garvin has encouraged fans to "never say never" about a Days Gone 2, while reminding us that a full outline for the game had <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/04/12/days-gone-2-details-revealed-by-games-director-including-a-shared-universe-with-co-op">already been completed</a> prior to his departure from developers Bend Studio in 2020.</p>
<p>Even with the caveat of "I’m not holding my breath", Garvin’s take is an altogether more hopeful one that that of fellow Bend alumni and Days Gone game director Jeff Ross, who in May <a href="https://x.com/JakeRocket/status/1796288252200235100">tweeXed</a> a collage of popular PlayStation characters – sans his own post-apocalyptic motorcycling hero, Deacon St. John. "A lot of people still ask me if there will ever be a Days Gone sequel, so I submit this poster as evidence it will never happen", Ross wrote, along with an apparent pop at Sony Interactive execs (including Hermen Hulst, co-CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment) for never being "fans" of the game.</p>

<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">A lot of people still ask me if there will ever be a Days Gone sequel, so I submit this poster as evidence it will never happen. Sony higher ups like Hermen were never fans, so you won't hear about it at the PlayStation State of Play today or ever. <a href="https://t.co/9G8lPgJgVW">pic.twitter.com/9G8lPgJgVW</a></p>— Jeff Ross (@JakeRocket) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeRocket/status/1796288252200235100?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2024</a></blockquote></div> <p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>Just to be clear that this isn’t a 'My dads are fighting' situation, Garvin’s tweet was not in direct response to Ross’s, and even suggested that Sony re-hire the two to work on the elusive sequel. Whether Bend would be up for that is a different matter: besides <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/days-gone-devs-are-getting-back-in-the-saddle-and-hiring-someone-with-live-service-experience">a recent job posting</a> suggesting the studio are busy trying their hands at a new live-service game, Bend have previously <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/days-gone-studio-do-not-share-former-directors-views-on-its-critical-reception">distanced themselves</a> from their former creative director after he posted a (long since deleted) tweet blaming "woke reviewers" in part for Days Gone’s lukewarm reception. I’ve never played it myself, either on console or when it came to PC in 2021, though I’ve wokishly shaken my Magic Woke Ball and it said "sequel unlikely". I’d therefore probably go with Ross as having the more realistic outlook.</p>
<p>That said, the image that Ross interpreted as a damning snub on Sony’s part is not an official promo but a <a href="https://twitter.com/Traveler_BP/status/1795173576250687805">piece of fanart</a>, seemingly made by unaffiliated PlayStation enjoyer @Traveler_BP. They’ve even made an <a href="https://twitter.com/Traveler_BP/status/1722711519060729922/photo/2">older version</a> featuring ya boi Deacon, though this should not necessarily be considered confirmation that Sony actually love Days Gone and will be greenlighting two new games and a remake any time now. I think there’s still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/theres-a-days-gone-movie-adaptation-in-development">a film coming</a>, though?</p>

            <p>A former developer at Total War studio Creative Assembly has written <a href="https://medium.com/@julianmckinlay/total-war-rome-ii-and-creative-assembly-my-statement-ten-years-on-d964f65b0a8f">a lengthy personal account</a> of his time at the studio, in which he details development troubles on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-rome-ii">Total War: Rome 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-attila">Total War: Attila</a>, and alleges that these issues were exacerbated by an inflexible and counterproductive leadership structure and “chronic mismanagement,” sometimes resulting in what he calls a “toxic work environment.”</p>

<p>Julian McKinlay, who between 2009 and 2014 worked on Total War games ranging from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/napoleon-total-war">Napoleon</a> to Attila, also detailed his experience being blamed by a section of the community for Rome 2’s bug-ridden launch after appearing in a promotional video. McKinlay was blamed for misrepensenting information about the game. He makes clear he wasn't coerced into giving the interview, but answered questions based on what he understood about the then current state of Rome 2.</p>
<p>McKinlay also goes into detail on the issues he faced as a programmer, largely centred around AI, and claims that upper management either misunderstood or routinely ignored issues raised by programmers. He also alleges that leadership put the addition of marketable new features - and marketing itself - at a higher priority than giving the programmers the support and resources they needed.</p>
<p>He also alleges that the design and programming teams were at odds as regards certain features, and that upper management frequently sided with designers. “The way it looked from my point of view was that production leadership let designers do whatever they wanted, and it’s one of the main reasons that Rome II went so badly wrong,” writes McKinlay. “Designers instructed us not to improve [the AI] in certain ways, because they believed that players enjoyed being able to dominate the AI and that we shouldn’t deprive them of that.”</p>

<p>“The Total War team was very hierarchical for its size,” McKinlay writes, “and key design and management decisions were made by a small handful of individuals at the top without any real oversight from the wider development team.” Total War’s “leaders”, writes McKinlay, “seemed to resent critical feedback and treated it as unwelcome. It was common for important decisions to be already treated as final by the time they were communicated to those of us in the trenches, if they were communicated to us at all.”</p>
<p>In terms of the aforementioned Rally Point video, McKinlay was subject to ridicule and harassment after it aired. He says this culminated in death threats, although he adds that he felt he “did not have actual reason to fear for my safety.” While he says that he doesn’t believe Creative Assembly intentionally stoked these fires, he believes that “this narrative was actually quite convenient for Creative Assembly, and I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that I became a scapegoat for the project’s failures.”</p>
<p>McKinlay eventually left the studio during the development of Attila, after friction with the design team over feedback resulted in him being “chewed out by management”, which he alleges was “clearly intended to silence [him] for the convenience of management figures who wanted to continue doing things their way no matter the consequences to anybody else”. McKinlay left soon after, feeling that he had “made enemies in the team’s leadership and that it would probably affect my chances of promotions and things like that down the line.” In McKinlay's view, he parted after "it became clear that leadership was going to keep repeating the same mistakes."</p>
<p>Towards the end of the piece, which is far more detailed and gets much further into the weeds of actual game design than is practical to summarise here, McKinlay poses the following question:</p>
<blockquote>One question to ask is, how well do these experiences represent the Creative Assembly of today? Given the recent problems faced by the studio it seems clear that studio management and creative leadership continue to be a source of major problems, but I should be clear that it’s not for me to say how similar the details of recent problems are to those that I experienced. One thing I will say is that several of the individuals responsible for the problems I’ve described in this statement either still work at the company, or did until recent layoffs, which I think says something about ongoing problems with the studio’s management culture.</blockquote>
<p>“Despite ongoing problems with the games and a number of high profile embarrassments, the series continued to be profitable,” he concludes. “This fact was used against developers like me who argued for better practices, and was often used by creative leadership as a metric to confirm the success of prior projects and decisions regardless of other ways that they might have failed.”</p>
<p>It's worth reiterating that this is one developers's perspective on an entire studio, and one that hasn’t worked there for ten years, even if the recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cancelled-shooter-hyenas-was-reportedly-segas-most-expensive-game-ever">Hyenas saga</a> could suggest that some of the issues McKinlay raises are still ongoing. McKinlay is also not entirely negative about his time there, mentioning friends at the studio still.</p>
<p>One other former employee at CA has boosted McKinlay’s account. Will Overgard, CA’s community coordinator from 2012 to 2015, has <a href="https://x.com/Will_Overgard/status/1804243223399010631">shared the post on Xitter</a>. “I still feel guilty for what happened to Julian, so give his statement a read for me,” writes Overgard. “I’m incredibly proud of what I contributed to CA…but I had a hand in destroying someone's career and that awful feeling never went away.”</p>
<p>We’ve reached out to Creative Assembly for comment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dustborn-hands-on-preview-wordy-road-trip/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ragnar Tørnquist may not be among the most well-known game designers nowadays, but his contributions to the adventure genre cannot be overstated, as his works with games such as The Longest Journey helped the genre move forward when the point-and-click formula started dying out. After founding Red Thread Games in 2012 and releasing multiple entries in the Dreamfall Chapters, the Norwegian game designer is about to release, together with his development team Dustborn, an adventure game that tries to do things differently to present a better, rounded-up and more compelling experience.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240614130652_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>In Dustborn, players control Pax, an Anomal con-artist who has the power to weaponize language. Looking to create a new life in an alternate history America, she was hired to transport an important package to Nova Scotia, which she will have to keep safe with the help of a crew comprising a rather colorful crew with unique abilities. Despite the preview version I had the chance to try out was set a few hours into the adventure, my playtime with it made it clear how character development and interactions will be among the game's most developed features. Controlling Pax, players will have a lot of chances to interact with the other characters, develop relationships with them, and come to understand them better. These relationships are developed with a straightforward branching dialogue system that is pretty similar to similar systems seen in other adventure games.</p>
<p>When not interacting with other characters, players will explore a variety of closed-off, linear locations in Dustborn, controlling Pax from a third-person camera view as she searches for clues and objects to help her solve whatever conundrum she and her crew encounter. Much like in dialogues, players can make different choices that will shape the outcome of select scenarios, opting, for example, to ask for the help of a certain character instead of another. In the preview scenario, set in a service station in the middle of a desert, Pax can ask either Theo or Sai, a girl afflicted with vitiligo, to open a door by lock-picking it or using brute force, respectively. These types of interactions were everywhere in the preview version, and they helped immensely in getting to know and care for the crew, although writing did not feel particularly inspired. It does its job reasonably well, no doubt about it, but it's not really a standout feature.</p>
<p>Where Dustborn seems like it will deliver is the adventuring gameplay. The game makes it really easy to discover new elements needed to proceed through the story, and while most of the interactions are not particularly innovative, they are varied enough, and some are objectively cool, like the one where Pax has to guide Sai with her voice to help her drop a massive tire in a specific location to burn it down. Later on, to make other examples, Pax will have to distract a service robot to steal a bottle of whiskey to create a Molotov cocktail and throw a few of them in a more action-oriented sequence at a gang of bikers. All this, coupled with the dominant comic book aesthetics, which can be appreciated even more by the ability to control the camera at pretty much every time and alternate 90s setting, gives Dustborn a peculiar feel.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240614134730_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Sadly, it's in the more action-oriented sequences that Dustborn falters. Fighting enemies in the game is, simply put, not that fun. Moving and attacking feel terribly unresponsive, the animations are stiff, and the mechanics rather basic, as Pax can essentially only unleash simple short-range and long-range attacks, which don't feel impactful at all. The special power that allows Pax to weaponize words essentially gives her a chance to push enemies away, force some of them to attack their companions and force other conditions which did not feel particularly inspired in the preview version. Combination attacks performed by multiple characters are also in, and they look nice enough, although I never felt the need while fighting enemies to do anything more than swing Pax's unique bat around and dodge the occasional attack.</p>
<p>Having had the chance to experience less than two hours of the game, I cannot say if Dustborn's best features will be enough to make up for its weaknesses. While the setting, story, characters, and varied gameplay sequences have potential, and the adventure game mechanics feel solid enough despite not being particularly inspired, the action-oriented sequences and the combat system felt clunky and not particularly fun to play. With more surprises waiting for Pax and her crew on the road, however, Dustborn may prove to be a much better game than what it felt like in my limited time with it when it launches on August 20th on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/valorant-console-preview-one-tap-b-plant-no-cap<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the wake of eSports becoming a growing mine of financial prosperity and career opportunities, it makes sense that console players tend to be on the outside looking in. A keyboard being the optimal solution, its use in a console player base for games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege"><em>Rainbow Six: Siege</em></a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/call-of-duty-warzone"><em>Call of Duty</em></a> is met with derision, and some would say rightfully so. Regardless, Riot Games has decided to give console players some fun, with their Xbox and PlayStation-dedicated version of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/valorant"><em>VALORANT</em></a> recently released in beta.</p>
<p>This is the breakout FPS from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/league-of-legends"><em>League of Legends</em></a> developers Riot Games, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/counter-strike-global-offensive"><em>Counter Strike</em></a>-like which became a smash hit in 2020, during the COVID-19 lockdown. <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-summer-game-fest-2024-announcement">Announced during Summer Games Fest</a> that Riot would be bringing the PC shooter to consoles this year, the month-long beta kicked off shortly after the announcement. With a few of the game's standout maps available in rotation for matchmaking right now, Riot has made sure to plant its feet in the sand in regards to what this console version offers.</p>
<p>There may be a pretense of confusion when it comes to what <em>VALORANT </em>on console is, especially in comparison to the PC counterpart. As someone who has put an almost unhealthy (and almost completely unnecessary) amount of time into the Xbox 360 version of<em> Counter Strike: Global Operative</em>, one could see a necessity to give console players some of their own catered fun. Already, it seems like Riot feels the same way.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valorant-players-are-already-getting-banned-for-using-mouse-and-keyboard-on-console/1100-6524323/">banning users who use a keyboard and mouse in console lobbies</a>, to providing a keybind to allow players to walk without making noise, <em>VALORANT </em>is providing controller players with as much accommodation in their space, which is great! There’s obviously still a massive discrepancy in skill ceiling between console and PC, but then, that’s not the point, is it? It’s neither a humbling, nor a one-up, they co-exist, and for that, I’m personally grateful for the work put in.</p>
<p>It also helps that the pacing is breakneck, with <em>VALORANT</em>’s “Swiftplay” having matches take less than 20 minutes at a time, even when rounds are stretched out to their maximum. While a full-on Competitive mode with ELO rankings hasn’t been introduced in the beta yet, there’s a taste in the “Unrated” mode, which gives you a feel for the 24-round based mode, and what it offers, which is longer matches, and more focused play.</p>
<p>Still, none of this was really prevalent when playing on my own. At first, I didn’t have a squad to team up with, and <em>VALORANT</em>’s infamously toxic community didn’t really inspire me to ask around for new buddies, regardless of how new everyone was to this specific experience. I stuck it by myself for a while and found myself contending with how much dead air can linger in the moment-to-moment.</p>

<p>It’s a <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> </em>thing. When there’s complete silence, it’s meant to be offset by callouts, team talk, strategic divulgence, maybe even banter, and when you’re solo, <em>VALORANT </em>isn’t communicative like <em>Counter Strike</em> - hell, even <em>Siege</em>. I understand this may be more of a personal qualm than most of the other issues present, but it should be stated how much of a vacuum is present in a singular space.</p>
<p>All of this is to say it’s immediately remediated when you have at least one more friend playing alongside you. Suddenly the energy is frantic, alive, decisions weighted further amongst thought and actual presence. When you or they pop off in a match, it’s not to the sounds of silence, or maybe even nodding approval, but the squad in awe of your work, and it’s nice.</p>
<p>Honestly, there’s not much else to say in regards to <em>VALORANT</em>’s qualities. Its presence in the FPS market has been felt for a while now, its hero-based mechanics and tactical opportunities are always ever-present, synchronicity readily apparent in nearly every hero pair-up - even if too many rely on what are essentially just different colors of smoke grenades - and the weapon balancing is really good.</p>

<p>The controls are as good as they can be for an ultimately PC-ortiented experience. With a keybind to walk without making sound or wrangling with dead zones and thresholds for the controller's joysticks, it means everyone has a presence for the tactical FPS genre's most basic tactic, which is sound play. Sensitivity and its other parameters come down to personal preference, and the game's movement mechanics feel fresh and incredibly accessible to anyone playing.</p>
<p>The main issue of <em>VALORANT </em>on console right now is the UI, which is subject to sluggish and intrusive issues at the time of writing. At the start of every round, there’s a combat report that shows damage given and taken during the prior round, and it takes up a fair amount of the screen, with no way to remove it until the round begins. It’s not so much of a deal breaker, but I found optimal gadget placement a pain in the ass sometimes, trying to line things up when there’s an opaque slab on the right of the screen.</p>
<p>Still, that isn’t enough to put even a Gekko-sized blot on how well-optimized <em>VALORANT </em>on consoles appears to be. Catered to the crowd, and clearly focused on removing a damaging ego when comparing the two platforms, these are the same game yet entirely removed from each other, which is an achievement. When <em>Counter Strike: Global Operative</em> released on Xbox 360, there was a small hope to have them co-exist and progress together.</p>
<p>A noble cause, but one ultimately driven to fail when you’re emulating THE PC game.</p>

<h2><em>VALORANT </em>Console Preview | Final Verdict</h2>
<p>As it stands, <em>VALORANT</em>’s console offering is shaping up to be a refined experience for those who simply want to pick up the controller and have fun. It’s an ultimately more casual dilution of its eSports-toting, toxic-breeding, rage-inducing PC counterparts, but in this space, something else can grow.</p>
<p>Whether or not Riot can lay claim to what prospers is another thing entirely.</p>
<hr><p><em><strong>VALORANT </strong>was previewed on Xbox Series S using a copy provided by the publisher over the course of 30 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/riven-review-islands-of-adventure</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/riven-review-islands-of-adventure.909612/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/riven-review-islands-of-adventure<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the success of 2020’s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/realmyst-masterpiece-edition-pc-review"><em>Myst</em></a> remake, it was only a matter of time before its sequel, <em>Riven</em>, saw a similar treatment. Thus, we have four years later, the newly updated version of <em>Riven</em> that promises to be more than just a flashy graphics upgrade.</p>
<p>As I outlined in my original <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/riven-preview-everything-old-is-new-again">preview for <em>Riven</em></a>, there have been some subtle changes here and there – although from my personal perspective as someone who never played the original, I would be going in fresh regardless. That said, for those well-versed in the series, it’s something to keep in mind going in.</p>
<p>The way <em>Riven</em> begins is loaded with a mystery of sorts. You’re immediately faced with a man named Atrus, who gives you some sort of important book. After that you’re whisked away, stuffed in a jail, have had your book stolen by an indecipherable stranger, before being let loose on the rockery of some island.</p>
<p>From there the story becomes embedded in the environment around you, and it’s from the beginning and through exploration and puzzle solving that the main goal becomes clear: free Atrus’ wife Catherine, and capture Gehn, the one who imprisoned her.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riven_01.jpg?itok=2mcS4cxr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riven_01.jpg?itok=TXldY-27 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The premise is simple enough, and a lot of the surrounding flavor text is uncovered in things like your journal, as well as the observation of each unique environment.</p>
<p><em>Riven</em> takes place on a series of islands, the Age of Riven, that you’ll need to traverse in order to get to the final conclusion. Each one is fairly unique in that you’re never really encountering the same place twice. From the gold dome topped island you wake up on, to a jungle island, and even a prison, the variety of location is a place <em>Riven</em> excels at.</p>
<p>I found a good chunk of my play time was spent just admiring each environment. Because that’s what you do in <em>Riven</em>, you’re encouraged to explore everything to avoid missing out on some important detail you might need later on in your explorations.</p>
<p>The 3D, fully rendered environments are lovingly detailed, from cliffsides, sand, rocks, metal material, foliage, and water, it’s clear there was a lot of love in the transition to a modern version of <em>Riven</em>.</p>
<p>Along each island, you’ll come in contact with puzzles of different varieties. There’s going to be trial and error to get through doors, across bridges, and solving smaller puzzles using symbols found in places like a village.</p>

There’s even a few options to take in-game screenshots that go to your journal, as well as a one-button easy-access satchel to store inventory.</p>
<p>It’s all very detail-oriented, and there are even some aspects that don’t always lead to anything meaningful and that’s okay. One thing in particular that I found enjoyable was being able to move to the next island without completing everything as I went.</p>
<p>That element of freedom gives<em> Riven </em>a zen-like feeling. When you’re not looking around for artifacts and puzzles related to them, the lack of urgency in the game world creates a quiet beauty and plenty of immersion, even if there are a few people hidden around.</p>
<p>The puzzles themselves do offer a lot of critical thinking, and there were a lot of times when I was playing through <em>Riven</em> that I felt like I was second-guessing myself. Being able to roam around back and forth is certainly helpful, and ultimately, I felt that some of the trickier puzzles did instill a sense of accomplishment.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riven-03.jpg?itok=3gkBPCa7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riven-03.jpg?itok=jYYYWJKo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There’s not really any set difficulty level in <em>Riven</em> – it’s as hard as you make it on yourself really – but paying attention is a big part of it. The majority of these puzzles stem from smaller ones that must be solved first, along with gathering clues from out in the world. That said, it can get frustrating when some of them feel like there are not enough hints on what to do, and the lack of direction doesn't always make sense leading to a lot of aimless wandering back and forth.</p>
<p>As I said, I never played the original <em>Riven</em>, or <em>Myst</em> for that matter, so despite all that, I did find it interesting trying to wrap my head around all the little lore pieces scattered around to discover.</p>
<p>A lot of it is visual, like little windows you peek through to see some historical depictions and other times, there are books you can read with more direct information.</p>
<p>The element of choice also comes to <em>Riven</em> in a big way. Certain choices, without going into direct spoilers, can produce different outcomes. So much so that <em>Riven</em> does in fact have bad endings you can end up in if you make what might be considered to be the wrong decision.</p>
<p><em>Riven</em>’s status as a remake lends itself to its solid performance. Cyan’s choice to develop on Unreal Engine 5 is here in full force with smooth performance without sacrificing visual fidelity – not that there’s a ton going on to really push the game, but it’s a solid experience regardless.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riven-04.jpg?itok=SeVOxBRV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riven-04.jpg?itok=Kp4SrQ02 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Riven</em>'s music is pleasant enough, and I was glad to see some voice acting for the minimal character interaction that does exist. The characters, such as Gehn and finding out his story was one of the major draws for me during my playthrough.</p>
<p>Overall, this new version of <em>Riven</em> is plenty appealing, even if you’re just looking for a low-stakes puzzle game to chip away at. The point-and-click gameplay, along with the lack of any real information dumps or dialogue makes it approachable in a way that was unexpected to me.</p>
<p>While some of the puzzles are challenging and not always clear, I think the overall presentation, and being to explore the detailed environments without any real learning curve, shows that <em>Riven</em> can be enjoyed by anyone, even if they haven’t played the original version or even the previous game <em>Myst</em>.</p>
<p>Having dipped my toes into the world of <em>Riven</em>, I now want to go back and experience the beginnings for myself. Then after that, maybe revisit <em>Riven</em> for a different perspective. Riven feels like a game with a good amount of replay value, and I’m plenty keen to put that to the test.</p>

Sometimes I play to jumpstart my brain in the morning, sometimes to unwind during my lunch break, sometimes to fill some time in the evening. Usually, I choose the fifty-stage-long Expert difficulty, and see how far I can make it without using a continue.

The game feels perfect, looks perfect, and is astonishingly easy to pick up and play: spend five seconds with it and you’ll understand quite literally everything about its design. You’re a guy in a ball; there’s a goal at the end of a floating obstacle course; a timer is ticking down. Use the control stick to move. That’s <em>it</em>. Every pixel of what’s onscreen, from the level geometry to the character animations to the HUD, is designed with an elegant, utilitarian exactitude, relaying a constant stream of complex information to players while keeping their focus squarely on the center of the frame.</p><p>This is crucial, because <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> demands undivided, unbending attention. It is a <em>molecular </em>video game. The movement—which occupies more or less the entirety of the game’s mechanical space—is so precise that an errant two-millimeter nudge of the control stick can instantly change (or ruin) your approach to any given obstacle. In my twenty years with <em>Super Monkey Ball</em>, no run has felt remotely similar. Stages I’ve navigated hundreds of times constantly present new, unexpected, exciting challenges. In any other game, this would be impressive. In a game with exactly one verb, it’s a marvel.</p><figure id="" data-id="329e907f1af70622c29fd89ed6cb33b7" data-recommend-id="image://329e907f1af70622c29fd89ed6cb33b7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A sky view of a cog-themed level." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A sky view of a cog-themed level." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="329e907f1af70622c29fd89ed6cb33b7" data-recommend-id="image://329e907f1af70622c29fd89ed6cb33b7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A sky view of a cog-themed level." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s also a hard act to follow. Not long after the 2002 release of <em>Super Monkey Ball 2</em>—a great game, though hurt somewhat by its occasional prioritization of mazes and puzzles over brass-tacks platforming—the wheels began falling off. Save for a couple small blips on the radar (here’s to you, 2006’s <em>Super Monkey Ball: Banana Splitz</em>), the series has spent the majority of its lifespan in a steady state of decline, each entry drifting further away from the rigor and creativity of the GameCube duology. I was almost ready to leave it for dead after 2021’s <em>Super Monkey Ball</em>: <em>Banana Mania</em>, a remake of the first two games that tampered with their physics, flattened their structure, removed multiplayer modes, and introduced a slew of control and camera issues.</p><p>Now, practically out of nowhere, into our laps falls <em>Banana Rumble</em>, the first non-remake series entry<em>&nbsp;</em>since 2012. I booted up my review copy with tempered expectations. I’d been burned many times before. Recently, even. Imagine my relief when it wound up being the best <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> game in over twenty years.</p><h2 id="h36342"><a id=""></a><strong>The Meat</strong></h2><p>In almost every way that matters, <em>Banana Rumble</em> goes back to the drawing board. No more jumping, no more minigame bloat, no more micromanaging the camera. Motion controls are available, but they’re off by default, their toggle squirreled away in a labyrinthine options menu.</p><p>The mere presence of a labyrinthine options menu should be encouraging to anyone who was frustrated by <em>Banana Mania</em>’s sparse customizability. Rest easy, veteran ballers: <em>Banana Rumble</em> allows for adjustments to, among other things, input display, automatic camera speed, manual camera speed, stick dead zones for both character and camera control, stage tilt severity, and stage tilt speed. (I tested those latter two, and they don’t seem to have any bearing on physics.) If you’re hankering for a more traditional setup, do what I did and disable the manual camera entirely while cranking automatic tracking up to the max. Congratulations, you’re playing <em>Monkey Ball </em>just like mama used to make.</p><figure id="" data-id="e9fd6669ecedde2052be5b0b8c00f8bd" data-recommend-id="image://e9fd6669ecedde2052be5b0b8c00f8bd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lots of monkeys in balls, undermining the tone of this review entirely." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lots of monkeys in balls, undermining the tone of this review entirely." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e9fd6669ecedde2052be5b0b8c00f8bd" data-recommend-id="image://e9fd6669ecedde2052be5b0b8c00f8bd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lots of monkeys in balls, undermining the tone of this review entirely." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Even out of the box, a good chunk of this game is mama’s <em>Monkey Ball</em>, albeit with some significant adjustments to the formula—mostly for better, occasionally for worse. The creamy nougat center is Adventure Mode: 200 miniature platforming gauntlets, none longer than sixty seconds. These are evenly split into twenty worlds, the first ten of which comprise the story, the remaining ten of which are for “the real heads.” (As is series tradition, the story here is hopelessly dumb and I spent the entire game wishing it would go away. We’re back, baby!)</p><p><em>Super Monkey Ball</em> lives and dies by the strength of its level design. At its very best, each individual stage pushes you toward some new, minute understanding of the game’s physics, brutally ramping up difficulty in tandem. At its worst, you get something like <em>Super Monkey Ball 3D</em>, where every course is a flat, dinky, Denny’s kids’ menu maze that doesn’t teach you anything about anything, let alone itself. <em>Banana Rumble</em>, thankfully, falls into the former camp the vast majority of the time. A handful of stages are designed as brainteasers first and raw execution checks second, but even then, there’s an almost total lack of homogeneity. Levels feel distinct and, for the first time in I can’t remember how long, genuinely difficult. <em>Banana Rumble</em> actually<em> cares </em>about how you play it; it wants you to fastidiously consider every curve, edge, and gap in its geometry.</p><p>There’s one key addition to the game’s movement that fundamentally alters this relationship: the spin dash, a clear nod to Sonic the Hedgehog’s iconic maneuver of the same name. In <em>Sonic</em>, spin dashes let players effectively build momentum from a total standstill, the speed of their snap forward dependant on how many times a button is pressed in rapid succession. Prior to <em>Banana Rumble</em>’s release, I assumed its spin dash would function identically, and was worried. Much of <em>Super Monkey Ball</em>’s tension arises from the various ways it asks players to negotiate slopes, and the ability to quickly reverse course with a burst movement option would, if not negate that tension, diminish it considerably.</p><figure id="" data-id="a8f94c039aae6d57f823d40fba716c6e" data-recommend-id="image://a8f94c039aae6d57f823d40fba716c6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Monkeys in balls flying through a circle with numbers appearing all over." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Monkeys in balls flying through a circle with numbers appearing all over." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a8f94c039aae6d57f823d40fba716c6e" data-recommend-id="image://a8f94c039aae6d57f823d40fba716c6e" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Monkeys in balls flying through a circle with numbers appearing all over." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Luckily, the good folks at Sega were two steps ahead of me. The spin dash in <em>Banana Rumble</em> is a momentum extender, not a momentum generator. Try using it while stopped and it won’t send you anywhere. You need to be moving, and once you’ve built a bit of speed, you can use the spin dash to move way farther. A beautiful little nesting doll of commitments.</p><p>I’m still not sure this series really needs anything more than its fundamental control scheme. The purist in me wants to deride the spin dash, regardless of its implementation—why complicate something so pristine? But maybe I’m approaching this the wrong way. Maybe it isn’t a question of what <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> needs, but of what <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> wants. <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> needs a ball, a level and a timer like we need food, water and shelter. But what it <em>wants</em> is <em>momentum</em>. It wants you to delicately chain multiple precise inputs into seamless, buttery propulsion, and it wants you to invest in that propulsion. No time to renege; roll (yup) with it and see what happens. The spin dash aligns with this ethos perfectly. If this were the first <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> game, I’d probably want it to show up in all the future ones, too.</p><p>And it’s not like <em>Banana Rumble</em> doesn’t make good on the spin dash’s promise. Many levels are explicitly designed around it, and many more are subtly designed around it. Once I began using the dash more liberally, slingshotting simians through the air just to see where they’d end up, the game revealed its hand. There are shortcuts tucked into every nook and cranny of <em>Banana Rumble</em> if you know where to look. Working out alternate solutions to courses has always been one of the most rewarding challenges of <em>Super Monkey Ball</em>, and here we have a game built for it from the ground up. At times, these shortcuts can feel cheap, but for every level trivialized by the spin dash there are ten more that demand stringent, high-stakes applications of it.</p><figure id="" data-id="a05d1432ca348d8e2cec7f36f52c8af9" data-recommend-id="image://a05d1432ca348d8e2cec7f36f52c8af9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Four-player screenscreen Monkeyballing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Four-player screenscreen Monkeyballing." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a05d1432ca348d8e2cec7f36f52c8af9" data-recommend-id="image://a05d1432ca348d8e2cec7f36f52c8af9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Four-player screenscreen Monkeyballing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Rounding out <em>Banana Rumble</em>’s core modes are a number of multiplayer games, only a couple of which resemble past series staples. Gone are the likes of Monkey Golf, Monkey Bowling, Monkey Billiards, and—sigh—Monkey Target. Monkey Race (rebranded here as just “Race”) returns, alongside a few others that all scan as attempts to court the <em>Fall Guys </em>platformer-as-battle-royale audience. None of them are especially captivating, though I guess they automatically outclass <em>Fall Guys</em> by virtue of not making you feel like you’re swimming laps through a tar pit. I respect that these minigames all preserve and iterate upon <em>Banana Rumble</em>’s core movement (including the spin dash) instead of adopting entirely new control schemes (the standard in past <em>Super Monkey Ball</em>s), but they all come out the other end feeling a bit samey. Race, the most barebones, is also the best, for precisely that reason.</p><p>The real jewel here is multiplayer Adventure Mode, making a triumphant return (with online functionality to boot) after a decades-long absence. This was always one of the better showcases for the series’ versatility: put multiple people in the same course side-by-side and their approaches to it will almost immediately diverge in a thousand tiny ways. Skill makes a difference, sure, but personal expression moreso. With enough players, it’s a conversation.</p><h2 id="h36343"><a id=""></a><strong>The Potatoes</strong></h2><p>The original <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> is an arcade game. This is true both literally (the game first released as a cabinet several months before it landed on the GameCube) and structurally. Its progression systems demand knowledge of how its levels work not only individually, but together: avoiding a game over on higher difficulties means devising meticulous strategies that maximize both efficiency and banana accumulation (100 bananas grant an extra life, and the game has, for my money, one of the greatest 1-up sound effects in the medium). For instance, certain levels can be skipped with warp goals, but doing so may put your banana counter at a deficit—something you’ll regret when you’re teetering on the precipice of a wire-thin path with ten seconds on the clock and zero lives to spare. These competing tensions cultivate a holistic understanding of the game. Conquering it means conquering all of it.</p><p>2024’s <em>Banana Rumble</em> is not an arcade game, because arcade games don’t really get made anymore, and as with every <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> that’s not an arcade game, it works overtime to reshape and justify its design outside of an arcade framework. There are no game overs, because there are no lives. There are no high scores, because stages are played in isolation instead of as a group (with the exception of time attack mode, which I love, but it doesn’t do much to make the stages feel like they’re actually operating in concert). But the game still has bananas, and it still keeps track of your best times.</p><figure id="" data-id="51169ce534ad74a1cfbc947eccb636b1" data-recommend-id="image://51169ce534ad74a1cfbc947eccb636b1" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Finally a proper screenshot showing our ball as it appears in-game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Finally a proper screenshot showing our ball as it appears in-game." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="51169ce534ad74a1cfbc947eccb636b1" data-recommend-id="image://51169ce534ad74a1cfbc947eccb636b1" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Finally a proper screenshot showing our ball as it appears in-game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It solves this in two ways, the first of which is pretty crafty. Each level now has three sub-challenges (which the game dubs “missions”): a par time, a par banana count, and a single “golden banana” placed in a particularly tricky location. Depending on which one you tackle, your approach to the level will fundamentally change, in ways that <em>almost</em> recall the sensation of routing classic <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> difficulties. It’s somewhat disappointing that the game needs to prescribe these challenges in lieu of letting them emerge organically; on the other hand, it also means that each level effectively has three smaller levels folded into it, and I was consistently surprised and impressed by how much they required me to alter my gameplan.</p><p>The second solution is a bit clunkier. Instead of a traditional scoring system,<em> Banana Rumble </em>awards points based on story and mission completion. These points are primarily used as currency in an in-game cosmetics shop, where you can play dress-up with your characters, purchase new frames for photo mode, and just generally accomplish fuck all. This is, bluntly, meaningless, and I can’t help but feel ambivalent about the fact that most of the game’s progression terminates here, in something almost completely dislodged from the skills and knowledge it asks you to build elsewhere. <em>Banana Rumble</em> dangles the carrot and then reveals that it’s actually cotton candy; the last thing a game this lean needs is empty calories.</p><figure id="" data-id="6618fc3c5a26852ba0d2efc9fbdd0a15" data-recommend-id="image://6618fc3c5a26852ba0d2efc9fbdd0a15" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The sadly inevitable clothing customization screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The sadly inevitable clothing customization screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6618fc3c5a26852ba0d2efc9fbdd0a15" data-recommend-id="image://6618fc3c5a26852ba0d2efc9fbdd0a15" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The sadly inevitable clothing customization screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We’ve established what <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> needs; we’ve established what <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> wants; now, finally, we arrive at the million dollar question. What do <em>I</em> want? On some level, I know I just want the first <em>Super Monkey Ball</em>. I want elegantly paced arcade modes and intrinsically meaningful scoring systems and an unvarnished, elemental control scheme. I <em>don’t</em> want partitioned stages or games-as-a-service-adjacent cosmetics shops or a dozen different characters with unique stat spreads.</p><p>But these are all trees; what about the forest? What precisely about <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> makes me return to it day after day, year after year? The answer is embarrassingly simple: it’s a fun video game. What I really want when I play <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> is to play a fun goddamn video game. And what better choice? <em>Super Monkey Ball</em> is the stripped down essence of fun video games. It lets you do one thing, and that thing is fun, to the greatest extent that any one thing in a video game could be.</p><p><em>Banana Rumble</em> is fun. I love playing it. I thought I was mostly <em>done</em> playing it until, about 300 words into this review, something unexpected happened: I got The Itch. I’d beaten all the levels, but I wanted to beat them again. I wanted to take a crack at the missions, which I’d largely dismissed as frivolous on my first run. I wanted to go for some records in time attack, especially pre-release, when the sparse competition would all but guarantee me a spot in the top 5. (As of right now, 6:03 a.m. on June 23rd, 2024, I have <em>Giant Bomb</em>’s Dan Ryckert beaten by two seconds on the world 1 leaderboards. Dan, if you’re reading this: your move.) The game <em>works</em>, in all the ways I expect it to. Maybe not in all the ways I want it to, but so what? <em>Banana Rumble</em> doesn’t need to be perfect. It just needs to be good. And for <em>Super Monkey Ball</em>, “perfect” and “good” are very nearly the same thing.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On January 28, 1986, one of the biggest disasters in NASA history occurred when the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded 73 seconds into its flight. All seven crew members on board were killed in the first fatal in-flight accident in US spacecraft history. Now, 38 years later, the Challenger tragedy has been used in promotional art for military combat game War Thunder.</p>



<p>It was <a href="https://forum.warthunder.com/t/noticed-a-little-something/119652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first spotted by players</a> who compared the explosion in the art to that of the Challenger. What stood out is the distinct look of the shape of the smoke and debris when it happened. It featured smoking debris falling from the sky along with an angled “cloud” that’s easily recognizable to those who’ve seen the footage or images. </p>



<p>Many assumed it was an AI-generated image that was used for the key art for the game. However, it appears that it was done manually.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Developer Gaijin Entertainment acknowledged that the explosion in the image was, in fact, that of the Challenger explosion. The game’s community manager magazine2 says it was part of a “aerial explosion reference pack”.</p>



<p>“Hey guys, we have accidentally used the explosion from the Challenger disaster in one of our key art images,” they said. “Please accept our sincere apologies for this, the picture was part of an aerial explosion reference pack used by our artists and the context was lost.</p>



<p>“We’ll be altering this artwork as soon as we can and will take measures to ensure that this doesn’t repeat again in the future.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Gaijin Entertainment for comment on how an oversight like this was allowed to happen. A response has yet to be received as of publishing.</p>

The explosion, which killed all seven crew members of the Space Shuttle Challenger when the spacecraft broke apart 73 seconds after take-off, had a fairly distinct shape and was thus recognized by War Thunder players when used in the key art.</p><p>"Hey guys, we have accidentally used the explosion from the Challenger disaster in one of our key art images," magazine2 said.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-mods-have-begun-and-yes-most-make-it-easier<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> DLC <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Shadow of the Erdtree</a> is just a few days old but, predictably, mods for the expansion have already started coming in.</p><p>Most of the mods targeting Shadow of the Erdtree on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring?tab=popular+%2830+days%29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nexus Mods</a> right now make the expansion easier. That’s no surprise, given the reaction so far. As IGN has reported, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-down-to-mixed-on-steam-as-players-complain-about-the-difficulty-and-performance">Steam user reviews currently have a ‘mixed’ rating after a flood of complaints about the rock hard bosses as well as PC performance issues</a>.</p><p>Belger’s ‘<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5247" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Easy Shadow of the Erdtree</a>’ mod, for example, decreases all enemy damage in the DLC by around 25%. “Many players complain about enemies in SOTE dealing too much damage,” Belger said in the mod description, “so if that’s your case, you can try this mod that lowers it significantly.”</p><p>Belger added that their mod can also be used by players to learn boss patterns without dying so often. They can then uninstall the mod and take on Shadow of the Erdtree’s rock hard bosses “the way FromSoftware intended.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Elsewhere, existing mods for the base game were updated to work with Shadow of the Erdtree. For example, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/138" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CheezeOfAstora’s mod</a> lets players recover runes immediately upon death, so there’s no need to go to the exact spot of death to recover the runes. This is “not an easy mode,” CheezeOfAstora insisted. Syyyke’s ‘<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5216" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">All in One Cheat Version</a>’ very much is an easy mode, however.</p><p>Older Elden Ring mods that make the game easier are also seeing renewed interest now Shadow of the Erdtree is out in the wild, including <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5178" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GreyEnigma’s effort</a> that reduces grinding by giving you various helpful items. And here’s a useful mod: byDelamain’s ‘<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/5181" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DLC Ready Save File</a>’ lets players skip <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/How_to_Prepare_for_the_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree_DLC">Shadow of the Erdtree's boss kill requirements</a>.</p><p>Elden Ring modders, then, are stepping in to help with what many are saying is the hardest experience FromSoftware has ever created. Ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree’s release, director Hidetaka Miyazaki signaled the DLC would significantly test players’ abilities. "The new challenges for the player are going to be the boss encounters as well as the different kinds of threats that the world will impose on people," Miyazaki told <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/elden-ring-creator-hidetaka-miyazaki-talks-shadow-of-the-erdtree-new-weapons-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>CNET</u></a>. Some of these bosses are aimed at players who've completed most of the base Elden Ring, meaning FromSoftware has "kind of really pushed the envelope in terms of what we think can be withstood by the player," he added.</p><p>If you don’t want to go down the mod route, we believe <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/psa-shadow-of-the-erdtrees-scadutree-blessings-are-the-answer-to-elden-ring-dlcs-difficulty"><u>Shadow of the Erdtree's Scadutree Blessings are the answer to the Elden Ring DLC's difficulty</u></a> (Scadutree Blessing bolsters the recipient's abilities to deal and negate damage).

IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review"><u>Shadow of the Erdtree review</u></a> returned a 10/10. We said: “Like the base game did before it, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree raises the bar for single-player DLC expansions. It takes everything that made the base game such a landmark RPG, condenses it into a relatively compact 20-25 hour campaign, and provides fantastic new challenges for heavily invested fans to chew on.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-showrunners-confirm-robert-house-for-season-2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Many of our lead characters are Vegas-bound."</h2></div><section><p>Prime Video’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/fallout-the-series">Fallout TV show</a> ended with a clear nod to a much-loved Fallout video game, but there are still many questions left unanswered by Season 1. One thing we do know now is that a major character from the games — and who only makes a brief appearance in Season 1 — will play a part in Season 2.</p><p><em><strong>Warning:</strong></em><em> Spoilers for Fallout Season 1 follow.</em></p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/fallout-season-1-finale-explainer-1236044450/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, showrunners Graham Wagner and Geneva Robertson-Dworet confirmed Robert House “will be involved” in Season 2. Fallout video game fans know Robert House as Mr. House, one of the main characters in Obsidian’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout New Vegas</a>. In that game, Mr. House runs New Vegas as a brain plugged into a supercomputer that has extended his existence from the pre-war era into the post-war era.</p><p>Robert House makes a cameo appearance in the Fallout TV show during a pre-war scene in which the then RobCo Industries boss plots with Vault-Tec management and the heads of other companies to not only survive the inevitable nuclear apocalypse, but maybe even trigger it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Fallout TV Show Video Game Easter Eggs – Companies</h3></div></output><p>“Many of our lead characters are Vegas-bound,” Wagner said. “Las Vegas in the world of Fallout is Robert House’s town. Robert House will be involved in Season 2.”</p><p>Season 1 ends with a Power Armor-clad Overseer Hank stomping towards New Vegas, with The Ghoul and Lucy MacLean in hot pursuit. Wagner’s tease suggests newly knighted Brotherhood of Steel member Maximus will also end up in New Vegas. All roads, then, lead to a post-apocalyptic showdown on what's left of The Strip.</p><p>The question is, what form will Robert House take in Season 2? Will the TV show follow New Vegas’ lead and have the character star as a 200-year-old consciousness kept alive by machines? Or will the showrunners come up with some other way to have Robert House knocking about Vegas during this point in the Fallout timeline? After all, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-did-moldaver-survive-for-over-200-years-in-fallout-fans-have-theories">the mystery of how New California Republic chief Moldaver survived for over 200 years</a> remains unresolved.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/24/screenshot-2024-06-24-121514-1719227754798.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Robert House as he appears briefly in Fallout Season 1. Image credit: Prime Video.</figcaption></figure></output><p>As the showrunners have said before, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-fallout-season-2-confirmed-we-know-at-least-one-iconic-monster-will-make-its-debut">they would have loved to have squeezed Fallout’s iconic Deathclaw into Season 1</a>, but couldn’t manage it due to having to establish the world. But deathclaws are also confirmed for Season 2, and like so much of Fallout Season 1, they won’t be CGI.</p><p>“To be honest, the deathclaw is an element we were troubled by not finding the right space for it in season one, and we very deliberately wanted to box ourselves in,” Wagner admitted. “And sometimes, as writers, you do that. You set yourself a challenge and you just say, ‘Well, now we got to.</p><p>“So, that actually has helped us a lot because we’re already developing ways, iterating ways to actually get the deathclaw up on its feet. Make it the most cool and impactful thing and it actually has given us the runway so we’re not just delivering a script and saying, ‘Oh, God, there’s a deathclaw.’ It’s like, ‘We know there is a deathclaw, so get ready.; These things take a lot of iterating, a lot of time to do it and to do it right versus just having it be a CG squiggle running across the screen.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I like taking side trips and just exploring something that was mentioned in passing and making a thing out of it.</p></div><p>The final tease comes from Walton Goggins, who expertly plays Ghoul/Cooper. He suggested the Ghoul will once again get side-tracked in Season 2, as he did while dragging Lucy around the wasteland in Season 1.</p><p>“There are mysteries from Season 1, there are things that seem benign but may carry weight in Season 2, and things that are worth dedicating an episode to that seem outside of the overall trajectory of this experience. I like taking side trips and just exploring something that was mentioned in passing and making a thing out of it. And I know Graham and Geneva and Jonah [Nolan] are down for that too. So we’ll see what happens.”</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/whats-the-snake-oil-salesmans-mysterious-serum-in-the-fallout-tv-show-fans-have-theories"><u>Fans have plenty of theories about the Snake Oil Salesman’s mysterious serum</u></a>, for example.

In this case, the most-recent screens include War Thunder's newest Seek &amp; Destroy update, but appeared to also show an infamous image of the Challenger explosion.
