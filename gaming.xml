            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a> developers Paradox have decided now's the time for the medieval <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> to take a leaf out of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crusader-kings-2-now-has-a-subscription-service-for-all-the-dlc">its predecessor's book</a> - as well as fellow strategians <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hearts-of-iron-iv">Hearts of Iron IV</a> and Europa Universalis 4 - by getting its own DLC subscription service. Starting today, you'll have the option to pay a monthly fee for access to all nine billion or so CK3 expansions and add-ons, if you don't fancy paying to own them outright in the usual fashion.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>By taking out a monthly Crusader Kings 3 subscription via the marry your cousin to keep the crown sim's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/">Steam page</a>, you'll be granted all all of its major expansions, plus the truckload of smaller add-ons Paradox have put out for it. The price is £8.49 / €9.99/ $9.99 per month, though Paradox do note there'll be "discounts for longer term subscriptions".</p>
<p>The idea behind offering this alongside the existing DLC buying options is catering to "players who’d prefer to play for a limited time or in a more budget-conscious manner". It's a chance for folks who only own the base game to try out all of the add-ons for a month, with Paradox's coffers hoping the end result will be said people opting to keep their subscription running or opt to permanently pick up some DLC they've enjoyed. As someone who got into CK3 as a newbie last year, I can see the appeal. Coming to a game that already has half a decade worth of pretty pricey DLC (even if you wait for a sale) out and discerning which bits add enough stuff you'll use that they're worth committing to isn't the easiest, even if there's plenty of reading you can do to help you judge.</p>
<p>As of writing, a subscription opens up all 25 bits of CK3 DLC included in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/36586/Crusader_Kings_III_Collection/">Crusader Kings 3 collection</a>, which Steam tells me - a person who already owns the base game plus major expansions Royal Court, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/im-sorry-for-all-the-dead-bodies-i-left-behind-while-walking-from-ireland-to-china-in-crusader-kings-3s-brilliant-new-dlc">Roads to Power</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-largest-ever-crusader-kings-3-expansion-takes-us-to-china-japan-and-southeast-asia-this-october">All Under Heaven</a> - would set me back just over £100 to buy right now. There are three other major expansions out right now - Tours and Tournaments, Legends of the Dead, and Khans of the Steppe. The rest are either cosmetics, or event/flavour packs designed to add more royal strategising scenarios you can take on/flesh them out with more choices.</p><p>As with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-launch-dlc-subscription-service-for-hearts-of-iron-iv-today">Hearts of Iron</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/now-paradox-offer-a-dlc-subscription-for-europa-universalis-4-too">Europa Universalis</a>' subscriptions, this CK3 one looks as though it'll expand to include <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-show-off-their-mysterious-ass-to-tease-crusader-kings-3s-2026-expansions">future DLC Paradox put out</a> going forwards too. It also shares a need to pay for the subscription on top of the base game, which makes this less appealing than it might otherwise be. There's also the fact that a good portion of the strategy game's add-ons <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-apologise-for-crusader-kings-3s-coronations-dlc-not-being-up-to-the-standard-you-deserve">aren't necessarily things you'll miss greatly</a> if you've not got them. My three expansions plus base game setup's still got tons of scope to steal away hours of my life in the coming years, regardless of not having the likes of coronations or in-depth Genghis Khan simulation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sometimes, you do have to wonder what’s wrong with people on the internet. Wildlight Entertainment’s Highguard sure has come in for a cavalcade of online hate, because… erm… it was the final trailer shown at The Game Awards? Or was it because it wasn’t Half Life 3? Maybe because it was just a bit different? It’s hard to tell sometimes.</p>
<p>This free-to-play hero shooter comes from former Apex Legends devs, drawing on a whole host of random bits of MOBA, Capture the Flag, Overwatch, and Rainbow Six Siege before taking them in a slightly weird He-Man/Thundercats direction. It also gives you a mount to gallop across the map on, setting it quite clearly apart from both its developer’s past work, and its key competitors like Overwatch 2 and Marvel Rivals. Personally, I think it’s a mix that works.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gameplay Launch Trailer | Highguard" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gqFccBZyTaA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>You’re a Warden, a hero set on protecting the lands from ne’er-do-wells who’d use it for nefarious purposes. I think. You’re equipped with an odd mix of real-world styled armaments – hello sniper rifles and shotguns – and magical Warden abilities, with a limited use ‘tactical’ move, as well as an underpowered Ultimate that builds as you play, with some capable of altering the outcome of a round.</p>
<p>You start off in your own base. There’s six options to choose from, each with different looks, layouts and pros and cons, and you’ll need to work out which works best for you and your squad’s abilities. Each round you’re recommended a particular layout based on your team make-up, but it’s entirely up to you and your teammates. So far, everyone seems quite happy to follow the game’s recommendation, but I can see people settling on preferred options that provide the best opportunities for defense.</p>


<p>Your first task in any round of Highguard is the defensive phase. During this you’re able to reinforce the walls against attack if you’ve got iron, and it’s best to focus on protecting the central areas. Once that’s done, you set out to upgrade your arsenal, either farming from crystals to buy upgrades from the various stalls, or looting guns, ammo, armour, upgrades and special Raid devices from the chests positioned all over the map. The only frustration here is when you’re looking for very specific weaponry, having to make do at points with whatever the highest level thing you’ve found is. You rush around through these two periods, and it feels just about the right length not to drag.</p>
<p>Key to your offense is the Shieldbreaker. Once this sword appears, all hell lets loose as you and every other player on the map attempt to grab it. This is because, not only does it give you a He-Man “I have the power” moment, but it’ll spawn a giant Thundercats-esque tank to break down the shields wrapped around the opposition’s base.</p>

<p>This then segues into the best part of any round, the Capture the Flag-like race to the enemy base while riding your mount. You and your teammates saddle up, and try to find the best route across the map, with attackers hot on your heels, or teleporting back to their base to set up a perimeter. The Shieldbreaker gives off a massive electrical charge, so there’s no hiding here, and it can be super rewarding to set an ambush, or to ride through, scoring kills from horseback.</p>
<p>Once you’re in, you need to destroy the generators that are squirrelled away inside. You plant bombs on each of these, and then guard them until they detonate. Take out both generators, and the game is yours. You can go straight for the heart of the base if you’d prefer, with the Anchor Stone basically a one-shot kill to their stronghold. It takes longer to detonate your explosion, so you’ll have to hold off the enemy team in a tight, exhilarating gun battle, but if you’ve got a group that’s working well together, then it’s the fastest way to victory.</p>

<p>I found it really interesting just how much variation there can be through rounds of Highguard. I’ve won rounds in a few minutes, grabbing the Shieldbreaker and then instantly taking out the Anchor Stone. I’ve also played for well over half an hour, going through multiple rounds of push and pull, driving back siege weapons and attackers, before launching a counter-offensive. Each time you make it through a siege section, you drop back into the tooling-up phase, with the loot and weaponry steadily increasing in level. You can also repair your base against future assault, or go back to reinforcing all the walls, and it all feels rather good.</p>
<p>The 3v3 team size certainly works, though I wouldn’t complain about a few more bodies to bolster your team with. Limiting things to only six players at once, the maps can seem a touch too expansive, but when you’re riding around on your mounts, it suddenly makes much more sense to be covering swathes of ground while astride a bear. I mean, what can be better than that?</p>

<p>The gunplay is enjoyable, reactive and relatively tight, and you can feel the Apex Legends heritage running through each encounter with another player. There’s a fairly short time to kill, but I didn’t feel like I was instantaneously in and out. Respawns are quite slow as a punishment for falling, though, giving you a chunk of time to think about why you didn’t pull the trigger a fraction faster.</p>
<p>This is a game that lives and dies on you and your team playing the objective. It’s also the kind of game where you can’t just wander off on your own – apart from when you’re looking for loot during the interludes. So far, I’ve won most of the rounds where my team actually played together, and lost every one where they didn’t. I guess that will be most people’s experience.</p>
<p>So, the gunplay is good, and the systems all come together in a way that actually feels fresh and relatively new. Where’s the hitch? Well, for me it’s in the characters. There are currently eight Wardens, with five different classes, but within that eight, there’s already a few who are clearly less useful than others. Atticus, Scarlet, Kai and Slade are already becoming popular choices for dealing damage, though I truly hate Slade’s frat-boy visual design, and everyone else is undeniably generic. </p>

<p>My personal pick so far is Mara, the only Support character, though given that I play Moira in Overwatch, and Wildfire has used her design, abilities and personality as ‘inspiration’, it’s an easy fit for me.</p>
<p>The other three are currently much less useful. Falcon can give your team a boost with her Recon abilities, but can be easily evaded, while Una’s Wisps are just annoyances rather than the turret-like minions I would hope for. Her Ultimate is also a thoroughly underwhelming riff on Overwatch’s Ashe. Redmane, meanwhile, feels pretty great, but he’s only really any use when you’re attacking the enemy base, with his destructive abilities more of a liability on defence.</p>
<p>This is where Wildfire need to spend their time. If there’s only five truly viable characters, that’s a very constricted pool to draw from, and it will quickly lead to stagnation in team makeup and tactics. The roster needs a bump – I’m certain that there’s a bunch of characters waiting in the wings – and some of the Wardens need to be rebalanced and retuned.</p>

<p>Few games have ever elicited the kind of online vitriol Highguard has, and you know what? It doesn’t deserve it. There’s something both unique and familiar about it, and as a free-to-play title, it’s not asking anything of you, especially here at the start with its first free battle pass.</p>
<p>There are, of course, microtransactions lurking in the wings, and if you find your eye caught by one of the premium skins for a character, or your mount, they’re not the cheapest out there. There’s a few right now that I’d be tempted by, but after years of Overwatch, I do try not to get too caught up in it. Still, all it takes right now is a little resolve, and you can quite happily play for free. Really, it’s quite safe. Highguard can’t hurt you.</p>
<p>Performance on PS5 is good, with no noticeable hitches or frame drops. At times, it can feel like the image isn’t as clear as you’re expecting, but there’s nothing to hamper the moment-to-moment gameplay. Reports show that this isn’t the case on PC unless you’re running a massive rig, and hopefully, Wildlight can get on top of those issues quickly. </p>
<p>Highguard’s first steps into the PvP arena are confident and unashamed, despite what the angry voices on the internet might tell you. The slightly odd mix of Apex Legends, Rainbow Six and He-Man actually makes for a good time, and there’s so much room for more to happen here. That will take time, and I hope that it finds the audience it needs to thrive.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony is Quietly Suggesting PS4 Players Upgrade to PS5 Consoles]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Earlier today, images surfaced online of a system message apparently sent by PlayStation direct to users on PlayStation <strong>4 </strong>consoles. The message was suggesting they take a look at the latest deals on PlayStation 5 consoles to upgrade and avoid missing out on some of the biggest games set to launch in 2026.</p>



<p>Midway through 2024, the split between PS4 and PS5 players was around 50-50, with tens of millions of gamers worldwide still using the 2013 console as their flagship gaming device.</p>







<h2 id="h-it-s-time-to-give-up-the-playstation-4">It’s Time To Give Up the PlayStation 4</h2>



<p>The PlayStation 5 has been on the market for more than five years, and the first PlayStation 4 console dropped in 2013, so perhaps it’s time to finally bite the bullet and make that upgrade. That is, unless you’re holding out for the launch of the PlayStation 6 and are prepared to skip a generation.</p>



<p>In a recent image that surfaced on social media, one user claimed to have received a message from PlayStation that was quietly encouraging them to upgrade from PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 5. The <a href="https://x.com/Zuby_Tech/status/2016232719949189348" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">message read</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Whether you’re catching up with hits from 2025 like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, ARC Raiders, and Ghost of Yotei, or getting ready for the most-anticipated games of 2026, including SAROS, 007 First Light, Nioh 3, and so much more, now’s the perfect time to upgrade to a PS5 console.</em></p>



<p><em>Scan the QR code to see the latest deals on PS5 consoles.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Perhaps it’s good guy Sony trying to pull players in the right direction with their gaming hardware, or maybe it’s a method designed to coax players away from a withdrawing platform that they’ve started sunsetting.</p>



<p>In October 2025, it was revealed that some PlayStation 4 titles would have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-is-sunsetting-some-playstation-4-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">certain PSN features switched off</a> in 2026. It’s an effort by Sony to start winding down what has fast become legacy hardware and software, especially as eyes turn to whatever comes next in the PlayStation 6.</p>







<p>Are you still rocking your PlayStation 4, or did you upgrade years ago? Let us know what you’re using on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Wildlight Entertainment is working hard to address player concerns regarding some of the quality-of-life mechanics in Highguard. Or rather, some of the <strong>missing </strong>quality-of-life mechanics. The game came out just two days ago, and players quickly discovered that some settings they expected to be there simply weren’t.</p>



<p>The Highguard team posted a message on social media addressing the issue and stated that player feedback will be addressed with some rapid patching.</p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-fov-sliders-incoming">Highguard FOV Sliders Incoming</h2>



<p>Highguard has already had a tough time since jumping onto the market on Monday. It was a bold experiment by Wildlight Entertainment to fuse multiple genres in a bid to create something innovative, but a lot of the effort appears to have been lost in the delivery of the thing.</p>



<p>The launch of Highguard followed more than a month of radio silence after the game’s first trailer landed at The Game Awards, hosted by Geoff Keighley, who is also being burned after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-was-meant-to-be-a-shadowdrop/">promoting the game at length</a>.</p>



<p>In a recent social media post, the team at Wildlight stressed that some quality-of-life improvements are coming to address what players are asking for the most:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve been listening to feedback and working to add some highly requested features, including FoV sliders for consoles, toggle settings for ADS &amp; crouch, and more graphics scaling options for PC. We’re targeting to release a patch tomorrow, with full patch notes once it’s live.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For some, it’s bizarre that Highguard was released with some of these options missing. Regardless, Wildlight is going to right that wrong with a patch that promises to be pushed out today.</p>



<p>For those hanging around, Highguard has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-roadmap-reveals-year-of-content/">a year-long roadmap</a> stacked up and waiting to be delivered. Time will tell how many players are present to see all the content drops unravel this year, though.</p>

<p>Just remove the red lens cover</p>

<figure data-uuid="05dc168a21677"><a title="Colour" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/05dc168a21677/colour.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Yesterday, Nintendo shared an update about its Virtual Boy library coming to the Switch Online + Expansion Pack next month.</p>
<p>Although it seemingly doubles down on the requirement to purchase new headsets, on a more welcoming note, there will be some quality-of-life enhancements. Apart from the usual options, including save states, the ability to rewind gameplay and remap controls - in case you missed it, there'll also be the option to change the colour of the screen.</p>
<p>Yes, users will actually be able to remove the red lens and swap to the following colours to make the whole experience a little easier on the eyes:</p>
<figure data-uuid="f5a3e167c969d"><a title="Colour" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f5a3e167c969d/colour.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<figure data-uuid="5fcd40fbe7241"><a title="Colour" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5fcd40fbe7241/colour.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<figure data-uuid="d98c622b1157a"><a title="Colour" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d98c622b1157a/colour.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The one downside is that this colour change option <em>won't</em> actually be available at launch next month. According to Nintendo, it will be coming "later this year", so you'll just have to wait! Once again, this new feature will require users to physically "remove the lens cover" from the headset.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</a> delivered an excellent Switch 2 port last July, and if you were hoping for the next entry on Nintendo's new hybrid system, it seems you're in luck.</p>
<p>According to Dealabs' Billbil-kun, who has accurately reported on game announcements ahead of schedule in the past, the next WWE 2K will not only be coming to the Switch 2, but it will also be arriving on the same date as the Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 counterparts.</p>
<p>The current date for <strong>WWE 2K26</strong>'s launch is apparently scheduled to take place on <strong>13th March 2026</strong>, with pre-orders expected to open this week, so we'll provide an update if we hear anything. The source has also shared some details about the physical copy of the game, claiming it will be another "code-in-box release", much like last year's entry.</p>
<p>When we find out more, we'll let you know. In some <em>other</em> sports-related news, it seems the next chapter in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mlb_the_show_26">MLB The Show</a> series will actually be skipping the Switch 2, as Sony sticks with a Switch release for now.</p>

<p>Since the launch of the Switch 2, Nintendo and developers have been working to make as many Switch games as possible compatible with the new system.</p>
<p>One of the many titles that has experienced issues on this hybrid device is Bethesda's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/doom">DOOM</a> reboot, which launched in 2016 and eventually made its way to the Switch in 2017 with the help of the talented team at Panic Button.</p>
<p>Although issues with the title on the Switch 2 were thought to have been resolved in a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/more-switch-games-receive-compatibility-updates-for-switch-2">compatibility update last November</a>, it appears there are still some problems to iron out. While the title is now officially "supported" in terms of Switch 2 compatibility, according to Nintendo, the "game behaviour may vary from Nintendo Switch".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067nogurz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>The update posted on Nintendo's compatibility site earlier this week on 27th January 2026 mentions how "the game sometimes force closes after autosaving at specific points". For now, it's simply a matter of reopening the title when this happens and to continue playing using the same save data.</p>
<figure data-uuid="b83d434af1971"><a title="DOOM" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b83d434af1971/doom.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, it's not a major problem, but it's something that's being investigated and will hopefully be resolved sooner rather later. Despite this issue when playing DOOM on the Switch 2, this title, in general, is still a hell of a shooter and a fantastic port from Panic Button.</p>

Additionally, a special collaboration with <em><a title="Games > Silent Hill f [12 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a></em> is planned in the form of free costume downloadable content for each game. <span id="more-1021604"></span></p><p>Here are the latest details:</p><blockquote><p>In <em>FATAL FRAME II: Crimson Butterfly REMAKE</em>, twin sisters wander into an abandoned village infested with vengeful spirits, and use the Camera Obscura, a device that can capture and seal away the impossible, as their only weapon. This complete remake of the second title in the <em>FATAL FRAME</em> franchise introduces new gameplay elements, including a brand-new ending featuring the song “Utsushie”, composed by Tsuki Amano, along with new side stories and new locations to explore.</p><p>During their haunted journey, players will be able to use Broken Spirit Stones to delve into the past of various characters and discover new side stories, expanding the lore of Crimson Butterfly. Players will also explore new locations such as the Umbral Mound, an ominous burial site tightly bound with ropes and hidden within dense bamboo groves, and the candlelit hall of Eikado Temple, with its pair of twin statues tied together by sacred cords.</p><p>The deeper players delve into the mystery of the haunted village, the more danger they encounter. Evil spirits grow more desperate to attack, sprouting wings. In this state, spirits are shrouded in crimson malice, rapidly regenerating health while attacking more frequently and with even greater strength.</p><p>To help defeat the spirits lurking in the shadows, players can use Prayer Beads to enhance the Camera Obscura in battle, increasing the number of focus points and improving the reload speed. Players can also find Reversion Beads as they explore to reset all unlocked upgrades.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_1021660"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Using the Camera Obscura, players can take new Special Shots to fight vengeful spirits. Equipping different filters applies unique effects to Special Shots, allowing players to adapt their strategy to any situation. For example, the Paraceptual Filter allows players to activate the Special Shot “Blinding,” which temporarily blinds their target, allowing the player to escape. Another filter, the Radiant Filter, allows players to use the Special Shot “Purging,” which sacrifices Mio’s willpower to inflict increased damage.</p><p>﻿The Camera Obscura is more than a spiritual weapon: it can also be used to capture photographs of Twin Dolls scattered across Minakami Village. These dolls modelled after the Twin Maidens are guardians against calamity. Players can purify them by photographing them together in the same frame, finally putting them and the emotions trapped within them to rest. With each set of Twin Dolls purified, more items will unlock in the Point Exchange.</p><p>In addition to these new mechanics, <em>FATAL FRAME II: Crimson Butterfly REMAKE</em> also introduces a new Photo Mode that players can use to capture in-game moments. Players can use frames, stickers, and visual effects to create their own terrifying souvenirs and, maybe, capture an unexpected spirit or two.</p><p>The terrifying gameplay gets even scarier with a newly-announced collaboration with SILENT HILL f, the latest title of the renowned psychological horror franchise SILENT HILL that has sold over 13 million copies worldwide. Collaboration costumes will be added as free downloadable content at a later date. More details about this future update will be announced in the coming weeks.</p></blockquote><p><em>FATAL FRAME II: Crimson Butterfly REMAKE</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,274 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,631 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [908 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [25,359 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3920610" target="_blank">Steam</a> on March 12.</p><p><em>Silent Hill f</em> is available now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2947440/SILENT_HILL_f/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/silent-hill-f-714aed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/silent-hill-f/9n5nfrqv2hqq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Store</a>.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Employee Claims He’s Placed on Unpaid Suspension for Criticising Return-to-Office Policy]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-employee-suspension/</link>
            <guid>1418098</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A long-time <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a> employee has taken to social media to claim that he has been placed on an unpaid disciplinary suspension for comments regarding the recent return-to-office mandates.</p>







<p>Posting on LinkedIn, David Michaud-Cromp, who has worked at Ubisoft for more than 13 years, says the company notified him that he would receive a three-day unpaid disciplinary suspension.</p>



<p>According to Michaud-Cromp, the suspension, which is set to start tomorrow, was issued in response to public comments he made about Ubisoft’s return-to-office policy and an “alleged breach of the duty of loyalty.”</p>



<p>Following the announcement of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-forcing-full-return-office-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5-day return-to-office mandate</a>, which Insider Gaming understands has proven to be an extremely unpopular move with employees, David took to LinkedIn to say:</p>



<p>“So… Ubisoft wanna bring back 5 days in the office… because they “believe in collaboration”… but c’mon, we’re not completely stupid… we very well know why you want to go back to 5 days in the office…”</p>



<p>Michaud-Cromp alleges that these comments led to the three-day suspension.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft for comment, and should one be received, we will update this article.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I love this new YouTube video that uses mods to recreate the life of an NPC citizen of Gotham City in <a href="https://kotaku.com/batman-arkham-knight-the-kotaku-re-review-1791829083"><em>Batman: Arkham Knight</em></a> because it lets me experience something I’ve always thought about: What it must be like to live in the same place as a superhero.</p> <p>Living in Gotham City, the urban sprawl that superhero crimefighter Batman calls home, must be wild. Going out to grab something from the nearby convenience store could lead to you getting a front row seat for Batman’s next gang fight. Or he might just run past your window in the middle of the night. Or worse, he could run you over with his Batmobile-tank that is totally nonlethal, okay? And that’s what you get in <a href="https://youtu.be/UCosPe2ispc">Gaming with Griff Griffin’s new short but sweet<em> Batman: Arkham Knight</em> video</a>.</p>

  <p>My favorite moments from Griff’s video are when it really does feel like you’re seeing things from the perspective of a random Gotham City resident who just so happens to catch a glimpse of Batman. I imagine with a city as big as Gotham, not everyone has seen Batman, so it’s likely a treat for those who do. Or maybe scary as hell? Probably a bit of both.</p> <p>“Essentially, I modded <em>Batman: Arkham Knight</em> to ‘take control’ of pedestrians in Gotham, and see what Batman looks like from their perspective,” Griff explained to <em>Kotaku</em> in an email. The creator has also made a video presenting things from the point of view of the gang members Batman beats up in the games, <a href="https://youtu.be/yxYtpuc97eY">in case you’re curious about that experience</a>. It is a far more terrifying way to encounter the Dark Knight.</p>

<p>Just a week after <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-cancels-6-games-in-major-organisation-restructure">Ubisoft announced</a> it was making a huge amount of cuts and cancellations in order to aid efficiency and corporate restructuring, the French studio has confirmed it will be increasing the price of <strong>Just Dance+</strong> subscriptions from <strong>April 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>The streaming service, which launched back in November 2022, can be used in-game from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/just_dance_2023_edition">Just Dance 2023 Edition</a> onward, and gives you access to even more songs from the series' back-catalogue.</p>
<p>But that'll come at a steeper cost from, with monthly prices rising by <strong>$1</strong> a month, 3-month passes going up <strong>$3</strong>, and a year's pass costing an extra <strong>$5</strong>. Here's a rundown of the before and after:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Month Pass: $<strong>4.99</strong> <strong>/ 4,99€</strong> (previously $3.99 / 3,99€)</li>
<li>3 Month Pass: $<strong>12.99</strong> <strong>/ 12,99€</strong> (previously $9.99 / 9,99€)</li>
<li>12 Month Pass: $<strong>29.99</strong> <strong>/ 29,99€</strong> (previously $24.99 / 24,99€)</li>
</ul>
<p>Sure, new content is coming in the form of more songs, some of which are available from today, including 'Walking on Sunshine' by Katrina &amp; The Waves, 'Toxic' by Britney Spears, and 'Dynamite' by BTS. A second batch lands on 10th February 2026.</p>
<p>But the timing isn't great timing, especially in the aftermath <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-cancels-6-games-in-major-organisation-restructure">of last week's news</a>, which saw six games — including the long-in-development <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/prince-of-persia-team-behind-cancelled-sands-of-time-remake-shares-final-message">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a> — get cancelled, studios get closed down, and restructuring at various offices. All in aid of a live-service push, specialisations, and investments in generative AI.</p>
<p>Since then, a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/surprise-rayman-30th-anniversary-edition-has-been-rated">Rayman 30th Anniversary rating has appeared</a> (which is potentially being handled by Atari), but it doesn't look rosy. According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-follows-last-weeks-game-cancelations-and-studio-closures-with-a-proposed-reduction-of-200-more-jobs-at-its-paris-headquarters">IGN</a>, the Paris headquarters are looking at a cost-reduction initiative, including a voluntary redundancy process, with French union Solidaires Informatique reportedly planning more action following a call to strike last week (via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/anger-and-despair-reigning-supreme-at-ubisoft-following-restructuring-plan-says-union">GamesIndustry.biz</a>).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A small consolation has been provided to backers of the Darkest Dungeon board game. After <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mythic-games-files-liquidation-end-controversial-company" rel="nofollow">the collapse</a> of board game developer Mythic Games and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/darkest-dungeon-board-game-wont-ship-unless-backers-pony-up-more-money" rel="nofollow">failure to produce</a> the board game, the game files for its various elements will be released to its Kickstarter backers.</p><p>This development in the <em>Darkest Dungeon</em> board game came from a thread of social media posts by the official Darkest Dungeon accounts. The thread, later reposted on <a href="https://www.darkestdungeon.com/news/regarding-mythic-games-and-the-darkest-dungeon-board-game/" rel="nofollow">their website</a>, states that former Mythic employees reached out to the studio for permission to release the project files to everyone who backed the original campaign.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/darkest-dungeon-board-game-social-media-screenshot.jpg?itok=lNgT5R99 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="700" height="575">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/darkest-dungeon-board-game-social-media-screenshot.jpg?itok=uzcVZAUj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="700" height="575">
                  

  </picture><p>The account states that, while they don't own or control the board game files, they did permit their release for non-commercial use. This is important since those files contained copyrighted material from the <em>Darkest Dungeon</em> videogame, which made releasing any of this material impossible without Red Hook Studio's consent.</p><p>If you were a backer for the <em>Darkest Dungeon</em> board game Kickstarter, you will receive an email explaining the situation. That email will contain a link to all files for the project, including artwork, game rules, 3D models, and more.</p><p>The thread ends with addressing a major question by fans. Why doesn't Red Hook just step in and finish the game's production themselves? The thread explains that Red Hook doesn't have expertise in board game manufacturing. In addition, the studio doesn't have enough funds to divert to such an endeavor without seriously endangering its own operations.</p><p>Overall, this development for the <em>Darkest Dungeon</em> board game is better than most failed projects. It is a shame that the Kickstarter, which was one of the most successful on the platform, with $5.6 million raised, didn't happen due to Mythic's myriad production problems. But having a way to make your own is a small comfort. Just don't think about selling it.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
