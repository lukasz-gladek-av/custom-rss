            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">best board games</a> come in a lot of different themes, but war is one of the most popular ones. And for good reason – war board games can be incredibly fun and exciting. All of the games below will give you a feeling of epic battle. Some may do it in an evening, some may take all day, but none of them will sell you short on battle strategy along the way. Gather some friends, get the snacks and drinks together, and settle in for a long haul thrill ride.</p><p>Here are a few tips to help longer games run smoothly: If you can, get a PDF copy of the rulebook (most publishers make them freely available) and have everyone read it before the game. Insist players do "admin" tasks like sorting their hands or counters outside their turn. You may also want to impose a time limit per turn if all players agree. Now, on with the games!</p><h2>TL;DR: These Are the Best War Board Games</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#sniper-elite">Sniper Elite: The Board Game</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#twilight-imperium">Twilight Imperium IV</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#blood-rage">Blood Rage</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#dune">Dune</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#kemet">Kemet: Blood and Sand</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#rebellion">Star Wars: Rebellion</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#conflict-of-heroes">Conflict of Heroes: Awakening the Bear</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#undaunted">Undaunted: Normandy / Undaunted: North Africa</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#root">Root</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#twilight-struggle">Twilight Struggle: Red Sea</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#got">A Game of Thrones: The Board Game</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#war-of-the-ring">War of the Ring</a></li><li><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games#eclipse">Eclipse: Second Dawn for the Galaxy</a></li></ul><h2 id="sniper-elite">Sniper Elite: The Board Game</h2><div id="164399" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Sniper Elite: The Board Game</h3></p></div><p>Fans of the video game series might be surprised by the close-quarters action depicted in this tabletop adaptation, but that shouldn’t discourage you from its considerable charms. The stealth aspects are wholly intact, as the sniper player is trying to stay slow and silent while up against a punishing clock, and the roving squads controlled by the German player who are trying to sniff him out. In addition to that ever-escalating tension, it’s also got a sense of historical veneer that the video game lacks, with thematic components and more realistic combat. The game comes with two different boards and a variety of sniper loadout options and squad specialists for the German player, ensuring it’s got tons of replay value and tactical decision-making to explore.</p><h2 id="twilight-imperium">Twilight Imperium IV</h2><div id="158887" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Twilight Imperium 4th Edition</h3></p></div><p>Games don't get more epic than this all-day affair of sci-fi civilization building. It's got everything you could want from the genre. A range of bizarre aliens research technology and build fleets to fight over a random galactic hex map. There's inter-player diplomacy, of course, but also in-game political decrees to vote on. Yet while dealmaking is important, it rests on a rock-solid <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategic core</a> to challenge you. The strategy card system, where each player picks a special focus each round, is a particular mechanical gem. This fourth edition retains the sweeping scope but trims lots of fat, making it more accessible. </p><h2 id="blood-rage">Blood Rage</h2><div id="196921" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Blood Rage</h3></p></div><p>In Blood Rage, you control a Viking clan heading into the end times of Ragnarök and trying to gain as much rage, axes and horns as they can to win glory for their warriors and a place in Valhalla. As delightfully angsty as that all sounds, the violent exterior and great-looking components hide a game of considerable strategic subtlety. You’ll be drafting cards to support your actions each round, carefully marshaling your limited supply of warriors and monsters to try and pillage map regions and fulfill quests to earn that all-important glory. Of course, everyone else has the same designs, so you’ll frequently be fighting them for the privilege using an exciting blind battle card system. A fantastic blend of tactical challenge, theme and outright brutality, this is a definitive conflict-based classic.</p><h2 id="dune">Dune</h2><div id="158888" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Dune</h3></p></div><p>Dune is a very different kind of futuristic game, (not to be confused with <a href="https://zdcs.link/PjB0D?_ga=398378208.1708462773&amp;object_uuid=0abb9d39-5c55-4637-acfd-0bb89acb5f8b&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Dune: Imperium</a>). Based on Frank Herbert's famous novel and first released in 1979, it was years ahead of its time. There's little randomness in Dune. Instead, the game rests on a fascinating balance of hidden information and asymmetrical strategy.</p><p>Each player takes the role of a faction from the book, with asymmetric special powers. The Atreides, for example, get to peek at cards as they're auctioned off blind, while the wicked Harkonnen know all the secret traitors in play. The result is an astonishing evocation of the narrative and political themes of the novel. This new edition has cleaner rules and spanking art.</p><h2 id="kemet">Kemet: Blood and Sand</h2><div id="196922" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Kemet Blood and Sand</h3></p></div><p>Imagine all the gods and mythical creatures of ancient Egypt were real, and that they came down to the desert sands one day to tear each other into itty-bitty pieces. That’s Kemet. You could talk about the tech pyramids that allow you to tailor your strategy with special powers across attack and defense, and feed those into your board play. You could talk about how everyone starts with the same battle cards to use in fights, leading to terrible mind games as you try and out-guess what your opponent will play and what they’ll discard. But mostly this is all about out-and-out violence at a breathtaking pace, as the peculiar board layout means there’s no hiding, and everyone is a mere skip away from tearing everyone else’s mummified guts out.</p><h2 id="rebellion">Star Wars: Rebellion</h2><div id="158890" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Star Wars: Rebellion</h3></p></div><p>Star Wars: Rebellion takes a more liberal approach to reconstruct a favorite franchise on your table. It's clearly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-board-games">Star Wars</a>. The Rebellion player is the underdog, trying to survive militarily while winning planets over to their cause. The Empire, meanwhile, wields the power of huge armies to crush the slightest sign of dissent. It's a fascinating asymmetric struggle, peopled by well-known characters and events from the movies. But beyond the famous faces, the unfolding narrative is up to you. It's all woven together with tight strategic strings to ensure each turn is full of challenge and variety.</p><h2 id="conflict-of-heroes">Conflict of Heroes: Awakening the Bear</h2><div id="196924" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Conflict of Heroes: Awakening The Bear</h3></p></div><p>Tactical wargames, where the action is depicted at the level of squads or individual soldiers, are a tricky genre to get right. There’s so much detail available that it’s easy to get bogged down in over-complex systems, which, in turn, slow down what should be a pulse-pounding encounter. No game gets the balance better than the Conflict of Heroes series, which uses a simple system of action points, dice and differing front and rear defense values to offer players excitement, realism and tactical challenge all in one neat package. While it starts out simple, it soon expands to include artillery, vehicles and tanks for a full World War 2 experience. And the command point system, a tiny pool of extra actions you can invoke during your opponent’s turn, is a stroke of genius, with every point spent feeling like giving blood.  </p><h2 id="undaunted">Undaunted: Normandy &amp; Undaunted: North Africa</h2><div><div id="158884" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Undaunted: Normandy</h3></p></div><div id="158885" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Undaunted: North Africa</h3></p></div><div id="173903" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Undaunted Stalingrad</h3></p></div></div><p>While in no way a simulation, the way these games leverage the deck building genre to conjure the tactics of infantry combat from just a few rules is astonishing. Officer cards let you add new unit cards to your deck, imitating the issuing of orders and supplies to soldiers in the field. Those unit cards, meanwhile, let you move the matching troop counters on the modular scenario map, fighting the enemy and seizing objectives. Casualties thin your deck, making units less able to act as their morale erodes under fire. With tense firefights and pivotal moments aplenty, you won't find a more accessible or engaging way to refight the Second World War. </p><h2 id="root">Root</h2><div id="155278" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Root: A Game of Woodland Might and Right</h3></p></div><p>One of the shorter games on the list, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/root-board-game-review">Root</a> is a bold design that throws asymmetry to the fore. There are four factions fighting for control of the woodland realm, each with its own unique rules and feel. The Marquise de Cat and the Eyrie play standard, if quite different, conquest games. The Woodland Folk are guerrilla fighters against those invaders. Finally, the Vagabond is a lone trickster-hero. Don't let the cute theme and quirky art put you off – this is a red-blooded game of brutal strategy, where each play asks big questions about politics and governance in the real world.</p><h2 id="twilight-struggle">Twilight Struggle: Red Sea</h2><div id="196923" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Twilight Struggle: Red Sea</h3></p></div><p>The original Twilight Struggle is often counted among the best board games ever made, but there’s a problem: It’s complex and takes three or four hours to play. This version keeps the core card-play of the original that made it so compelling, with players facing endless dilemmas whether to risk triggering key events for their opponent as they navigate their hand of cards, but cranks down the play time to a mere hour or so. It’s still full of meaty, awkward decisions to navigate, but a new scoring mechanic helps ratchet up the excitement in the shorter game. And for history buffs there’s the chance to explore this little-known corner of the Cold War as it unfolded in East Africa, with real historical events simulated on the player’s cards through the game mechanics, and a book of designer’s notes to illuminate their view of the history.</p><h2 id="got">A Game of Thrones: The Board Game</h2><div id="158891" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>A Game of Thrones: The Board Game</h3></p></div><p>Speaking of politics, this game recreates all the conniving and backstabbing of the books and TV show. To do so, it borrows a trick from classic Diplomacy: only one player can win, but no player has the resources to win alone. Alliances and eventual treachery are thus inevitable, keeping everyone on a knife-edge. It's governed by a thrilling secret order system, meaning you can't know your opponent's intentions until it's too late. Atop this time-tested formula are lots of sweet bells and whistles from the world of Westeros to add strategic interest. A great game in its own right, it's a must for fans of the franchise. </p><h2 id="war-of-the-ring">War of the Ring</h2><div id="158892" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>War of the Ring 2nd Edition</h3></p></div><p>Another top game for lovers of the source material, this is by far the best of the many attempts to board-game Tolkien. At its heart is a brilliant division into two games on the same board. First is the epic clash of armies across Middle-earth, as the free peoples wake up and resist the threat of the dark lord Sauron. Beneath is the quest of the Fellowship to throw the One Ring into the fire before Sauron conquers all. The genius of this design is the way the two halves interweave at every turn, leaving a tricky tactical balancing act for players to master.</p><h2 id="eclipse">Eclipse: Second Dawn for the Galaxy</h2><div id="158886" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Eclipse: 2nd Dawn for The Galaxy</h3></p></div><p>While the Twilight Imperium series has tended to emphasise warfare and diplomacy over long-term planning, Eclipse attempts to bring more strategy to sci-fi civilization-building. Smart systems for initiative and technology upgrades mean you’re always having to look several steps ahead as you branch out from your starting hex into the unknown reaches of the galaxy. That tactical depth doesn’t detract from the feeling of exploring the cosmos, designing ships and taking the fight to your opponents. It’s just that when you get there, you need to be more reliant on having the right tech and the right units than falling back on the luck of the dice. </p><p><em>If you like these, be sure to check out our picks for the overall </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time"><em>best board games</em></a><em> and the </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-game-deals"><em>best board game deals</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2>What Counts as a Wargame?</h2><p>In hobby circles, “wargame” is a surprisingly loaded term. Folk who spend a lot of time in gaming circles tend to use it to exclusively refer to a small genre of games that simulate historical conflicts. Although it’s a niche interest, a lot of titles that fit the bill are published every year, often commanding high prices for boxes that contain map sheets and dozens of cardboard counters, because the major effort in getting these games to market is the detailed historical research required. Awakening the Bear and Twilight Struggle: Red Sea are our examples from our list, and they’re at the more approachable end of the genre.</p><p>However, even in this apparently neat definition, there’s room for a lot of grey areas. A few games seek to bring the simulation angle to conflicts that might have happened, but either didn’t, or haven’t, such as the Cold War erupting into World War 3. Others, like Undaunted, take the historical setting but have limited interest in being simulations. Finally, the smallest group of all are games that try to be realistic about entirely fantastic or science-fiction scenarios. Do any of these count as “wargames”? Some gamers will say yes, others no.</p><p>Fundamentally, of course, these kinds of semantic discussions are of limited interest to anyone who doesn’t play these kinds of games. So we’ve gone for the widest possible definition, which is games that explore conflict from a variety of different perspectives, from historical simulation to fantasy diplomacy. But if a particular subsection of conflict games appeals to you, and you want to explore it further, there will be enthusiast sites out there to help you.</p><p><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelancer for IGN, specializing in tabletop games.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/creepy-card-game-arsonate-is-a-very-short-race-to-be-the-last-person-burning.939960/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/creepy-card-game-arsonate-is-a-very-short-race-to-be-the-last-person-burning<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
2024’s small but growing avalanche of games that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-we-just-went-an-entire-year-where-every-game-was-as-short-cheap-and-existentially-harrowing-as-clickolding-thatd-be-great-thanks">trap you in a room with a nasty little freak</a> continues with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arsonate">Arsonate</a>, in which the nasty little freak wears a gasmask and wants to set you on fire. He wants to do this using cards. There are 47 of them - a forest of silhouettes, laid across the blood-stained table between you. Every turn, you flip a tree card to reveal a flame. When the flames spread to a player’s Tower card, it’s game over.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The trouble is, you can only flip cards on your half of the board, with the conflagration beginning in the middle. So "set you on fire" is wrong, actually: the gist of Arsonate is to carefully sculpt a mutually threatening blaze so that you get incinerated <em>last</em>. Integral to this are fire cards that trigger events. These range from giving you an extra turn – typically, not very welcome – to awarding you a random utility you can use to twist the odds. 
</p>
<p>
Utilities emerge from a weird little dumbwaiter to left of the table, and must be secured in a locker before you can play them. They include fire extinguishers, which let you re-flip a fire card, spy-glasses, which let you peek beneath a tree card, and crowbars, which let you steal a utility from one of your opponent's lockers. Don’t worry, he’ll happily do the same to you: on normal difficulty, the game tells you outright that your enemy loves to cheat. Utilities are executed with pleasing literalness: I have yet to win any real-life cardgames by embedding a fireaxe in the table, but I'm keen to try it during my next round of Cosmic Encounters.
</p>
<p>
Each game of Arsonate should take under 30 minutes, and there are three possible endings. It’s all obviously reminiscent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/inscryption-meets-russian-roulette-in-this-weird-short-horror-game">Buckshot Roulette</a>, a named influence <a href="https://nashset.itch.io/arsonate-demo">on the Itch.io page</a>, and less obviously of Inscryption, though I’m not sure the demo is as gripping as either. Arsonate’s Host doesn’t have the abject animatronic wrongness of Buckshot’s dealer, and the card game isn't as viscous with flourishes and variables as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inscryption">Inscryption</a>’s equivalent. Still, it <em>is</em> a demo, and it’s getting there.</p>
<p>Why do we like video games that trap us inside with a nasty little freak? I wonder if it’s down to the suspicion that most video game developers are nasty little freaks. "Entertainers", my eye - video game developers are Cartesian demons who immerse us in predatory stagecraft and perform mean tricks on us from behind the veil of code. In games such as this, you can at least savour the pretence of confronting the sadistic fucker and, if you play your fireaxes right, cooking their goose.
</p>
<p>Arsonate is also on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2822980/ARSONATE/">Steam</a> - there's no release date yet. Question for the thread: favourite fire system in a game? I’ll see your oh-so-predictable <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-far-cry-2-is-the-best-in-the-series">Far Cry 2 shoutout</a> and raise you one <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tenderfoot-tactics">Tenderfoot Tactics</a>.</p>

			<p>Rockstar Games leaker tez2 <a href="https://x.com/TezFunz2/status/1817699079876407495" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> today that Grand Theft Auto V may soon launch on PC Game Pass. The game has previously been on Xbox Game Pass, but only for consoles; it would be the first time on PC.</p>
<p>While the addition of such a high-profile game is always welcome, it is doubtful many gamers would still need to take advantage. Grand Theft Auto V launched on PC on April 14, 2015, nearly two years after its debut on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It's been available for over nine years on various stores, such as Steam, the Epic Games Store (where it was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-free-egs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free</a> to grab for a limited time back in 2020), and Rockstar's own launcher. Moreover, it's currently priced at just $15. The PC version is also still behind the next-gen console version, which was enhanced with ray traced ambient occlusion and shadows a while ago.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto V is currently the second best-selling premium game of all time, having recently broken the milestone of 200 million units sold. Only Minecraft, with its estimated 300 million units sold, stands above it; of course, it has a much larger target audience than Rockstar's M-rated game.</p>
<p>Unlike its predecessor, Grand Theft Auto V did not receive any single player DLCs. There was at least one in production featuring the character Trevor, but it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-rockstar-dev-says-kick-ass-gta-v-standalone-trevor-dlc-was-scrapped-to-milk-gta-onlines-cash-cow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set</a> aside in favor of GTA Online support once Rockstar noticed the incredible popularity of the multiplayer mode.</p>
<p>GTA Online itself is still regularly updated to this day. Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-online-bottom-dollar-bounties-update-out-now-adding-bounty-hunts-dispatch-work-and-new-vehicles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released </a>the Bottom Dollar Bounties update last month, and there's more to come throughout the Summer. As for Grand Theft Auto VI, the long-awaited sequel is slated to launch in Fall 2025 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X, while a PC version is likely coming around a year to a year and a half later.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-the-mandalorian-adventures-board-game-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>When it comes to the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-board-games"><u>best Star Wars board games</u></a>, you have a lot of great choices. The Queen’s Gambit, for instance, recreates the multi-front finale of The Phantom Menace. Star Wars: Rebellion captures the breadth of the original trilogy in a three-hour epic. The Mandalorian Adventures is the latest tabletop take on Star Wars, and it’s shooting for a somewhat smaller scope. This new release is content to capture several key moments from the first season of The Mandalorian, presenting these encounters as 40-minute firefights with color, tension, and a minimal amount of overhead. Just like the show upon which it’s based, this is a splendid slice of Star Wars that packs some new surprises while managing to call back to the spirit of the franchise. </p><div catalogid="068db5aa-26cf-442f-bd55-e367b98276dc" id="205353"><div id="205353" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Star Wars: The Mandalorian Adventures Board Game</h3></p></div><p>This is a very straightforward and approachable game. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-lord-of-the-rings-adventure-book-game-review"><u>The Lord of the Rings Adventure Book Game</u></a> immediately comes to mind, as the structure here is similar. Play is focused around a spiral-bound book that forms the board. Each new scenario moves on to a subsequent page, allowing for quick setup and minimal storage space. While there is a main rulebook, missions themselves introduce new rules and tweaks that are printed alongside the map. It’s a relatively seamless experience to work through the book and internalize the additional details.</p><p>The core system is simple and surprisingly interesting. Players cooperate to take down game-controlled foes and accomplish the scenario objective. You can choose between characters such as Mando, IG-11, and Greef Karga. Each possesses their own unique deck of cards and abilities. On your turn you perform two actions, but the effectiveness of each action is variable and depends on the card you play. So, if you play a four-strength card to move, then you will move four spaces. A two-strength card to attack means you inflict two damage, and so on. Some cards include special ability text that offers additional benefits. This system is interesting because it’s a blend of a straightforward two-action turn with variance in action points. Furthermore, the way enemy response plays off this card system is splendid.</p><p>These action cards are played in slots on the board. All of the cards any player spends to move go into the “move” slot, for instance. Once one of the slots receives a total of five or more strength total, the enemy phase triggers and a card is drawn. This emphasizes the strength of the game in presenting tense and nuanced systems with the absolute minimal amount of rules weight. It enforces timing constraints and facilitates discussion between players, because you may hold off on throwing down that powerful card so that one of your buddies gets to go before the enemies trigger.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is a very straightforward and approachable game.</p></div><p>This tension is important, as it’s the primary source of drama. All damage is set by the power of your attack card or the activation card drawn for the enemies. No dice are rolled, so the dynamism is entirely encapsulated in the card play. This works to increase the speed of the game and achieve that brief playtime at the expense of a more nuanced combat system. That makes sense, as this game is aimed at less experienced players as well as dedicated hobbyists.</p><p>Despite the relative simplicity, Mandalorian Adventures has an almost puzzle-like feel. The difficulty, while able to be tweaked, is formidable enough that it requires thought and discussion on how players will approach their turns. Often, you will use what information you have in combination with gut instinct to formulate a plan. Analyzing the board state is essential to success.</p><p>One of the most intriguing aspects is in how it bridges the gap between those two levels of players. Each scenario is standalone, as this is not a campaign game. However, it wants you to engage the missions in order on your first playthrough. This is because there is an accompanying deck of cards that gives you step-by-step instructions on what to play next. It’s a key component in introducing new rules in bite-sized pieces, rules that you can then apply to all games going forward. New content is also added to play and the system adjustments are considerable. By your fifth session, the game will have grown quite a bit in density, but it will have been an effortless journey.</p><p>In addition to this large deck of cards, there are two full-sized envelopes. They contain additional ways to play or modify existing scenarios. Once you have finished revealing everything, you will have numerous ways to enjoy the game. It’s an interesting concept, one indicative of publisher Unexpected Games’ design philosophy. They presented a similar approach with their debut title, The Initiative (<a href="https://zdcs.link/BdvJv?object_uuid=9c5fafc2-a1bf-4d20-a416-f65b74714548&amp;t=article" target="_blank">see at Amazon</a>). That game also presented new content during the course of play and shook up expectations. </p><p>This methodology, of breaking up the experience into a gradual arc of play, and then throwing in several optional modules to re-experience existing scenarios, is very effective. One such example, mentioned in the game’s core rulebook and hence not technically a spoiler, is the inclusion of a traitor mode of play. This is a set of cards where players are given a randomized loyalty with the chance of one character being a traitor to the group. This is excellent as it touches upon the themes of trust and honor present in the television series. You can add these cards into any existing scenario to spice it up. This mode is completely optional and not the standard way to play. In fact, it’s probably best to hold off on this until you’ve played several sessions, as the traitor mode is somewhat fragile and can result in uneven plays. Yet, when it comes together with a perfectly timed reveal, it’s wonderfully cinematic. </p><p>There's a good deal of depth here in exploring the system and additional content. It manages to elevate the experience, achieving a status above the comparably mellow Lord of the Rings Adventure Book Game. The Mandalorian Adventures is not likely to supplant Star Wars: Rebellion or Imperial Assault for fans of those more robust and weighty titles, but it’s a surprisingly devious game that captures a solid amount of tension with simple and interesting systems. It is very flexible, supporting solitaire play or even multiple participants sharing characters by shuffling all of the cards into a single deck. This really is a stellar box that offers much more than appears on the surface.</p><h3>Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/xPWJO?object_uuid=9c5fafc2-a1bf-4d20-a416-f65b74714548&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/weoVq?object_uuid=9c5fafc2-a1bf-4d20-a416-f65b74714548&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Get it at Asmodee</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/2eRXD?object_uuid=9c5fafc2-a1bf-4d20-a416-f65b74714548&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Get it at Unexpected Games</a></li></ul></div></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 29, 2024 7:43 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>This apparently modest board game unveils itself over multiple plays, presenting an escalating series of surprises that tweaks the overall ruleset through additional content.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fablecraft-startplaying-partnership-announced-by-developers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new update video was released by the developers of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/fablecraft-creators-talk-about-their-accessible-digital-ttrpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Fablecraft</em></a>. This digital TTRPG, which released about a week ago on Steam Early Access, has been steadily rolling out <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/developers-of-digital-ttrpg-fablecraft-announce-homebrew-tools" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new features</a> and listening to player feedback. One of those new features is an official Fablecraft StartPlaying partnership.</p>

<p>The Fablecraft StartPlaying partnership was the first thing announced in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WqFfYvaYIxM">most recent video</a> on the Tales of Fablecraft YouTube channel. For those not aware, StartPlaying is a premium service platform where players can find TTRPG campaigns run by professional GMs.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fablecraft-battlemap-gameplay-screenshot.jpg?itok=EQhhXzBp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fablecraft-battlemap-gameplay-screenshot.jpg?itok=t2jPbQMF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The platform hosts games from many RPG systems. Everything from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> to <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/cyberpunk-red-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk Red</em></a> to <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/vampire-masquerade-5th-edition-review-front-loaded-lore" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Vampire: The Masquerade</em></a> is available on the platform if you are willing to pay for a seat.</p>
<p>Now, professional GMs can host games of <em>Fablecraft</em> as well. The video even contains a $10 in-store credit promo for those who want to start playing immediately. Given that the <em>Fablecraft</em> game is currently available for free, you're paying for the convenience of a tailored, safe play environment by a dedicated professional; a great introduction to the tabletop hobby.</p>
<p>The <em>Fablecraft</em> StartPlaying partnership wasn't the only announcement in this update video. Outside of general quality-of-life updates and bug fixes, the video highlights seven feature requests via player feedback. This feedback was gathered via the <em>Fablecraft</em> Discord Server, the Steam Community forums, Steam User Reviews, and their dedicated feedback website.</p>
<p>GMs requested more <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/developers-of-digital-ttrpg-fablecraft-announce-homebrew-tools" rel="noopener" target="_blank">homebrew tools</a>. These include changes to the Gamemaster Guide and a user-generated content marketplace. Homebrew tools were already announced as part of Fablecraft's content roadmap.</p>
<p>As for general requests, players have asked for additional pre-made content, Fable Dice enhancements, matchmaking, and more single-player content like the combat arena. The video does state the dev team's priority right now is towards multiplayer and homebrew integration, given how key it is to the TTRPG experience.</p>

That’s because as he was down, Patrice settled on an unorthodox method to try and clinch victory: he began jumping ever so slightly, and then very aggressively, towards his opponent.</p><p>An utterly ridiculous clip of Patrice pulling this off at the Paris Olympics is going around now, and I’m kind of incredulous at the whole thing. He’s clearly like a wounded (and losing) animal lashing out as it’s backed into a corner, but the move actually stuns the other guy so much that he just keeps being able to press the advance and frantically whip his saber looking for a touch until it eventually connects. It’s the equivalent of smashing the buttons at your local arcade’s exhibition and actually stealing a win off your opponent.<br></p><p>I always thought fencing had much more to do with composure, light touches, and ripostes, but I’m not sure Patrice has ever heard of the terms if I’m being honest. One of the top comments on the video jokes that his “0-60 is faster than most cars,” and they aren’t exaggerating.

Considering that just two weekends ago, the biggest fighting game tournament in the world occurred in Vegas, folks who had the genre fresh on the brain (including myself) started getting jokes off about footsies and jabs, which are attacks you do to try and poke the other player and gain control of the space before you, opening them up to further moves.</p><p>In the parlance of the fighting game community, my man Patrice <em>nailed</em> the jump-in.

The spin-off features a career mode and online play, including co-op and PVP. Unfortunately, there doesn’t seem to be any split-screen, which would be a huge miss for a licensed game like this. The new trailer shows players as Chasers scoring points by throwing balls through gold rings and what seems like a Seeker flying through gold rings of its own in order to catch up to the Golden Snitch. </p><p>It’s already giving some players <em>Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup</em> vibes, a stripped-down PS2 game that nevertheless got the job done in terms of recreating the fantasy of being a wizarding Messi.

If you miss a play is it easy to get back in time? What kind of mechanics keep you from constantly hitting breakaways? Comparisons to <em>Rocket League </em>are already being made, which is the best thing any sports game, <em>Harry Potter</em> or no, could hope for. </p><p>Unlike <em>Rocket League</em>, however, <em>Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</em> isn’t free-to-play. It’s $30 when it comes out September 3 on PC and all consoles, though it will be free for paid PS Plus subscribers that month.

He was 67.</p>

<p>Supermassive announced Pankhurst's passing on Twitter. A <a href="https://tonypankhurst.muchloved.com/">tribute page</a> from Pankhurst’s family (spotted by <em><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-dark-pictures-anthology-curator-tony-pankhurst-has-died/1100-6525365/">GameSpot</a></em>) reveals that he died on May 9 and his funeral was held on June 7. The family is currently accepting donations to Hospice in the Weald, who cared for Pankhurst during his final weeks.</p>

<div>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We are all saddened to hear of Tony Pankhurst's passing. He was the face of The Curator, and we loved working with him. 🤍 <a href="https://t.co/ZZQbeViE8S">pic.twitter.com/ZZQbeViE8S</a></p>

<p>Pankhurst’s career in the entertainment industry spans over 40 years across films, TV, and radio. In video games, he provided the likeness for the mysterious Curator in The Dark Pictures Anthology games Man of Madan, Little Hope, House of Ashes, and The Devil in Me, although actor Pip Torrens provided the voice and motion capture for the character. Pankhurst did portray a live-action version of The Curator in a trailer for 2021's House of Ashes, which you can watch below.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-london-devs-update-bugs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Last week, Fallout: London was finally released after a lengthy delay and years of development. It emerged as an ambitious and impressive game-sized mod that’s unfortunately plagued by bugs, crashes, and stability issues – plus a complex installation process that can alienate users on some platforms. However, there’s a dizzying amount of meat on the bones and it’s something I’m desperate to play in full.</p>



<p>That’s why I’m over the moon that Team FOLON has revealed the impending deployment of an update that’ll target the worst issues in Fallout: London.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-s-wrong-with-fallout-london">What’s Wrong With Fallout: London?</h2>



<p>Fallout: London is pretty great, but some fundamental issues with the mod’s stability are making it a nightmare to play. I managed to battle my way through about 20 minutes before I hit a crash loop that never ended. Fortunately, Team FOLON has pledged that an update is coming to tackle these issues:</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/TeamFOLON/status/1817959101441446153">https://x.com/TeamFOLON/status/1817959101441446153</a></p>



<p>This is great news for anyone struggling to play one of the most ambitious mods in gaming history. Fallout: London has hundreds of quests and 20 original factions, and it features an authentic representation of post-apocalyptic London. I <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-london-review-first-impressions/">wrote up a review</a> featuring my first impressions if you’re interested.</p>



<p>If you’re having issues with <strong>your </strong>installation of Fallout: London, try following the advice detailed in this lengthy guide.</p>

That massive scope includes more than 700 different characters and 140,000 lines of dialogue.</p><p dir="ltr">"We wanted to make sure we got this one right," creative director John Epler said in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilgaurd-took-so-long-as-bioware-wanted-to-make-sure-we-got-this-one-right-that-and-it-takes-a-long-time-to-record-700-characters-and-140000-lines/" rel="nofollow ">GamesRadar</a>, in which he also revealed the enormous amount of dialogue.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dragon Age: The Veilguard Is a Great Start For Newcomers | Summer Game Fest 2024</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Performance director Ashley Barlow added that--in addition to other projects BioWare was working on during the decade between <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-age-inquisition/">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a> and The Veilguard--part of the reason the game took so long to make was simply due to the sheer number of characters and voice lines.</p><p dir="ltr">"We started casting five years ago," Barlow said. "The team, the talent, has been on for five years. It takes a long time to record [dialogue for] 700 characters, you know--80,000 lines or 140,000 lines with all the Rooks. It just takes time to make [it] good."</p><p dir="ltr">The game features seven romanceable companion characters, and the player-character--who BioWare has nicknamed Rook--has four voices for players to choose from (two feminine voices and two masculine voices). That brings the total number of voice actors for main characters alone to 11. Add in Varric (who will accompany the player in certain parts of the game) and the game's main antagonist, Solas, and you're looking at 13 voice actors who absolutely <em>must</em> get their lines right.</p><p dir="ltr">Given the fact that the total number of characters is 700 (with all of them <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/">voiced by actual humans</a>), it's no surprise that the game took significant time to make, especially considering the varying dialogue branches that have become commonplace in most RPGs. They even got Alex Jordan, who <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/actor-who-voiced-baldurs-gate-3s-kissing-noises-announces-charity-stream-with-hilarious-tiktok-video/1100-6521395/">provided all of the kissing noises</a> for Baldur's Gate 3, to pitch in for one of Rook's voices (it's unclear if he also provided smooching sounds for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-gonna-show-a-lot-of-skin/1100-6524909/">The Veilguard's spicier scenes</a>).</p><p dir="ltr">"I sit on a throne of moans," Jordan <a href="https://x.com/AlexJordanVO/status/1815478891693101081" rel="nofollow ">joked on Twitter</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">But all the time in the recording booth was worth it, according to Epler, who says the newest entry in the Dragon Age franchise is "the best version" of the game that it "could possibly be."</p><p>BioWare still hasn't announced an official release date, but the game is currently slated for release sometime in late 2024.

One such benefit is "recall rights," wherein companies are required to offer to bring back employees they laid off if they need to refill their role two or three years after they're dismissed from the company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mitchell explained that she'd seen these terms in other tech industry contracts, and their inclusion is a boon for employees and employer alike. "We're talking about eliminating that 'revolving door' at least to some degree," she said, alluding to the fact that high turnover obliterates institutional knowledge.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In other words, the industry's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/humble-bumble-shuts-down-game-publishing-label">swaths of layoffs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> could potentially be alleviated by studios having a fast method to re-hire new talent after their finances are stabilized.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fellow Bethesda developer Chris Lusco highlighted other unionization gains, such as converting some freelancers to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-incorporates-contract-workers-into-zenimax-union-offers-some-full-time-roles">full-time</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/zenimax-union-secures-juneteenth-holiday-for-all-zenimax-staff">paid holidays</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and pay bumps for contractors.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If developers are concerned their employer is about to reduce benefits or implement unpopular policies, racing to unionization can be a tool to slow them down. Per Mitchell, union recognition immediately guarantees the "status quo" condition. Under it, changes to current work policies have to be bargained for first, which is particularly helpful for things such as a return-to-office mandate.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When the QA-focused </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/qa-staff-at-zenimax-studios-unanimously-votes-to-unionize">ZeniMax Workers Union</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was recognized last year, some staff were working from home—and were able to keep doing so even after the company began rolling out return-to-office policies. They'll be able to keep doing so "until we reach an agreement at the bargaining table" with regard to updated remote work policies, said Mitchell.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The importance of Xbox's first-party unions">The importance of Xbox's first-party unions</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unionizing isn't an easy endeavor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/capcom-games-sales-down-by-44-during-q1-fy25/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Capcom has released its financial report for the first quarter of the financial year, which ends on March 31, 2025. The report shows that sales have dropped considerably compared to last year's period.</p>
<p>Despite the significant drop in sales, the publisher says that "all business segments outperformed the company's plan." Net sales were down by 32.5% this year, with digital content net sales being down by 43.5% year-on-year.&nbsp; Their net income is down by 45.1% year-on-year, for a total of $64.7 million.</p>
<p>In terms of their <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-7-ios-launch-did-not-break-30000-sales-for-capcom/">digital content net sales</a> being down, the company responded by saying that its sales were "dominated" by titles released in previous years, such as Street Fighter 6 and Dragon's Dogma 2, with their new releases for 2024 due for release in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>Capcom sold 9.53 million copies of its games during this time, compared to 13.5 million in the same quarter last year. However, Street Fighter 6 was released during this time, giving Capcom a massive boost to its sales.</p>
<p>Although game sales dipped significantly, they were compensated by Arcade Operations' upturn of 18% and Amusement Equipment's skyrocketing of 147%.</p>
<p>Despite being released in 2021, Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin continued to sell very well in this financial quarter. Capcom saw the game reach two million units sold in this quarter, and it commented that the Monster Hunter franchise has sold over 100 million copies globally.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Now, developed in conjunction with Niantic, has performed very well, with over 15 million downloads.</p>
<p>Capcom has said its "progress toward achieving the full-year plan was generally in line with plans," specifically regarding the sale of digital content.</p>
<p>Recently, Capcom saw the release of Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, a game that has a very similar feel to their game Okami. Overall, the game has received highly positive reviews from the audience.</p>
<p>Looking into the future, Capcom expects to reach $1.07 billion in net sales for the fiscal year ending 31 March 2025, which will give the company an 8.3% growth year-on-year.</p>
<p>Capcom has <a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/product/en-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upcoming releases</a> such as Ace Attorney Investigations Collection, which was previously a Japanese exclusive. The Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is slated for October 2024. Additionally, games such as Monster Hunter Wilds are set for release in 2025 and have the potential to be one of Capcom's biggest releases, especially given the number of units for the franchise that have already been sold over the years.</p>

The international sports tournament, which happens every four years, has made us all patriots once more (at least temporarily) as we root for Team U.S.A. to clean house. While you may catch some basketball and soccer at the Olympics, the best part of the event is tuning in to the more niche sports that people mostly only talk about when the Olympics are happening.<br></p><p>Gymnastics, archery, and breakdancing (making its Olympic debut this year) are all suddenly topics your average joe is likely to bring up in conversation. If you’ve suddenly fallen in love with a new sport during the Games, then you will be happy to hear that there are plenty of video games to feed your new obsession. That goes for events big and small. Here are ten of our video game recommendations based on your Olympic sport of choice.</p></div></div><div><p>OK, real talk. You should be locked in to Olympic fencing. It is one of the most exciting sports you can watch, and the Paris games are filled with incredible matchups. If you happened to miss it, I recommend watching the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhhRb2kgFSs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhhRb2kgFSs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">finals of Women’s Foil</a></span>, which saw defending Olympic champ Lee Keifer put on a masterclass in fencing. Once you realize how great the sport is, you might want to try a game that will give you the experience of being just as good at swordfighting as Keifer. For that you’ll want to try out<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steam-womens-day-sale-signalis-unpacking-1851320438/slides/2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steam-womens-day-sale-signalis-unpacking-1851320438/slides/2"><em>En Garde!</em></a></span></p><p>The 2023 swashbuckling adventure game puts you in the shoes of a dashing swordswoman fighting off a horde of enemies through the streets of a gorgeous Mediterranean city. <em>En Garde! </em>lets you thrust, slash, and cut your way through your opponents in cartoonish but still strategic bouts of action. It might not be as serious as Olympic fencing, thanks to the ability to throw enemies off buildings or into traps, but it feels amazing to wield a sword regardless.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-the-kotaku-review-1829984369&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-the-kotaku-review-1829984369"><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em></a></span> is for the horse girls—always has been. As the best cowboy game ever made it’s no surprise that Rockstar’s stunning epic about the end of the wild west is also a phenomenal horse game. In it you can find different types of horses with different stats, build your relationship with said horses, and brush and dress them up to look their best. It’s what Equestrian events are all about, at least as far as I’ve gathered from my Olympic viewing.</p><p>There is really no better game for the horse-obsessed, as you can roam the beautiful frontier on your steed of choice. Run through the wilderness and jump over obstacles or trot along city streets, the choice is yours. You can also name your horse, and to get the full experience I suggest following the American Quarter Horse Association’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.aqha.com/-/naming-your-aqha-foal&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.aqha.com/-/naming-your-aqha-foal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official naming rules</a></span> — there are a lot of them. </p></div><div><p>If you like watching athletes beat the crap out of each other in the ring, then there really isn’t any other option than <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/super-punch-out-two-2-player-cheat-mode-snes-nintendo-1849387561&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/super-punch-out-two-2-player-cheat-mode-snes-nintendo-1849387561"><em>Super Punch-Out!!</em></a></span><em> </em>The boxing game lets you work your way through a series of progressively tougher matches in order to become the world champion. </p><p>In each match, you choose your strategy, adapting to your opponent’s technique as you decide what type of punch to throw and when to dodge and block. It’s a simple set of mechanics but one that feels endlessly enjoyable to master. Play your cards right during the game and you too can learn what it’s like to knock out your opponent and take home the title.</p></div><div><p>After making its Olympic debut at Tokyo in 2021, skateboarding is back for the Paris Games. If you happened to catch the Women’s Street finals over the weekend you may have seen skating legend Tony Hawk in attendance, and he’s who we have to thank for our game recommendation.</p><p>Both the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-the-kotaku-review-1844937925&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-the-kotaku-review-1844937925">first and second iconic <em>Pro Skater</em> games</a></span> got an amazing remake in 2021, and they remain probably the best skating games ever made. If you noticed how laid back the skating competition has been despite being an Olympic competition, you’ll love the <em>Pro Skater </em>games. Vibe out with good music while you shred in a set of awesome venues. Pull off flips and twists or just speed along the course; whatever you do, you’ll be sure to have a great time.</p></div><div><p>A few games may come to mind when you think about sailing. Perhaps it’s <em>Wind Waker</em> or <em>Sea of Thieves </em>you think of first, but I think <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-the-kotaku-review-1453735783&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-the-kotaku-review-1453735783"><em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em></a></span> is the best game for the sport. In addition to letting you command the crew of a large pirate ship on the open waters, you can sing sea shanties! </p><p>Now I don’t know if they do that at the Olympics (though I would like to dream) but in <em>Black Flag</em> the singing of your crew makes the sailing experience an absolute delight. For fun you can create your own racing challenges in the game—see how fast you can sail across the game’s map or make little courses to maneuver through. The ocean is your oyster!</p></div><div><p>In addition to boxing, Judo and Taekwondo bring martial-arts flair to the Olympics and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps-plus-march-2024-games-sifu-destiny-2-ps5-ps4-1851294301&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps-plus-march-2024-games-sifu-destiny-2-ps5-ps4-1851294301"><em>Sifu</em></a></span> does them both justice. While <em>Sifu</em> doesn’t exactly use either as the basis for its complex martial arts combat, the ability to combine different kicks, punches, throws, and more makes for perhaps the best approximation of such fighting you can find in games. </p><p>To tailor the game to whichever Olympic martial art you prefer, you could limit your options. Maybe try to do an all-kicking run to get the Taekwondo feel. Whatever you choose, mastering the game will surely make you feel like a pro.</p></div><div><p>No, I didn’t pick <em>FIFA</em> for soccer, sue me. Maybe that would have been the most accurate representation of the sport, as it literally bears the name of soccer’s international governing body, but it’s not the most fun version. That’s all that matters to me personally, hence <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-strikers-battle-league-nintendo-switch-review-rou-1849035907&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-strikers-battle-league-nintendo-switch-review-rou-1849035907"><em>Mario Strikers</em></a></span>! So enjoy kicking the ball around as Nintendo’s iconic characters, with the added addition of special powers.</p></div><div><p>Both beach and indoor volleyball are big events at the Summer Olympics. To cover both of those, why not play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/windjammers-is-still-just-as-good-23-years-later-1802908500&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/windjammers-is-still-just-as-good-23-years-later-1802908500"><em>Windjammers</em></a></span>? The retro classic is available for Nintendo Switch and lets you face off against opponents in a volleyball-like sport. As opposed to the real sport, <em>Windjammers</em> includes throwing discs around and using special skills depending on your character, bringing some arcade fun to beach-set competitions and making for a great title to play in handheld mode while you watch the real deal on your TV. </p></div><div><p>Last year’s indie darling <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jusant-dont-nod-indie-zelda-botw-assassins-creed-1851093233&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jusant-dont-nod-indie-zelda-botw-assassins-creed-1851093233"><em>Jusant</em></a></span>, a game about climbing to the top of a massive peak, was all about minute control over movement. It requires you to press, hold, and release triggers to move the protagonist’s feet and hands along the sheer surface of a cliffside, making it perfect for fans of Sport Climbing. </p><p>The Olympic version of rock climbing is a spectacle to behold, as its competitors scale surfaces with impressive speed. <em>Jusant</em> isn’t necessarily about speed but it is about making smart placements to climb up the wall, and when you do reach the top of even the shortest obstacles you get a welcome sense of accomplishment. </p></div><div><p>There are a lot of different cycling events at the Olympics but<em> Rider’s Republic </em>is squarely for fans of mountain biking and BMX. The Ubisoft open-world sports game lets you ski, snowboard, and even wingsuit your way around the massive map, but the main event is biking. </p><p>With such a gorgeous world filled with varied environments to explore, there’s never a dull moment as you bike across <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/so-far-ubisofts-extreme-sports-game-riders-republic-1847586967&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/so-far-ubisofts-extreme-sports-game-riders-republic-1847586967"><em>Rider’s Republic</em></a></span>. On top of riding your way through the rough terrain, you can also pull off some sick tricks and get big air, all without any risk of breaking your bones.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Microsoft's vision for the future of Xbox goes beyond its own hardware--as the company looks to extend into streaming and mobile--but that doesn't mean Microsoft is abandoning Xbox hardware--far from it. The company has said, time and again, that it aims to offer a range of ways for people to become Xbox customers, and that includes via Xbox consoles.</p><p dir="ltr">But what's coming next after the Xbox Series X|S? The future is still fuzzy, but Microsoft has dropped clues and made statements about what's next. In this post, we're rounding up everything we know so far about the next Xbox console.</p><p dir="ltr">Keep checking back for more, as we will update this post with new details as they become available.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Next_Xbox_release_date__price_speculation"><strong>Next Xbox release date, price speculation</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">The next Xbox has not yet been announced, so it's too soon to say what it could cost or when it may release. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-next-gen-plans-leaked-cloud-hybrid-console-planned-for-2028/1100-6517814/">major leak from the Microsoft vs. FTC court case</a> revealed some of Microsoft's plans for the next Xbox, including a heavy focus on "cloud hybrid" technology, machine learning, and AI. The leak also pointed to a potential 2028 start-date for this next console generation. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer responded to the leak and said at least some of the information was out of date.</p><p dir="ltr">"We've seen the conversation around old emails and documents. It is hard to see our team's work shared in this way because so much has changed and there's so much to be excited about right now, and in the future. We will share the real plans when we are ready," <a href="https://x.com/xboxp3/status/1704233222752571842?s=46" rel="nofollow ">he wrote.</a></p><p dir="ltr">When this next Xbox is announced, what could it be called? We don't know yet, but Microsoft had talked about how its console platform is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-its-just-called-xbox-actually-more-c/1100-6472320/" data-ref-id="1100-6472320">known as just "Xbox,"</a> and that things like Series X|S denote the specific models underneath that umbrella. Whether or not Microsoft sticks with this for its next console remains to be seen, however.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Next_Xbox_potential_specs"><strong>Next Xbox potential specs</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">In February this year, Xbox president Sarah Bond confirmed Microsoft was making new Xbox hardware and went on to make a bold statement about what it could deliver. Bond said this next Xbox, whatever it turns out to be, will offer the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-talks-next-gen-hardware-teases-new-console-controller-for-this-fall/1100-6521133/">"largest technical leap you will have ever seen in a hardware generation."</a> That's a bold claim, for sure. Bond didn't offer anything else, like how Microsoft might achieve this, nor did she provide any timetable for the console's release.</p><p dir="ltr">Also this year, Bond said the next Xbox will focus on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-talks-the-future-of-its-hardware-and-the-importance-of-backward-compatibility/1100-6523373/">"power and performance"</a> to create the "biggest leap ever," but again, Bond didn't go any further than those lofty claims.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Next_Xbox_backwards_compatibility"><strong>Next Xbox backwards compatibility</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Bond has also discussed how Xbox is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-talks-the-future-of-its-hardware-and-the-importance-of-backward-compatibility/1100-6523373/">ensuring backward compatibility will be a part of its next-gen hardware.</a></p><p dir="ltr">"It's also about the ability to be able to play all of the games. I mean, we have people who've been playing on Xbox for decades and invested thousands and thousands of dollars and hours with us. And [we want to enable them] to take all those games with them into the hardware of the future."</p><p dir="ltr">Bond went on to explain that when she became president of Xbox in 2023, one of the first things she did was create a team dedicated to backward compatibility. She then went on to say that the Xbox team is committed to the idea of being able to play their games wherever they are.</p><p dir="ltr">"So our long-term commitment to cross-play is part of that and our commitment to cross-progression and cloud saves. So you can pick up on one device and you can play on another is a part of that."</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Next_Xbox_news"><strong>Next Xbox news</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Those same leaked documents revealed a trove of insights into what Microsoft may be cooking up for the future, but again, some or all of this information could be out of date. The documents showed that Microsoft was considering switching to an ARM64 CPU, like the Nintendo Switch uses. The leak also revealed that Microsoft is targeting DirectX ray tracing for its next-gen consoles, as well as machine-learning-powered graphical enhancement.</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft seems to be putting a lot of focus on AI and machine learning for its next generation, touting its use for "optimization and acceleration of game performance, operations, and development for players and creators." Microsoft said AI and machine learning could help with things like matchmaking and player-discovery, while AI could also be used for game-testing and to optimize monetization strategies.</p><p dir="ltr">Also listed in the leak as a "key innovation" coming with the next generation of consoles from Xbox is an "immersive game and app platform" that will allow anyone to develop their own games--possibly similar to Roblox's development platform. This seems to play into what Xbox executive Sarah Bond said recently about the potential for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-sarah-bond-says-ai-will-be-great-for-game-development/1100-6517653/">AI to further enable players also becoming game developers</a> within the Xbox ecosystem.</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft said in the leaked documents that its aim was to develop a "next-generation hybrid game platform" that taps into the "combined power" of local hardware and the cloud. The end result? Microsoft believes this could result in "deeper immersion and entirely new classes of game experiences."</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Beyond_Xbox"><strong>Beyond Xbox</strong></h2><p>While Microsoft is working on new hardware, it's just one piece of the puzzle for Microsoft as it looks to the future and seeks out ways to find more Xbox customers. Recently, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cloud-gaming-now-works-on-4k-fire-tv-sticks-which-are-up-to-50-off-at-amazon/1100-6524775/" data-ref-id="1100-6524775">Xbox cloud gaming came to Amazon's Fire Stick devices</a>, and Microsoft launched an ad campaign telling people they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiVHc3UBJFk" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don't need to buy an Xbox</a>. Indeed, Microsoft has been saying for years that it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-kinda-doesnt-care-if-you-buy-an-xbox-ser/1100-6481227/" data-ref-id="1100-6481227">kinda doesn't care if you buy an Xbox</a>. Thanks to cloud streaming, the phone in your pocket or the TV in your living room is an Xbox device.</p><p>Xbox CFO Tim Stuart said during the <a href="https://event.webcasts.com/viewer/event.jsp?ei=1643204&amp;tp_key=6a9bad458f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wells Fargo TMT Summit</a> that the goal is to make first-party games and Game Pass available on "every screen that can play games," and this includes rival consoles.</p><p>"It's a bit of a change of strategy. Not announcing anything broadly here, but our mission is to bring our first-party experiences [and] our subscription services to every screen that can play games," Stuart said. "That means smart TVs, that means mobile devices, that means what we would have thought of as competitors in the past like PlayStation and Nintendo."</p><p>In addition to streaming, Microsoft has discussed plans to launch its own mobile game store. Recently, a <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/mobilestore" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">landing page on Xbox.com for the mobile store appeared</a>, telling people it is "coming soon." This mobile store for Xbox games <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-talks-xbox-mobile-store-planned-for-2024/1100-6512489/" data-ref-id="1100-6512489">could launch in 2024</a>, and given that Microsoft owns juggernauts like Candy Crush and Call of Duty, this could end up being a big deal, though time will tell if that comes to fruition.</p>
